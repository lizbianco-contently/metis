Mr. President, I rise this morning to speak in support \nof the immigration reform bill which has been produced out of our \nJudiciary Committee. I wish to first congratulate Senator Specter and \nSenator Leahy for their leadership in that effort in the Judiciary \nCommittee. I also wish to congratulate all of my colleagues, \nRepublicans and Democrats, who have come together in support of this \nhistoric measure that is now before the Senate.\n  I believe this measure truly represents the kind of bipartisan spirit \nthat leads to the best policy creation for our country. I am also proud \nof the eight sponsors of the McCain-Kennedy bill, including Senator \nMcCain and Senator Graham, Senator Brownback, Senator Martinez, Senator \nKennedy, Senator Lieberman, and Senator Obama, who came together and \nhave led part of the effort to make sure we address comprehensive \nimmigration reform this year.\n  I believe these bipartisan success stories establish the kind of \ncivility we need to have in the Senate to be able to address the major \nissues that affect our\n\n[[Page S2548]]\n\ncountry. In reality, what the Judiciary Committee proposal does is it \naddresses the real problem we currently are facing in our country. We \nare facing a reality of broken borders and lawlessness at our borders \nas well as the interior with regard to immigration issues. What the \nJudiciary Committee bill does is it takes that reality of broken \nborders and lawlessness and creates a system that addresses our \nnational security by strengthening our borders.\n  It also takes that system and reality of broken borders and \nlawlessness and says we can do a better job in securing our interior by \nenforcing our immigration laws. It also takes that system of broken \nborders and lawlessness and it creates a workable system of immigration \nthat addresses both the economic and human realities of immigration in \nour Nation.\n  Finally, it takes that system of broken borders and lawlessness and \ntackles head on the horrible injustice that occurs with human \ntrafficking that we see in our immigration problems of today.\n  As the Senate works to perfect and strengthen this legislation, it is \nmy hope we will build upon the committee's work. I believe if we \ncontinue in a bipartisan manner, our final work product will be a \ncomprehensive immigration reform law that protects our borders and \naddresses the human and economic realities within our homeland.\n  I believe comprehensive immigration reform legislation must be tough, \nmust be fair, and must be practical. It must be tough, and it must be \nfair, and it must be practical. I believe the Judiciary Committee \nproposal is, in fact, tough, fair, and practical.\n  I know I am not alone in supporting this type of approach. Just last \nweek, President Bush met with Americans from the business, faith, \nagriculture, and civil rights communities across our country. In the \ngroup in that meeting there were two people from Colorado who attended: \nCindy Clark from The Broadmoor in Colorado Springs and Archbishop \nCharles Chaput, the archbishop of Denver. I commend both Ms. Clark and \nthe archbishop for voicing the concerns of Coloradans with the \nPresident that we need to have a comprehensive immigration reform \npackage. I have also spoken with President Bush and members of his \nCabinet on a number of different occasions in the last year about the \nneed for comprehensive immigration reform.\n  I share President Bush's belief, as he says--and I quote--\n\n       Ours is a nation of law and ours is a nation of immigrants, \n     we believe that we can have rational, important immigration \n     policy that's based upon law and reflects our deep desire to \n     be a compassionate and decent nation.\n\n  Immigration is, indeed, a vital component of our Nation's history. \nOur country has always been seen as a land of opportunity for \nimmigrants who are willing to work hard for a chance at achieving the \nAmerican dream for themselves and for their families.\n  Without the important contributions immigrants have made to our \ncountry, the United States would not exist as we know it today.\n  In my home State of Colorado, the first nonnatives to explore our \nlands were the Spanish. They arrived nearly 500 years ago and left \ntheir mark on the American Southwest and Colorado. Their presence is \nreflected today in the names of my State and its cities, its rivers, \nits mountains, and even in the food we eat.\n  More recently, immigrants came to Colorado to farm and ranch, to mine \nour State's abundant natural resources, to build the railroads and \nforge steel. They came, and continue to come, out of desperation, and \nalso out of hope--the hope of America.\n  In a recent newspaper column, a former councilman, Bill Burnett, of \nthe little Colorado town of Minturn--an old mining town--summed up the \nsentiments of many people in my State. He said:\n\n       Without immigrants, we never would've built this place.\n\n  The sentiment is echoed by many across this great country of ours.\n  It can also be heard through the words of the great poem ``The Mew \nColossus,'' inscribed at the foot of the Statue of Liberty. That poem \nsays:\n\n     Give me your tired, your poor,\n     Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,\n     The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.\n     Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,\n     I lift my lamp beside the golden door!\n\n  Our country has always been a beacon of hope.\n  My own family migrated to Colorado in the 1850s, almost 20 years \nbefore Colorado became a State. We came from northern New Mexico, from \na city named Santa Fe, which we had helped found over 250 years \nearlier. That was before Plymouth Rock and James Town. We pioneered the \nsettlement of Colorado's San Luis Valley, where we have farmed the same \nland for almost 150 years.\n  In truth, every one of us in Congress and, indeed, virtually every \nperson in America has a story to tell of their immigrant roots. That is \nbecause we are a nation of immigrants, a historical fact that has made \nus the wonder, the hope, and the envy of the world for centuries.\n  But there is no question today that our immigration laws are not \nworking. We have broken borders in America today, and we must fix the \nproblem for the sake of the national security of America.\n  The level of illegal immigration on our borders is unacceptable and \nhas to change. Our borders are undermanned and overwhelmed. We must do \nfar better in getting control of our borders.\n  In the past decade alone, we have seen the number of undocumented \nimmigrants in our country rise from 4 million to some 12 million in \n2006.\n  Enforcement of our immigration laws has certainly not kept pace with \nthe flow of both legal and illegal immigration, and the laws that deal \nwith those who cross the border are enforced only rarely so that in \nreality many believe enforcement of the laws simply does not exist.\n  In this post 9/11 era, it is critical we get control of our borders--\nboth the northern border with Canada as well as the southern border \nwith Mexico--so we can protect our country from outside threats that \nwould do harm to Americans and punish those who exploit the hopes of \nforeign workers who come here through human trafficking.\n  We must solve our Nation's illegal immigration problems as a matter \nof national security.\n  To that end, the first priority of immigration reform must be to \nprovide for adequate and sensible border security and a renewed Federal \ncommitment to enforcing our Nation's immigration laws. The Judiciary \nCommittee bill contains many provisions that will strengthen \nenforcement both at the border and within our country. It contains more \nthan 30 provisions that will ensure the security of our borders.\n  Among the numerous provisions it includes, it doubles the number of \nBorder Patrol agents. It adds 12,000 new agents over the next 5 years. \nIt doubles interior enforcement. It does so by adding 1,000 \ninvestigators per year over the next 5 years. It provides additional \nborder fences at specific vulnerable sections across the border. It \nincreases resources to expand the ability of Federal agents to retrieve \naliens detained by local police. And there are numerous other \nenforcement provisions contained within the bill.\n  Some in our country would have preferred that we wall off our country \nalong our southern border. To the proponents of building that wall, I \nask them: What would Ronald Reagan have said about that wall? We should \nnot repeat the example of the Berlin Wall, one of the most shameful \nsymbols of antifreedom and oppression ever designed by man, designed \nsolely to keep people from hope and opportunity and freedom. It was \nPresident Reagan who told the Soviet leader: Mr. Gorbachev, tear down \nthis wall. We must not build those walls around our country.\n  Some also want to make criminals out of local parish priests who \ncounsel their immigrant parishioners and soup-kitchen workers who \nprovide a warm meal to the hungry. That, too, is wrong, to criminalize \nthese people who take on humanitarian endeavors. I am pleased that the \nJudiciary Committee bill does not call for the construction of a \nmassive wall along the border and does not criminalize the millions of \nAmericans who come into contact with undocumented workers.\n  These security and enforcement efforts alone cannot be our sole means \nto confront this challenge. In the past,\n\n[[Page S2549]]\n\nCongress has focused almost exclusively on only this component of \nborder security. We have tripled the number of Border Patrol agents who \nsometimes spend eight times as many hours patrolling the border. Yet \nduring the same time, our borders have continued to be out of control.\n  The reality is, regardless of how much money we dedicate to border \nand interior enforcement, there are economic forces that spur \nimmigration. Our country's current workforce is continuing to age, and \nour newer workers have become more educated and less interested in \ntaking the important jobs our economy keeps creating. The Judiciary \nCommittee bill addresses this issue.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a question, \nI know he has a limited period of time. Obviously, in describing his \nown background and that of his family--some 160 years in Colorado, 250 \nyears in Santa Fe--he knows the issues. He brings a special dimension \nto the debate. What I am hearing from the Senator is that what is \nreally necessary is a comprehensive approach, that the Senator is a \nstrong believer that we have to do something about our borders to make \nsure they are going to be the best in terms of technology so we can \nhave realistic laws, but that we also have to understand how we are \ngoing to include those undocumenteds here in the United States in a way \nwhich is going to be consistent with our traditions and will also be \nresponsible.\n  Many have called that adjustment status amnesty. I reject that. I ask \nthe Senator if he doesn't agree with me that amnesty means forgiveness. \nIt means pardon. That is not what the underlying legislation is. The \nunderlying legislation says you have to go to the back of the line. You \nhave to wait until everyone who is in line gets the opportunity to come \nhere. You have to work hard, play by the rules, pay your taxes, and pay \na fine. Then you can earn your way to the possibility of citizenship, \nif that is what you desire. If you don't desire that, you don't have \nto. Does the Senator agree with me that is a reasonable way we ought to \nthink about that, at least when we are trying to recognize that some 11 \nmillion undocumented people are here, who work hard and play by the \nrules? Eighty thousand of them are permanent residents who are serving \nin the Armed Forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. Should they not be able to \nearn the possibility of citizenship?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I agree with my colleague and friend from Massachusetts. \nAs a person who has worked with law enforcement for a good part of my \nlife as attorney general of my State, I know what amnesty is. I believe \nthose who characterize this bill as amnesty are absolutely wrong. In \nthe proposal of the Judiciary Committee, we have said that you go to \nthe back of the line. What we have said is that you pay a very \nsubstantial fine. That, in my view, with the other provisions in the \nbill, takes it completely out of the context of any kind of amnesty \nprogram we have ever seen.\n  I agree with my colleague from Massachusetts that at the end of the \nday, what we are dealing with is the reality of creating a stronger \nborder but then addressing the reality within our Nation in a way that \nis workable. For those who would simply want to ignore the reality of \nthe 11 to 12 million undocumented workers who are in the shadows of \nAmerica today, we are simply not going to create a workable system of \nimmigration reform in our country.\n\n  That is why I join my colleague from Massachusetts in pushing as hard \nas I can to get the Judiciary bill passed.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator. He has explained the underlying \nbill accurately and correctly. The Senator understands that any of \nthose individuals attempting to adjust their status over an 11-year \nperiod, if they get in trouble with the law, they are subject to \ndeportation. They have to play by the rules, pay their taxes, work in \nthe community, and be good citizens, learning English.\n  I am always impressed by the fact that under the Pew poll, it says \nthat 98 percent of undocumented males are working today in the United \nStates. These are workers making our economy stronger and providing for \ntheir families. If they in any way violate the law, they are subject to \nall of the legal interpretations and their opportunity for citizenship \nis eliminated. This is a tough provision, I believe.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I agree with my colleague from Massachusetts. Amnesty is \nsimply a red herring from those who don't want to get real immigration \nreform. When you talk about somebody having to wait in line for 11 \nyears, having to go to the back of the line, having to remain crime \nfree for 11 years, having to have a job in America, having to have an \nabsolutely clean record, and then, at the end of the day, having to pay \na substantial monetary fine, that is not amnesty.\n  We will be on this bill for a number of days. I expect to be speaking \nagain about the importance of immigration reform as part of our \nnational security. I wanted today, in this period of morning business \nand as we enter into the debate, to read from one of my favorite \nprayers from a person who understood the importance of immigration, \nespecially in the context of agriculture. That is Cesar Chavez. He \nwrote this prayer, and it is something I think all of us in the Chamber \nshould keep in mind as we move forward in the debate:\n  Show me the suffering of the most miserable so that I will know my \npeople's plight. Free me to pray for others, for you are present in \nevery person. Help me take responsibility for my own life so that I can \nbe free at last. Grant me courage to serve others, for in service there \nis true life. Give me honesty and patience so that I can work with \nother workers.\n  Bring forth song and celebration so that the spirit will be alive \namong us. Let the disparate flourish and grow so that we will never \ntire of the struggle. Let us remember those who have died for justice, \nfor they have given us life. Help us love even those who hate us so \nthat we can change the world.\n  As we engage in this very important debate on comprehensive \nimmigration reform, I ask my colleagues to keep in mind that this is \none of the most important issues we confront together as a group of \nAmericans in the 109th Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Colorado and the senior Senator from Massachusetts regarding the \nimportant issue before the Senate, which is trying to reconcile the \nrules and regulations regarding immigration. I commend both of them for \ntheir outstanding leadership on that issue.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Landrieu and Mr. Kerry pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 2482 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I did not hear the unanimous consent \nrequest of Senator Kerry. Was it to have 3 minutes on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No. It was to add 3 minutes to his side.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I ask unanimous consent that we add an additional 3 \nminutes to the majority's time also.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President. I rise to express my extreme \ndisappointment with the actions taken by the Senate Judiciary Committee \nearlier this week on immigration reform. I know that this is a tough \nissue, an emotional issue, and that my colleagues on the Judiciary \nCommittee worked very hard to pass something out of committee. However, \nit seems to me that the rush to pass some form of immigration reform \neclipsed prudent policy-making.\n  The immigration problem in our country is out of control and must be \nsolved. Our top priority in this immigration reform debate is to \nprovide for real and comprehensive border security. We must also \naddress in a responsible manner the presence of an enormous illegal \npopulation currently in our country.\n  The issue before us is critical to the future of our country, in \nterms of national security, economic prosperity, and the fabric of our \nNation. I hope we will proceed with a thoughtful and thorough debate in \nthe Senate because the proposals we are going to be asked\n\n[[Page S2550]]\n\nto consider are enormous in scope and have far-reaching implications. \nWe must ensure that not only the Senators but also the American people \nhave ample opportunity to fully comprehend the consequences of any \naction we take.\n  It is absolutely vital that the Senate act to put the resources and \nmechanisms in place to allow the Department of Homeland Security to \ngain operational control of our borders and to have stronger and more \nmeaningful enforcement of our immigration laws in the interior of the \nUnited States.\n  Rarely a day goes by when our borders are not breached in a new way. \nBy now, we've all heard the story of the teams of investigators from \nthe Government Accountability Office who, in December 2005, were able \nto carry enough radioactive material to make two dirty bombs past \nborder checkpoints in Texas and Washington State by faking Government \ndocuments We can address this problem, and we will, by providing \nimproved training for agents and improved technology at the borders.\n  The magnitude of the flow of illegal immigrants into the United \nStates is astounding. The Border Patrol arrested 1.2 million illegal \nimmigrants in 2005, but couldn't stop hundreds of thousands more from \nunlawfully entering the country because they don't have the resources. \nWe can address this problem and we will, by providing more Border \nPatrol agents, better infrastructure, additional checkpoints and use of \nthe latest technology available.\n  In addition, we must address the real magnet for illegal immigration \nfor so many: the promise of a job. Most illegal immigrants in the \nUnited States did not come to this country to cause us harm but rather \ncame to earn a better life for themselves and their families. However, \nwe must ensure that a legal process for hiring foreign workers is put \nin place and strictly adhered to. We can address this problem and we \nwill by mandating employer sanctions for those who flaunt the rule of \nlaw and continue to hire illegal workers and by providing tamper-proof \ndocumentation to those who are authorized to work in the United States \nso that employers will have no confusion about the legality of the \nworkers they hire.\n  In addition to border security, we will be addressing a guest worker \nprogram. However, I am hoping we can have the opportunity to refocus \nthe Senate's attention on the ``guest'' part of the term guest worker \nprogram. It is vital in this debate to distinguish between true \ntemporary guest worker programs and proposals that will lead a guest \nworker down a new path to citizenship. I don't think it's fair to call \nthe legislation passed by the Judiciary Committee a guest worker bill. \nIt is more appropriately named a citizen worker bill because it \nprovides a clear new path to citizenship for aliens who are currently \nin the United States illegally.\n  I have a very simple question to ask all Members of the Senate as we \ndebate this bill: Why is it necessary that we address the issue of U.S. \ncitizenship when we are talking about immigration reform? There are \nreasons we need to deal with the people who are here illegally. There \nare reasons we need to deal with folks who want to come to this country \nfor the right reasons. But why is it necessary in this legislation that \nwe even consider the issue of U.S. citizenship?\n  I am particularly concerned about the agricultural guest worker \nprogram adopted by the Judiciary Committee because I believe it is \ncontrary to the best interests of American agriculture. Not only that, \nbut it will punish those farmers who have been abiding by the law in \nthis country and utilizing the H-2A program, which has been a \nlongstanding temporary guest worker program in the U.S. relative to \nagriculture.\n  Because my focus in this debate will center on border security and a \ntemporary agricultural guest worker program, I would like to take a few \nminutes to outline some of the problems I see with the Judiciary \nCommittee's agricultural guest worker program and indicate my intention \nto utilize the amendment process at the appropriate time to attempt to \nremedy what I regard as some shortcomings of the Judiciary Committee's \nagricultural reform.\n  Most troubling to me is that the agricultural reform provision \nprovides amnesty to 1.5 million illegal workers in agriculture.\n  Some might call it earned adjustment of status or earned citizenship, \nbut I call it amnesty because it provides a clear path to citizenship \nfor illegal agricultural workers who meet a very low threshold. These \nillegal workers will not have to return to their home countries and \nwill not have to wait their turn in line to gain legal permanent \nresident status in the United States.\n  The amnesty provision would allow illegal aliens who performed 863 \nhours, or 150 days, of agricultural work in the United States between \nJanuary 1, 2003, and December 31, 2005, to qualify for a blue card.\n  In legislation Senator Kyl and I introduced a year ago and had on the \nfloor previously, we had a blue card provision. That is not the blue \ncard I am talking about this morning. The blue card I am referring to \nis the one that was created by the Judiciary Committee mark.\n  The blue card program has a low threshold requirement to qualify. A \nworkday is defined as ``any day in which the individual is employed 1 \nor more hours in agriculture.'' So someone who worked 1 hour per day \nfor 150 days over the past 2 years would qualify for a blue card. The \nblue card under the Judiciary Committee bill would allow those illegal \nworkers to then work legally in agriculture or any other area of our \neconomy, provided they satisfy their agricultural employment \nrequirements each year.\n  Once in possession of a blue card, an alien who is currently here \nillegally, would only have to work in agriculture for 100 workdays, or \n575 hours per year, over a 5-year period to qualify for legal permanent \nresident status.\n  Alternatively, those blue card workers could work 150 workdays, or \n863 hours per year, over a 3-year period to earn legal permanent \nresident status.\n  A workday is still defined as ``any day in which the individual is \nemployed 1 or more hours in agriculture.'' So the requirement to obtain \nlegal permanent resident status is either 100 hours per year over a 5-\nyear period or 150 hours per year over a 3-year period.\n  While the number of blue cards allowed to be issued is capped at 1.5 \nmillion, once a blue card holder becomes a legal permanent resident, \nhis or her family members receive derivative legal status and work \nauthorization.\n  That means that whether a blue card worker has 1 child or 10 \nchildren, once he or she becomes a legal permanent resident, the rest \nof the family will have been deemed to have been here legally in the \nUnited States, and the spouse will be allowed to work regardless of \nwhether they have had a job in the United States in the past.\n  This is hardly matching willing workers with willing employers but, \nrather, putting a large population on a level playing field with \nAmerican workers for job opportunities.\n  While some of my colleagues might disagree with me on the amnesty \nissue, we should be able to agree on the fact that these agricultural \nworkers who earn amnesty through this provision will not remain in \nagriculture forever.\n  Most everyone agrees that agriculture is the hardest low-skilled work \naround in our country today. It is truly backbreaking. Generally, those \nwho have had an opportunity to earn a living in some other manner have \nchosen to do so. Even those who choose to stay in agricultural work \nfind they cannot occupy these labor-intensive jobs over a long period \nof time. There is a natural tendency to age out of agricultural work.\n  Therefore, if this provision adopted by the Judiciary Committee is \nenacted into law, I anticipate those current illegal workers who become \nlegal permanent residents will leave agriculture in the short term and \nleave our farmers to continue to rely only upon H-2A for their \nworkforce, if they are going to hire legal workers.\n  The reason I believe these workers will leave agriculture is because \nthat is what has happened in the past. I have spoken with numerous \nfarmers who were farming during the special agricultural worker program \nCongress authorized in 1986. That is commonly called the Special \nAgricultural Worker Program. That program provided amnesty for those \nagricultural workers who performed 90 days of farm work in 1985 through \n1986.\n\n[[Page S2551]]\n\n  Chalmers Carr, a peach grower in the State of South Carolina, helped \n200 workers adjust in 1986 pursuant to the special agricultural worker \neducation program. After 2 years, 75 percent of those workers had left \nhis farm, and after 5 years, the last adjusted worker left agriculture.\n  Similarly, Bill Brim, a Georgia fruit and vegetable grower, assisted \n130 workers adjust status pursuant to the Special Agricultural Worker \nProgram. Not one single one of the 130 workers stayed on his farm for \nmore than 6 months after they adjusted their status.\n  Recognizing that these agricultural workers who are able to adjust \ntheir status will not be in agriculture forever, the Senate should be \nable to agree that we need a viable H-2A program to address the labor \nneeds of agriculture in the future. Unfortunately, the agricultural \nprovision of the Judiciary Committee's bill simply does not meet the \nneeds of our Nation's agribusiness.\n  It is ironic to me that those who admittedly do not use the H-2A \nprogram in their States purport to know the modifications necessary for \nimprovement of the program. In reality, the language contained in the \nJudiciary Committee's proposal provides every advantage to those \nagricultural employers who have been utilizing an illegal workforce and \ncripples those employers who have utilized the legal H-2A program.\n  For instance, the Judiciary Committee's agricultural proposal treats \nall those currently illegal aliens who qualify for a blue card as U.S. \nworkers for purposes of recruiting workers. This means an agricultural \nemployer who has been utilizing the H-2A program for years and \nfollowing the rule of law already on the books will be forced to hire \nan illegal alien with a blue card before that farmer can petition to \nbring in the same people who had been working and returning in a legal \nmanner for him in the H-2A program for years.\n  Further, in the case of an agricultural employer who properly applies \nfor and brings H-2A workers to work on his farm, that employer will be \nforced to replace that H-2A worker for whom he has paid transportation \ncosts to the worksite with a blue card worker who arrives at the \nworksite at any point during the first 50 percent of the work period \nseeking an agricultural job to fill his or her yearly hourly \nrequirement to maintain their blue card status.\n  Once again, we are going to be giving folks who are here illegally \npreferential treatment over those folks who are here legally. There is \nno common sense whatsoever to that proposal.\n  That yearly requirement, in many cases, may not encompass the \nemployer's entire season or period of desired employment, leaving the \nemployer, again, without an adequate, reliable workforce. This \ndisadvantages those who have been playing by the rules.\n  The framework of the Judiciary Committee's proposal which provides \nthat only 575 hours of agricultural labor per year are required to \ntransition from blue card status to that of a legal permanent resident \nwill likely have a destabilizing effect on the agricultural workforce.\n  Madam President, 575 hours per year equates to a little less than 72 \ndays per year based on an 8-hour workday. I don't know about farms in \nCalifornia or Idaho, but in Georgia, our farmworkers generally work \naround 11 or 12 hours per day during peak season. Using a 12-hour \nworkday, a blue card worker will work just under 48 days to meet the \nyearly minimum hour requirement.\n  If these blue card workers are allowed to work in industries other \nthan agriculture and are only required to work 575 agricultural hours \nto qualify for legal permanent resident status, my guess is they will \nnot work in agriculture one hour more than necessary. This is not going \nto provide our agricultural employers with the stable workforce they \nare being promised.\n  I close with a comment relative to a very current issue that is very \nimportant as we debate this bill on the floor today, and that is the \nfact that our President today is in Cancun, Mexico, meeting with the \nleadership of our two best trading partners and our two border partners \nin the United States, that being the leadership of Mexico and the \nleadership of Canada.\n  As he meets with those leaders, I hope he will strongly emphasize, \nparticularly to the leadership in Mexico, to change their position on \nborder security. It is almost unfathomable to me that the leader of a \ncountry would say to his citizens that he is encouraging a border \ncountry to grant amnesty to anyone who has left his country to go into \na border country. But that is exactly what is happening on the part of \nPresident Fox.\n  I hope President Bush emphasizes to the leadership over this week \nthat they must be a partner with us in helping secure their border and \nour border which we have in common. If they will work with us, we can \nsecure the border, and if this body acts in an appropriate way over the \nnext several days, we can come up with an accommodation to those \nworkers who are here for the right reason and, at the same time, we can \nensure that those people who have crossed into our country illegally \nreturn to their home country, again, in the right way.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I wish to talk about immigration reform \nand border security. In particular, since this debate will be \ncontinuing for this week and the next, I want to emphasize the \nimportance of border security, and, obviously, enforcement begins at \nthe border.\n  But before I talk about border security and enhanced enforcement, I \nwant to address the issue of the 12 million immigrants who are already \nhere who have come to this country in violation of our immigration \nlaws.\n  We know why people come to America. It is the same reason they have \nalways come: because too often they have no hope and no opportunity \nwhere they live. So we understand at a very human level why it is that \npeople want to come to the United States. Yet I think we all \nacknowledge America cannot open its borders to anyone and everyone who \nwants to come here or we would literally be drowned in a wave of \nhumanity.\n  We have to regain control of our broken immigration system, and that \nmeans to deal with enforcement at our borders, to deal with enforcement \nin the interior of our country, and to deal with verification of the \neligibility of prospective employees to actually work legally in the \nUnited States. We cannot repeat the mistake this Nation made with the \n1986 amnesty bill.\n  I remind my colleagues that in 1986, that legislation required \nillegal aliens to pay a fee, to learn English, to improve themselves by \nworking in this country for a set time.\n  I also remind my colleagues that everyone agrees on two points when \nit comes to the 1986 experience with the amnesty bill.\n  No. 1, they agree it was amnesty. And No. 2, they agree it was a \ncomplete and total failure. I will continue to work with my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle to find a solution to this great\n\n[[Page S2552]]\n\ncrisis that confronts our country, but I won't accept a repetition of \nthe mistake of 1986 when this country granted amnesty in the hopes of \nthat being the end of it and in the hopes that there would be a \nreciprocal obligation on the part of the Federal Government to actually \nsanction employers who violate our immigration laws. I am afraid the \nnumbers speak for themselves, with 3 million illegal immigrants who \nbenefitted from the amnesty and now roughly 12 million who are here \nawaiting the next amnesty. Thus we can see what a magnet amnesty \nbecomes and why it is so counterproductive.\n\n  I am proud to represent a border State, the great State of Texas, and \nI know from personal experience what problems the border States face. I \nknow the strains that illegal immigration and our broken borders have \nplaced on local taxpayers when it comes to education, when it comes to \nhealth care, and I know the anger and frustration that many people feel \nat the Federal Government's abject failure when it comes to enforcing \nour immigration laws.\n  I also know the nature of immigration across our borders is changing. \nThere is more and more violence on the northern border of Mexico in \ncities such as Nuevo Laredo. I have listened to the concerns of my \nfellow Texans, including ranchers and those who are well accustomed to \nthe movement of people across the border into the United States who \nwant to work here and who then go back home with the savings and skills \nthey have established. I have listened to the ranchers and the Good \nSamaritans who live and work along the border who were happy to lend a \nhelping hand to the occasional traveling immigrant worker, to those \nseeking a better life. But I have to tell you, these people are now \nscared. They are terrified because drug smugglers and human traffickers \nare wreaking havoc along our Nation's borders.\n  Let's not delude ourselves. This debate isn't just about drugs, and \nit isn't just about violence, as horrible as those are. This debate is \nalso--and I would say first and foremost--about our Nation's security. \nIn a post-9/11 world, border security is national security. I say that \nagain: In a post-9/11 world, border security is national security.\n  Make no mistake about it. Today we do confront a crisis that \nthreatens our security. We all know that our immigration system is \nbroken and has been for many years. And it is not getting any better on \nits own. So I applaud the majority leader and those who have worked so \nhard on both sides of the aisle to try to bring this debate to the \nSenate floor. This is the greatest deliberative body on the face of the \nplanet, and I would hope that we could have a debate about this urgent \nneed to fix our broken immigration system and to restore security to \nour border and do it in a way that is dignified and civil and worthy of \nthis great institution and of this great democracy.\n  Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona and I have teamed up to work on this issue \nfrom top to bottom. We have worked closely together over several years \nto address this challenge in a comprehensive way. We have held numerous \nhearings, and we have heard testimony from a diverse array of experts \nacross the political spectrum. We have also inspected our Nation's \nfailed immigration system and its relationship with the terrible events \nof September 11. And we have examined why it is important for America's \nneighbors to raise living standards for their own citizens to help \nrelieve some of the pressure on our border.\n  Senator Kyl and I have sought to lay a foundation for a comprehensive \nsolution to fix our broken borders, a comprehensive solution that would \navert another crisis 5, 10, or 20 years down the road.\n  When we sat down to draft legislation, we were alarmed that many of \nthe bills already introduced at that time simply called for more \nstudies and more reports. One so-called comprehensive bill failed to \ncontain a single provision on interior enforcement. This is not a time \nfor more studies or more reports. This is a time for action. We need to \nact, and we need to act prudently and in America's best interests.\n  So our goal was to craft an immigration bill that would be \ncomprehensive. We understood that any truly comprehensive bill must \naddress both border security and enforcing the law in our Nation's \ninterior. Over a dozen of the strong and sensible enforcement \nprovisions we crafted made their way into the bill that is now before \nthe Senate in the form of the Judiciary Committee bill. I want to talk \nabout these enforcement measures and why they are a necessary \nprecondition to everything else that we do when it comes to reforming \nour broken immigration system.\n  I repeat: National security and border security begin at the border. \nCongress can no longer ignore the realities on the ground. We can no \nlonger afford to under-fund and under-man our borders. What we see in \nmy State of Texas is that the mandates that the Federal Government \nissues when it comes to health care, when it comes to education, when \nit comes to law enforcement are foisted off on State, and most often, \nlocal taxpayers. It is considered a local problem when self-evidently, \nit should be a national mandate. When it comes to any of those issues, \nwe have a national responsibility, and the Congress and the Federal \nGovernment must step up.\n  Let's look at the reason many Texans and others who live and work \nalong the border are scared, people who are very much accustomed to \nimmigrants moving back and forth across the border. It is because they \nknow the face of illegal immigration across our border has changed. We \nhave a chart, chart No. 1, that illustrates the changing nature of \nillegal immigration and the rise in the number of people coming from \ncountries other than Mexico. You can see on this chart that the aliens \nwho have been detained along the border are from special interest \ncountries--countries with ties to international terror such as Syria, \nIraq, Iran. Just 2 weeks ago, I talked to the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and he told me there were 39,000 \nChinese who had been detained coming across our southern border and, \nunfortunately, once they were detained, China refused to accept any of \nthem back.\n  So we have to use every diplomatic tool in our toolbox to make sure \nwe not only detain people who come across our border illegally, but \nthat we then, in an expeditious way, return them back to their country \nof origin.\n  Second, in the bill that Senator Kyl and I proposed, we proposed a \ndoubling in the number of Border Patrol agents. And while we have heard \na lot of talk about additional Federal agents at the border, the \nFederal Government really hasn't stepped up yet. There is a lot of good \nand, I think, well-intentioned talk. But on 9/11, we saw that 9,788 \nBorder Patrol agents were funded by the U.S. Government. Here we are \ntoday, and we have seen a small increase to a little over 11,000. But \nlest some people think that is a lot of Federal agents on the border, \nlet me remind them we have a 2,000-mile border between the United \nStates and Mexico--a 2,000-mile border--and now a little over 11,000 \nFederal agents, when the city of New York has somewhere on the order of \n39,000 policemen. So if you compare a 2,000-mile border and 11,000 \nBorder Patrol agents with the fact that the city of New York has 39,000 \npolice officers, you can see why I suggest to my colleagues that we are \nboth underfunded and undermanned when it comes to the sheer volume of \npeople coming across the border.\n\n  Last year, about 1.2 million--that's 1.2 million--people were \napprehended coming across the border. So how can we in good conscience \nsay that we are doing everything within our power to enforce our \nborders and enforce our laws when we simply deny the Federal agents, \nwho are doing a very good job, the number of people they need in order \nto be successful?\n  Then there is the issue of detention beds. Once you detain someone \ncoming illegally across the border, they are entitled, ordinarily, to a \ndeportation hearing, if they come from a country other than Mexico. \nPeople who come from Mexico are returned expeditiously--usually the \nsame day. Of course, many of them try to come back and, after enough \ntries, they usually make it past the border. But we have had a flawed \npolicy of catch and release. In other words, when we have apprehended \npeople at the border who come in illegally from countries other than \nMexico, we said: Please show up\n\n[[Page S2553]]\n\nin 30 days for your deportation hearing. Are we surprised that the vast \nmajority of people don't show up but just merely melt into our \nlandscape and become part of that 12 million people who come to our \ncountry in violation of our immigration laws? Well, it is because we \nonly have 20,000 detention beds--20,000--with 1.2 million people coming \nacross our borders just last year. That is the fundamental, root \nproblem with the catch-and-release policy that the Department of \nHomeland Security has had for far too long.\n  Senator Kyl and I would not only raise the number of detention beds \nto 50,000, but we would end the catch-and-release policy by improving \nand increasing and mandating the use of expedited removal across our \nborders.\n  This chart reflects that Border Patrol apprehensions of people from \ncountries other than Mexico were 165,000 last year. Yet 114,000 of them \nwere released under the catch-and-release program. As I say, most, if \nnot all, of them melted into the landscape and became part of this \nshadow culture living in America today of people who have come to this \ncountry in violation of our immigration laws. We may assume we know why \nthey have come here. We may assume that they are people in search of a \nbetter life and, indeed, many of them are. But the fact is, we can't \nassume in a post-9/11 world; we have to know who is coming into our \ncountry and why they are here because we know there are those who have \nevil intent toward America. We know there are common criminals. We know \nthere are drug dealers and drug smugglers. We know there are arms \ndealers. We know there are international criminal syndicates who will \ndo anything for a buck, whether it is smuggling drugs, guns, weapons of \nmass destruction, or smuggling terrorists across our borders.\n  In addition to the 10,000 more Border Patrol agents, I believe the \nsolution to securing our borders is in the technology we have, our \ntechnological advantage. But we are not using technology along the \nborder the way we should. We know the Department of Defense, our \nmilitary, is the finest, most professional military the world has ever \nknown, and in large part it is because of the technology they are able \nto use. We need to use ground sensors. We need to use unmanned aerial \nvehicles. We need to use technology to provide a secure border.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds \nto conclude my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, as I pointed out, border security is \nnational security. I see the chairman of the Subcommittee for Homeland \nSecurity of the Appropriations Committee on the floor, and he has been \na great champion of getting more money allocated for this important \neffort. But we are a far cry from where we need to be. We can do this \nif we have the national will and commitment. But our national security \ndepends on border security, and we have to make a credible effort--\nindeed, more than an effort--we need to be successful in providing \nsecurity to our borders in order to keep the American people safe.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/30/senate-section/article/S2553-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I understand that the Senator from \nGeorgia and the Senator from Louisiana wish to speak. I also wish to \nspeak, and I see the Democratic floor leader is here. I spoke with the \nSenator from Massachusetts, and he said he wasn't speaking at this \ntime.

Under the previous order, the time until 12 \np.m. will be equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I would just suggest that since the \nSenator from Georgia is here and the Senator from Louisiana is here and \nI am here and I know the Senator from Vermont is here, since he is the \nfloor leader, he would probably want to proceed. Do you have a \nstatement you are proceeding with, I presume?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I would tell my good friend from my \nneighboring State of New Hampshire, I do have a statement. It is not \nvery long; it is probably 7 or 8 minutes. But I would like to say, just \nto frame the issue, the distinguished chairman of the committee, \nSenator Specter, and I spoke on the floor yesterday on this. This is a \nmajor issue. I will want to speak. I do not intend to hold the floor \nvery long.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator be good enough to yield? I will be glad \nto wait for 45 minutes or an hour. I will seek recognition at that \ntime. After the Senator from Vermont speaks, we have some other \nspeakers, but I think we can wait.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Vermont be \nrecognized for as much time as he may desire and then the Senator from \nGeorgia be recognized for 15 minutes, the Senator from Louisiana for 15 \nminutes, and then I be recognized for 15 minutes, and that will get us \nto approximately the 45 minutes the Senator was talking about.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Then would the Senator from Illinois be recognized for \n15 minutes and I will follow the Senator from Illinois?\n  Mr. GREGG. That sounds reasonable to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield the floor. I thank the Senator from Vermont and \nthe Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire. \nAs usual, he found us a roadmap and it worked well.\n  Madam President, let me just briefly suggest the absence of a quorum. \nI am going to take us out of the quorum in about 1 minute.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, we are going to have a major debate on \nimmigration. That is a good thing, both for the country and for the \nSenate. I note, however, in the Judiciary Committee, we have had a \nmajor amount of debate and long markups. The distinguished chairman of \nthe committee, Senator Specter, and I have tried to make sure we had \nfull hearings.\n  The distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, is \non the floor. As I said last night, he has spent more time on this than \nany of the rest of us. He has been in the Senate longer. He has been a \nleader in the area of immigration.\n  When we began the debate, Chairman Specter and I followed the opening \nstatement of the Republican leader with a discussion of how the \nJudiciary Committee, in a truly bipartisan manner, worked successfully \nto meet the deadline set by the Senate's Republican leadership. I \nunderstood that the majority leader had committed to turn to the \ncommittee bill if we were able to meet that deadline. I heard our \nchairman reiterate that same thing on the floor again yesterday. We did \nit, we completed that difficult task. We did it by working together, \nRepublicans and Democrats, something that should be done more often \naround here.\n\n[[Page S2554]]\n\n  Under the steady leadership of the chairman and Senator Kennedy, and \nwith the hard work and dedication of so many members of the committee, \nwe worked through the long hours and numerous amendments and \naccomplished what had seemed to be the impossible. Our staffs worked \nthroughout the St. Patrick's Day recess. As I said last night, I got e-\nmails from them at 11 o'clock and 12 o'clock at night and then again \nvery early in the morning. I knew how hard they were working on this--\nthe staffs of all the Senators involved. Then the Judiciary Committee \nsent a resounding message approving a bill by a bipartisan vote of 12 \nto 6.\n  What was interesting about that is none of the amendments on the \ncritical issues passed on a party-line vote. They were by strong \nbipartisan votes. Let me tell you what our committee did.\n  We have a bill that is strong on enforcement. In some ways, it is \nstronger than the bill passed by the House. It is tough on employer \nenforcement. It is tough on traffickers--and it should be. It is \nstronger than the bill introduced by the senior Senator from Tennessee, \nwho started from the same place as the committee bill but did not \ninclude some of the enforcement measures added by amendment during \ncommittee consideration nor any of the other improvements we made. For \nexample, neither of those other bills included a provision, added by \nthe committee at the urging of Senator Feinstein, to make tunneling \nunder our borders a Federal crime. The committee bill adds new criminal \npenalties for evading immigration officers, and it added manslaughter \nto the definition of aggravated felony.\n  Finally, on Monday morning of this week, the committee adopted a \nFeinstein amendment to add 12,000 new Border Patrol agents--2,400 each \nyear for the next 5 years.\n  Our committee bill is enforcement-plus. It starts with strong \nenforcement provisions and border security, but it is also \ncomprehensive in its balance. It confronts the problem of 12 million \nundocumented immigrants who live in the shadows. It values work. It \nrespects human dignity and includes guest worker provisions supported \nby both business and labor. It includes a way to pay fines and earn \ncitizenship that has the support of religious organizations and leading \nHispanic organizations.\n  Yesterday, Senator Kennedy and Senator Durbin and Senator Harkin made \nexcellent, persuasive statements in favor of the committee bill. \nSenators Domenici and Martinez also spoke of their personal journeys. \nThese were very real and meaningful statements. They reminded us all \nthat we are a country of immigrants. I thank them for speaking in terms \nfavorable to the comprehensive approach we have adopted. Listening \nto them makes me think how proud my immigrant grandparents would be. \nThey immigrated from Italy to Vermont. They would be proud to hear this \ndebate, and to see their grandson speaking on the floor of the Senate.\n\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Specter in a bipartisan way \nto pass the committee bill. The chairman and I have been able to move \nour committee from being a confrontational committee to one that works \nin a bipartisan fashion. I commend him for that. I commend all members \nof the committee for that.\n  What we have done is, by working that way, we have provided a \nrealistic and reasonable system for immigration. The bill protects \nAmerica's borders, it strengthens enforcement, and most important, it \nremains true to the best of American values.\n  The committee bill wisely dropped controversial provisions which \nwould have exposed those who provide humanitarian relief or medical \ncare or shelter or counseling or other basic services to undocumented \naliens. Under the earlier bill, they would have faced possible \nprosecution under felony alien-smuggling provisions of the criminal \nlaw--a reminder that in a nation such as ours, with such a great heart \nand soul as a nation, we also have a moral and humanitarian \nresponsibility to people. We should not make felons of those who carry \nout the responsibility of feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, and \nsheltering those who need shelter.\n  I thank so many in the relief and religious communities, the faith \ncommunity, for speaking out on this matter. Even in my own faith, I was \nso pleased to see some of the leaders speak out so strongly.\n  The criminal provisions should be focused on the smugglers, not on \nthe children of aliens or those who help them. Focus it on the \nsmugglers, those who traffic in human misery and sometimes bring about \nthe death of those they smuggle. Under the committee bill, that is what \nwe did.\n  The committee also voted down a measure that would criminalize mere \npresence in an undocumented status in the United States. I was a \nprosecutor. I know how unworkable that would have been. Illegal status \nis currently a civil offense with very serious consequences. One of the \nmost serious, of course, is it includes deportation. But if you then \ncriminalize that status, it is punitive, it is wrong, it is totally \nunworkable and goes against the history of our Nation. It would have \nled to further harsh consequences. It would have trapped people in \npermanent underclass status. It would have put bars in front of the \nAmerican dream.\n  These criminalization measures, which were included in the House-\npassed bill supported by congressional Republicans and which were \nreflected in the majority leader's bill, have understandably sparked \nnationwide protest. In the view of many, it is anti-immigrant and \ninconsistent with America's values and history. The committee bill, \nwhile tough in enforcement and on the smugglers, is smarter and fairer.\n  I ask Senators to look at the peaceful demonstrations across this \ncountry. Listen to the people who are speaking out. A half-million \npeople went out in a peaceful demonstration in Los Angeles. That is \nnearly the population of my State. That was just one demonstration \namong many.\n  Opponents of a fair, comprehensive approach are quick to claim that \nanything but the most punitive provision is amnesty. They are wrong. \nThis is not an amnesty bill. An editorial in yesterday's New York Times \nentitled ``It Isn't Amnesty'' makes the point that painting the word \n``deer'' on a cow and taking it into the woods does not make the cow a \ndeer. As I said yesterday, in Vermont, especially during deer season, \nwe Vermonters know the difference between a deer and a cow. Sometimes \nwe wish the tourists did.\n  Our committee bill should not be falsely labeled. Our bill is more \nproperly called what it is: a smart, tough bill.\n  We know we need a comprehensive solution to a national problem. We \nneed a fair, realistic, and reasonable system that includes both tough \nenforcement and immigration reform provisions. All Senators, \nRepublicans and Democrats, should be able to agree with these \nprinciples. The bill reported by the Judiciary Committee is that bill.\n  I am glad to hear that President Bush is again speaking about the \nneed for a path to citizenship and the need for a comprehensive bill. I \nhope, as we now proceed through the sixth year in office, that the \nBush-Cheney administration will finally send a legislative proposal to \nCongress on these matters. They have stated their support. Let them \nalso bring forward what they believe is appropriate legislation. We did \nnot want to wait any longer in our committee. We did the hard work, and \nproduced a bipartisan bill.\n  We did the hard work, and we wrote a tough, smart, comprehensive \nbill. The Judiciary Committee's debate has produced a bill that I \nbelieve would make my immigrant grandparents proud, and my maternal \ngreat-grandparents proud. It is worthy of our support.\n  This is a body which should reflect the conscience of our great \nNation. There are only 100 of us. We are enormously privileged to \nrepresent 295 million Americans. Let us speak to the conscience of all \nof us and the humanity of all of us. Let us pass this bill. It is not \njust from the managers' point of view, from a political point of view; \nit has the support of the labor unions, business groups, leading \nHispanic organizations, and many from our religious communities. They \nare asking the Senate to do its part. Let's adopt the committee bill so \nwe can bring hard-working people out of the shadows and end the \npermanent underclass status of so many who have contributed so much.\n\n[[Page S2555]]\n\n  Let us protect our security and our borders, but support the American \ndream that attracted my grandparents and the American dream that \nattracted so many, and allow this bill to become a reality. We are a \ngood, brave, and wonderful country. Let us demonstrate it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, in 1903, Andrew Bengsten boarded a ship \nand left Sweden, the son of Isak Bengsten. He landed on Ellis Island \nand took the last name Isakson, which is the Scandinavian tradition, to \ntake the father's first name and add ``son'' to it. In 1916, he had a \nson named Ed, and in 1926 he became a naturalized citizen.\n  He went to West Texas as a laborer, and later on to Atlanta, GA as a \ncarpenter. In 1944, his son Ed and Ed's wife Julia had a son, who by \nthe grace of God is me. No one in this body has any greater respect or \nadmiration for this great country and our process of legal immigration \nthan I.\n  As we approach the most important debate this Senate will encounter \nin this session, it is important that it be a debate of dignity and a \ndebate of substance and a debate where we learned the lessons of the \npast and make sure that immigration in the future holds the same \npromise it held for my grandfather 103 years ago.\n  I have filed an amendment at the clerk's desk, which at the \nappropriate time in the debate I will offer, which to me is the key as \nto whether we proceed on whatever the final product this Senate may \nadopt may be. It is a point that has been missed by many and avoided by \nsome but we must focus on and we must accomplish. It is an amendment \nthat very simply says no provision of any act we pass which contains a \nguest worker program will go into effect until, first, the Secretary of \nHomeland Security has certified to the President and to this Congress \nthat our borders are reasonably secure.\n  I want to tell you why that is important. It is important because 20 \nyears ago, in 1986, a great President, Ronald Reagan, and this Congress \nadopted a program that gave legal status to 3 million illegal aliens in \nthe United States. We did so in the hopes of clearing up the problem. \nInstead, what we created was an attractive reason for more to come \nillegally in hopes of gaining the same status. Today, 20 years later, \nwe have estimates of 11 million to 13 million Americans who came \nexactly that way--over the border illegally in hopes of that same \npromise that happened in 1986.\n  Were we to pass in this body this year a bill granting status that \ndoes not require, first, security on the border, then we will create \nthe same attractiveness we did 20 years ago. The result will be the \nsame, and the legacy to another Congress and the problems in our social \nservices system in our great country will be great. It is important \nthat whatever security requirements we place in this legislation--and \nthere should be many--be funded and be in place before any other \nprovision takes place.\n  Second, it is important to understand that enforcing the border is \nsomething we can do. Before I introduced border security legislation a \nfew weeks ago, I traveled to the United States border with Mexico. I \nwent to San Diego and Tijuana, met with our border agents who are \nhaving remarkable success now because of technology and, of course, \nbecause of improved numbers.\n  I went to Fort Huachuca in Arizona where the one and only unmanned \naerial surveillance vehicle, the Predator, has a 150-mile stretch of \nthe United States-Mexican border secure because we have eyes in the sky \n24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n  For $400 million, we can deploy a fleet of 26 of those unmanned \nPredator aircraft to have eyes in the sky 24/7 along the entire 2,000-\nmile border. That will have a tripling effect on our manpower because \nit allows us through technology to identify those who are coming and \nwhere they are, to position the agents we have to intercept them and \nturn them around. It will send the signal that no longer are we going \nto look the other way but instead we are going to focus on those who \nare trying to come here illegally and be smuggled, and shut the door so \nthey will apply legally to come to this country the right way, as so \nmany American guests have and some citizens have, to ultimately become \nnaturalized.\n  This place we all call home and the rest of the world calls America \nis a very special place. Our problem isn't that people are trying to \nbreak out of this great country; they are all trying to break into this \ngreat country. We owe it to our country and our future and to the \nlegacy of our children to assure that the path to this country is legal \nand operable, and that it isn't done illegally and involve smuggling.\n  While often many of us talk about the Southwest border, it should \nalso be true on the border with Canada as well, and it should be true \nat our ports.\n  Whatever we do in this 2 weeks of debate, it must ultimately be \npredicated on, first, securing the border of the United States, whether \nit be on the north or on the South. We must have fortitude in this \nSenate to pass the appropriations necessary to fund the programs to \nsecure those borders. Rhetoric is cheap. Enforcement on our borders can \nbe expensive. But it must be essential.\n  The distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, who is on the floor, \nhas been an absolute leader to the appropriations and the budget \nprocess in focusing like a laser beam on seeing to it that we authorize \nand ultimately appropriate the funds to do exactly that in terms of \nmanpower. I will join him in that as well as those who put the funds up \nfor the unmanned aerial vehicle surveillance and the ground sensors for \ntunneling and other technology we have.\n  It is a matter of us developing a resolve to secure the borders of \nthe United States of America. We must not demonize anybody. First, we \nmust secure the borders which the American people expect us to secure.\n  I come from a great State, the State of Georgia, a State that is a \nmajor agricultural producer in this country, a State where there are \nmany migrant laborers. I am well aware of what the green industry, the \nagricultural industry and the construction industry workforce, is made \nup of. We owe it to those industries to see to it that we have a legal \npath to come to this country and to work and appreciate America, that \nno longer will there be smuggling of illegal aliens across our border, \nbut instead we have as a country a legal path for people to come and an \nillegal door that is shut because we have stopped turning and looking \nthe other way.\n  I look forward to this debate. I appreciate the promise of this \ncountry, because were it not for our legal immigration process I would \nnot be here today. But I will fight as hard as I can to see to it that \nwhatever passes this Senate requires first and foremost the securing of \nour borders before the extension to guest workers or any status be \ngranted. If we do not, we will have recreated the problem we created in \n1967. We will deal not with just 3 million illegals coming but millions \nand millions and millions more, all because we looked the other way at \na time when we needed to focus like a laser beam.\n  The people of this country are looking to us to secure our borders \nfor the homeland and for immigration. We must secure them first before \nwe do anything else.\n  A comprehensive bill is possible, and I have no problem with \naddressing comprehensive reform. But those reforms that involve guest \nworkers must only be implemented after the certification by the \nSecretary of Homeland Security that our borders are secure. For failure \nto do so is to pass on to another generation of Americans a compounded \nproblem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I too rise to strongly support the general \nthrust of the President's border security bill. As the essential first \nstep in this great challenge, we must take strong, meaningful action--\nnot just talk but action to prove that we can and will secure our \nborders and return to the rule of law with regard to our immigration \nsystem.\n  I too rise as a descendent of immigrants to this country, and I am \nvery proud of that. Both sets of my grandparents--on my mom's side and \non my dad's side--came from France. They came first into New York but \nvery soon thereafter to Louisiana where there are\n\n[[Page S2556]]\n\nmany other French immigrants, and they settled.\n  What is so unique about this debate is that here in the Senate, every \nSenator rises and begins with a similar sort of story. We are all the \ndescendants of immigrants. That is what makes America so magical and so \nunique. For a young country, we are an immigrant country, and we \ncelebrate that. But we also want to preserve that.\n  To me, that comes down to two fundamental traditions in this \ncountry--the two fundamental reasons I am supporting the Frist border \nsecurity bill--and that focus as a first step in this great debate is \none tradition, the tradition of immigration, but it is a proud, strong \ntradition of legal immigration throughout the history of our country, \nat least until recently.\n  The other great tradition which I will base my vote on is the very \nimportant tradition--in fact, one of the leading reasons so many \npeople, including my grandparents, came to this country--of the rule of \nlaw which forms the basis of so much of what we do.\n  Let me talk briefly about those two traditions.\n  First, the rule of law: It is at the heart of our entire system. It \nis at the heart of what is attractive to millions upon millions of \npeople from every country around the world to become Americans, \nincluding my family. Law is at the center of our democratic traditions. \nWithout proper law enforcement, written laws mean nothing. Failure to \nenforce certain laws, including our immigration laws, gives people the \nimpression that the Federal Government will fail to enforce other laws. \nThat tradition of the rule of law and enforcement is an essential \ncomponent to comprehensive immigration reform.\n  A recent poll conducted by the Washington Post and ABC News found \nthat the huge majority of Americans agrees with what I am saying. Four \nin five Americans think the Government is not doing enough to prevent \nillegal immigration, with three in five saying they strongly hold that \nview.\n  The same poll found that 56 percent of Americans believe illegal \nimmigrants have done more to hurt the country than to help it, while \nonly 37 percent believe illegal immigrants help the country. But the \nkey is the illegal nature of that activity--not our proud tradition of \nlegal immigration.\n  Of course, this issue of the rule of law and the explosion of illegal \nimmigration also has a very important national security component, \nparticularly since September 11. Adequate border security and \nenforcement of our immigration laws was an issue on September 11. It \ngoes directly to the terrorist attacks. It goes directly to our war on \nterror.\n  In its report, the 9/11 Commission itself found weaknesses in \nimmigration enforcement could have facilitated those terrorist acts. \nThe Commission stated:\n\n        . . . our investigation showed that two systematic \n     weaknesses came together in our border system's inability to \n     contribute to an effective defense against the September 11 \n     attacks: A lack of well-developed counterterrorism measures \n     as part of border security, and an immigration system not \n     able to deliver on its basic commitments, much less support \n     counterterrorism.\n\n  Other studies have shown that 15 of the 19 September 11 hijackers, \nincluding Mohammed Atta, should have been denied visas. At least three \nof them overstayed their visas. Clearly, lax enforcement was an \nimportant part, sadly, of that tragedy.\n  There are also other issues within the country related to illegal \nimmigration--not our proud tradition of legal immigration but illegal \nimmigration.\n  First, it is very important to say we are talking about millions upon \nmillions of people, 11 to 13 million by most estimates, even more by \nsome. It is important to say the great majority of those people are not \ndangerous criminals. However, some percentage of those folks do \ncontribute enormously to our criminal issues in this country. A GAO \nreport issued in April of 2005 says the number of criminal aliens \nincarcerated in the United States increased by 15 percent from 2001 to \n2004. Those aliens constitute about 27 percent of all Federal \nprisoners. That is a cost to the Federal Government of about $1.2 \nbillion a year. That specific year was 2004. It is an enormous cost to \nour country. Again, a small percentage of those balloon the costs to \nsociety.\n  Violent gangs, composed mostly of criminal aliens such as the El \nSalvadoran-based MS-13, have been a very important and dangerous part \nof the criminal problem and violent crime in this country. Last March, \nICE agents deported 37 criminal aliens rounded up in the Washington, DC \narea, two of whom had ties to MS-13. MS-13 has spread across the \ncountry. Over 2,000 members are in northern Virginia alone.\n  For all of these reasons, real enforcement must come first in our \nmeeting this challenge. It must come first because we need to get \ncontrol of our borders. We need to get control of the serious \nrepercussions this illegal problem has in our country, including on the \ncriminal side. To do this, we must prove to the American people we are \nnot just going to talk about it as window dressing to what is \ntantamount to an amnesty program. We are going to do it. We are going \nto put the resources behind it. We are going to deploy those unmanned \naerial vehicles. We are going to do what is next in terms of manpower \nenforcement and other resources at the border.\n  I am a fairly typical American when it comes to this issue. I have \nheard this enforcement talk in Washington for the last couple of years. \nI don't believe most of it. Quite frankly, we have never been true to \nit. We have never been serious about it. We have never turned the \ncorner on this issue before.\n  I believe it is our solemn duty and responsibility in terms of \naddressing this issue in a comprehensive way to first not only pass \nborder security and significant enforcement measures, but to put them \nin practice, to fund them, to get agents on the border, to do whatever \nit takes to turn the corner on this issue and prove to the American \npeople, prove to me and so many millions of others, we are serious \nabout enforcement.\n  There is another reason I believe we must start with enforcement, as \nthe Frist measure does. It is because any measure that is tantamount to \namnesty sends exactly the wrong message as we try to get our hands \naround this problem. We are a nation that believes in upholding the \nrule of law. We must reestablish respect for our laws, including border \nsecurity and interior security. But provisions which are tantamount to \namnesty send exactly the opposite message. It sends the message that \nyou can break the law and over time you will basically be rewarded for \ndoing so.\n  These are not just theoretical or commonsense arguments. These are \narguments that are borne out by history, as Senator Isakson, the \nprevious speaker, pointed out.\n  The last amnesty type of program enacted by this Congress was in \n1986. There have been many studies about the effects of that since \nthen. Across the board they show that act of basically granting amnesty \nto a class of illegal aliens in this country dramatically worsened the \nproblem. It did nothing to solve the problem. In 1992, for instance, 6 \nyears after the last illegal alien agricultural worker amnesty passed \nin 1986, the Commission on Agricultural Workers issued a report to \nCongress that studied the effects of that 1986 agriculture worker \namnesty. They made a number of findings and recommendations. First, the \nCommission found that the number of workers amnestied under the bill \nhad been severely underestimated. I fear many of the estimates we are \ntalking about here today are underestimated.\n\n  Second, the Commission found the agriculture worker amnesty only \nexacerbated existing problems.\n\n       Six years after AIRC was signed into law the problems \n     within the system of agricultural labor continue to exist . . \n     . In most areas, an increasing number of newly arriving, \n     unauthorized workers compete for available jobs, reducing the \n     number of work hours available to all harvest workers and \n     contributing to lower annual earnings . . .\n\n  Third, the Commission stated that a guest worker amnesty program \nshould not be the basis for future immigration policy. The Commission \nwent on to say the only way to have a structured and stable market was \nto increase enforcement of our immigration laws, certainly including \nstrong employer sanctions.\n  So we have experience to guide us. We have concrete history to learn \nby. Why do we believe doing the same thing as we did in 1986, only on a \nmuch greater scale, is going to yield different results?\n\n[[Page S2557]]\n\n  The Frist bill is not perfect, but it is a good and an appropriate \nstart. And start we must on the enforcement side of the equation to \nprove we can get real, get tough, get serious about enforcement as \nnever before. Because, quite frankly, we have never, ever, in the \nhistory of this modern problem proven that we will be serious, that we \nwill have the political will, that we will devote the manpower and \nother resources necessary to turn the corner on this issue.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to start here where there is consensus, \nwhere we can come together around commonsense, meaningful, and \nappropriate enforcement actions as the important first step in \naddressing this very important challenge.\n  The Senate is having a very important and responsible debate on this \nissue. It is crucial in this debate that we be respectful of each other \nand of everyone involved in this issue and not demonize any part of \nsociety. That applies equally to those who believe we must start with \nenforcement as it does to people illegally in this country.\n  No one in this Senate, I believe, is anti-immigration. Everyone is a \nproduct of a strong and proud history of immigration in this country. \nBut until recently it was a strong and proud history of legal \nimmigration. I truly believe what most threatens that strong and proud \nhistory and the support in this country for that foundation of our \nsociety is the fact that illegal immigration has subsumed that \ntradition.\n  If we want to continue to cherish that tradition, if we want to \ncontinue to have respect for all members of our society, no matter how \nthey look or appear, we must get back to that important tradition of \nlegal immigration. We must get back to the rule of law so we can defend \nthat strong tradition and get hold of this very serious challenge our \ncountry faces.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, obviously the issue before the Senate is a \ncritical issue--how we maintain the atmosphere of this Nation, which is \nbasically the essence of our definition of a culture, which is that we \nare a society which invites people from around the world to participate \nin our society. It was the reason we went with the motto, E pluribus \nunum: from many, one. How we maintain that atmosphere, that way of life \nwhich has given us so much energy as a nation, that has given so many \npeople the opportunity to pursue the American dream, is what this \ndebate is all about.\n  Whatever we do, we do not want to, in my opinion, chill that great \ntradition which is the engine for our strength as a nation. People come \nhere seeking a better life, and as a result they energize society to be \neven more productive, successful, and stronger.\n  We are, as has been mentioned by most of the speakers today, most all \nof us immigrants. Certainly everyone in the Senate since the departure \nof the great Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell falls into that category.\n  The issue, in my opinion, breaks into two obvious parts. The first is \nhow you secure the border. The second is how you deal with the fact \nthere is a large number of people in this country who are here \nillegally today and that there is a large number of people who wish to \ncome to this country for the purposes of earning a living, and that \nthey will come into this country however they can--and if it is \nillegal, they will come here illegally--and how we would change that \natmosphere.\n  On the first issue, which has been discussed and which is the purpose \nof the bill before the Senate, the bill filed by the Senate majority \nleader, this is very resolvable. We can secure our borders. That has \nbeen said by everyone. And we should. We must. We cannot as a culture \nsurvive if we do not have borders which are secure, if we do not know \nwho is coming into the country, if we do not know who is coming here. \nIf we have large numbers of people who are coming into this Nation \nillegally, it undermines us as a nation of laws.\n\n  There is no question but this can be resolved. It does not take a lot \nof new law to do that, to be very honest. We can pretty well control \nwho is coming into this country. I want to get into the specifics of \nhow we do that because I have the good fortune to chair the \nsubcommittee which has jurisdiction over the borders in the \nappropriations area. I will talk about what we need there. Before I do \nthat, I also want to address this issue of amnesty and guest worker and \nhow we deal with the folks who are here and who are here illegally.\n  Let's assume for the moment we are able to secure the southern \nborder, which I think we can. It might take 2 or 3 years, but I am \nabsolutely sure we can do that, so that the vast majority of the people \ncoming across our southern borders will come across in some manner \nwhich is legal, for a purpose which is not to harm us. That is a little \nmore difficult to do on the northern border. We do not have the human \nwave coming across the northern border. The northern border is probably \nmore of a terrorist threat to us, actually, in many ways, but it does \nnot have the human wave issue that we see on the southern border.\n  The question becomes, how do you deal with the folks who are already \nhere illegally? There is this term, we cannot give them amnesty; \namnesty is wrong. Well, as a practical matter, they already have \namnesty. Our system is not able to deal with these individuals unless \nthey become criminals, unless they commit an act which violates our law \nin an open way, commit a felony, do something that is clearly a \ntransgression to our society. But if they are here working, as most of \nthem are, trying to support themselves or their families or their \nfamilies back home, for all intents and purposes they already have \namnesty because we are not doing anything about it and we do not have \nthe capacity to do anything about it. That is a straw dog, to be very \nhonest, this argument of amnesty.\n  The bigger question, more fundamental question, is how do you set up \na system which allows these people to come out from behind the bushes \nwhere they have to hide, so they are not taken advantage of, so they \ncan be even more productive in their role here in the United States, \nand do it in a way that does not basically affront our sensibilities as \na nation of laws, and especially address the issue of citizenship.\n  There are a lot of ways to do that. There are a lot of ideas being \nput forward to do that. I happen to think the essence of the question \nis how you deal with the issue of citizenship. If you are here \nillegally, getting citizenship should be probably not attainable, but \ncertainly there should be a way to allow you to still participate in \nour society so you do not have to hide.\n  That assumes, however, you have effectively set up a border \nenforcement mechanism which works because, as the point was made by the \nSenator from Louisiana, you cannot move to any sort of effort to try to \nredress or address the issue of people who are here illegally unless \nyou have more control of the borders because you simply will create an \nincentive for more people to come in illegally.\n  But let's remember that if we were able to solve the problem of the \npeople who are here illegally and who are working and who seek nothing \nmore than to be working, if we were able to give them some sort of \nstatus that would allow them to participate as workers in this country \nin a public way, so they were able to participate in systems such as \npaying into the health care system, paying into retirement systems, I \nthink we might actually be moving toward a more constructive result \nthan what we have today, which is essentially a large number of people \nwho we know are here and we just turn our eyes to the fact they are \nhere illegally. They are going to continue to stay here and work here. \nWe certainly are not going to remove them because we have no way to \nremove 10, 11 million people, however many people there are, except for \nthose people who commit criminal acts.\n  So I think the debate is misfocused in some ways when the word \n``amnesty'' becomes the hot button nomenclature versus the more \nsubstantive question: What you do with people who are already here and \nbasically have the capacity to be here, and they already have amnesty, \nfor all intents and purposes, because we are not going to do anything \nabout them so long as they act legally in the context of their jobs \nbecause we do not have the capacity to remove 11 million people, and \nour society would not be able to absorb it.\n  But getting into the issue I wish to talk about today, which is the \nspecifics\n\n[[Page S2558]]\n\nof the Border Patrol question and how you upgrade the Border Patrol, \nthe bill before us authorizes an additional 1,400 Border Patrol agents \nover the next few years and authorizes more beds for detention. It \nauthorizes more technology for the purposes of guarding the border. \nThat is all well and good. I strongly support those authorization \nefforts.\n  But the bottom line is, the rubber does not meet the road with the \nauthorization bill. The rubber meets the road with when we spend the \nmoney, which is with the appropriations bill. The problem we have, very \nsimply, is we are not committing resources in this area to the level we \nneed to accomplish what is already on the books in the way of obtaining \nsecurity along the border.\n  Security along the border basically breaks down to three basic \ncomponents: First, how many agents, how many feet on the ground do you \nhave down there? Second, how many beds do you have, so when you find \npeople who are coming across illegally, you can actually control where \nthey are going, so you are not basically catching and releasing but you \ncan actually hold these people and send them back? And third, what \ntechnologies are necessary in order to, first, monitor the border, and \nsecondly, evaluate people who are coming into our country as to whether \nthey are coming here to participate in our society in a positive way or \nwhether they are coming here to do us harm?\n  In all four of those categories--three categories with a couple \nsubcategories--we simply have not been able to put the resources in \nthat are necessary to get where we want to go. This does not mean we \nhave not tried. In fact, in the last 2 years, we have increased the \nnumber of Border Patrol agents by 1,500. That is almost 1,300 more than \nthe administration asked for. We added over 2,000 beds to detention. We \nhave significantly increased the funding for the surveillance and \ntechnology area, especially in the area of US-VISIT, which is the \nprogram which is essentially going to try to, through technology, be \nable to evaluate people as they come into the country legally and know \nwhether they are people whom we want to have visit us or whether they \nare people who may be here to do us harm.\n  But that has not generated the results we need. I wish to go through \na few statistics which are, unfortunately, rather stark but should be \ntalked about because you are not going to get resolution around here \nunless you talk about them.\n  The first is the issue of border agents. We have been increasing the \nnumber of our border agents rather significantly over the last couple \nyears, as I just mentioned, but we also know we need to increase them \neven further in order to hit what is the goal. With 20,000 agents on \nthe border, we can accomplish what we need to do relative to boots on \nthe ground. That means we have to increase--by 1,500, 2,000, 2,000 in \neach of the next few years--the number of agents we put on the ground, \nthe number of agents in the system.\n\n  The problem is very simple: One is a dollar issue, which should be \nable to be resolved but, secondly, it is an issue of being able to \nhire. It takes 30,000 applications, approximately, in order to hire \n1,000 agents. It is very difficult to find the people we need--it is \nthat simple--because of the language requirements and because of the \neducational requirements and because of the demands of the job. So it \nis not only an issue of money, it is an issue of hiring up. And that is \na big problem for us.\n  A second problem we have is that the technology situation is dire, \nespecially in the area of aircraft, where we are essentially \nfunctioning with a fleet of aircraft which has long outlived its \npurposes.\n  The average life of the P-3s we have in the air should be 20 years, \nbut the average life of the P-3s that are actually flying is 40 years. \nI want to show you a picture of the problem we have with the P-3s, \nwhich basically is the backbone of our air surveillance. This is a \ncrack in the bathtub fitting of a P-3. As a result, last year, we had \n11,000 hours of P-3 flight, but this year alone we have had to reduce \nthe P-3 flights by over 1,000 hours because we have had to retrofit \nthese planes. Why? Because they are 40 years old or older, and they \nshould have flown for 20 years.\n  We have the same problem in our helicopter fleet, where the average \nlife is supposed to be 15 years for our helicopters. We are flying \nhelicopters which have average lives of 30 years.\n  The same is true of our Beech King air fleet, where the average life \nis supposed to be 20 years, and they are well over 30 years.\n  These are problems of resources which need to be addressed. I will \ntalk in a second as to how they should be addressed.\n  The third issue in the area of surveillance--we have heard about the \nPredator, which is the unarmed, in this case, air surveillance system \nalong the border. This is a great breakthrough for us. We do not have \nto build a fence along the southern border. Building a fence would be \nthe exact wrong message to send, in my opinion. There are certain \nsections where there are heavily populated communities where you are \ngoing to have to have some fencing, but the vast majority of the border \ndoes not require fencing, should not have fencing. It is the wrong \nimage for us as a nation. And with technology, we can do a lot.\n  One of the keys to technology is the Predator. But we only have one \nPredator. We need 18 in order to effectively do the border. So, again, \nit is an issue of resources, putting resources in this area.\n  In the area of beds, we know the States are absorbing a huge amount \nof the costs of basically taking care of the illegal aliens who have \nbeen arrested. We know we do not yet have the beds necessary to be able \nto even hold the non-Mexican arrests, which are the people we are most \nconcerned about from a terrorist standpoint. We need to add a lot of \nnew beds. We need to be creative about this--not just having physical \nbuildings; we need to figure out ways to use swing beds. We need to \nfigure out ways to use closed military facilities, maybe tents, tent \ncapabilities. But we need to put more resources in this area, although \nthis Congress has attempted to do it by adding over 2,000 beds in the \nlast few years.\n  So we have serious resource issues. Well, how do we address this \nissue? There will be a supplemental coming through here in a few days--\nin a week--which is the supplemental to fight the war on terror. Now, \nit seems to me that probably one of the core elements of fighting the \nwar on terror is making sure your borders are secure.\n  I would hope within the limit of that supplemental we would be able \nto fund the capital needs or at least make the first downpayment on the \nmajor capital needs I have just outlined in the border areas, \nspecifically: the aircraft, replace those P-3 aircraft, buy more \nPredators, replace the helicopters, make sure the cars these agents \ndrive can go out in the field day after day and still work well so we \ncan move the agents out into the field, make the capital investments in \nthe buildings necessary in order to take care of these people.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is something we should do now. It is something we \nshould do in the context of national defense, and it should be done as \npart of the supplemental.\n  The bigger problem we have is that when the Homeland Security bill \nhits this floor, we are going to have to figure out a way to pay for \nthis. The administration has proposed we increase fees on air \ntransportation. Well, air transportation fees do not necessarily line \nup with Border Patrol needs. In fact, the Border Patrol needs are not \naffected by air transportation fees. Air transportation fees fund \nthings such as TSA. So it is unlikely that fee is going to occur. But \nif we do not do it, we are going to have a $1.6 billion hole in the \nHomeland Security budget. We cannot afford that. We need those extra \ndollars. So we will have to come up with a way to do that. I am making \nmy commitment to do that.\n  But the reason I wanted to speak today was to make it clear we can, \nwith additional resources, accomplish the first step to border security \nand to good immigration policy, which is border security, which allows \nus to know who is coming into this country. It is a very doable thing. \nAll it takes is resources. I believe we should have, as a Congress, the \nwherewithal and the willingness to commit those resources.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n[[Page S2559]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first, I commend Senators McCain and \nKennedy, who are on the Senate floor. They have really pointed the way \nfor a positive resolution of a problem we have faced for generations in \nAmerica.\n  The immigration system in our country is seriously broken, and we \nknow it. It is obvious, as we look at the number of undocumented people \nin America and as we consider, those of us in this line of work, all of \nthe families who come to us with problems with the current system. \nThere is so much unfairness, so much injustice. We can do better as a \nnation, a nation of immigrants.\n  Now the Senate will face a very clear and stark choice. Senator Frist \nbrings to the floor an alternative. His is an alternative that focuses \non enforcement.\n  Well, Senator Frist is not alone in believing we need to be better at \nenforcing the laws of our country. In fact, Senator Frist's bill and \nthe bill I support--the one that came from the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, supported by Senator Specter, the chairman of the committee, \ninspired by Senators McCain and Kennedy in major part--is a bill which \nalso focuses on enforcement.\n  Both bills double the size of the Border Patrol by adding 12,000 new \nagents. Both bills strengthen interior enforcement of immigration laws \nby adding 5,000 new immigration investigators. Both bills would take \nadvantage of new technology to create a ``virtual fence'' at the \nborder. Both bills would improve border controls by expanding entry-\nexit tracking. Both bills require the construction of new vehicle \nbarriers and new permanent highway checkpoints near the border. The \nlist goes on and on. The bills are the same when it comes to \nenforcement at our broken borders, as it should be.\n  But what the Frist bill does beyond that is what is clearly \nunacceptable, from my point of view, and was unacceptable in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. The Frist bill continues the provision that was \nstarted in the House of Representatives which criminalizes those who \nare here in undocumented status and those who help them. That is where \nthis bill, the Frist bill, crosses the line. That is why it is \nunacceptable. This concept was rejected in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and should be rejected on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  Think about it for a moment. Are we serious that we are going to \ncharge 12 million people with the crime that Senator Frist would create \nin his provision? Are we saying to people who are here in the United \nStates under a myriad of different circumstances that they are going to \nbe treated as criminals amongst us?\n  To what end? To arrest them, to apprehend them, to prosecute them, to \nincarcerate them? Of course, we can't do that. With 12 million people, \nit can't be done.\n  But by branding them as criminals at the outset, it is a guarantee \nthey will never come out of the shadows. They will stay lurking as part \nof our culture, part of our economy in illegal status indefinitely. \nCriminalizing them is not the answer.\n  Sadly, the bill goes even further. In the instance of undocumented \npeople amongst us, it would subject them to a misdemeanor subject to 6 \nmonths in jail, but it goes much further for the Good Samaritans who \nassist them. That is the most outrageous element of the Frist bill. It \nis harsh. It is not American.\n  Consider this for a moment. If a priest counsels a mother that she \nshould remain in the United States with her children who happen to have \nbeen born here and are American citizens, that priest can be found \nguilty of an aggravated felony for having counseled her to stay in the \nUnited States. In the city of Chicago, which I am proud to represent, \nwe have a domestic violence shelter, Mujeres Latinas en Accion. It is \nin a section known as Little Village. It is primarily a Mexican section \nof our city. Some are citizens; some are not. This domestic violence \nshelter brings in battered mothers and their children to protect them \nfrom their abusive, drunken husbands while they call the police \ndepartment. The social workers who are standing at the door protecting \nthose mothers and children would be subject to being charged with a \nfelony under the Frist provisions. A nurse who offers to a mother at a \nmedical clinic the advice that she should bring her child back, without \nchecking to make certain she is not undocumented, could be charged with \na felony. Is that where we are headed? Is that the kind of America we \nwant to live in? I don't think so.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee rejected that. Why Senator Frist \ncontinues to offer it, I don't know. I don't think it is consistent \nwith the goal we all share. The goal we share is in repairing the \nsystem, better enforcement at the borders, better enforcement when it \ncomes to employment so we will know if employers are exploiting the \nundocumented. That is part of real enforcement that will lead to \nfairness and justice in the way we deal with immigration.\n  There's another problem with the majority leader's bill. It would do \nnothing to address the situation of 12 million undocumented immigrants \nwho currently live in our country. We need tougher enforcement, but in \nthe Judiciary Committee bill we acknowledge something that the majority \nleader's bill does not: A strategy that focuses on enforcement only is \ndoomed to failure.\n  Beyond that, the McCain-Kennedy bill, which is an inspired piece of \nlegislation, would offer a chance for immigrants who work hard and play \nby the rules to earn their way to citizenship over the course of many \nyears. This is not an amnesty. Amnesty says we forgive you. The McCain-\nKennedy bill does not say that. The McCain-Kennedy bill says: If you \nare here undocumented for a variety of reasons, if you are here without \nlegal status, there is a path you can follow. It is a long path, a \ndemanding path, but at the end, you could end up in a legal position or \nhave a chance. That is the best approach for us to use.\n  Let me tell you exactly what the McCain-Kennedy provisions would \nrequire in this path to legalization. It is not a free ride. It is not \na get-out-of-jail-free card. Let me tell you what you would have to do \nduring the course of an 11-year commitment on your part to finally \nreach citizenship: a clean criminal record, employment since before \nJanuary 2004, remaining continuously employed during this period, \npaying approximately $2,000 in fines and fees, passing a security \nbackground check, passing a medical examination, learning English, \nlearning U.S. history and government, and paying all back taxes. If you \nhave complied with all of those requirements, you will go to the back \nof the line behind all applicants currently waiting for green cards. \nThat is not an amnesty; that is a demanding process which will test the \nundocumented as to whether they really want to be part of America on a \nlegal and permanent basis.\n  All of us understand--those of us who are the sons and daughters of \nimmigrants--that the people who come to these shores bring a special \nquality. David Brooks of the New York Times has an article which I ask \nunanimous consent to print in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Immigrants To Be Proud of\n\n                           (By David Brooks)\n\n       Everybody says the Republicans are split on immigration. \n     The law-and-order types want to close the border. The free-\n     market types want plentiful labor. But today I want to talk \n     to the social conservatives, because it's you folks who are \n     really going to swing this debate.\n       I'd like to get you to believe what Senator Sam Brownback \n     of Kansas believes: that a balanced immigration bill is \n     consistent with conservative values. I'd like to try to \n     persuade the evangelical leaders in the tall grass to stop \n     hiding on this issue.\n       My first argument is that the exclusionists are wrong when \n     they say the current wave of immigration is tearing our \n     social fabric. The facts show that the recent rise in \n     immigration hasn't been accompanied by social breakdown, but \n     by social repair. As immigration has surged, violent crime \n     has fallen by 57 percent. Teen pregnancies and abortion rates \n     have declined by a third. Teenagers are having fewer sexual \n     partners and losing their virginity later. Teen suicide rates \n     have dropped. The divorce rate for young people is on the way \n     down.\n       Over the past decade we've seen the beginnings of a moral \n     revival, and some of the most important work has been done by \n     Catholic and evangelical immigrant churches, by faith-based \n     organizations like the Rev. Luis Cortes's Nueva Esperanza, by \n     Hispanic mothers and fathers monitoring their kids. The anti-\n     immigration crowd says this country is under assault. But if \n     that's so, we're under assault by people who love their \n     children.\n\n[[Page S2560]]\n\n       My second argument is that the immigrants themselves are \n     like a booster shot of traditional morality injected into the \n     body politic. Immigrants work hard. They build community \n     groups. They have traditional ideas about family structure, \n     and they work heroically to make them a reality.\n       This is evident in everything from divorce rates (which are \n     low, given immigrants' socioeconomic status) to their \n     fertility rates (which are high) and even the way they shop.\n       Hispanics and Hispanic immigrants have less money than \n     average Americans, but they spend what they have on their \n     families, usually in wholesome ways. According to Simmons \n     Research, Hispanics are 57 percent more likely than average \n     Americans to have purchased children's furniture in the past \n     year. Mexican-Americans spend 93 percent more on children's \n     music.\n       According to the government's Consumer Expenditure Survey, \n     Hispanics spend more on gifts, on average, than other \n     Americans. They're more likely to support their parents \n     financially. They're more likely to have big family dinners \n     at home.\n       This isn't alien behavior. It's admirable behavior, the \n     antidote to the excessive individualism that social \n     conservatives decry.\n       My third argument is that good values lead to success, and \n     that immigrants' long-term contributions more than compensate \n     for the short-term strains they cause. There's no use denying \n     the strains immigration imposes on schools, hospitals and \n     wage levels in some markets (but economists are sharply \n     divided on this).\n       So over the long haul, today's immigrants succeed. By the \n     second generation, most immigrant families are middle class \n     and paying taxes that more than make up for the costs of the \n     first generation. By the third generation, 90 percent speak \n     English fluently and 50 percent marry non-Latinos.\n       My fourth argument is that government should be at least as \n     virtuous as the immigrants themselves. Right now (as under \n     Bill Frist's legislation), government pushes immigrants into \n     a chaotic underground world. The Judiciary Committee's bill, \n     which Senator Brownback supports, would tighten the borders; \n     but it would also reward virtue. Immigrants who worked hard, \n     paid fines, paid their taxes, stayed out of trouble and \n     waited their turn would have a chance to become citizens. \n     This isn't government enabling vice; it's government at its \n     best, encouraging middle-class morality.\n       Social conservatives, let me ask you to consider one final \n     thing. Women who have recently arrived from Mexico have \n     bigger, healthier babies than more affluent non-Hispanic \n     white natives. That's because strong family and social \n     networks support these pregnant women, reminding them what to \n     eat and do. But the longer they stay, and the more \n     assimilated they become, the more bad habits they acquire and \n     the more problems their subsequent babies have.\n       Please ask yourself this: As we contemplate America's moral \n     fiber, do the real threats come from immigrants, or are some \n     people merely blaming them for sins that are already here?\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. Brooks' message was addressed primarily to \nRepublicans and conservatives, but he spells out for all who read it \nwhat these immigrant people bring to America. My mother came to these \nshores in 1911 at the age of 2. Her mother, my grandmother, brought her \nfrom Lithuania with her brother and sister. They made to it East St. \nLouis, IL, where my grandfather worked in a steel mill. My mom dropped \nout of school after the eighth grade, which was not unusual in her \ntime, got married, and a few years later became a naturalized citizen. \nHer son is now the 47th Senator from the State of Illinois. Those \nstories can be told over and over.\n  Think of the courage of the people who came here, starting with my \nfamily and others, the courage to leave behind your village, your \nchurch, your language, your relatives, your friends, to come to a \ncountry you have never seen before with a language you didn't speak to \ntry to make a better life. So many of us are so blessed to be here from \nthe start, but others fight night and day for the chance to come. They \ndon't just bring another body to be counted; they bring a spirit. It is \na spirit of hard work and determination, creativity, entrepreneurship. \nIt is a spirit of family values that we should treasure. Mr. Brooks \nsays as much in his article.\n  This is a positive force in the development of America, and it always \nhas been. We should look at this as a positive opportunity for America \nto be a stronger nation, a nation that grows in the right direction \nwith the right people and the right values.\n  The Frist bill is the wrong approach. Criminalizing those who are \nhere, charging those who help them with felonies for simply providing \nhumanitarian assistance is wrong. It is far better for us to take the \nmore constructive and comprehensive approach of the Specter bill that \nwas reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, with the \nagreement of the Senator from Massachusetts, to use his time and an \nadditional 5 minutes, if necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. First, I thank my friend from Massachusetts for allowing \nme this time. Working with him on this issue has been an experience \nthat I believe will result in benefit to the country. I appreciate the \neffort we have made together.\n  As we know, the Senate is beginning debate on a very important and \ncomplex subject that is among the most difficult and divisive we face. \nOur Nation's immigration system is broken. Without comprehensive \nimmigration reform, our Nation's security will remain vulnerable. That \nis why we must act.\n  I begin by commending Chairman Specter and the members of the \nJudiciary Committee for the considerable effort they have taken to \nreport a comprehensive immigration reform measure that could be \nconsidered during this debate. While I am not in agreement with each \nand every provision, it is a great starting point for the debate.\n  Those of us from border States witness every day the impact illegal \nimmigration is having on our friends and neighbors, our county and city \nservices, our economy, and our environment. We deal with the \ndegradation of our lands and the demands imposed on our hospitals and \nother public resources. Our current system doesn't protect us from \npeople who want to harm us. It doesn't meet the needs of our economy. \nIt leaves too many people vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.\n  Throughout this debate, we will be reminded that immigration is a \nnational security issue, and it is. It is also a matter of life and \ndeath for many living along the border. We have hundreds of people \nflowing across our borders every day, an estimated 11 million to 12 \nmillion people living in the shadows in every State in our country. \nWhile we believe the majority are hard-working people contributing to \nour economy and society, we can also assume there are some people who \nwant to do us harm hiding among the millions who have come here only in \nsearch of better lives for themselves and their families. We need new \npolicies that will allow us to concentrate our resources on finding \nthose who have come here for purposes more dangerous than finding a \njob.\n  Last year, when Senators Kennedy, Brownback, Lieberman, Graham, \nMartinez, Obama, Salazar, and I worked together to develop a sensible, \nbipartisan and comprehensive immigration reform measure, first and \nforemost among our priorities was to ensure our bill included strong \nborder security and enforcement provisions. We need to ensure that the \nDepartment of Homeland Security has the resources it needs to secure \nour borders to the greatest extent possible. These include manpower, \nvehicles, and detention facilities for those apprehended. But we also \nneed to take a 21st century approach to this 21st century problem. We \nneed to create virtual barriers as well through the use of unmanned \naerial vehicles, ground sensors, cameras, vehicle barriers, advanced \ncommunications systems, and the most up-to-date security technologies \navailable to us.\n  The border security provisions under the leader's bill and the \nJudiciary Committee's bill provide sound proposals to promote strong \nenforcement and should be part of any final bill. However, I do not \nbelieve the Senate should or will pass an enforcement-only bill. Our \nexperiences with our current immigration system have proven that \noutdated or unrealistic laws will never be fully enforceable \nregardless of every conceivable border security improvement we make. \nDespite an increase in Border Patrol agents from 3,600 to 10,000, \ndespite quintupling the Border Patrol budget, despite the employment of \nnew technologies and tactics, all to enforce current immigration laws, \nillegal immigration drastically increased during the 1990s. While \nstrengthening border security is an essential component of national \nsecurity, it must also be accompanied by immigration reforms.\n\n[[Page S2561]]\n\n  We have seen time and again that as long as there are jobs available \nin this country for people who live in poverty and hopelessness in \nother countries, these people will risk their lives to cross our \nborders no matter how formidable the barriers, and most will be \nsuccessful. Our reforms need to reflect the reality and help us \nseparate economic immigrants from security risks. We need to establish \na temporary worker program that permits workers from other countries to \nthe extent they are needed to fill jobs that would otherwise go \nunfilled.\n  We need workers in this country. There are certain jobs Americans are \nsimply not willing to do. For example, today in California and Arizona, \nfood is rotting on the vine and lettuce is dying in the fields because \nfarmers can't find workers to harvest their crops. At the same time, \nresorts in my own State of Arizona cannot open to capacity because \nthere are not enough workers to clean the rooms. Restaurants are \nlocking their doors because there is no one to serve the food or clear \nthe dishes. We are facing a situation whereby the U.S. population does \nnot provide the workers businesses desperately need, yet the demand for \ntheir services and products continues. The current immigration system \ndoes not adequately and lawfully address this problem. As long as this \nsituation exists without a legal path for essential workers to enter \nthe country, we will have desperate people illegally crossing our \nborders and living in the shadows of our towns, cities, and rural \ncommunities. That is not acceptable, particularly when we are fighting \na war on terror.\n  The vast majority of individuals attempting to cross our borders do \nnot intend to harm our country. They are coming to meet our demand for \nlabor and earn money to feed their families. By the Border Patrol's own \nestimates, 99 percent of those apprehended coming across the border are \ndoing so for work. However, the Border Patrol is overwhelmed by these \nindividuals. They cannot possibly apprehend every crosser being \nsmuggled in, no matter how many resources we provide. That is why any \nimmigration legislation that passes Congress must establish a legal \nchannel for workers to enter the United States after they have passed \nbackground checks and have secured employment. Then we can free up \nFederal officials to focus on those individuals intending to do harm \nthrough drug smuggling, human trafficking, and terrorism.\n  In addition to a temporary worker program for future immigrants, we \nhave to address the fact that 11 to 12 million people are living in the \nUnited States illegally, most of them employed, many whose children \nwere born here and are, therefore, American citizens. Our economy has \ncome to depend on people whose existence in our country is furtive, \nwhose whereabouts and activities in many cases are unknown.\n  I have listened to and understand the concerns of those who simply \nadvocate sealing our borders and rounding up and deporting undocumented \nworkers currently in residence here.\n  Easier said than done. I have yet to hear a single proponent of this \npoint of view offer one realistic proposal for locating, apprehending, \nand returning to their countries of origin over 11 million people. How \ndo we do that? The columnist George Will quite accurately observed that \nit would take 200,000 buses extending along a 1,700 mile long line to \ndeport 11 million people. That's assuming we had the resources to \nlocate and apprehend all 11 million, or even half that number, which we \ndon't have and, we all know, won't ever have. And even if we could \nexponentially increase the money and manpower dedicated to finding and \narresting undocumented workers in this country, and inventing some \ndeportation scheme on a scale that exceeds all reality, we would, by \nremoving these people from their jobs, damage the American economy.\n  Instead, what we have allowed to be in effect is a de facto amnesty, \nwhere, for all practical purposes, a permanent underclass of people \nlive within our borders illegally, fearfully, subserviently, vulnerable \nto abuse and exploitation. Most of these people aren't going anywhere. \nNo matter how much we improve border security. No matter the penalties \nwe impose on their employers. No matter how seriously they are \nthreatened with punishment. We won't find most of them. We won't find \nmost of their employers. There are jobs here that Americans aren't \naccepting, that people in other countries who have no future there will \neagerly accept. They will find their way to those jobs, and employers \nwho can't fill them any other way will employ them.\n  And what of those we do apprehend? Do they have children who were \nborn here? What shall we do with these Americans--and they are \nAmericans by virtue of their birth here--when we deport their parents? \nShall we build a lot of new orphanages? Find adoptive parents for them? \nDeny their citizenship and ship them back, too? No, Mr. President, \nwe'll do none of these things. We'll simply continue our de facto \namnesty program. Because we all know, we aren't going to find and \ndeport so many millions and suffer the dislocation and agonizing moral \ndilemmas that such an impossible task would engender. So let's be \nhonest about that, shall we?\n  The opponents of our attempt to address undocumented workers in this \ncountry decry as amnesty our proposal to bring them out from their \nshadows and into compliance with our laws amnesty. No, Mr. President, \nit is not. Amnesty is, as I observed, for all practical purposes what \nexists today. We can pretend otherwise, but that doesn't make it so. \nAmnesty is simply declaring people who entered the country illegally \ncitizens of the United States, and imposing no other requirements on \nthem. That is not what we do, Mr. President.\n  Under the provisions of our legislation, undocumented workers will \nhave incentives to declare their existence and comply with our laws. \nThey may apply for a worker visa. They would be subjected to background \nchecks. They must pay a substantial fine, pay their back taxes, learn \nEnglish, and enroll in civic education, remain employed here for six \nyears, and then, at the end of those six years, go to the back of the \nline to apply for legal permanent resident (LPR) status. I believe most \nundocumented workers will accept these requirements in order to escape \nthe fear, uncertainty and vulnerability to exploitation they currently \nendure. And while those who have come here to do us harm won't come out \nof hiding to accept these conditions, we will at least be spared the \nHerculean task of finding and sorting through millions of people who \ncame here simply to earn a living.\n  What are our opponent's alternatives? Raid and shutter businesses in \nevery city and state in the country? Clog our courts with millions of \nimmigration cases? Offer illegal immigrants the not too appealing \nopportunity to ``report to deport?'' We propose a better solution that \nis consistent with our country's tradition of being a nation of laws \nand a nation of immigrants.\n\n  Mr. President, we are aware of the burdens illegal immigrants impose \non our cities and counties and States. Those burdens, which are a \nFederal responsibility, must be addressed. And we need also to face \nhonestly the moral consequences of our current failed immigration \nsystem.\n  As I mentioned previously, immigration reform is a matter of life and \ndeath for some. At this moment, someone may be dying in the Arizona \ndesert. According to border patrol statistics, 330 people died in \nfiscal year 2004, and that figure increased by 43 percent--to 472 \ndeaths--in 2005. As temperatures in the deserts get higher and the \ndesperation more tangible, we can only expect the death tolls to \nincrease further this fiscal year.\n  In October of 2003, the Arizona Republic ran a story entitled ``205 \nMigrants Die Hard, Lonely Deaths.'' I would like to read an excerpt \nfrom that story:\n\n       [In 2003] the bodies of 205 undocumented immigrants were \n     found in Arizona. Official notations of their deaths are \n     sketchy, contained in hundreds of pages of government \n     reports.\n       Beyond the official facts, there are sometimes little \n     details, glimpses, of the people who died.\n       Maria Hernandez Perez was No. 93. She was almost 2. She had \n     thick brown hair and eyes the color of chocolate.\n       Kelia Velazquez-Gonzalez, 16, carried a Bible in her \n     backpack. She was No. 109.\n       In some cases, stories of heroism or loyalty or love \n     survive.\n       Like the Border Patrol agent who performed cardiopulmonary \n     resuscitation on a dead man, hoping for a miracle. Or the \n     group\n\n[[Page S2562]]\n\n     of migrants who, with law officers and paramedics, helped \n     carry their dead companion out of the desert. Or the husband \n     who sat with his dead wife through the night.\n       Other stories are almost entirely lost in the desolate \n     stretches that separate the United States and Mexico.\n       Within weeks, the heat makes mummies out of men. Animals \n     carry off their bones and belongings. Many say their last \n     words to an empty sky.\n       John Doe, No. 143, died with a rosary encircling his neck. \n     His eyes were wide open.\n\n  I am hopeful that at the end of this debate in the weeks ahead, we \ncan show the American people that we addressed a serious and urgent \nproblem with sound judgment, honesty, common sense and compassion.\n  There are over 11 million people in this country illegally. They \nharvest our crops, tend our gardens, work in our restaurants, care for \nour children, clean our homes. They came as others before them came, to \ngrasp the lowest rung of the American ladder of opportunity, to work \nthe jobs others won't, and by virtue of their own industry and desire, \nto rise and build better lives for their families and a better America. \nThat is our history, Mr. President. We are not a tribe. We are not an \nethnic conclave. We are a Nation of immigrants, and that distinction \nhas been essential to our greatness.\n  Yes, in this post 9/11 era, America must enforce its borders. There \nare people who wish to come here to do us harm, and we must vigilantly \nguard against them, spend whatever it takes, devote as much manpower to \nthe task as necessary. But we must also find some way to separate those \nwho have come here for the same reasons every immigrant has come here \nfrom those who are driven here by their hate for us and our ideals. We \nmust concentrate our resources on the latter and persuade the former to \ncome out from the shadows. We won't be able to persuade them if all we \noffer is a guarded escort back to the place of hopelessness and \ninjustice that they had fled.\n  Why not say to those undocumented workers who are working the jobs \nthat the rest of us refuse, come out from the shadows, earn your \ncitizenship in this country? You broke the law to come here, so you \nmust go to the back of the line, pay a fine, stay employed, learn our \nlanguage, pay your taxes, obey our laws, and earn the right to be an \nAmerican. Riayen Tejada immigrated to New York from the Dominican \nRepublic. He came with two dreams, he said, to become an American \ncitizen and to serve in the United States Marine Corps. He willingly \naccepted the obligations of American citizenship before he possessed \nall the rights of an American. Staff Sergeant Tejada, from Washington \nHeights by way of the Dominican Republic, the father of two young \ndaughters, died in an ambush in Baghdad on May 14, 2004. He had never \nfulfilled his first dream to become a naturalized American citizen. But \nhe loved this country so much that he gave his life to defend her. \nRight now, at this very moment, there are fighting for us in Iraq and \nAfghanistan soldiers who are not yet American citizens but who have \ndreamed that dream, and have risked their lives to defend it. They \nshould make us proud, not selfish, to be Americans.\n  They came to grasp the lowest rung of the ladder, and they intend to \nrise. Let them rise. Let them rise. Let us take care to protect our \ncountry from harm, but let us not mistake the strengths of our \ngreatness for weaknesses. We are blessed, bountiful, beautiful \nAmerica--the land of hope and opportunity--the land of the immigrant's \ndreams. Long may she remain so.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3192\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, yesterday Senator Frist spoke about his \nbill and I spoke about the committee bill. We said that today, after \nthere had been speeches, at approximately noon, I would propose an \namendment that would be the committee bill.\n  I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3192.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as noted, this amendment will put before \nthe Senate the bill which was passed out of the Judiciary Committee on \nMonday. There is one modification. There is a title which remains as to \njudicial review, and for procedural purposes, we have left the title in \nas to judicial review. But it is my intention to modify that, depending \nupon what the hearing discloses on Monday.\n  As is known, we worked under considerable time pressure. The leader \nwanted a bill reported out on Monday. People came back from recess \nearly, and people were in town on Sunday night so we could start Monday \nmorning, which we did at 10 o'clock, and worked through until 1 p.m., \nand then from 2 p.m. until past 6 p.m.\n  The section on judicial review was not subject to debate because the \nchairman's mark had a consolidation of the Federal circuit. We had \nconsiderable debate about that, so we have scheduled a hearing for \nMonday where we will take up those issues. Then in the course of floor \ndebate next week, we will modify that section, depending upon what we \nhear and what we decide to do.\n  Mr. President, I ask that Senator Leahy, the distinguished ranking \nmember, be listed as the original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the schedule, as agreed to, will call for \ncontinued debate. The majority leader, Senator Frist, will have an \namendment to offer involving the subject of deaths at the border. It is \nanticipated that there will be a 3 o'clock vote on the Frist amendment \nand that there will be an allocation and scheduling of time for debate \nuntil 5 o'clock.\n  Yesterday I urged Senators to file their amendments, to make them \nknown to the ranking member, Senator Leahy, and myself, so we could \nschedule debate. We have a prodigious task ahead of us. We are \nscheduled for a 2-week recess beginning at the close of business a week \nfrom tomorrow. It is going to be a daunting task to finish this bill on \nthat schedule, but we have undertaken daunting tasks before and \nsucceeded. That can be done only if we have cooperation from Members.\n  I ask Members who have amendments to consider at the outset time \nagreements so we can move ahead. I give notice to my colleagues that in \norder to complete this business, we are going to have to hold the \nvoting time to 15 minutes, plus the 5-minute leeway, but we are not \ngoing to allow the votes to run 25 minutes, 30 minutes, 21 minutes. We \nare going to move ahead under the rules of the Senate.\n  As I say, it is a prodigious job to get finished by next Thursday \nnight or on Friday. The temper of the Senate is to try to finish on a \nThursday late before a recess, but to do that we are going to have to \nhave a lot of cooperation to avoid a Friday session or, depending on \nthe will of the leader, a session beyond Friday into the weekend, if \nnecessary, to complete this bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I understand the majority leader may be \ncoming soon and, if he does, I will suspend my remarks so he may be \nrecognized and hope that after he is recognized, I can continue with my \nremarks.\n  This week, the Senate begins an overdue reform of our immigration \nlaws. The Chair has been in the middle of that and is making \ncontributions to it. Because nearly 10,000 illegal aliens cross the \nUnited States border every day, more than 3 million a year, we\n\n[[Page S2563]]\n\nshould start--start--with border security. But then, once we secure the \nborder and can uphold our limits on immigration, we should get quickly \nback to the American tradition of creating a legal status for those \nwhom we welcome to temporarily work and study in the United States and \nwho, by doing so, enrich our diversity and spur our economy. But my \npurpose today is to make sure we don't stop there, that we don't \noverlook, as Paul Harvey might say, ``the rest of the story,'' the rest \nof the immigration story; that is, helping prospective citizens who are \nlegally here become Americans.\n  Joined by Senators Cornyn, Isakson, Cochran, Santorum, Frist, and \nMcConnell, I have introduced S. 1815, the Strengthening American \nCitizenship Act that is indispensable to any comprehensive immigration \nbill. This legislation I plan to offer as an amendment at the \nappropriate time during this debate would help legal immigrants who are \nembarked on a path toward citizenship to learn our common language, to \nlearn our history, and to learn our way of government by the following \nsteps:\n  No. 1, providing them with $500 grants for English courses; No. 2, \nallowing those who become fluent in English to apply for citizenship 1 \nyear early; that is, after 4 years instead of 5; next, providing grants \nto organizations to offer courses in American history and civics; next, \nauthorizing a new foundation to assist in these efforts; next, \ncodifying the oath of allegiance, which new citizens swear when they \nare naturalized. It is an oath of allegiance that is very much like the \noath of allegiance George Washington and his officers took at Valley \nForge in 1778, about which I am going to have more to say.\n  In addition, our amendment would ask the Homeland Security \nDepartment, working with the National Archivist and others in our \nGovernment, to carry out a strategy to highlight the ceremonies, such \nas the one the President attended this week, in which immigrants become \nAmerican citizens; finally, our amendment would establish an award to \nrecognize the contribution of outstanding new American citizens.\n  Harvard political scientist Samuel Huntington has written that most \nof our politics is about conflicts among principles that unite us as a \ncountry. More than any other subject we might discuss, this immigration \ndebate will involve the basic principles of what it means to become an \nAmerican. That is why we begin the debate with border security, not \nbecause we are pro-immigrant or anti-immigrant. That is not what we are \ntalking about. We begin the debate with border security because as \nAmericans we believe in the principle of the rule of law.\n  It is hypocritical for us in the United States of America to preach \nto the world about the rule of law, yet thumb our nose at the 12 \nmillion people who live here illegally. It is hypocritical and it is \ndangerous to our security not to control our own borders.\n  There is no apology to be made for us as Americans insisting on the \nprinciple of the rule of law, just as there should be no other \nhesitancy about other principles, such as welcoming those who \ntemporarily work here and study here. So the principle of the rule of \nlaw is not the only principle that is at stake in this debate. We \ncreate a legal status for those from other countries whom we welcome to \ntemporarily study and work here because of the principle, first, of \nequal opportunity, because we are a nation of immigrants; that is a \npart of our character, and because we founded our economy upon the \nprinciple of laissez faire. In other words, we are a free market \neconomy.\n  So there are three more principles we need to throw into the mix \nalong with the rule of law: equal opportunity, a nation of immigrants, \nlaissez faire.\n  We may be outsourcing jobs, but for years we have won our wars and \nbuilt our economy by ``insourcing'' brain power. Wernher von Braun and \nhis colleagues from Germany helped us in the space race against the \nSoviets. Sixty percent of the American winners of Nobel Prizes in \nphysics are immigrants or children of immigrants. Sixty percent of the \npostdoctoral students at our universities in America are foreign \nstudents. There are 572,000 foreign students studying at colleges and \nuniversities in the United States. While they are here, these students \nand researchers from other countries help create a higher standard of \nliving for us Americans, and when they go home they export our values \nbetter than any foreign aid ever has.\n\n  In addition, many of the workers our economy needs to grow come from \nneighboring countries. I asked my staff to see if I could get an \nestimate of how many visas we have on the books today for workers \ncoming to the United States from other countries. As best we can tell, \nwe have about 500,000 visas of different forms that may be issued each \nyear, of one kind or another, to unskilled and skilled people who come \nto our country. Add that to the 572,000 foreign students who study in \nour country and we have today a large number of people from other parts \nof the world who are here, enriching our country and improving our \nstandard of living.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this list of visas for workers coming to \nthe United States from other countries each year be printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, these temporary students and workers \nhave helped us create an economy that last year produced 30 percent of \nthe world's wealth for us Americans alone, who constitute just 5 \npercent of the world's population. It makes no sense for us to have an \nimmigration system that makes it easy for unskilled workers to come \nhere illegally and harder for the brightest people to come here \nlegally. That is why it is my hope this comprehensive immigration bill \nwe are considering will have in it the ideas that would make it easier, \nmodestly easier, for a larger number of highly skilled people to come \nhere and help us create better jobs.\n  For example, there are two recommendations that were made in the \ndocument called ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' by the National \nAcademy of Sciences panel, headed by Norm Augustine. This was a set of \n20 recommendations that was made to us in Congress by this \ndistinguished panel last summer in answer to our question: What should \nwe do to keep our advantage in science and technology so that our good-\npaying jobs don't go to India and China?\n  They told us 20 things to do. Two of the things to do had to do with \nmaking it easier for the most intelligent people in the world to work \nand study and do research here. One of the ideas would be to give a \ngreen card, a permanent residency card, to any student from overseas \nwho earns a doctorate in mathematics, engineering, technology, or the \nphysical sciences. Those persons could stay here and help improve our \nstandard of living.\n  For example, at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, the \nlargest science laboratory in the United States of America, the \ndirector, the assistant director, and the head of our United States \neffort to recapture the lead in supercomputing in the world--those jobs \nare all filled by people from other countries who have green cards, who \nare here helping us improve our standard of living. So we are glad they \nare here, and we should make it easier for such people to come.\n  Craig Barrett, the head of Intel, estimates if we were to adopt this \nprovision, that would mean perhaps 12,000 to 15,000 additional doctoral \nstudents in math, engineering, technology, or physical sciences, once \nthey earn their degree, can stay in the United States.\n  The other provision was at one point in the Judiciary Committee mark. \nIt may still be there. But it takes the cap off some categories of \nhighly advanced people who have earned an advanced degree in science, \ntechnology, engineering, and math. It is simply in our own interest to \ndo that. It continues a long tradition and is one more example of why \nwe already have a tradition of welcoming workers and students who \ntemporarily work here.\n  So we have at least four principles at play that I have talked about: \nThe rule of law, equal opportunity, laissez faire, and we have the \ncharacteristic of our country being a nation of immigrants. But there \nis another principle that I believe is the single most important \nprinciple we have in this debate and it is the one that is engraved \nabove the chair of the Presiding Officer. It is the motto of this \ncountry: E pluribus\n\n[[Page S2564]]\n\nunum. Our work will not be complete until we help prospective citizens \nbecome Americans because our country's greatest accomplishment is based \nupon that principle. That is, we have united people from many different \nbackgrounds into one nation based upon the belief in a few ideas, \nrather than upon race, ancestry, or background.\n  Of all the principles we will be debating in these next 2 weeks, none \nis more important than that one chosen as our national motto, the one \ncarved in stone above the desk, E pluribus unum: one from many.\n  We are not here dividing sides up on who is pro-immigrant and who is \nanti-immigrant. We are here saying we have 5 important principles we \nall believe in that unite us as Americans, from rule of law to equal \nopportunity to E pluribus unum. We are trying to put those together in \na sensible way. That is what our politics is about. That is most of \nwhat we do in the Senate and that is what the people expect us to do \ntoday. Each year we welcome about 1 million permanent new legal \nresidents, many of whom go on to become citizens. I am now talking \nabout people who are legally in the United States of America.\n  To become an American is a significant accomplishment. First, you \nmust live in the United States as a legal permanent resident for 5 \nyears. Next, you must learn to speak English, our common language. \nNext, you must learn about our history and Government. Since we are \nunited by ideas rather than the color of our skin, one has to learn \nthese ideas to become a citizen. Next, you must swear an oath and \nrenounce the government of the country from which you came and then \nswear allegiance to the United States of America.\n  Those are pretty strong words--renounce the government of the country \nfrom which you came and swear allegiance to the country to which you \nare going. Where does that come from? This is where it comes from. This \noath dates back to May 12, 1778, when General George Washington and the \ngeneral officers at Valley Forge signed an oath very similar to the one \ntaken by the 30 citizens the President swore in on Monday, the oath \nthat more than 500,000 new American citizens took last year in hundreds \nof naturalization ceremonies all over America.\n\n  Here is a portion of the oath Washington and his general officers \nswore:\n\n       I, George Washington, Commander in Chief of the armies of \n     the United States of America, do acknowledge the United \n     States of America to be Free, Independent, and Sovereign \n     states, and declare that the people thereof owe no allegiance \n     or obedience to George the Third, King of Great-Britain; and \n     I renounce, refuse and abjure any allegiance or obedience to \n     him; and I do swear that I will to the utmost of my power, \n     support, maintain and defend the said United States of \n     America. . . .\n\n  Those were remarkable words then. Those were remarkable words on \nMonday, when those 30 new citizens stood up and said the same thing.\n  The language in the oath immigrants take today comes from that oath \nin 1778. It says in effect: I may be proud of where I come from, but I \nam prouder of where I am. In both the last session of Congress and in \nthis session, Senator Schumer and I introduced legislation, S. 1087, to \nput the wording of the oath of allegiance derived from this into law, \ngiving it the same dignity as the Star Spangled Banner and the Pledge \nof Allegiance.\n  Becoming an American is also a unique experience because it has \nnothing to do with ancestry. America is an idea, not a race. We are \nunited by principles expressed in our founding documents, the very \nprinciples we are debating in this immigration legislation, not by our \nmultiple ancestries.\n  Americans enjoy more rights than the citizens of any nation on the \nface of the Earth and our Founders recognized, as every citizen and \nprospective citizen must, that along with those rights come \nresponsibilities. The new citizens, like those who came before, must \nappreciate this simple but fundamental truth: In a free society, \nfreedom and responsibility go hand in hand.\n  Some have suggested our diversity is what makes our country great.\n  To be sure, diversity is one of our great strengths, but diversity is \nnot our greatest strength. Jerusalem is diverse. The Balkans are \ndiverse. Iraq is diverse. The greatest accomplishment of the United \nStates of America is that we have molded that magnificent diversity \ninto one nation, based upon a set of common principles, language, and \ntraditions.\n  That is why the words above the desk of the Presiding Officer say one \nfrom many, not many from one. And that is why a comprehensive \nimmigration bill is not complete unless we help prospective citizens \nwho are legally here become Americans.\n  We could look to Great Britain and France to remind us of how \nfortunate we are to have had two centuries of practice helping new \ncitizens become Americans. Last August, when he announced a number of \nmeasures regarding British citizenship, Prime Minister Tony Blair said:\n\n       People who want to be British citizens should share our \n     values and our way of life.\n\n  These new rules were spurred by the terrorist attack in London in \nwhich four young men, three of whom were the British-born children of \nPakistani immigrants, bombed the London subway system.\n  France is facing a similar period of self-examination on integrating \nimmigrants and the children of immigrants following violent civil \nunrest this last November.\n  According to the French Ambassador:\n\n       These teenagers feel alienated and discriminated against \n     both socially and economically. They don't want to assert \n     their difference. They want to be considered 100 percent \n     French.\n\n  It is hard to imagine becoming French or becoming British or becoming \nJapanese or Chinese or German, for that matter. On the other hand, to \nbe a citizen of this country, one must become an American. We should be \nwise enough to take a lesson from the difficulties of our friends \noverseas and redouble our effort to help new citizens become Americans. \nThis is, of course, one more reason to control our borders--so that we \nknow who is coming from other countries and can help those who legally \nchoose to stay here to become Americans.\n  We Americans have always understood that perhaps the most important \nlimit on how many new citizens our country can successfully absorb \ndepends upon how many can be assimilated as Americans. Robert Putnam \nhas written in the book ``Bowling Alone'' how at the beginning of the \n20th century, when America experienced an influx of foreigners about as \ngreat in terms of percentages as that of today, the Nation took \nseriously the issue of assimilation. It was during this time that civic \norganizations such as the Boy Scouts and the Girl Scouts and the Rotary \nClubs were launched. Many industries had programs that taught English \nand history to foreign workers. The most important agent of \nassimilation was the common school, what we call today the public \nschool.\n  The late Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of \nTeachers, said the public school was created largely ``to teach \nimmigrant children reading, writing, and arithmetic--and what it means \nto be an American.''\n  Yet today U.S. history is not as important a part of the school \ncurriculum as it once was. As a result, high school seniors score lower \non U.S. history than on any other subject. I have worked with Senators \nKennedy, Byrd, Reid, and a number of others to help put the teaching of \nAmerican History and civics back in its rightful place in our schools \nso our children can grow up learning what it means to be an American.\n  But while we are teaching our children more about what it means to be \nan American, we should also be stepping up efforts to help the 500,000 \nto 1 million permanent legal residents who are living legally among us \nand who will this year become American citizens.\n  During these next 2 weeks, we should enact legislation to secure our \nborders. That honors the principle of the rule of law. Then we should \ncreate a legal status for the workers and the students we welcome here \nto help increase our standard of living, as well as to support our \nvalues. That honors the principle that we are a nation of immigrants, \nthat we believe in equal opportunity, and that we believe in a free \nmarket, laissez faire. But we should not complete work on a \ncomprehensive immigration bill without remembering why we have placed \nthat three-word motto above the Presiding Officer's chair,\n\n[[Page S2565]]\n\nwithout remembering that our unity did not come without a lot of \neffort, without noticing lessons from overseas that remind us that it \nis more important today than ever to help prospective citizens become \nAmericans.\n  In the spring of 2002, 4 years ago, when Senator Fred Thompson \ndecided not to run for reelection, my job then was on the Harvard \nfaculty at the Kennedy School of Government. I was teaching a class I \ncreated there called the American Character and America's Government. \nMatt Sonnesyn, who is my senior policy adviser today, was my course \nassistant at the time.\n  In that course, we looked at the kinds of issues that Senators might \ndeal with. I had no idea at the time that I might be a Senator. We \ntried to identify the principles that each of the problems raised. In \nother words, we recognized that since we are a nation united by \nprinciples, we wanted to be able to understand the principles and have \na principled discussion when we got issues like school choice or \nsupport for faith-based institutions.\n  Perhaps the issue that created the most discussion in our class that \nsemester was a question that was presented in this way: Should illegal \nimmigrants in the State of Illinois have State driver's licenses?\n  The President of Mexico, Vicente Fox, had come to Chicago and asked \nthe Illinois legislature to do that.\n  If one of my students had stood up and said: I have a pro-immigrant \nor an anti-immigrant solution to this problem, that student would \nprobably have earned an F because I asked them to identify the \nprinciples that this issue raised. This was a typical university class \nof pretty smart students in an area where more of the students are to \nthe left, I would say. There were several refugees from the recent \nClinton administration, there were some international students, and \nthere were students from all over our country of many races and \nbackgrounds.\n  But the first issue this class raised when considering the question \nof driver's licenses for illegal immigrants in Illinois was the \nprinciple of the rule of law. Then we went right through the other \nprinciples that I have just discussed today. And a little bit to my \nsurprise, this class came down very hard on the idea that, of all the \nprinciples considered, the principle of rule of law required no \ndriver's licenses for people not legally here.\n\n  They came to that conclusion quickly. But they also came quickly to \nthe conclusion that in a country that always values equal opportunity, \nlaissez faire, and a nation of immigrants, that we should have clear \nrules for welcoming people who are temporarily working here and \ntemporarily studying here, that there should be generous allotments for \nthat, that it was in our interest. They also spent a lot of time \ntalking about those three words above the Presiding Officer's chair, \nabout how can we help all those who were here legally to learn what it \nis to be an American.\n  I was very impressed with the way our class 4 years ago at that \nuniversity dealt with the issue of immigration. It had a similar \nproblem to the one we are facing. They considered all the principles. \nIt was not considered to be a pro-immigration or anti-immigration \nresult. It was a discussion about principles in which we all agree, \nwhich collide, and it was up to the students in that class to come to a \nsolution which was principled.\n  That is our job in this body. We need to let the American people know \nthat we honor each of the principles that we talk about today. We \nshould not step back one inch from honoring the principle of the rule \nof law, but we shouldn't be hesitant for one minute to welcome those \nwho work here and study here because we also honor the principle of \nequal opportunity, being a nation of immigrants and the free market \neconomy that we are.\n  I hope before we are through in these 3 weeks that we will do as the \nstudents did 4 years ago and realize that above all, when we talk about \nimmigration, about people coming to this country, that what is \ndistinctive about America, what is our greatest accomplishment, is not \nthat we can figure out a way to create laws and virtual laws to control \nour borders, not that we can come up with some mathematical number of \npeople who can work and study here, but what we have been able to do \nthat France has not done, that Great Britain has not done, that China \nand Germany have not done--no country in the world has ever done the \nway we have--is that we have taken people from all different \nbackgrounds and said we are the United States of America. And to become \nan American you believe in ideals, and it doesn't matter where you come \nfrom, what your race is, what your background is.\n  It is important that we keep that up front, that we honor our \ndiversity but more important that we can be proud of where we come from \nbut prouder where we are; that we honor the oath of allegiance that our \namendment will seek to make law, where George Washington and his \nofficers said we put aside where we came from--we may honor it, we may \nbe proud of where we may go to reunions and talk about it, but we are \nAmericans.\n  That is the most important subject for an immigration debate, and \nthis bill will not be complete without it.\n  I look forward to offering an amendment at the appropriate time that \nadds to our discussion of helping prospective citizens become \nAmericans. This would be the only country in the world in which such an \namendment would have that kind of meaning.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n        VISAS FOR WORKERS COMING TO THE UNITED STATES (PER YEAR)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n               Type of Visa                     Number per Year (cap)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n``Green Card'' or legal permanent           140,000\n residency includes exceptional, skilled,\n and unskilled workers (NOTE: a number of\n these folks originally came to the U.S.\n under H-1B or L, but then applied to\n become permanent; see below).\nH-2A (Temporary Ag Workers)...............  no cap, but averages only\n                                             30,000\nH-2B (Temporary, non-skilled, non-ag)       66,000\n landscaping, construction, etc.\nH-1B (Professional Skilled Workers).......  65,000\nL Visa (intercompany transfers) Executives  no cap, has grown to 123,000\n and employees with specialized knowledge    in 2005\n of a company's product (and their\n families).\n                                           -----------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Due to lack of applicability to the illegal population, this\n  analysis does not include more obscure temporary visa categories, such\n  as foreign diplomats, religious workers, athletes, entertainers,\n  ``treaty traders or investors,'' press, etc. All told, these\n  additional categories would total about 100,000 additional visas.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Mr. President, the Senate is now engaged in a spirited \ndebate about reforming our immigration policy. I rise today to share my \nperspectives and my priorities.\n\n[[Page S2566]]\n\n  Let's remember, though, that this is not just about immigration; it \nis about the type of country we want to be, what we stand for, and what \ntype of future we all want to build. It is easy to get caught up in the \nspecifics of one policy or another, but I encourage my colleagues to \nnot lose sight of the bigger picture. This debate touches nearly every \naspect of American life, from our economy to security, from our \nclassrooms to our workplaces.\n  I know there is a lot of pressure to do something about immigration, \nespecially in an election year, but if we do the wrong thing, it will \nhave a painful effect on millions of families, on our economy, and on \nour future for generations to come. Let's take the time to do it right. \nPerhaps the biggest mistake we could make is to think that addressing \nenforcement alone will create the changes we want to see.\n  I approach this debate with a clear understanding of what is at \nstake, frankly, with some skepticism that Congress can achieve this \ndelicate balance in a heated political environment. But I will keep \npushing for the right policies. These policies are based on my own \npersonal experiences, on people who have shared their life experiences \nwith me, and on the unique perspective Washington State provides.\n  Washington State does have a lot at stake in this debate over \nimmigration reform. I have led discussions around my State with key \nstakeholders who have experiences in areas such as border security, \nlabor needs, agriculture, education, and housing that have all helped \nform my perspective.\n\n  First of all, Washington State is a border State. We know the dangers \nof an insecure border. For years, I have fought Federal policies that \nsteered critical resources away from the northern border to the \nsouthern border. Year after year, I have fought budgets that were \nbiased against the needs at our northern border. My border communities \nhave struggled with inadequate staff, equipment, and facilities. \nTragically, it took the September 11 attacks to finally get the Federal \nGovernment to listen to what we had been saying all along: you cannot \nkeep America secure if you shortchange the northern border.\n  Since then, we have made some progress. I have worked with Chairman \nGregg and others to secure the money to triple the number of agents \nalong our northern border. I helped to fund the northern border air \nwing that is in my State to patrol our skies and to provide enforcement \nand surveillance. I should note that we still need to extend their \npatrol hours beyond just 40 hours a week.\n  We have made progress but not nearly enough. Just this week, we \nlearned that Federal investigators were able to smuggle parts for a \ndirty bomb across the northern border into Washington State. That is \nunacceptable.\n  As we have increased enforcement at the northern border, new \nchallenges have emerged. Federal agents are arresting more people for \nsmuggling and other crimes, but the Feds are just handing those \nsuspects over to local officials for holding and prosecution. As a \nresult, communities like Whatcom County on the foreign border are \nstruggling to deal with the huge new burden of Federal prosecutions. \nWhatcom County is spending $2 million a year to process federally \ninitiated cases. Whatcom County is not being reimbursed, but \ncommunities along the southern border are. That is not fair, and it is \nsomething I am working to correct.\n  Washington State understands the importance of border security. I \nbelieve any bill we pass has to treat the northern border fairly.\n  Our communities need help to combat the scourge of drugs and violence \nthat accompany rampant smuggling operations. We cannot wait until a \nterrorist tries to move a dirty bomb across our northern border.\n  Washington State also has a great stake in how immigration reform \naffects one of our largest industries--agriculture. We rely on \nimmigrants to harvest the crops that put food on our table and bring \nour State billions of dollars a year in economic activity. Last week in \nMoses Lake, WA, I heard personally from farmers and orcharders who had \nto leave fruit on the trees last season because they could not get \nenough help to pick it fast enough. This costs our farmers and our \nentire State economy.\n  Already, many farmers have told me that the 2005 season was the worst \nseason they have had in trying to get the employees they needed. It is \nestimated that 700,000 undocumented workers are living in Washington \nState. That means Washington State has the highest per capita \nconcentration of undocumented workers of any State in the Nation. We \nknow how important laborers are for our economy.\n  Washington State public schools and universities are also impacted by \nour Nation's immigration policies. I hope we can all agree the children \nof immigrants deserve a decent education which builds our communities \nand our economy.\n  For years, I have worked to increase educational opportunities for \nall students living in this country. I am a proud supporter of the \nDream Act, which helps make higher education more accessible to the \nchildren of immigrants. I have been proud to celebrate with young \nstudents through the Latino Educational Achievement Project and other \norganizations in my home State of Washington that break down barriers \nto education. Our educational policies have to ensure that immigrants \nand the children of immigrants are not denied the opportunity to share \nin the American dream.\n  Housing is another area that is connected to our immigration policy. \nMany communities in Washington State are struggling with the lack of \naffordable housing. That can mean families are trapped living in unsafe \nor substandard housing. We also have to address the housing challenges \nin agricultural communities. For several years, I have been working on \na farmworker housing initiative to help address a tremendous shortage \nof safe and affordable housing for the people who work on our farms.\n  All of these experiences--the northern border, agriculture, \neducation, labor needs, and housing--help inform me on my view on \nimmigration policy. I believe from that, that we need a holistic \napproach.\n  Enforcement is important. Securing our borders is important, but if \nwe leave out things such as education and job training, if we ignore \nthe tools families need to rise above their circumstances and build a \nbetter life, we will be missing the big picture and we will be throwing \naway the ladders of success generations of Americans have relied on to \nmake their families and, subsequently, our country stronger.\n  Comprehensive immigration reform should do seven things: it should \nimprove enforcement; it should treat the northern border fairly; it \nshould include a guest worker plan which includes a path to \ncitizenship; it should provide a path forward so that people who are \nhere have an opportunity to become citizens and realize the American \ndream; it should protect the rights of victims and refugees; it should \nnot turn into criminals those compassionate souls who care for their \nwounds, teach their children, or feed their families; and finally, it \nshould provide the resources to help families rise above their \ncircumstances through education and training.\n  Let me take a minute to talk about each of these priorities.\n  First of all, we should improve our enforcement, and that means \nproviding personnel, equipment, facilities, and resources to enforce \nour borders. In the wake of September 11, security at our borders and \nenforcement of our immigration rules are now more critical than ever. \nThat is why I have pushed for years to hire more Border Patrol agents, \ndeploy more resources along the border, including the northern border \nair wing, and to make sure we are using the latest technology to secure \nour Nation's borders. We must continue to make investments in securing \nour border and protecting ourselves from those who seek to do us harm.\n  Second, we have to treat the northern border fairly. We will not be \nshortchanged as we have in the past. If we are going to secure our \nborders, we cannot leave the northern border behind.\n  Third, immigration reform should include a guest worker plan to keep \nour economy moving forward. We have tremendous labor needs in our \ncountry, especially in labor-intensive fields such as agriculture. Our \neconomy cannot survive without access to the workers we need. A \nresponsible guest worker\n\n[[Page S2567]]\n\nprogram can help address our country's economic needs. As one farm \nleader in my State put it, we need reform, but we cannot commit \neconomic suicide in the process.\n  I am cosponsor of the bipartisan AgJOBS bill which allows current \nworkers to retain citizenship and which would set up a guest worker \nprogram that will really work. I hope we can follow a similar path. But \nwhatever we do, we can no longer tolerate a system that expects our \nfarmers to be experts in document verification. Our farmers should not \nbe turned into criminals.\n  One option is to provide a way to electronically verify someone's \nidentity. If we pursue that approach, we must not put a new financial \nburden on our farmers who are just trying to follow the law and do the \nright thing.\n  We have to establish a realistic system that allows employers to \nlegally hire the help they need. And agriculture is not the only sector \nthat would be affected by these proposals. It would also affect the \nconstruction and hospitality industries as well.\n  Fourth, immigration reform should provide hope and a path forward for \na resident to be able to earn--earn--legal status.\n  Fifth, any legislation must protect the rights of victims and \nrefugees to access the courts. Over the years, we have worked to \nprotect victims and refugees, but if we enact an expedited removal \nprocess, we could undo all that work and cause tremendous human pain. \nWe have worked very hard through the Violence Against Women Act to \nprotect victims no matter where they come from or what their legal \nstatus is. The act allows victims of domestic violence to petition to \nstay in the United States. We should keep those humane protections in \nplace.\n  Sixth, we should not make felons of those who seek to help the most \nvulnerable. Churches and other support groups should not be threatened \nwith jail time for showing compassion toward anyone who needs help. It \nis not the job of hospital workers or teachers or priests to enforce \nour immigration laws, nor should it be. We should not block any \nemergency room doors, any classroom, or any police station to the needs \nof all of our residents.\n  Finally, we need to invest in the things that help immigrants and all \nAmericans rise above their circumstances. I am concerned that many \nimportant issues are being left out of this debate we are now having. \nAs leaders, it is our duty to protect and foster the American dream for \nall of our citizens as well as those on the path to citizenship.\n  We need to invest in primary and secondary education. All of our \nchildren should have the opportunity to become more successful than \ntheir parents. We need to invest in adult education and literacy \nprograms. Immigrants on the road to earned adjustment should have the \nopportunity to improve themselves and learn the English language.\n  We also need to invest in workforce training. All of our citizens \nshould have the opportunity to increase their skills and earning power \nand achieve a greater share of the American dream.\n  We need to invest in health care and secondary education if this path \nto earned citizenship will truly allow all of our neighbors to \nparticipate in the American dream, while also allowing our economy to \ngrow.\n  We are not talking about charity for someone else. We are talking \nabout investments that help every American family achieve their dreams.\n  Throughout our history, the United States has been a beacon of hope \nfor people throughout the world. That light shines as bright today as \nit ever has. As we work here to reform our immigration policy, let's \nmake sure our actions reflect our security, our economy, and the \nopportunity America has offered generations of immigrants. Let's take \nthe time to get this right. Our country's future depends on it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes under Republican time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today, I intend to offer an amendment to \nthe immigration reform bill. This amendment aims to bolster our efforts \nto stop the illegal flow of methamphetamine across our borders.\n  Colorado, as well as the Nation, must deal with the epidemic of \nmethamphetamine. In just 10 years, methamphetamine has become America's \nworst drug problem, worse than marijuana, cocaine, or heroin.\n  In the Senate, we have passed comprehensive legislation to combat \nmethamphetamine. However, I believe this initiative can be improved by \nconcentrating our efforts to expedite an effective plan to tackle \nmethamphetamine that is smuggled across our borders.\n  Methamphetamine is a dangerous drug. The Mesa County Meth Task Force, \nin my home State, notes that methamphetamine is highly addictive, \ncheap, widely available, easier to make than LSD, and therefore more \nattractive to users. The number of users is increasing, and more \nmethamphetamine is starting to come across our borders and into our \nStates.\n  Colorado has been particularly hard hit by methamphetamine \ntrafficking. Numerous local task forces, police departments, as well as \nthe Drug Enforcement Agency, report that the availability of crystal \nmethamphetamine has increased throughout Colorado. In recent years, \nColorado has seen a significant increase in the amount of \nmethamphetamine, cocaine, and marijuana being imported, stored, and \ndistributed in the area. The use and abuse of this drug has spread \nbecause of the availability of high-quality imported methamphetamine.\n\n  According to the DEA, the Drug Enforcement Agency, over half of the \nmethamphetamine available in Colorado is manufactured abroad and \ntrafficked across our borders illegally. The Colorado Drug \nInvestigators Association agrees, stating that most of the \nmethamphetamine available in Colorado is produced abroad or comes from \nlarge-scale laboratories in California. In recent years, the potency of \nmethamphetamine produced in other countries has risen dramatically.\n  The Department of Justice cites that domestic methamphetamine \nproduction is decreasing. National Clandestine Laboratory Seizure \nSystem numbers demonstrate that the number of reported methamphetamine \nlaboratory seizures is on the decline. In fact, Colorado lab seizures \nfrom 2003 to 2004 fell by more than half.\n  However, methamphetamine availability within our borders is not \nlikely to decline because of increased production outside of U.S. \nborders. Production abroad has offset recent declines in domestic \nproduction. Foreign sources of methamphetamine appear to be increasing \ndomestic supplies.\n  According to estimates from the DEA, an alarming two-thirds of the \nmethamphetamine used in the United States comes from larger labs, \nincreasingly abroad, while only one-third of the methamphetamine \nconsumed in the country comes from the small laboratories.\n  The methamphetamine production abroad is dependent on a steady supply \nof ingredients from other foreign sources. These producers are able to \nsecure large quantities of ephedrine or pseudoephedrine from sources in \nother countries which export massive quantities of ephedrine and \npseudoephedrine and increase means of production. These foreign \nlaboratories are often termed as ``super labs.'' They are able to \nproduce more than 10 pounds a day of highly pure methamphetamine. These \nlabs then traffic their product into our country.\n  According to the National Drug Intelligence Center, the \ntransportation of methamphetamine from abroad is increasing, as \nevidenced by increasing seizures along our borders. The amount of \nmethamphetamine seized at or between U.S. border ports of entry \nincreased more than 75 percent overall from 2002 to 2004. The sharp \nincrease in methamphetamine seizures at or between U.S. border ports of \nentry reflects increased methamphetamine production abroad.\n  Methamphetamine has been a leading drug threat in Western States \nsince the\n\n[[Page S2568]]\n\nearly 1990s. The studies from the Department of Justice show that the \ntrafficking and abuse of this drug have gradually expanded eastward \nwith time. Methamphetamine now impacts every region of the country and \nis increasingly prevalent within the Northeast region. Without a \nsensible and timely effort, methamphetamine trafficking will continue \nto spread eastward and eventually encompass the entire United States.\n  Colorado is not just a hot spot for the distribution of \nmethamphetamine. Often drug traffickers pass through Colorado on their \nway to other States. The majority of the methamphetamine that is \ndistributed outside the Rocky Mountain region is destined for States \ngenerally to the north and east, such as Montana, the Dakotas, \nNebraska, and as far away as Illinois.\n  The trafficking of methamphetamine across our country threatens the \nsafety of communities. As distribution spreads, addiction will grow. \nMethamphetamine addicts are increasingly involved in violent crimes. \nThe Mesa County Meth Task Force notes that methamphetamine-related \ncrime ranges from auto theft, burglary, to murder. Methamphetamine \nusers are unreasonable, erratic, and capable of causing great harm not \nonly to themselves but others. We simply must protect our families and \ncommunities from violence.\n  We must recognize the immediacy of this issue and be able to curb the \nflow of methamphetamine into the United States. It is important that we \nprotect U.S. borders to ensure national security and the safety of our \ncommunities. Therefore, I propose that we speed up our efforts to curb \nthe flow of methamphetamine through our borders. We must have a formal \nplan that outlines the diplomatic, law enforcement, and other \nprocedures the Federal Government will implement to reduce the amount \nof methamphetamine being trafficked in the United States.\n  The main thrust of my amendment takes a swift approach to fulfilling \nrequirements for the international regulation of precursor chemicals as \noutlined in the PATRIOT Act. We must press upon the Secretary of State, \nthe Attorney General, and the Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity the immediate need for a firm plan of action. It is imperative \nthat such a plan include, at a minimum, a specific timeline to reduce \nthe inflow of methamphetamine into the United States.\n  There must be a tough standard for keeping excessive amounts of \npseudoephedrine products out of the hands of methamphetamine \ntraffickers. We must outline a specific plan to engage the top five \nexporters of methamphetamine precursor chemicals, such as \npseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine.\n  Also, we must be prepared to be able to address funding needs to \nsecure our borders, ports of entry, and other methamphetamine-\ntrafficking windows that are currently being exploited by drug \ntraffickers. These controls are critical to help law enforcement \nofficials eliminate the flow of methamphetamine into our communities. \nThis plan calls for a detailed funding request that outlines what, if \nany, additional appropriations are needed to secure our borders.\n  My amendment requires the administration to deliver a plan within 90 \ndays of the enactment of this act. This amendment also calls for a \nGovernment Accountability Office report to ensure that our Government \nis fulfilling its obligation to combat methamphetamine.\n  Our Nation has been hard hit by the illegal trafficking of \nmethamphetamine across U.S. soil. This is a national issue which is \ngrowing at a rate that is outpacing our law enforcement officials. \nThrough our work on the Combat Meth Act, we have provided them with the \nnecessities to fight methamphetamine. Now we must be vigilant and \nestablish a responsive plan of action.\n\n  In conclusion, I thank State Representative Josh Penry and State \nSenator Ken Kester from Colorado for working with me on this issue and \nfor their efforts to combat the horrific issue of methamphetamine in \nColorado.\n  I intend to offer this amendment later today. I ask my colleagues to \njoin me in my effort to stop the illegal trafficking of methamphetamine \nand all dangerous drugs at the border.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, there is an order of speaking locked in. I \nbelieve I am entitled to speak in about 5 minutes. Is it appropriate \nfor me to begin at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair.\n  I rise to address the starting point of any discussion of \ncomprehensive immigration reform, which is security at the border, and \nthen move on to the other significant security aspects of this issue. I \nbelieve we need comprehensive immigration reform, which essentially \nboils down to four things: security at the border; security in the \ninterior of the country, including at the workplace; a temporary worker \nprogram to accommodate our employment needs; and a way to deal with the \npeople who are here illegally today. All of those issues need to be \naddressed. Ideally they should be addressed at the same time, but \nalmost everyone agrees that the starting point is security at the \nborder. What I wish to do today is to describe some of the reasons why \nit is so important for us to focus on that and then to discuss the \nunderlying legislation which significantly deals with that problem.\n  As a result of including provisions of the majority leader's bill and \nprovisions of the Cornyn-Kyl legislation in the Judiciary Committee's \nbase bill with respect to border security, we have a good start on \ngetting a handle on border security. It is only a start, and it takes \nyears to build out the fencing, to build up the Border Patrol, to add \nthe new aircraft, the UAVs, to install the sensors and cameras, to \nbuild the detention space and all the other things that have to be done \nin a mosaic to gain control of the border. This bill offers a good next \nstep in that regard.\n  I thank the chairman of the Budget Committee, Judd Gregg, who as \nchairman of the subcommittee on Appropriations has ensured over the \nlast several months that there is additional funding available for more \nBorder Patrol agents, more infrastructure at the border and the like. \nWe have actually already started on this problem, but this legislation \ntakes the next step in a significant way.\n  There are a lot of things going on on the border right now that I \ndon't think Americans who are not from a border State would appreciate. \nI wish to start by talking about those.\n  While it is true that part of the issue before us is the millions of \npeople who have crossed our borders illegally to come here to work, \nthat is only part of the story. Today the border is a violent, crime-\nprone environmental disaster with people in jeopardy and even our \nmilitary suffering as a result of illegal immigration. Let me explain.\n  Because we have added more Border Patrol, we are beginning to contest \nterritory that the smugglers used to call their own. They are fighting \nback. The U.S. Attorney from Arizona testified before my Terrorism and \nHomeland Security Subcommittee about a month ago that assaults at the \nborder were up 108 percent over last year. Those assaults include not \njust rock throwing, which bashes people's heads in, but also assaults \nwith weapons, including automatic weapons. I will get later the number \nof people who have been killed as a result of these assaults. I don't \nhave that with me. But we have had people die in the line of duty \ntrying to protect our borders from this increased violence.\n  Now criminals are coming into our country by horrendous numbers. Last \nyear something like 150,000 criminals entered the country. These are \nnot petty criminals. These are murderers and rapists and child \nmolesters and drug dealers of the worst kind. Now about 10 percent--in \nfact, somewhere even between 10 and 15 percent--of the people \napprehended at the border have significant criminal records.\n  Think about this for a moment: If the usual rule of thumb is that at \nleast three people are able to cross the border and do so successfully \nfor every one who is apprehended, think of the number of violent, vile \ncriminals who are entering our country because we have failed to secure \nthe border. This is a serious problem for the United States. It is \nestimated now that in some places over half of the population of \nprisons is illegal immigrants.\n\n[[Page S2569]]\n\n  In addition to the crime that is occurring at the border and the \ncriminals coming across the border, it is also true that the people who \nare illegally coming to the United States for a better life are prey to \nthe coyotes and other criminal elements. They are raped, robbed, \nbeaten, held hostage for ransom. They represent value that can be \ncollected from their relatives back home. They are mistreated in the \nmost horrible way. Many die because of the way they are being \ntransported or not transported. We are all aware of the increasing \nnumber of deaths, most of which occur in my State and which were a \nrecord number last year.\n  There is also huge environmental degradation. To look at the Arizona \ndesert from the air is to want to cry. Thousands of paths where \nthousands--indeed, millions--of illegal immigrants have trod crisscross \nthe border. It was pristine, but it takes centuries for this very \nfragile ecosystem to revive after it has been trampled. Vehicles coming \nacross by the hundreds, sometimes left behind because they get stuck in \nthe sand or ran out of gas, but the trails can be seen all over. Tons \nand tons of trash left behind, fires started, vegetation trampled. It \nis an ecological disaster.\n\n  I mentioned the military. Because the Barry Goldwater Gunnery Range \nis located on the border with Mexico and is one of the largest areas \nfor our pilots to train regardless of the service, that area is of \ngreat value to the United States for our defense preparedness. Two \nyears ago--I don't have the numbers from last year--there were \nsomething like 400 to 500 missions that had to be aborted because \npilots had their planes gassed up, ready to go, with the bombs ready, \nor maybe had even taken off, but when they got close to the range, the \nradio call came back that there are illegal immigrants in the area. \nTurn back. Don't drop your bombs. This is an area where strafing and \nbombing occurs on a regular basis. The Marine Corps is responsible for \nthe western half of this gunnery range. They go out on a weekly basis \nand try to clear the area of illegal immigrants. But frequently, after \nthey have cleared the area and radioed that it is OK for the mission to \ncome in, they find there is somebody there and they have to abort. \nThere were hundreds of flying hours that were lost 2 years ago and I am \nsure last year as a result of this phenomenon. Military training is \nbeing sacrificed.\n  The same thing is occurring on the proving ground, the Yuma proving \nground, which is a pathway for illegal immigration. The point is, there \nare a lot of reasons to control our border beyond dealing with the \nproblem of illegal immigrants. That is a huge problem. With at least \nhalf of the illegal immigrants coming through my State on an annual \nbasis, it represents particularly a huge problem for my State. But I \nhaven't mentioned one of the key elements, and that has to do with \nsecuring our borders as a sovereign country, particularly in a time \nwhere there is a potential terrorist threat. It is not hard to \ntransport contraband material across our border. The drug war is going \non full blast on our borders. Methamphetamine is not made or \nmanufactured so much in at least our State, and I understand other \nStates now, because it is easier to bring it across the border where it \nis manufactured by the ton in Mexico and then brought over in \nbackpacks, one backpack of value anywhere from a quarter to a half \nmillion dollars.\n  These kinds of things are coming across the border every day. If they \ncan come across, then so can a backpack full of material for a \nradiological weapon, for example, or a biological weapon, and so can a \nterrorist. We now have 165,000 other-than-Mexican illegal immigrants \napprehended. Remember the rule of thumb that for every one you \napprehend, perhaps at least three more are not apprehended. These are \npeople from countries other than Mexico. So when they are apprehended, \nthey can't be returned to Mexico as we do with Mexican citizens. They \nhave to be processed and put on an airplane back to their country of \norigin. I was told by the Director of Homeland Security that there are \nover 39,000 Chinese citizens in the United States, having come here \nillegally, who need to be returned but that only a few hundred are \nbeing returned every year. In other words, the problem is getting \nbigger and bigger every year.\n  There are not enough detention spaces for all of these people. As a \nresult, they are released on their own recognizance. Do they show up \nwhen they are asked to? No, of course not. These other-than-Mexican \nillegal immigrants are caught and released, allowed to meld into our \nsociety. A large number of them are criminals. Many of them come from \nso-called countries of interest, meaning countries from which \nterrorists come. Yet we can't hold them and return them because we \ndon't have the detention space to hold them and their countries won't \ntake them back quickly, if at all. Some countries won't even take them \nback.\n  The Department of Homeland Security has announced a plan to end catch \nand release, but that is only possible when we have the detention beds \nto put them in, pending their departure. There is money in this bill \nfor that purpose, but not enough. The point is, it will take years.\n  I hope I am beginning to create some picture of the magnitude of this \nproblem beyond just the problem of illegal immigrants wishing to come \nhere for a better life. This issue is frequently portrayed as nothing \nbut that. It is far more than that, far more complicated, far more \ndangerous, far more destructive. We have to get control of our borders. \nIf we don't, we are not a sovereign nation, we don't have control over \nour own destiny, and there are threats to our existence far beyond \nwhatever problems illegal immigrants who want to work here may create.\n  There is another aspect of enforcement that has received far too \nlittle attention. We talked about enforcement at the border but also \nenforcement in the interior. Illegal immigrants know if they get a few \nmiles north of the border, they are home free. Border Patrol doesn't \neven operate 60 miles north of the border for the most part. As a \nresult, there is no or very little enforcement in the interior of the \ncountry. There may be the occasional border checkpoint, but they are \nusually much closer to the border, the occasional Border Patrol officer \nin an airport to try to discourage illegal immigrants from transporting \nthemselves by airline, which they have done for years, but very little \nenforcement.\n  There is essentially no enforcement of the law against hiring illegal \nimmigrants, a law that was written several years ago which has \nessentially never been enforced. The reason is because, A, it is not \nenforceable and, B, we don't have the will to enforce it. Employers are \ntold they are supposed to check documents. The documents are all easily \nforged. Everybody knows that. The employer has a good idea when he is \nhiring the individual that that individual is an illegal immigrant, \nprobably can't speak English and clearly comes from another country. \nAnd yet the employer can't do anything about it because the driver's \nlicense or passport or Social Security card looks like the one you and \nI have. The counterfeiters are very good at this.\n  So everybody pretends the law can be enforced when they know it \ncan't. The Government doesn't do anything about it, the employers don't \ndo anything about it. America sees that and Americans say: What happens \nto a country that isn't enforcing its laws and apparently doesn't have \nthe will to do so? And, importantly, why should we believe that you in \nthe Senate can create a workable, comprehensive immigration program \nwith temporary workers and a way to deal with the illegal immigrants \nwho are here today? Why should we believe you will be able to do that \nand enforce it when you haven't enforced the ones that are on the books \ntoday?\n  We are all familiar with the 1986 amnesty, 3 million people, but then \nwe were going to enforce the law so it would never occur again. In \n1996, once again, we provided for enforcement at the workplace, as I \ndescribed it. It didn't happen. It is kind of like Lucy and the \nfootball. After about three times, Charlie Brown ought to start getting \nthe idea that when he goes up to kick the football, Lucy is going to \npull it away from him. That is the way the American people look at us. \nThey ask: When are you going to assure us this will be done?\n  I dare say neither the administration, the previous administration or \nthe current one, or the Congress has given the American people much to \npeg confidence on.\n\n[[Page S2570]]\n\n  The administrations have not asked for enough money. The Congress has \nadded money to the situation but has still not added enough. Our law \nenforcement doesn't seem to be willing to go after the employers who \nare clearly violating the law. Indeed, it would be hard because, in a \nsense, they are being precluded from asking questions about the \ndocuments that are given to them.\n  This all points the way toward the second and equally critical part \nof the legislation we are going to have to deal with. If we don't \nenforce the law in the interior, this whole exercise is a fraud, it is \na deceit, it will not work, and the American people will react very \nnegatively, I predict.\n  Now, it is relatively simple to make this work if we have the \nwillpower to do it. You have to have a verification system that is \npegged to a valid database, electronically verified and audited. The \nSocial Security system has numbers that are assigned to everybody, but \nit is full of bad numbers today. It needs to be cleaned up. I believe \nwe will have an amendment that will provide for the cleaning up of the \ndatabase, for its maintenance in a proper way, and for an employer \nverification system that depends upon a Social Security number being \ntyped in electronically and sent back to the headquarters in \nWashington, or wherever it is, verifying whether the number is valid.\n  That is half of the situation. OK. The number you have just been \ngiven is a valid Social Security number, it doesn't appear to be being \nused by somebody else, it has been validly issued by somebody with the \nname of John Doe, and the person standing in front of you claims to be \nJohn Doe. How do you know it is John Doe? I can go to an employer and \nrattle off a number and put it into the system, and he says: That is a \nvalid number; what is your name again? I happen to know the number \nbecause I saw the card or asked my neighbor his name, or whatever the \nsituation. Well, you have to have a way of tying the person in front of \nyou to the number. This will also have that kind of system. They are \nworking right now on exactly what kind of number to attach to that to \nmake that work. Eventually, the REAL ID Act, which is based upon good \ndocuments, will connect the individual standing before you to the \nnumber, and therefore you will be able to validate identity in that \nway.\n  This is somewhat costly. It will take some period of time to put into \nplace. Once it is put into place, it can operate efficiently. Employers \nwill be mandated to use it. But it will be easy to use. So we should \nnot be asking employers to be the cops here. It is an impossible job \nfor them. If the Government has determined in advance who is legally \nemployable and who is not, then the employer doesn't have to worry \nabout it. All he or she has to worry about is when the number \nelectronically comes back and it says ``valid,'' you are home free. If \nit says ``invalid number,'' don't hire the person or you will be in big \ntrouble.\n  This legislation will provide a way to clear up any problems, so if \nfor some reason the number doesn't compute, and you say: That is really \nme and that is my number, you can straighten that out. The bottom line \nis that if we don't have a valid verification of employment, whether \nthe individual is verified as a citizen, a temporary worker, a green \ncard holder, or whatever the status is, if you are validly able to get \nemployed, great. If you are not, then you won't be employed. Unless we \nhave that kind of system, this entire thing breaks down.\n  In the legislation Senator Cornyn and I developed, this is a critical \ncomponent, and it answers one of the questions that is frequently \nasked: How do you know people will eventually come out of the shadows \nand participate in a temporary worker program--or seek a green card, in \nany event--that they will eventually leave the United States in an \nillegal status and will come back in a legal status? The answer is: \nWith a good validation of employment, verification of employment \neligibility system, nobody is going to be able to get a job illegally.\n  So within a couple of years, it is not going to be possible to be in \nthe United States, if you want to work, and be illegal. You are going \nto have to get legal and come in on a temporary worker status, if that \nis what you want to do. That is part of the answer as to what will \ncause people to comply with the law. They are not going to be able to \nget a job if they don't.\n  It is theoretically possible that an individual could go live with \nsomebody else and remain in the shadows; that possibility could exist. \nAlthough, as the documents become better, it is going to become harder \nto do anything, in terms of purchasing or bank transactions or driver's \nlicenses and the like, if you don't have valid documentation for your \nstatus in the United States.\n  These are the two key things which we refer to when we talk about \nenforcement of the law: securing the border and securing the interior, \nincluding the workplace. These two factors must be a part of any \nlegislation we pass. The House focused only on the first part of that, \nprimarily. There are others who think we should do that first and wait \nuntil we do the rest of the bill. I don't believe that is a good idea. \nWe need to try to do all of these things together. But I support the \nidea that until these systems are locked in, until the American people \ncan see that we have been serious about it, that a year or two has gone \nby and we have funded them and the administration is enforcing them, \nsome of the rights that attach under various bills should not finally \nattach. In other words, let's make sure we are doing these things \nbefore future rights to citizenship or something like that come into \nplay.\n\n  What do Americans think about this issue of illegal immigration, and \nwhat would they support in terms of what I have been talking about? \nThis is according to a variety of surveys.\n  Time magazine, earlier this year, said 63 percent believe illegal \nimmigration is an extremely or very serious problem. Another one says \nthey see immigration first as a security problem, then an economic \nissue, and finally a civil rights/humanitarian issue. Again, the Time \npoll says they believe that illegal immigrants, overall, hurt the \neconomy, 64 to 26 percent.\n  In a Quinnipiac poll, in February, they opposed allowing illegal \nimmigrants to obtain driver's licenses, 72 to 25 percent.\n  In a New Models poll, 58 percent to 37 percent say they would like to \nsee military troops be used for border security.\n  The American people want serious action. I believe that illustrates \nhow concerned they are that we have not been able to control the \nborders so far.\n  They favor a proposal to build a 2,000-mile security fence by a 51-\nto-37 percent margin. That is a Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll.\n  I don't think it is realistic to put a fence along the entire border. \nWhat you need is troops on the ground and fences. You can put up a \nfence, but if nobody checks it for 3 or 4 days, they can cut a hole in \nit and come through. You have to have boots on the ground to control \nthe territory, as we have seen in Iraq. We are talking about \ncontrolling our own territory. Fences are a key part of that, but so \nare people--Border Patrol agents who can continually patrol and make \nsure the fence is doing its job.\n  Again, from the Quinnipiac University poll in February of this year, \nthey support requiring proof of legal residency to obtain Government \nbenefits by an 84 percent to 14 percent margin.\n  There are other polls. Let me cite a couple. There is a Gallup poll \nof March 27, just recently, where 80 percent of the public wants the \nFederal Government to get tougher on illegal immigration; 62 percent \noppose making it easier for illegals to become citizens; 72 percent \ndon't even want illegals to be permitted to have driver's licenses.\n  A Time Magazine poll found that 75 percent favor ``major penalties'' \non employers of illegal immigrants.\n  An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll: 59 percent oppose a guest worker \nproposal.\n  I might say, there are different numbers on that. I think part of \nthat depends upon how you ask the question. Nonetheless, there is an \nextreme amount of cynicism there.\n  An IQ Research poll done on March 10 found that 92 percent are saying \nsecuring the U.S. border should be a top priority of the White House \nand the Congress.\n  So the American people are pretty clear on this issue. They want us \nto act, and they want us to act to enforce the law.\n\n[[Page S2571]]\n\n  We are going to be talking about a lot of other things here soon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the majority has expired.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for another 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, we will have more to say about a lot of other \naspects of the pending legislation and what we need to do. I wanted to \ntake this time at least to lay the groundwork for the discussion of why \nit is important to enforce the law.\n  The final point I will say is this: We are, it is often said, a \nnation of immigrants but a nation of laws. What do we mean by that? We \nmean that when we go to an intersection and the light is green, what do \nwe know? We know we can drive on through because the people who have \nthe red light will obey the law. We do that with everything in our \nsociety. We have contracts with each other that are very loose because \nwe have a rule of law that if anything goes wrong, we have a way of \nresolving that legally. Everything we do, we do because of trust with \neach other based upon the rule of law. That is the way it works in our \nsociety. When everybody obeys the law, we can get along great. Once \npeople disobey the law, bad things happen. You need more and more laws \nand enforcement, and you get into a situation like we are with illegal \nimmigration. That is why we have to get back to the rule of law. People \nin America have to have confidence in their Government, in the \nbusinesses, in their fellow citizens, and they will if they know \neverybody is operating within the rule of law.\n  What happens if they begin to see that nobody appears to be adhering \nto the law? Remember what Mayor Rudy Giuliani proved in New York City: \nWhen little things begin to happen that are violations of law, soon it \nis bigger and more and more, and pretty soon you have a lawless \nsociety. If people understand that even the smallest things have to be \nwithin the rule of law, then you have a much better society.\n  We have to get back to the rule of law with respect to our employment \npractices, the internal operation in our country, and the security of \nour borders for all the reasons I have indicated.\n  I look forward to discussing some of the other significant issues \nrelative to this entire issue. I hope we can agree that border security \nand enforcement of the law at the workplace are critical elements of \nany legislation we adopt.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, pending somebody else wishing to speak, I can \nquote for the record about 3 statistics I think are meaningful with \nrespect to this debate.\n  I did not give a precise number on the number of illegal immigrants \nwho died last year while crossing the United States-Mexican border. \nAccording to the most recent Border Patrol statistics, the number who \ndied in 2005 was 473. That is the highest number since the Border \nPatrol began tracking such deaths since 1999.\n  Another statistic is that last year, the U.S. Border Patrol \napprehended 1.2 million illegal immigrants, which is roughly 1 person \nevery 30 seconds. According to the Pew Hispanic Center, the estimate is \nthat there are about 12 million illegal immigrants in the United States \ntoday, and about 56 percent of them are Mexican citizens.\n  Another statistic: The busiest U.S. Border Patrol station right now \nis the Yuma Border Patrol station. Last year, 138,460 immigrants were \ncaught coming through that station.\n  I see my colleague from California. The Senator from California was \nvery concerned about the lawlessness right near San Diego and the \nenvironmental degradation, crime on both sides of the border, and \nillegal immigration through there, as well as drug smuggling. As a \nresult, as we all know, a fence was constructed in that area.\n  It is interesting, the fence clearly helped to prevent crossings. \nRight where the fence is, I am told, nobody has crossed illegally, and \nin that sector, the number of people apprehended declined from a peak \nin 1986 of 629,650--just in that one area, which is phenomenal to me; \nthat is astounding--from almost 630,000 just in the San Diego sector, \nit is now down last year to 126,000 illegal immigrants were caught near \nSan Diego. That is still a lot of people. We can see the fencing in \nthat area has clearly had a significant impact.\n  There are other statistics, but if the Senator from California is \nready, I will withhold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, shortly the Senate is going to be \nconfronted with a vote on two bills, one of them being the leader's \nbill which deals with enforcement on the border, and the other the \nJudiciary Committee bill which essentially incorporates provisions of \nthe McCain-Kennedy bill into a broad and comprehensive bill which will, \nI believe, be before the Senate for discussion and amendment.\n  The bill approved by the Judiciary Committee is a bipartisan bill. It \nhad a 12-to-6 vote in the committee. It is the first step forward in a \nvery difficult and consequential process to address what has become one \nof the most contentious issues in American life.\n  If this bill is approved by the full Senate, it will then have to go \nto a conference committee and be reconciled against another bill, \nnamely the House bill, which is very onerous in many of its provisions.\n  The reconciliation of these two bills is going to be extraordinarily \ndifficult to achieve, and it remains uncertain whether any bill can be \nenacted into law in this current congressional session.\n  Any legislation approved by Congress, I think, has to take into \nconsideration the reality of today's immigration world in America. It \nis very different from the 1990s, it is very different from the 1980s, \nand it is very different from the 1970s. There are very strongly held \nviews on both sides. Most, though, of what is attempted by Federal \nagencies responsible for the administration of immigration services \ntoday and responsible for the protection of our borders has more often \nthan not failed, and we have to deal with that failure.\n  Employer sanctions, which are the seed of current immigration laws, \nhave failed. Border control is spotty at best. Naturalization takes \nyears. Detention facilities are inadequate. And despite our attempts to \ngain operational control of our border and to secure the interior of \nthe United States so that everyone plays by the rules, the Government \nhas essentially failed.\n  We now have 10 million to 12 million undocumented people living in \nthe United States. They have come here illegally. They live furtively. \nMany of them have been here for 20 to 30 years. I know many. They own \ntheir homes. They pay taxes. Their children were born in this country \nand educated in this country. This is the only home they know. They \nwant to live by the law, but they have no way currently to live by the \nlaw.\n  Employer sanctions, I mentioned, do not and, I believe, in our global \neconomy, will not work. That is evidenced by the fact that in 2004, \nonly 46 employers in the United States were criminally convicted for \nemployer sanctions out of 3,258 cases initiated.\n  I have watched in California. On the few occasions where immigration \nofficials have gone to agricultural worksites and arrested employers, \nthe public reaction has been entirely negative.\n  Both you and I know, Mr. President, that a law is only as good as the \nability to enforce it. There is virtually today no ability to enforce \nemployer sanctions in the United States of America. Therefore, a more \npunitive immigration philosophy that is based and dependent upon \nemployer sanctions as working doesn't work and clearly creates a \nsituation whereby there is disorganized chaos in the immigration world.\n  Another reason for this is our borders are a sieve, porous through \nand through. The Senator from Arizona correctly mentioned there are 14 \nmiles on the California border with Mexico where there is a two-layer \nfence. It is an immigration border control process\n\n[[Page S2572]]\n\nknown as Operation Gatekeeper. It was very controversial when put into \nplay, but it works. And he is correct, immigrants coming in illegally \nin that corridor have been deterred.\n\n  But what has happened is, it has simply pushed them east into \nunfenced portions of the border, and those portions of the border where \nthe desert and the heat wreak considerable destruction upon anybody \ncrossing.\n  A concern with porous borders has also brought attention to a \nclassification of aliens known as ``other than Mexicans.'' In 2005, \nBorder Patrol agents apprehended 165,175 ``other than Mexicans'' at the \nborder, 155,000 of them on the southern border.\n  The concern here is that many of these people are increasingly from \nterrorist-supporting countries, and that presents a real potential \nnational security threat to our country.\n  We continue to have a catch-and-release policy with respect to this \nlimited category of people, but we don't have sufficient detention \nfacilities. Consequently, they are released on their own recognizance \npending a hearing. They are expected to show up at the hearing. More \noften than not, they do not show up. They simply disappear into the \nfabric of America, gone for all time.\n  I can go on and on, but I think this gives an accurate view of what \nhas become an extraordinarily dysfunctional immigration system, and it \nhas also made me realize that while we need strong border enforcement, \nit alone is not the only solution to the problem of illegal \nimmigration.\n  The House bill, which focuses only on enforcement and criminalization \nof undocumented aliens, isn't the solution. We need to be much more \nrealistic and comprehensive.\n  I see the Democratic leader on the floor, and I would be happy to \ncease and desist for the moment if he wishes to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Through the Chair, I know the Senator from California is a \nmember of the committee, and I certainly don't want to interrupt her \nstatement. I have a statement to give, and I need to do that sometime. \nI am wondering how much longer the Senator is going to speak?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Probably about 15 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. What I will try to do is come back when the Senator has \nfinished her statement.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator very much. That is \nvery generous of him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the Senate Judiciary Committee passed \na bill, and I must tell you, I regret the way it was done. It was a \nkind of forced march, hour after hour of amendments on a bill that is \nvery complicated, that I believe has actually come to the floor \nsomewhat prematurely. I don't believe there is yet a consensus in this \nbody, and I hope the debate that takes place can be a respectful debate \nso Members will feel free to open their minds and then to change them \nif the facts warrant that.\n  But this bill is a beginning. It seeks to address the overall problem \nin a much more comprehensive and practical way.\n  First with regard to border enforcement. The bill doubles the number \nof Border Patrol agents. It adds 12,000 over 5 years. Senator Kyl and I \nhad testimony in the Terrorism and Technology Subcommittee from the \nhead of Border Patrol that today there are 11,300 Border Patrol agents. \nThis more than doubles that number over the next 5 years.\n  It also would add an additional 2,500 new ports of entry inspectors \nin this same period so that the ports of entry are strengthened and \nlegal immigration is able to be handled in a more prompt manner.\n  It criminalizes the act of constructing or financing a tunnel or \nsubterranean passage across an international border into the United \nStates. Most people don't know this, but this has become a real \nproblem. There are 40 such tunnels that have been built since 9/11, and \nthe great bulk of them are on the southern border. Large-scale \nsmuggling of drugs, weapons, and immigrants takes place today through \nthese tunnels.\n  I recently visited a tunnel running from San Diego to Tijuana, and I \nwas struck by the inordinate sophistication of the tunnel. It was a \nhalf mile long. It went 60 to 80 feet deep, 8 feet tall. It had a \nconcrete floor. It was wired for electricity. It had drainage. At one \nend, 300 pounds of marijuana were found, and at the other end, 300 \npounds of marijuana.\n  What was interesting is that the California entry into the tunnel was \na very modern warehouse, a huge warehouse compartmented but empty and \nkept empty for a year. You went into one office, and there was a hatch \nin the floor. It looked much like the hatch which Saddam had secreted \nhimself in. But when you lifted that hatch and you looked underground, \nyou saw a very sophisticated tunnel. It went under other buildings all \nthe way across the double fence into Mexico and up in Mexico in a \nbuilding as well.\n  Today, interestingly enough, at this time, there is no law that makes \nbuilding or financing such a tunnel a crime. A provision in this bill \nincludes language from the Feinstein-Kyl Border Tunnel Prevention Act \nwhich would make the building or financing of a cross-border tunnel a \ncrime punishable by up to 20 years.\n  This bill also authorizes additional unmanned aerial vehicles, modern \ncameras, sensors, and other new technologies to allow the Department of \nHomeland Security to work with the Department of Defense so the latter \ncan carry out surveillance activities at the border to prevent illegal \nimmigration. So this bill is very strong on border enforcement. But it \ndoesn't just leave it there, as the majority leader's bill does. It \nsays, that is only half the problem; you have to deal with the other \nhalf of the problem, and there is the rub. That is the difficult part, \nand that is the controversial part as well.\n\n  The bill we have from the Judiciary Committee seeks to remedy the \nvery real needs of our economy which, as much as we might want to, \ncannot be ignored. Our global economy has changed the face of the \nAmerican workforce. I am not going to comment on whether this is good \nor bad. In some cases, it is one or the other. In some cases, it is \nmixed. But the fact of the matter is the needs are different and the \nworkforce is somewhat different.\n  Let me give you a large industry: Agriculture. There are about \n1,600,000 workers in this country who work in agriculture. In my State, \nthere are 566,000. I would hazard an informed guess that half of the \n566,000 are here in undocumented status. I have had farmer after \nfarmer, grower after grower tell me they cannot farm, they cannot grow \nwithout this workforce. I didn't believe it, so I got in touch with \n58--we have 58 counties--58 welfare departments and asked them to post \nnotices saying: Please, there are jobs in agriculture. Here is where to \ncome. Here is to what expect. Guess what. Not a single person responded \nanywhere in the 58 counties of California.\n  That was pretty convincing evidence to me that Americans don't choose \nto do this work. It is the undocumented workforce who has been the \nmainstay of American agriculture, whether through the H-2A program \ncoming cyclically or whether it is through a large contingent of \nundocumented workers who remain in this country year after year and do \nthis work.\n  Under this program--and this was an amendment that I made after \nnegotiations with Senator Craig who has been one of the Senate leaders \non the agriculture jobs program--and I was very pleased to negotiate \nwith him and very delighted to see that he really cared enough to spend \nthe day Monday in the Judiciary Committee. Between us, and with the \ncommittee's help, we have worked out a program whereby an undocumented \nworker could apply for a blue card if that worker could demonstrate \nthat he or she has worked in American agriculture for at least 150 \nworkdays within the previous 2 years before December 31, 2005. After \nreceiving blue cards, individuals who have then worked an additional \nperiod in American agriculture for 3 years, 150 workdays per year, or \n100 workdays per year for 5 years, would be eligible for a green card. \nTheir spouses could work, and their children could remain in the \ncountry with them.\n  What would be the result of this? The result is that American \nagriculture\n\n[[Page S2573]]\n\nwould have a stable base of employment which is legal, which has the \nopportunity to bring people out of the shadows into the bright light of \nday, assume additional responsibilities, grow in the process, and raise \ntheir families. I think that is healthy for America, not unhealthy.\n  Also, we reform the current H-2A program, which is the agricultural \nguest worker program, which employs, I would say around 30,000 people \nand is used largely in the tobacco-producing States. The way this is \nreformed is it makes it easier for an employer to apply for workers \nthrough an attestation system, the paperwork is simpler, the housing \nrequirements are changed to make it easier. In general, the bill \nupdates the H-2A agricultural program.\n  Returning to the larger bill, I suppose the most contentious part is \nwhat should happen to the 12 million people who are living here in the \nshadows, undocumented. Many would say they are here illegally; they \nought to go back. Well, they are not going to go back. They are going \nto remain living furtively, and they are going to remain in the \nshadows. And most of them work.\n  The question before this body is: Does that make sound public policy \nsense over a substantial period of time? These immigrants live \nfurtively. They are subject to work abuse, exploitation, threats, and \nblackmail. This bill would provide them with an opportunity to come \ninto the light of day. But it wouldn't be easy for them. It is not an \namnesty. An amnesty is instant forgiveness with no conditions. There \nare conditions on this. They must pay a fine of $2,000, they must learn \nEnglish, they must have paid all back taxes, and they must be evaluated \nas neither a criminal or a national security threat to this Nation.\n  Also, they would not go in front of anybody in the line. There are \npresently 3.3 million people waiting in other countries legally for \ngreen cards, and those people should and will be processed first. It is \nestimated it will take, believe it or not, up to 6 years to process 3.3 \nmillion. These workers, these undocumented 12 million would go at the \nend of that line, and then one by one, they would come through that \nline. If they have worked steadily for the 6-year period, if they can \nshow they have paid all back taxes, if they have avoided any criminal \nconvictions, if they have learned English in that time, they would be \ngranted a green card. Therefore, they come out of a furtive lifestyle, \nhidden and in secret, living in fear that tomorrow they could or might \nbe deported.\n  Over the years in the Senate, one of the things that we can do is put \nforward a private bill. If we see a family or an individual who we \nbelieve is an exceptional circumstance, we can try and get a private \nbill passed for them, and when we introduce the bill, their deportation \nis stayed. It is very hard to get a private bill through. Many Members \ndon't do private bills. I met some of the families. I want to give you \nthree cases that I think are eloquent testimony to what is happening \namongst the 12 million.\n  Let me share with you a family. Their last name is Arreola. They live \nin Porterville, CA. I have filed a private immigration relief bill for \nthem over 2 sessions. I didn't get the bill passed, but their \ndeportation has been stayed. Mr. and Mrs. Arreola came to the United \nStates from Mexico illegally in the 1980s to work in agriculture. They \nhave five children, two brought to the United States as toddlers, and \nthree born in the United States. They range from 8 years old today to \n19, and they know no other home but this country.\n\n  Their eldest daughter, Nayely, is a bright, engaging student. I have \nmet her and talked with her. She is the embodiment of the American \ndream and what can happen when we give children a chance to excel in a \nloving, nurturing environment. She was the first in her family to \ngraduate from high school and the first to go to college. And on a full \nscholarship. She goes to Fresno Pacific University. Mrs. Arreola works \nas a produce packer and Mr. Arreola now has an appliance repair \nbusiness. They have no criminal background. They own their home. They \npay their taxes. For Nayely, this bill offers a glimmer of hope that \nher family, once and for all, can come out of the shadows. They don't \nhave to have that daily fear of deportation. They have been here for 20 \nyears. They are and will be legal, productive citizens.\n  One other example. Shigeru Yamada is a 21-year-old Japanese national \nliving in Chula Vista, CA. He is facing removal from this country due \nto a tragic circumstance relating to the death of his mother. He \nentered the United States with his mother and two sisters in 1992 at \nthe age of 10. He fled from an alcoholic father who had been physically \nabusive to his mother, the children, and even his own parents.\n  Tragically, Shigeru's mother was killed in a car crash in 1995, and \nhe was orphaned at the age of 13. The death of his mother also served \nto impede the process for him to legalize his status. He could not \nlegalize his status. At the time of her death, his family was living \nlegally in the United States. His mother had acquired a student visa \nfor herself and her children. Her death revoked his legal status in the \nUnited States.\n  In addition, his mother was also engaged to an American citizen at \nthe time of her death. Had she survived, her son would have become an \nAmerican citizen through this marriage. Instead, today, he is an \nillegal immigrant leading a model American life. He graduated with \nhonors from Eastlake High School in 2000. He has earned a number of \nawards, including being named an ``Outstanding English Student'' his \nfreshman year. He is an All-American Scholar, and he is earning the \nUnited States National Minority Leadership Award. He was vice president \nof the associated student body his senior year of high school. He is \npopular and he is trustworthy. He is an athlete. He was named the \n``Most Inspirational Player of the Year'' in junior varsity baseball \nand football as well as varsity football. After graduating, he \nvolunteered for 4 years to help coach the school's girl's softball \nteam.\n  Sending him back to Japan today would be an enormous hardship. He \ndoesn't speak the language. He is unaware of the Nation's cultural \ntrends. He is American, raised here, educated here. He is one who is \ndeserving, who would be helped by this legislation.\n  I see the minority leader, and I know he has a very busy agenda. \nRegretfully, I have a little bit more, so I will finish up.\n  Let me give a third example of the type and character of individuals \nthat this bill would legalize. The Plascencias are Mexican nationals \nliving in San Bruno, CA. They are undocumented. They face removal from \nthe country due to the fact that they have received ineffective \nassistance of counsel. They have four children, all born in this \ncountry. The mother and father are subject to deportation; the children \nare not. They arrived in this country in 1988, and they have worked \nhard. Mrs. Plascencia studied English. She is now taking nursing \nclasses at the College of San Mateo. She worked for 4 years in the \noncology department of Kaiser Permanente Hospital, where she was a \nmedical assistance.\n  Mr. Plascencia works at Vince's Shellfish Market. During the last 13 \nyears he has worked his way up from part-time employee to his current \nsupervisory position. He is now the foreman in charge of the packing \ndepartment.\n  The Plascencia family has struggled to become legal residents for \nmany years. Based on the advice of counsel, whom they were later forced \nto fire for gross incompetence, they applied for asylum. The \napplication was denied, and they were placed in removal proceedings.\n  Their children--Christina, 13; Erika, 9; Alfredo, 7; and Daisy, 2--\nare entitled to remain. Their eldest daughter, Christina, is enrolled \nin Parkside Intermediate School in San Bruno, where she is an honor \nstudent. Erika and Alfredo are enrolled in Belle Air Elementary School. \nThey are doing well. They have received praise from their teachers.\n  This family has worked hard to achieve the financial security their \nchildren now enjoy. This includes a home they purchased 3 years ago in \nSan Bruno, CA. They own their car. They have medical insurance. And \nthey have paid their taxes.\n  It is very clear to me and I think to a majority of Americans that \nthis family has embraced the American dream and their continued \npresence in our country would do much to enhance the\n\n[[Page S2574]]\n\nvalues we hold dear. So I believe that by presenting a pathway for the \n12 million to become legal, this bill offers the only realistic option. \nThink about it. How do you find 12 million people, and what do you do \nwhen you find them, if you do? If brought across the border, they \nreturn the next day. This is their home. This is their work. There are \nno adequate facilities to detain them. And most, today, have become a \nvital and necessary part of the American workforce--in agriculture, in \nrestaurants, in hotels, in landscaping, and throughout our economy.\n  We need to build a border infrastructure that is modern and \neffective. We can do that. Operation Gatekeeper has shown irrefutably \nwe can, in fact, enforce our borders if we have the will to do so and \nwe are willing to spend the money to do so. But we also need to find an \norderly way to allow those people who are already here, who are \nembedded in our communities and in our workforce, to be able to \ncontinue to remain. This bill does that.\n  I know this is tough for everybody because I know emotions run high \nand it is really hard to change your mind on this subject because there \nare so many conflicting pressures. But we have an opportunity to chart \na new destiny for a lot of people. We have an opportunity to do \nsomething which has a chance to work, which is real, which meets the \nneeds of real people out there, and which can stop the illegal infusion \nthrough our borders in the future if we act wisely, well, and \neffectively.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, a man--well, actually a boy--by the name of \nIsrael Goldfarb came to the United States from Russia with his parents. \nHe and his family were forced to leave Russia because of the pogroms \nthat were going on. The economic situation for the Goldfarb family was \nchaotic, and no end was in sight for the problems the family faced. The \nlittle boy came to America with his parents and found a home with his \nparents in Minnesota, got an education, changed his name from Israel to \nEarl, and eventually came to California, where he met his wife. She was \nalso of Lithuanian extraction. They married and had a very good life.\n  The best part of their life was their having one child. They had one \nchild from that union. The reason that is so meaningful to me is that \none child is my wife. My wife's father was a Russian immigrant, may he \nrest in peace. Of course, he and his lovely wife are gone. But for me, \nwhenever I hear stories of immigrants and immigration, I think, but for \nthis great country that opened its arms to this Jewish immigrant \nfamily, I wouldn't have had the opportunity to fall in love with my \nwife, Landra, and have five children of whom we are very proud. So \nimmigration to me is more than just a word.\n  I am very happy that the Senate has started debate on immigration \nreform. Last week, 8 days ago, I traveled to the border, the \nCalifornia-Mexican border. It was an eye-opening trip, to say the \nleast. I was able to see firsthand the problems created by our broken \nimmigration laws. We need a serious strategy to address this crisis, \nand that is an understatement.\n  I am always so impressed with public servants. Public servants are \nmore than Governors and Secretaries in the Cabinet and Senators. Public \nservants are the people who work in these buildings here in Washington \nand all over the country, these Federal offices. People who work in \nthese agencies we have created all over America, I saw them firsthand \nin California a week ago Wednesday. Such dedication is hard for me to \ncomprehend. Every day, these men and women put their lives on the line \nto enforce laws that we pass. I am very proud of the people who work on \nour borders. Again, we need a serious strategy to address the crisis \nthat we have--and it is one.\n  Immigration reform is a matter of national security. We must know who \nis crossing our borders, when they cross our borders, who is living and \nworking in our country. We need tough and smart enforcement at the \nborder and throughout the country. And we need realistic immigration \nlaws that bring immigrants out of the shadows, paying taxes, learning \nEnglish, and contributing to our communities.\n  I strongly support enforcement, but I also know that enforcement \nalone cannot solve the problem. We have tried that. We tried it for the \nlast many decades. We have tripled the number of Border Patrol agents \nover the last two decades. I am glad we have. I voted for every one of \nthem. We increased immigration enforcement in the budget 10 times over. \nWe need to do more, but during the same time we tripled the number of \nborder agents and increased our immigration enforcement budget 10 times \nover, the probability of catching someone illegally crossing our \nborders has fallen from 32 percent to 5 percent.\n  My recent visit to the border convinces me all the more that \nenforcement alone is not the answer. I flew over miles of the border--\nSan Diego going into Arizona. As I said, I have talked at length with \nthe Border Patrol agents. They recognize better than anyone in this \nChamber that fences don't keep people out. Near San Diego, we have a \nbig metal fence. I don't know how tall it is, maybe 8 feet tall. And \nthen we put up another chain link fence--tall, maybe 9 or 10 feet tall. \nThe agents explained to me that people cut through, climb over, tunnel \nunder. They showed me the new fence, a big, thick, chain link fence. \nThey showed me the dents in the fence, the secondary fence, from people \nthrowing ladders up and hooking them and climbing up over these.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will use leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the agents also showed me huge slingshots, \nfor lack of a better description, metal slingshots that shoot ball \nbearings. These criminals who are trying to illegally bring people over \nthe walls have these huge slingshots, and they will get a ladder over \nwhere the metal fence is, and they fire these and they do tremendous \ndamage to our Border Patrol agents. That is just one example. I saw \nthat famous tunnel. It was a third of a mile long; in some places 80 \nfeet deep.\n  Half a million people come over our border, the Mexican border, every \nyear. The fact is, our economy depends on them. We simply cannot get \nthe situation under control until we acknowledge economic reality. To \nbe sure, we need more Border Patrol agents, and we should give them the \nequipment and technology they need. We must shut down the flow of \nillegal immigration, but we also need realistic and enforceable \nimmigration laws.\n  One crucial element of this strategy is to provide incentives for the \nundocumented immigrants already in the country to step out of the \nshadows. Today, there are more than 11 million undocumented people in \nour country, and more are coming every day. From a national security \nperspective, this is not acceptable. A sovereign government must know \nthe identity of people crossing its borders and living in its cities. \nOf course, most of these 11 million people pose no threat, but those \nwho do--we must know who they are.\n  Most of these 11 million have been here for a long time. Most have \nchildren and spouses who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Most \npay taxes on property and are active, valuable members of their \ncommunities. Virtually all of them came here to work. But they are \nliving in hiding. If they are the victim of crime, they don't report it \nbecause they are afraid to have contact with the police. They accept \nabuse and low wages in the workplace. They live in fear every day that \nthey will be deported and separated from their families. They must have \nincentives to come out of the shadows. It is unrealistic to think we \ncan round up these people and expel them.\n  As conservative columnist George Will recently wrote in the \nWashington Post:\n\n       We are not going to take the draconian police measures \n     necessary to deport 11 million people. They would fill \n     200,000 buses in a caravan stretching bumper-to-dumper from \n     San Diego to Alaska.\n\n  That is farther than San Diego to Miami.\n  He writes:\n\n       And there are no plausible incentives to get the 11 million \n     people to board the buses.\n\n  Even if we could depart 11 million people, how would we? Do we want \nto? It would cost billions of dollars. Some\n\n[[Page S2575]]\n\nsectors of the U.S. economy would literally shut down, and it would be \ninconsistent with our core values as Americans.\n  There are two competing approaches to this issue. The House of \nRepresentatives has passed a bill that represents one approach. The \nSenate Judiciary Committee--and I compliment and applaud Senator \nSpecter, Senator Leahy, Senator Kennedy, and all the members of the \nJudiciary Committee--reported out a bill that is bipartisan.\n  I believe the House bill is profoundly misguided. It purports to be a \nborder security bill, but it contains provisions that are not about \nsecuring our borders at all. It makes criminals out of and demonizes a \nlot of hard-working people who are just trying to provide for their \nfamilies. In my view, the House bill is mean-spirited and I really \nbelieve un-American and it would not solve the problem.\n  In contrast, the Senate Judiciary Committee bill would take real \nsteps to restore order to our immigration system. It combines tough, \neffective enforcement with smart reforms to the immigration laws. It \nwould strengthen our borders, crack down on employers who hire \nillegally, and bring undocumented immigrants out of the shadows. It \nwould require them to learn English and pay taxes, have no criminal \nrecord, have a job, and pay fines in order to work toward legalization. \nAnd it is not amnesty. There is no free pass, no jumping to the front \nof the line. It is a bipartisan bill. Half the Republicans on the \ncommittee voted for it.\n  By shifting the flow of undocumented immigrants to legal channels and \ncreating a hard-earned path to citizenship for those already here, we \ncan finally focus on catching the criminals and terrorists who put our \nNation at risk. That makes more sense than spending precious law \nenforcement resources trying to track down hard-working housekeepers, \ndishwashers, and other people who have jobs.\n  As we weigh these competing proposals in the coming days, we must not \nforget we are a nation founded on and built by immigrants.\n  My grandmother came from England. I talked to you about my in-laws--\nRussia, Lithuania. My great-grandparents came here to pursue the \nAmerican dream. Let us honor that proud heritage and move forward on \nthe committee-reported bill. That is a step in the right direction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The majority leader.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3191 to Amendment No. 3192\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I call up my amendment which is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Frist] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3191 to amendment No. 3192.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require the Commissioner of the Bureau of Customs and \nBorder Protection to collect statistics, and prepare reports describing \nthe statistics, relating to deaths occurring at the border between the \n                       United States and Mexico)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. DEATHS AT UNITED STATES-MEXICO BORDER.\n\n       (a) Collection of Statistics.--The Commissioner of the \n     Bureau of Customs and Border Protection shall collect \n     statistics relating to deaths occurring at the border between \n     the United States and Mexico, including--\n       (1) the causes of the deaths; and\n       (2) the total number of deaths.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the \n     Commissioner of the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection \n     shall submit to the Secretary a report that--\n       (1) analyzes trends with respect to the statistics \n     collected under subsection (a) during the preceding year; and\n       (2) recommends actions to reduce the deaths described in \n     subsection (a).\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the debate and discussion today has been \nsuperb in terms of addressing the overall issue of border security and \nimmigration. It centers on the issue of security, of the economy \nitself, social issues, and issues of compassion. The amendment I have \njust proposed is an amendment that focuses on the latter; that is, the \nissue of compassion.\n  Over the past decade more than 3,000 men, women, and children have \ndied along our borders. These deaths represent an immense humanitarian \ntragedy, a tragedy that all too often is shuffled off into the corner. \nWhile we have an obligation to protect our borders--and much of our \ndiscussion over the last 24 hours has been on the absolute critical \nimportance of securing those borders--I think we have even a higher \nobligation to protect and preserve the life of every person who sets \nfoot on American soil.\n  The people who die come here searching for a better life. They are \nnot bad people. There are people such as Matias Garcia.\n  Mr. Garcia was the oldest of five children. He left school at the age \nof 8 to work in the fields. It is a story which is not too uncommon \ntoday. Each year he would cross that border illegally, unfortunately, \ncoming into this country to enter California.\n  In the spring of 2003, he started crossing that border in May--one of \nthe hottest months of the summer. A coyote--a human smuggler--left him \nwith only 2 gallons of water. It wasn't enough. He became delirious, \nlost touch with reality and collapsed on the ground, to die within \nsight of the Arizona highway he had struggled to reach.\n  I commend the Customs and Border Protection's existing efforts to \nsave migrants. I know the men and the women of the Customs and Border \nProtection agency put human life first, but we are failing today.\n  When I first started looking into this issue, I asked for the \nstatistics and the statistics simply were not available. I would have \nto go to a local newspaper, call that newspaper along that border and \nanother newspaper to compile statistics.\n  We must better direct our efforts to understand why people die, where \nthey die and, most importantly, what we can do to reduce that death \ntoll.\n  I have already requested that the Government Accountability Office \nreport to us about this. But we cannot wait. We must begin to count \nthose deaths now to see what lies behind those deaths and to see what \nwe can do to mitigate that unnecessary loss of life. We must reduce the \ndeath toll.\n  This amendment will do both of those things, and we must save all the \nlives we can. I ask my colleagues to support this vital amendment. It \nrequires the CBP to begin compiling reports about the number of deaths \nalong the borders and their causes, and to also analyze those trends in \nborder deaths and suggest specific policies that might serve to reduce \nthem.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this critical amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from New Hampshire (Mr. Gregg).\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Martinez are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \nparticipate in what I believe is a fundamentally important, if not \nhistorical, debate about national security and border control and \nimmigration and local law enforcement, of a magnitude and an importance \nthat this country has not seen in a long while.\n  This afternoon, I want to focus on border control because border \ncontrol is synonymous with national security. If there is one \nresponsibility our Government has--it is, in fact, a constitutional \nresponsibility--it is that of national security.\n  It is crucial, for observers, citizens, listening in, watching, \ntrying to understand this debate--and oftentimes frustrated by it--to \nunderstand that while there are many contentious issues that will be \ndiscussed and debated over the course of the remainder of today and \ntomorrow and next week--and that the news media may well focus on only \nsegments of it, attempting to dramatize it, attempting to suggest there \nare great divisions amongst Members of the Senate and the Congress as a \nwhole, and the citizens as a whole--Congress will start and end with \nlegislation that serves, first and foremost, the national security \ninterests of our country.\n  The bill that is now before us includes provisions that are unique \nand important and truly address those kinds of concerns that Americans \nhave been speaking out about ever since 9/11, ever since we were thrust \nupon the issue of immigration and a reality that we had anywhere from 8 \nto 12 million foreign nationals, undocumented people within our \ncountry, and that some of them, while but a few, were intent on doing \nus harm, were intent on attacking our citizens and not here to work and \nto benefit themselves and their families. So it is appropriate that we \nstart this discussion by looking at a critical element of national \nsecurity, and that is simply border control.\n  I must tell my colleagues, that is as difficult, if not more \ndifficult than attempting to address, understand, and identify some 11-\nplus million undocumented foreign nationals who are now in our country. \nWhy? Because we have phenomenal borders. The United States has 7,458 \nmiles of land borders and over 88,600 miles of tidal shoreline. We \ncannot possibly build a fence that long, that high, and that deep \neverywhere to accommodate with absolute surety that those borders are \nimpenetrable.\n  I grew up with this as a very common statement amongst most \nAmericans. When you read the history books and the government books of \nmy day, while I was in the sixth and seventh and eighth grade and in \nhigh school and college, America was tremendously proud that it had \nliterally thousands and thousands of miles of northern border and \nsouthern border that were unguarded, that we were a peaceful nation. \nAnd the nation to our north, Canada, and the nation to our south, \nMexico, were peaceful nations. We didn't have to have guarded borders, \nand we didn't guard them. It was not only impractical in that day, it \nwas simply unnecessary.\n  We realize the world has changed significantly and that clearly \nestablishing workable security policies that act in many ways as a \nfence or a border must be called a virtual fence, a virtually \nimpenetrable border because it won't be just building the fence where \nmany propose it ought to be built. It goes well beyond that. It truly \nis a policy that works, that allows, that identifies, that controls, \nthat shapes the relationship of our border so that while we want to \nstop those who may do us harm and control those who want to cross the \nborder undetected, we must also recognize that we have to allow and we \nmust allow movement of innocent citizens and commercial traffic. That \nis the nature of a border--to control, to shape, to clarify, to \nidentify those who move across our borders.\n  In the last 5 years, we have increased funding for border security by \n60 percent. For those who say you have done nothing, you are just flat \nwrong. This Congress, understanding from 9/11 to today the \nresponsibility of controlling our borders, has invested dramatically \nthe resources of the American taxpayer. We now have some 10,000 Border \nPatrol agents along the southwestern border and 1,000 along our \nnorthern border. Our border protection agents have removed more than \n4.5 million people, of whom some 350,000 have criminal records. In \nfiscal year 2005 alone, the U.S. Border Patrol apprehended 1.19 million \npeople attempting to enter our country illegally. Through the State \nCriminal Alien Assistance Program, Congress has provided more than $4 \nbillion to State and local governments to help with the cost of \nincarcerating criminal aliens. It isn't just making sure the border is \nimpenetrable, but when they cross the border making sure that we at the \nlocal level can bring about the kind of law enforcement that apprehends \nat least the criminal element and incarcerates them and holds them for \nfuture prosecution.\n  Last year's emergency supplemental funding bill contained an \namendment by Senator Robert Byrd and myself reprogramming funds from \nother programs to make an immediate and substantial downpayment on \nincreasing Border Patrol as well as adding hundreds of other law \nenforcement agents and nearly 2,000 more detention beds for illegal \nimmigrants the law requires to be held for criminal activity. We didn't \neven have space, once arrested, once apprehended, to put the criminal \nelement or those we felt might be engaged in criminal activity.\n  However, even as we have increased border enforcement, net illegal \nimmigration continues to be estimated at 400,000 to 500,000 people a \nyear. We were all stunned last week at the report that undercover \nFederal agents managed to smuggle radioactive material through security \ncheckpoints at the border. For all the billions we have invested, while \nthere is no question the border is tightening, it is still penetrable \nin an illegal way.\n  Clearly, despite the resources we have poured into the border, and \nwith many successes, there is still much left to be done. The \nlegislation before us, incorporated in a much broader immigration \npolicy, is the kind of legislation that ought to go first, coupled with \na responsible national immigration policy.\n  Both bills before the Senate today contain numerous provisions aimed \nat improving our border security. They will increase the number of \nFederal officers policing our borders and improve their training. These \nbills will clean up\n\n[[Page S2577]]\n\nFederal laws addressing criminal aliens, increasing the penalties for \nalien smuggling and gang violence and illegal entry and reentry, and \nexpanding the definition of aggravated felony that is the basis for \nremoving aliens or denying them entry in the first place.\n\n  These bills support the President's decision to end the catch-and-\nrelease program. Can you imagine, that is exactly what we have been \ndoing. You catch an undocumented worker, you file it, you release them. \nWhy? We didn't have the capacity to detain them and hold them, to \nprocess them appropriately and make sure they were returned to the \nother side of the border. Clearly, that is now in here, instead of \nrequiring detention of all aliens caught illegally across the border \nuntil they could be formally removed. We couldn't handle that. Now we \nare increasing the number of ports of entry and provide for improvement \nof existing ports.\n  There is much more to improve border security in this legislation. I \nthought I would refer to a few of the other areas of enforcement \npolicy. The bill authorizes 250 new Customs and border protection \nofficers, 200 new positions for investigative personnel to investigate \nalien smuggling, and 250 additional port of entry inspectors annually \nfrom fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2011. It also increases the number of \nCustoms enforcement inspectors by 200 in section 5203 of the \nIntelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. It authorizes \n2,400 additional Border Patrol agents annually for 6 years, adding an \nadditional 4,400 agents to the border over 6 years to the 10,000 \nalready added by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act \nof 2004, for a total of 14,400 new Border Patrol agents by 2011.\n  If America says nothing is being done, then America, listen up: This \nCongress is as committed as you are concerned about border control and \nbuilding that fence. But it will not be a steel and concrete fence \nstretching from the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of California and the \nwest coast. It will be a virtual fence of electronics, of surveillance \nflights, of the recognition of new ports and people, personnel, because \nthe other is, at best, impractical and, at worst, once done, \nunworkable. That is why what we are doing now, many of us who have \nstudied and worked with this issue for a good number of years believe, \nis the right approach.\n  Technical assistance and infrastructure: The bill authorizes such \nsums as are necessary in the acquisition of unmanned aerial vehicles, \ncameras, poles, sensors, and other kinds of technology to achieve \noperational control of the borders and to construct all-weather roads \nand add vehicles and vehicle barriers along the borders.\n  It requires the Department of Homeland Security to replace damaged \nprimary fencing and double- or triple-layered fencing in Arizona's \npopulation centers and on the border, and to construct at least 200 \nmiles of vehicle barriers and all-weather roads in areas that are known \ntransit points for illegals who traffic the border. Is this nothing? \nThis is a phenomenal, historic investment in building that virtual \nfence that is necessary and appropriate at this time.\n  It is safe to say that nobody in Congress, House or Senate, believes \nour job is done until we have acted to increase security for America's \ncitizens, knowing that those who cross the border cross it legally and \nthat those who cross are not a criminal element, are not putting our \ncitizens at risk. None of us believes our job will be done until the \nborder is closed but open to legal entry, open to those who have a \nright to come across because we have so designated them, so recognized \nthem for the purpose they would come--to work in our economy to provide \nfor themselves and their families, to come here to work, to go home, to \nsomeday become an American citizen if they choose and if they stand in \nline and make the application and make the effort to become just that.\n  I have been very outspoken about agriculture and agriculture's need \nfor foreign national workers. American agriculture needs some 1.2 \nmillion workers annually. Many will be foreign nationals, as they have \nbeen in the past. Without them, it is possible that we could collapse \nAmerican agriculture. If we cannot find the workforce for American \nagriculture to come here to work, then American agriculture's \ninvestment will go elsewhere to fill the supermarket shelves of our \ncountry with the quality of plentiful food that American consumers have \ngrown and expect to be there. What American consumers have not \nrecognized is that over the last 20 years, most of that food has been \nharvested by illegal foreign nationals.\n  Next week, I will talk in detail about changes in policy that are \nembodied within this legislation to improve our immigration policy, to \nrecognize those who have come who deserve to be treated fairly. But \ntoday, tomorrow, and clearly throughout the week, I hope Americans \nunderstand that first and foremost our effort is to gain control of our \nborders, to make them secure, to make Americans feel comfortable that \nwe have done our very best to take the thousands and thousands of miles \nof border, both land and sea, and to secure them for the sake of our \nNation's security.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, some long while ago, I was on a helicopter \nflying in Central America between Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador, \nin the mountains and jungles, with two other Members of Congress. We, \nunfortunately, ran out of fuel. So we abruptly landed. It is a \nuniversal rule that if you are in a flying machine and you run out of \ngas, you will be landing soon and we did. We were there for 4 or 5 \nhours until someone found us and sent other helicopters in to get us \nout.\n  The campesinos in the area had seen the helicopters landing and they \ndecided to walk up and see who we were. So 30, 40 campesinos came to \nthe helicopter that landed, and we talked with them. We had an \ninterpreter with us.\n  I visited with a young woman with her three children in tow. We \ntalked about her life. She had never met anybody from the United \nStates. I asked about her life and I said: What would you aspire to do \nwith your life? She said: I would like to come to the United States of \nAmerica. I said: Why would that be the case? She said: Well, that is \nwhere there is opportunity--in the United States of America. This young \nwoman, in the jungles of Nicaragua and Honduras, saw opportunity in the \nUnited States.\n  It is true that in much of the world, if you ask people what are your \naspirations, they would like to go to the United States. We are a \nbeacon of hope and opportunity. We have created a country that is quite \nextraordinary--a country in which we have developed a broad middle \nclass. That middle class helped create jobs that paid well, that had \nretirement and health benefits, raised families, built communities, \nbuilt churches, built schools, sent their kids to schools. What a \nremarkable country.\n  At the start of the last century, leading all the way up to this \ncentury, we had debates, which sometimes turned violent, about what are \nthe conditions of freedom, what are the rights in this country. People \ndied in the streets. James Fyler died. Not many remember his name. He \nwas shot 56 times. Do you know why James Fyler was shot 56 times? It \nwas because he believed that people who were going down into the coal \nmines ought to have a better deal. He stood for coal miners, for the \nright to form labor organizations and bargain collectively. He paid for \nthat with his life.\n  Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in the first third of the century, helped \nwrite and signed the Fair Labor Standards Act, which created rights for \nAmerican workers. It changed the conditions of work in our country. \nWhen Roosevelt died--there is the story that I have mentioned \npreviously on the floor of the Senate about the journalist covering his \nfuneral. As his body lie in state in the Capitol of the United States, \na long line of people formed to file past the body of the President. A \nworking man holding his cap, with tears in his eyes, stood in the line \na long while. The journalist came up to him and said: Did you know \nPresident Roosevelt? And the working man said: No, I didn't, but he \nknew me.\n  His point was that this was a President who stood with working men \nand women. Who knows the working men and women today? Who stands with \nthem and for them today? Well, we\n\n[[Page S2578]]\n\nbuilt a place that is quite extraordinary, and a lot of people want to \ncome to this place. Now, if you fast forward to 2006, we see a strategy \nin this country with respect to trade, the outsourcing of American \njobs, and now with respect to immigration, of insourcing cheap labor.\n  I know this is a sensitive subject and a very difficult one for the \nCongress and the American people. There are two elements of what is \nbeing discussed by President Bush and by those in the Chamber of the \nSenate. One deals with those who have come to this country illegally--\nthe 11 million or so--and the second deals with an add-on to that, \noffered in unlimited quantity by President Bush and in the quantity of \n400,000 workers per year by the underlying bill discussed in the \nSenate, called guest workers.\n  I will talk a little about this. This chart shows the illegal \nimmigration over the past two decades. People don't like to use the \nterm, but you have to use that term. We have processes for immigration \nhere. Let me describe what that process is. We allow people, through H-\n2A visas and H-2B visas--agriculture and non-agriculture work--to come \ninto this country legally. In addition, people immigrate to live here \npermanently. In 2004, 175,000 people immigrated here legally from \nMexico. By comparison, last year, 1.1 million who attempted to come \ninto this country illegally were stopped at the border.\n  Last year, we understand--although we don't have hard numbers--in \naddition to the 1.1 million who were stopped at the border, another \n400,000 to 700,000 came across illegally, to add to this growing number \nof illegal immigrants in this country.\n  My colleagues say--and I understand the comment--nobody is going to \nround up 11 million or 12 million people and prosecute them and deport \nthem and all that. I understand that. We are going to discuss the \nconditions of all of that, and that is important to do. I don't want \nto, nor would any of my colleagues want to, diminish the worth, the \ndignity of those who are part of this pool. They came here illegally, \nbut many have been here a long time. I understand that is a difficult \nissue. But let me not talk about that.\n  Let me talk instead about the add-on by President Bush and by the \nunderlying bill in the Senate dealing with guest workers. I want to \ntalk about that because as we outsource American jobs through terrible \ntrade deals and because big American corporations want to find cheap \nlabor in China, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, as we outsource \nthose jobs and decide to insource cheap labor to take the jobs on the \nbottom of the economic ladder here, the question ought to be asked: Mr. \nPresident, who knows today's American workers--especially those at the \nbottom of the economic ladder?\n  I know the folks at the top have had it real good for a long time. \nThey have an increasing share of America's income. But the folks at the \nbottom have struggled, lost ground, lost jobs, lost retirement, lost \nhealth care. Now this Congress is saying we want to change the status \nof 11 million people who are here illegally and make them legal, No. 1; \nNo. 2, in addition to that, we want to have a guest worker program by \nwhich 400,000 people who now are outside of this country are going to \nbe allowed in, in the next year, and that can increase 20 percent each \nyear. As this chart shows, that guest worker provision, in my judgment, \nwill likely lead to 4.6 million additional people coming into this \ncountry who now live outside of the country.\n  What is the purpose of this? I don't think there is much question at \nall. Why does the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and American business want \nthis? They want to bring in cheap labor. We have seen lots of examples \nof this. Let me show a picture. This photograph shows immigrant workers \nwho were doing work in response to Hurricane Katrina. I will tell you \nabout this for a minute because I want to talk about motives and what \nis happening with respect to this proposal for guest workers which is \nof, by, and for American business that wants to import cheap labor.\n  On October 17 of last year, I chaired a Democratic Policy Committee \nhearing to talk about contracting practices with respect to the \nrecovery effort due to Katrina. I heard from Al Knight and Mike Moran \nfrom Louisiana. They run a small business in Louisiana. Al and Mike run \na New Orleans company. They were hired by a subcontractor of the \nHalliburton Corporation to provide 75 qualified electricians to work on \na project they had begun at the naval air station in Belle Chasse, LA. \nThe Halliburton subcontractor very quickly replaced their 75 local \nworkers with workers from outside the region, many not trained as \nelectricians and not from that region. Here is what Al Knight said, \nmanager of the New Orleans company that lost that job, who had 75 \nworkers who lost jobs:\n\n       Almost all of the workers were from out of State. Most did \n     not speak English. Few seemed to be qualified electricians. \n     According to the Halliburton subcontractor, they were being \n     paid two-thirds of our prevailing hourly wage, with no \n     benefits. At the time, they were living in small tents off \n     base.\n\n  Another person who testified had this picture of the living \nconditions of immigrants being brought in at subpar wages to do this \nwork. That is at the root of much of this discussion with respect to \nguest workers.\n  Five days after I held that hearing, the Washington Post ran an \narticle that pointed out that there was a raid and they found the \nillegal workers down at that job site on a U.S. naval air base.\n  Look, I am not unsympathetic to people who want to work and come into \nthis country. But I am much more sympathetic, as an American, to those \npeople at the bottom fifth or the bottom fourth of the wage scale in \nthis country who are struggling to find good jobs, to hang onto those \njobs.\n  We are told by companies: We cannot find American workers to take \nthese jobs. Oh, really? I am telling you that there is a price at which \npeople will take those jobs. You just want to pay dirt poor wages. How? \nJust bring in immigrants who work for lower level wages, and that way \nyou never have to raise the income by which you attract American \nworkers.\n  That, in my judgment, undercuts our economy, it disserves our \nworkers, and it sends a message when you ask the question: Who knows \nAmerican workers? Not this Congress, not this President. My hope is \nthat we will start understanding what we are doing here. We are talking \nabout American workers who all too often these days are seeing lost \njobs, lost wages, lost retirement programs, lost health care, and lost \nopportunity. Now we are talking about a Congress that is talking not \njust about the 11 million people who came here illegally but about a \nCongress who says on top of that: Why don't we see if we can find a \nway, a formula by which we can add 400,000 a year; and at the end of 6 \nyears, you conceivably could have said we want 4.6 million more workers \nwho are now living in our country to come back to do this job. Is this \nabout good government, about good economics? Is this sensible? Is this \nstanding up for American workers? No.\n  I will tell you, it is about American businesses, big businesses who \nrun most of the agenda around here, who want to continue to have access \nto a pipeline of cheap labor, because if you have cheap labor coming \nin, you never, ever have to increase wages at the bottom.\n  It has been 8 years since this Congress has increased the minimum \nwage for American workers--8 years. We have increased everything else--\ntax breaks for wealthy Americans, opportunities for companies to move \njobs overseas. But we have not increased the minimum wage in 8 years. \nThat is unbelievable. It is unforgivable, just in terms of values.\n  Now, we have quotas in this country by which we allow people in. Some \ndon't like that. But the fact is, if tomorrow we had a new public \npolicy and said as a country, look, there are no restrictions, no more \nquotas, no more immigration issues, whoever in this world wants to come \nhere, God bless you, come and stay. If we did that, we all know what \nwould happen. We share this small planet of ours with about 6.3 billion \npeople; half of them live on less than $2 a day. Half of them have \nnever made a phone call, and they don't have access to clean, potable \nwater. We simply cannot, as a country, having built what we built to \nincrease our standard of living, decide that we can be the sponge for \neverybody everywhere who wants to come to our country. We cannot do \nthat.\n\n[[Page S2579]]\n\n  As a result, we have immigration laws. Those immigration laws provide \nopportunities for others to come to our country. Last year, for \nexample, our Southern border allowed 175,000 people to immigrate \nlegally. Second, through the processes of the visas that are issued for \nagricultural workers and temporary, seasonal nonagricultural workers, \ntens and tens of thousands more came across temporarily. That is the \nway we have always done business.\n\n  I understand those who have come to this floor saying let's try to \nfind a way to address the status of the 11 million people who are \nalready here. I don't understand this Congress, this President saying: \nOh, by the way, we have this huge problem that has become a mushrooming \nproblem, so let's bring in 400,000 more workers each year, and let's \nadd to it by putting a formula in this bill that says we will have an \nexpansion of 20 percent more each year, if you reach the 400,000 in the \nfirst quarter. I don't think that makes sense.\n  I understand all those who speak for immigrants, and I don't want to \ndo anything to diminish their value, their worth, their dignity. God \nbless them all. But I also want to be here standing for American \nworkers who are struggling trying to find their footing, trying to find \na job.\n  There is no social program in this country, there is no social \nprogram that we work on in this Congress, as important as a good job \nthat pays well because that allows everything else to be possible in a \nfamily. A good job allows people to take care of their kids. It allows \npeople to do the things they want to do. There are fewer and fewer of \nthose kinds of jobs.\n  To suggest on top of dealing with the 11 million-plus guest worker \nprogram to bring 400,000 a year in with a 20-percent expansion program \non top of that, I think it defies all common sense. This is clearly a \ncorporate strategy to keep wages low. It clearly will replace the jobs \nof American workers.\n  Let me describe a study that was recently done. Professor George \nBorjas of the John F. Kennedy School of Government did a study on the \nimpact from 1980 to 2000 on U.S. wages by ethnicity. What he said is \nthe kind of integration occurring with people taking substandard-wage \njobs--and incidentally, corporations have been wanting to do that \nbecause if someone is illegal, they can pay them little or nothing. \nThey don't have a lot of leverage with the employer. What he said is it \nhas decreased income for the average American worker. It has decreased \nincome for the Hispanic workers more than anyone, talking about the \nHispanic workers who are part of the workforce legally, and it has \ndecreased income for African Americans, Whites, and Asian. But \nHispanics and African-Americans have been the hardest hit of all.\n  The fact is, with this illegal immigration and now on top of that, \nhundreds of thousands of so-called guest workers on top of the visas \nthat already exist, there isn't any way to describe what this is going \nto mean other than it is going to depress income for the lowest 20 to \n40 percent of the American workers, and it is going to take jobs from \nthe lowest 20 to 40 percent of the American labor force.\n  I remember Ross Perot when he talked about NAFTA, the horrible trade \nagreement that has dramatically injured our country. He was then \ntalking about American jobs going to Mexico. He called it that giant \nsucking sound, that giant sucking sound, sucking American jobs to \nMexico. He was right about that. All the economists, all the hotshots \nwho got paid all the money on behalf of American businesses \nparticularly supporting NAFTA told us: Some jobs will go there. They \nwill be low-skilled, low-wage jobs.\n  Oh, I am sorry. We have some experience now. Mr. President, do you \nknow what those jobs are? The three biggest imports into this country \nfrom Mexico are automobiles, automobile parts, and electronics, all of \nthem the product of high-skilled jobs but not high wages. They \ndisplaced high-skilled, high-wage jobs in this country. Now that giant \nsucking sound will be heard from the other direction. That giant \nsucking sound will be sucking 400,000 immigrant workers into this \ncountry each year at the bottom of the economic ladder to displace \nworkers in this country. I am not talking about the 11 million; I am \ntalking about 400,000 additional workers who will displace American \nworkers and continue to put downward pressure on wages.\n  I don't understand what the thinking is of people who decide that \nthey want to find a way to continue to diminish opportunities in our \ncountry for our workers. I think of what a turnabout this has been for \nthis country in a century. There was a time when American workers were \nvalued, work was valued. No one stood quite as tall as those who had a \ngood job.\n  I am going to speak on this next week again, and I know others have \nsome time, but I do want to make one final point. I have not yet spoken \nabout the security on our borders. Senator Domenici and I introduced \nlegislation dealing with real border security, which I expect we will \ntalk about additionally. While I have talked about jobs and income and \nimmigration, the issue here is in addition to security, a country \ntargeted by terrorists has to have secure borders. A country that is \nsuch a magnet for illegal immigration has to have secure borders. A \ncountry that cares about its workers has to have secure borders. A \ncountry that cares about the ability of a worker to find a job and have \na decent wage and have retirement benefits has to care about the \nsecurity of its borders. It is just that simple.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, before the Senator from North Dakota \nleaves, I have been paying attention to his comments and feel strongly \nthat he has made very good points. I am going to zero in on areas he \ndid not cover. I suspect he will agree with many.\n  One point is there is an answer to stopping our perforated borders. \nThere is a means of doing it a lot cheaper than people have talked \nabout. And the other point is a requirement for English to be the \nofficial language. It is a rather complicated subject, but those two \nareas I think the Senator probably would agree with me, as I agree with \nmost of the remarks he has made.\n  First, Mr. President, for some reason, I have never been sure why it \nis, but I have been invited to speak at more naturalization ceremonies \nin my State of Oklahoma than any other Members, I believe. It is always \na very touching event for me because these people go through the \nprocess, the legal process, of becoming a citizen of the United States, \nas my grandparents had to do. They learned the language. They learned \nmore about the history of this country than the average person you will \nrun into on the streets of Washington, DC. And these people are so \nproud.\n  I recall one guy. He is from Vietnam. His name is Thi Van Nguyen. He \nis an outstanding young man, and he had worked hard to become a \ncitizen. I happened to be a speaker at his naturalization ceremony that \nwas taking place in one of the courthouses in Oklahoma.\n  After the ceremony was over, he went down and changed his name to \nJames Thi Nguyen, instead of Thi Van Nguyen, which was the highest \nhonor one can pay because here is a person who wanted to go through the \nprocess of becoming a citizen the right way. It appears to me anything \nshort of a slap in the face to all these people who came here legally \nand did it right.\n  I would like to mention a couple of areas I am going to be offering \nin the way of amendments. One is what we call the National Border and \nNeighborhood Watch Program or the BRAVE Force. There is an acronym for \neverything. It stands for border regiment assisting in valuable \nenforcement.\n  I think we have learned one thing that probably most of us knew \nalready. I draw from a background of having been a developer in south \nTexas right on the Texas border. I have been there many times, and I \nhave been down there actually working and developing for some 35, 40 \nyears.\n  It happens I am an aviator, so I would always fly my own plane down \nthere and land at Cameron County Airport. It is adjacent to the \nimmigration center. I would watch and see what was going on. Yes, we \nare taking good care of those people.\n  I started getting interested in it. I said: What is the negative? \nWhat are\n\n[[Page S2580]]\n\nthese people facing should they be caught trying to come illegally over \nthe border? They go into the center. So I looked over at the center and \nsaw half were in brown jumpsuits and half were in orange jumpsuits. I \nsaid: What is the reason for that?\n  They said: A football team brown versus the green and basketball and \nother activities.\n  Probably the food--I went over and inspected it--is better than most \npeople would eat in their country.\n  I looked at that and thought: We aren't really offering much of a \ndisincentive for people to come in illegally.\n  This program we call the Brave Force Program recognizes that our \nborders can be closed, our borders can be strong borders, and we can \nstop people from coming in. I am sick and tired of people saying this \ncan't be done or it can only be done with a certain kind of fence. \nThere are areas with serious problems, but the answer is in numbers.\n  The minutemen demonstrated very clearly that if you have enough \npeople down there and take a 35-mile area, you can stop people from \ncoming across. I recognize the criticism of that program. I don't agree \nwith it. Certainly there is some authentic argument against it when \nthey say these people are not law enforcement people. They are not \ntrained that way.\n  I found out something after 9/11 when we were dealing with the TSA, \nand that is that Federal law enforcement officers have a mandatory \nretirement age of 57. Since I have worked with them before, I started \ngetting letters from them saying: Why can't we come in as sky marshals \nand other positions? We, as an organization, would be willing to do it \njust for cost, just to pay our expenses.\n  If we had an army down there, as my amendment calls for, these people \nare available. It is virtually just for the cost of sustaining these \npeople while they are on watch. There would be an army of law \nenforcement officers for each trained Border Patrol agent. Then we have \nthe neighborhood watch people who are volunteers and are not trained \nproperly, but they can help the second tier.\n  There would be three tiers. We would have the trained Border Patrol \npeople, then the retired law enforcement officers, and then, of course, \nthe neighborhood watch people. It is a numbers game that has been very \nsuccessful and has worked.\n  Civilian volunteers, much like the minutemen, would be able to report \nto those who are in a higher level of training. I think this BRAVE \nForce would be effective. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to \nsee we can do something on the border. It is just we have not been able \nto do it.\n  Let me interject that as one of the high-ranking members of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, I certainly don't want to get sucked \ninto the point where we are going to have to use military people on \nthese borders when they are already overworked. The OPTEMPO of our \nmilitary right now is at an unacceptable rate. By ``military,'' I mean \nour standing forces, as well as the Reserve components--the Guard and \nReserve. This wouldn't affect that. This would ensure we are not going \nto have to further dilute our military.\n  That is one of the amendments I am going to offer. The second one has \nto do with the English language. I know people get all exercised about \nthis issue. The language is taken almost verbatim from Peter King's \nHouse Resolution 4408 by strengthening a very weak provision in the \nJudiciary Committee bill that will be under consideration here, that \nillegal immigrants currently in the United States must merely \n``demonstrate an effort'' to learn English when applying for a green \ncard.\n  Anyone can demonstrate an effort to do anything. You don't have to do \nanything to do that. So that is a meaningless phrase. There is no \nrequirement whatsoever. My amendment would require these immigrants to \nlearn our language by making English the official language of the \nUnited States and making all official business of the United States \nconducted in English, including publications, tax forms, information \nmaterial, and other items.\n  As a matter of fact, my amendment follows what at least 26 other \nStates already have at the State level. They have English as the \nofficial language. Half the States already have that, and there is \nnothing wrong with making that uniform throughout the United States.\n  Making English the official language would eliminate about $1 billion \nto $2 billion annually that we spend on providing language assistance, \nincluding Federal agencies and funds recipients, according to the \nOffice of Management and Budget.\n  Studies show that those who know English get better jobs, earn more \nmoney, and are less likely to be uninsured. As a result, English \ndecreases Government dependency.\n  This will come as a shock to you, Mr. President, because they think--\nand I do speak Spanish. I have worked for many years in areas--I was a \ncommercial pilot in some of the Latin American countries. I know the \nlanguage fairly well, so I can communicate. But I do know this: There \nare a lot of immigrants in this country who support English as the \nlanguage.\n  In 1995, there was a poll--I talked about this once before on the \nfloor--by Luntz Research, and it said that more than 80 percent of \nimmigrants supported making English the official language.\n  Eighty percent. These are the ones who are supposed to be against it. \nThey are not against it, they are for it.\n  The need for official English appears in our newspapers every day--\ninjuries in the workplace, lawsuits over mistranslation in hospitals, \npeople who are unable to support their families--all because they can't \nspeak English. Making English the official language would also help \nimmigrants assimilate, which is vitally important to becoming an \nAmerican and preserving our rich heritage.\n  As my colleague, Senator Alexander, said yesterday--and I thought so \nmuch of this, I got his quotes--he said:\n\n       Becoming an American--\n\n  This is very significant--\n\n       Becoming an American is also a unique accomplishment \n     because it has nothing to do with ancestry.\n\n  In other countries, it has to do with ancestry. My family came from \nGermany, so we all come from different places.\n  He said:\n\n       America is an idea, not a race. We are united by principles \n     expressed in our founding documents--the very principles that \n     we are debating in this immigration legislation--not by our \n     multiple ancestries.\n\n  I am still quoting from Senator Alexander, who made this speech \nyesterday, which is well researched and well thought out.\n\n       Some suggest that our diversity is what makes our country \n     great. To be sure, diversity is one of our strengths, but \n     diversity is not our greatest strength. Jerusalem is diverse. \n     The Balkans are diverse. Iraq is diverse. The greatest \n     accomplishment of the United States of America is that we \n     have molded that magnificent diversity into one Nation based \n     upon a set of common principles, language, and traditions. \n     That is why the words above the desk--\n\n  And the desks of many of us, including mine--\n\n       say ``One from many,'' not ``Many from one.''\n\n  Clearly, as Senator Alexander so eloquently stated, our Nation is \nunique among the nations of the world in that we welcome people from \nall countries and backgrounds to become Americans. By becoming \nAmericans, they are saying they want to adopt our laws and our way of \nlife, and this includes speaking English. It is very much like the case \nI just cited to you of Thi Van Nguyen coming in so emotionally wrapped \nup. It wasn't enough just to become a citizen of the United States, he \nwanted to adopt my name.\n  Some of our colleagues as well as the people watching us may think \nthis amendment is unnecessary because they mistakenly think English is \nour official language anyway, but it is not. I have received \nconstituent letters insisting that the Senate do something about \nbilingual ballots, bilingual education, and driver's licenses in other \nlanguages.\n  People in my State of Oklahoma are angry, and they have good reason \nto be so. It seems there are those who object to immigrants learning a \nsingle word of English. This is not an exaggeration. In the April 10, \n2006, issue of The Nation magazine, an article called ``Strangers in \nthe Land'' seriously asks:\n\n\n[[Page S2581]]\n\n\n       Why should linguistic competence be a factor--or acceptable \n     as an item for democratic debate--in determining citizenship? \n     As my comrade for a day in Los Angeles would attest, a \n     nonEnglish speaker in the United States not only can get and \n     hold down a job; she--\n\n  Or he--\n\n     can also turn out the vote. Why should a nonEnglish speaker \n     be allowed to mobilize for American democracy, not to join it \n     as a citizen?\n\n  Learning the language and learning something about American history \nwas something the ancestors of nearly everyone in this Chamber \naccomplished as a matter of course. All of a sudden, everything is \nchanging, and we are told that it is unfair to expect today's \nimmigrants to do likewise. Yet if people are not encouraged to learn \nEnglish, they will be dependent upon translation services for the rest \nof their lives. There is nothing wrong with using a translator. I have \ndone so on my trips to Africa quite often. But it is dangerous to rely \nentirely upon the accuracy of any translator, especially in one's own \ncountry. The competence of any given interpreter is all too often in \nthe eye of the beholder.\n  Judge Wayne Purdom told the National Law Review that once \ninterpreters are in place, the arguments have only begun:\n\n       Sometimes one interpreter is very critical of another's \n     translation--right in the middle of the courtroom--and they \n     will interrupt and contradict each other and say the other \n     person's translation is inaccurate.\n\n  We have seen it happen. We have documented cases. Even the \ntranslation currently required at the polls has failed to accomplish \nits intended purpose: helping people cast an informed ballot.\n  Consider the 2000 election: In one community in New York, the Chinese \nbilingual ballot translated the ``Democratic'' label on all State races \nas ``Republican,'' while ``Republican'' was translated to be \n``Democrat.'' Consequently, we know the results.\n\n  In the 1983 case of People v. Diaz--and we have talked about this \nbefore--a California court confessed, and I am quoting now from the \nrecord:\n\n       We recognize that frequently there is no single word in a \n     foreign language which carries the identical meaning of a \n     single word in the English language. We examined four \n     different Spanish translations of the Miranda advisement at \n     issue.\n\n  That was the case going on at that time.\n\n       We discovered that none of these translations was \n     identical.\n\n  If governments do not agree on the proper Spanish translation of the \nphrase ``You have the right to remain silent,'' how can they accurately \ntranslate the context of legal documents? And the short answer is, they \ncannot. But legal language is complex because it is meant to be exact. \nTranslation may muddy that precision.\n  I can see the day when someone will go to court claiming that the \nSpanish translation of some piece of legislation has a different \nmeaning than the English version does. In the absence of an official \nlanguage, there would be no way to resolve that dispute.\n  For decades now, we have looked the other way while multilingual \nmandate was piled upon multilingual mandate. State and local taxpayers \nhave shouldered much of the fiscal burden for our insistence upon \nwelfare forms in Spanish and school documents in Cantonese. Immigrants, \ntoo, have suffered from this ``reign of multilingual micromanaging.''\n  The National Review just this week put the problem in a very vivid \nperspective, and I will quote because I want this in the Record:\n\n       I was reading Li Shaomin's account of being held in China \n     over long months.\n\n  Some of us will remember that.\n\n       Li recounted how the Communist security thugs taunted him \n     and tried to break him. Taking his passport, they said, \n     ``This will do you no good. You may have an American \n     passport, but you are not a real American, and never will be. \n     You were born in China, and you will always be Chinese.\n\n  Every bilingual ballot and every multilingual government document \nsends this same message to immigrants: You are not a real American, and \nyou never will be. This is wrong.\n  Thankfully, America's Hispanic immigrants are turning out this vile \nmessage that they need not bother to learn English.\n  Hispanic Magazine recently carried a story, ``The Next Generation of \nHispanic TV is in English.'' Allow me to read a paragraph from this \nnews story:\n\n       Most U.S. Latinos are bilingual, 54.7 percent, say Census \n     data, and consume media in both Spanish and English. The 2002 \n     National Survey of Latinos by the Pew Hispanic Center found \n     that 46 percent of second-generation and 78 percent of third-\n     generation adult Hispanics speak mostly English.\n\n  The Pew Hispanic Center echoed these findings in 2004:\n\n       In one key segment of the Hispanic population--likely \n     voters in U.S. elections--the English language media is the \n     dominant source of news. More than half of Latino voters, 53 \n     percent, get all of their news in English and 40 percent get \n     news from media in both languages, while only 6 percent of \n     likely voters get all their news in Spanish.\n\n  Statistics such as these are counter to what most people think. The \nidea that 80 percent of the immigrants want English to be the official \nlanguage is really pretty incredible. Hispanics are learning English, \nthey are willing to learn English and support the idea that immigrants \nshould learn English. Only the groups which claim to represent the \nHispanic people seem to have a problem with the English language. Of \ncourse, should Hispanic immigrants fail to learn English, these self-\nstyled Hispanic leaders will benefit from their ignorance.\n  John Miller of National Review told The Washington Post, correctly, \non May 28, 1998:\n\n       On the whole, there is an American national identity that \n     immigrants ought to be encouraged to assimilate into.\n\n  A recent Zogby poll confirmed that most Hispanic Americans still \nagree with Mr. Miller. Eighty-four percent of Americans, including 77 \npercent of Hispanics, believe English should be the official language. \nSo there were two totally different polls taken at different times \ncoming to the same conclusions. We are not doing them any favors.\n  I think a lot of politicians are so afraid they are not going to get \nthe Hispanic vote in some of these highly populated Hispanic States, \nand they are misinterpreting. To me, it is insulting to the Hispanic \ncommunity to say: You cannot be a real American unless you learn--just \nby sitting on the side lines. I believe they are all capable of \nlearning it and they are able to do it and they are willing to do it.\n  The other polls have similar findings. Ninety-one percent of foreign-\nborn Latino immigrants agree that learning English is essential to \nsucceeding in the United States, according to a 2002 Kaiser Family \nFoundation poll. A 2002 Carnegie/Public Agenda poll found that by more \nthan a 2-to-1 margin, immigrants themselves say the United States \nshould expect new immigrants to learn English. These are immigrants \nsaying that they expect to have to learn English.\n  My official English amendment is the only popular thing to do, the \nright thing to do, and it is the fiscally necessary thing to do. \nMultilingual government is not cheap, and translation is not free. This \nNation is at war with a relentless foe. Just as a family seeking to \nreduce expenditures will reexamine its budget to look for needless \nfrills, so too must the U.S. Government.\n  I also wish to mention the two pictures I brought with me today. As \nthe old saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words. There is \nnothing I could say that would be more telling than these pictures, \ntaken of high school students in California raising the Mexican flag \nabove an upside down American flag. This is not only disgraceful, it is \ndisgusting and a slap in the face at everything for which this great \ncountry stands. These students are living here enjoying the benefits of \nthe United States, not Mexico. But this is happening all over the \ncountry, it is not just California. I believe this picture demonstrates \nwhat I have been talking about--that we desperately need to seal our \nborders and instill ways of helping immigrants know and love this \ncountry and appreciate the sacrifices made for the liberties they would \nbe enjoying.\n  So there are two amendments that I have. One would go a long way to \nsecuring the border. I know it will work; it has been demonstrated by \nnumbers. That is the name of the game. Secondly, making English the \nofficial language of the United States of America, to do away with this \ntype of thing.\n  Over 2 years ago, on January 7, 2004, after President Bush's press \nconference\n\n[[Page S2582]]\n\non Fair and Secure Immigration Reform, I announced my principles \nregarding immigration reform:\n  I would oppose any program that would shortcut the current \nnaturalization process;\n  I would oppose any program that rewards illegal aliens for their \nillegal acts;\n  I would oppose any program that does not further address the porous \nnature of our borders.\n  I remain true to those principles today. Let me elaborate.\n  I agree with the 1997 U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform which \nstated that measured, legal immigration has lead to create one of the \nworld's greatest ``multiethnic nations.''\n  I also agree with the commission that immigrants who are \n``Americanized'' help cultivate a shared commitment to ``liberty, \ndemocracy and equal opportunity'' in our Nation.\n  However, I cannot stand idly by and watch this great Nation collapse \nunder the pressure of illegal immigration.\n  Roy Beck, executive director of Numbers USA, a nonprofit organization \ndedicated to immigration reform, stated that:\n\n       A presence of 8 to 11 million illegal aliens in this \n     country is a sign that this country has lost control of its \n     borders and the ability to determine who is a member of this \n     national community . . . a country that has lost that ability \n     increasingly loses its ability to determine the rules of its \n     society--environmental protections, labor protections, health \n     protections, safety protections.\n\n  Beck goes on to say:\n\n       In fact, a country that cannot keep illegal immigration to \n     a low level quickly ceases to be a real country, or a real \n     community. Rather than being self-governed, such a country \n     begins to have its destiny largely determined by citizens of \n     other countries who manage to move in illegally.\n\n  Illegal immigrants continue to flood our borders and cause a myriad \nof problems for our country and law-abiding citizens like you and me.\n  For example, according to the Center for Immigration Studies, CIS, a \nnonprofit immigration reform organization, some of the most violent \ncriminals at-large today are illegal immigrants, not to mention the \nterrorists who have illegally entered our country or overstayed their \nvisas.\n  I would like to share a personal story regarding illegal aliens who \ncommit crimes in the United States and then flee across the border to \nMexico.\n  Last May, my friend's son, Jeff Garrett, was tragically shot by an \nillegal alien while Jeff was turkey hunting in Colorado.\n  Ater he shot Jeff, the alien fled to Mexico where he is hiding today.\n  I know this story is just one among many about police officers and \nother innocent Americans murdered each year by illegal aliens who then \nfind safe harbor in Mexico.\n  We must prevent these criminals from coming across our borders.\n  Not only are illegal immigrants increasing by crossing the border in \ndroves, they are having ``anchor babies'' in rapid numbers.\n  These babies are helping the immigration population grow more rapidly \nthan the birth rate of American citizens.\n  In fact, the Census Bureau estimates that at the time of the 2000 \nCensus, the illegal immigration population reached approximately 8 \nmillion.\n  Therefore, according to this estimate, the illegal-alien population \ngrew by almost half a million a year in the 1990s.\n  These numbers are derived from a draft report given to the House \nImmigration Subcommittee by the INS that estimated the illegal \npopulation was around 3.5 million in 1990.\n  In order for the illegal population to have reached 8 million by \n2000, the net increase would be around 400,000 to 500,000 per year \nduring the 1990s.\n  According to CIS, based on numbers from the National Center for \nHealth Statistics, in 2002 there were about 8.4 million illegal aliens, \nwhich represent about 3.3 percent of the total U.S. population.\n  That same year, there were about 383,000 babies born to illegal \naliens, which represented about 9.5 percent of all U.S. births in 2002.\n  Additionally, in the Spring 2005 issue of the American Physicians and \nSurgeons Journal, Dr. Madeleine Pelner Cosman says:\n\n       American hospitals welcome anchor babies. Illegal alien \n     women come to the hospital in labor and drop their little \n     anchors, each of whom pulls its illegal alien mother, father, \n     and siblings into permanent residency simply by being born \n     within our borders.\n\n  Anchor babies are, and instantly qualify for public welfare aid. \nBetween--300,000 and 350,000 anchor babies annually become citizens \nbecause of the fourteenth amendment to the U.S. Constitution:\n\n       All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and \n     subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the \n     United States and the State wherein they reside.\n\n  Dr. Cosman continues:\n\n       In 2003 in Stockton, California, 70 percent of the 2,300 \n     babies born in San Joaquin General Hospital's maternity ward \n     were anchor babies, and 45 percent of Stockton children under \n     age six are Latino (up from 30 percent in 1993). In 1994, \n     74,987 anchor babies in California hospital maternity units \n     cost $215 million and constituted 36 percent of all Medi-Cal \n     births. Now they account for substantially more than half.\n\n  These anchor babies are being used to enable their parents to skirt \nthe law, cross our borders, and bring in additional, illegal aliens.\n  Furthermore, as the law currently stands, by allowing these children \nto be considered citizens, it is an incentive for more aliens to \nillegally cross into our country.\n  I am very concerned about the cost these illegal immigrants have on \nthe U.S. economy.\n  Because illegal workers do not pay income taxes, it is estimated that \nthe Federal Government could be spending $35 billion a year in unpaid \ntaxes, according to Gear Stearns Asset Management.\n  This figure does not include additional costs spent on illegal \nimmigrants for welfare, healthcare, education, and imprisonment.\n  In fact, according to Americans for Immigration Control, a \nnonpartisan, grassroots organization, the implications for these \nillegal immigrants in the future could cost upwards of $1,500 per year \nif these same illegal immigrants are granted amnesty because they would \nsuddenly have access to many social programs for which they are not \ncurrently eligible.\n\n  This means the government could spend an additional $6 billion in \nwelfare expenditures alone.\n  Taxpayers also pay for illegal immigrant's healthcare.\n  According to the Oklahoma Health Care Authority, illegal immigrant \nwomen living in my State gave birth to 2,600 babies in 2005. Delivery \nof these children cost $6.5 million, or 83 percent of all Medicaid \nmoney that is spent on healthcare for illegal immigrants in Oklahoma.\n  Taxpayers also pay every time an illegal alien visits an emergency \nroom; which they often use as their primary healthcare provider.\n  Federal prisons are also feeling the strain from illegal immigrants.\n  June 2003, criminal aliens comprised 34,456 of the prisoners held in \nFederal prisons.\n  According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, holding criminal \naliens in Federal prisons cost taxpayers $891 million in 2002.\n  In Oklahoma alone, the estimated annual operating expenditure for \nFederal prisons was almost $12,000 per noncitizen inmate in 1999.\n  Additionally, elementary and secondary education is often one of the \nmost expensive programs funded by State and local governments.\n  A 1982 Supreme Court ruling entitles children of illegal immigrants \nto taxpayer-funded government education.\n  Today, according to the Urban Institute, an estimated 1.1 million \nschool-aged children of illegal immigrants are living in our country.\n  The cost of educating these illegal students is almost $2 billion per \nyear and is projected to top $27 billion per year in the near future, \naccording to Americans for Immigration Control.\n  Considering the burden and risk of the current level of illegal \nimmigration, I firmly believe it is vital to secure our borders first, \nbefore we address any other immigration issue.\n  What the Judiciary Committee voted out is amnesty; it allows \nvirtually anyone who is here illegally or who wants to come here to \napply for citizenship.\n  This is a reward for law-breakers. It is essentially an open flow for \nimmigration.\n  We have seen in the past that this approach does not work.\n\n[[Page S2583]]\n\n  For instance, in 1986, the Immigration Reform and Control Act, IRCA, \ngranted amnesty for illegal immigrants already here in return for \nstrict prohibitions against future illegal entrants.\n  In place of promised outcomes, however, the number of illegal aliens \nhas more than tripled since IRCA was passed.\n  Another problem with the Judiciary Committee bill has to do with \ncollege tuition for illegal aliens.\n  While current law allows States to determine whether or not they will \nprovide in-State tuition at colleges and universities for illegal \naliens, the Judiciary Committee bill includes a provision whereby the \nFederal Government mandates that States provide in-State tuition for \nillegal aliens.\n  This is unfair for the thousands of out-of-State students who must \npay higher tuition costs than illegal immigrants who have broken the \nlaw and do not belong in our country.\n  Some say we don't necessarily need as many guest workers as the \nJudiciary Committee bill allows.\n  For example, economist Philip Martin of the University of California \nsays that, when the ``Bracero'' program of the 1960s that brought in \nseasonal Mexican laborers was discontinued in 1964, the California \ntomato industry that had depended on these workers developed oblong \ntomatoes that could be picked by a machine--increasing California's \ntomato output five times more than what it was before the machines were \nused.\n  In a recent Washington Post article, Robert Samuelson expresses his \nview that with a massive guest worker program, we are importing \npoverty.\n  Referring to guest workers, Samuelson says:\n\n     . . . they generally don't go home, assimilation is slow and \n     the ranks of the poor are constantly replenished. Since 1980 \n     the number of Hispanics with incomes below the government's \n     poverty line (about $19,300 in 2004 for a family of four) has \n     risen 162%. Over the same period, the number of non-Hispanic \n     whites in poverty rose 3% and the number of blacks, 9.5%.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       What we have now--and would have with guest workers--is a \n     conscious policy of creating poverty in the United States \n     while relieving Mexico. By and large, this is a bad bargain \n     for the United States. It stresses local schools, hospitals \n     and housing; it feeds social tensions (the Minutemen have \n     witnessed this) . . .\n\n  As a matter of fact, according to the Pew Hispanic Center, the \nillegal immigrants that are currently here only represent about 4.9 \npercent of the labor force; they represent 36 percent of insulation \nworkers, 28 percent of drywall installers, and 20 percent of cooks.\n  These illegal immigrants, while large in numbers, are not the \nmajority of the workforce.\n  I ask that we consider the Frist bill which, though not perfect, \nwould increase enforcement and border security.\n  I further ask that we not bring up the Judiciary Committee's amnesty \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to this \ndebate on reforming our immigration system. While many of us here may \nhave our differences, I think one thing on which we all agree is that \nthe current system is broken and something must be done now if we are \never to get this situation under control.\n  There does seem to be a consensus in this body, and I think it is \nappropriate, that we absolutely must strengthen our borders. I \npersonally believe that securing our borders has to be a priority in \nwhat we achieve in this legislation. Our borders have been porous for \nyears and we must take adequate steps to secure them, and we must do it \nnow.\n  This is a homeland security issue, first and foremost, but it is also \na good government issue. American taxpayers continue to see their tax \ndollars spent on securing our borders without the results they deserve. \nWhile traffic from areas where we have placed more enforcement has \ndecreased, border crossings in total have risen by 43 percent, despite \ntripling patrol personnel. The cost of an arrest has increased from \n1992, when it was $300, to the cost of $1,700 in 2002.\n  Americans cannot afford this type of performance from a security \nstandpoint or an economic standpoint. At a time when America is facing \nits most serious threat and dealing with record deficits, having our \nborders remaining unsecured as we spend more on them is simply \nunacceptable. It is unacceptable to the American people in terms of \nsecurity and economics.\n  But securing our borders without dealing with the over 12 million \nundocumented immigrants who are in this country is not the solution \neither. One without the other is not going to achieve the results we \nwant in the cost-effective way we must do it.\n  Many in this body are probably somewhat unaware that my State of \nArkansas had the largest per-capita increase of its Hispanic population \nof any State in the Nation during the last census. Arkansas has become \nwhat is referred to as an emerging Hispanic community, with largely \nfirst-generation immigrants. These immigrants have a dramatic impact on \nour communities and on our economies. They are hard working, they are \nactive in the religious community, they are law abiding, and they are \nputting their children through school. Whether they came here legally \nor illegally, they are establishing roots and we cannot dispute that. \nThe majority of immigrants in my State came to the United States \nbecause they wanted good work and a better way of life for their \nfamilies. A good number of them are educated and wanted to take \nadvantage of the opportunities afforded to them in the U.S. economy. \nThis is why a plan based on ripping these roots out of the ground and \ndeporting over 10 million people is simply not realistic.\n  First, we couldn't afford it. Second, I am not sure we could \nimplement it. And then think of what it would do to our economy.\n  While these people may have come here illegally, many of them have \nbeen here long enough now to have become part of the fabric of our \ncommunities. Removing them will break up families and it will hurt our \nlocal economies.\n  I am not saying we should grant amnesty, and neither does the \namendment Senator Specter has offered. It is critical to know that \namnesty is not the answer. No reform should grant amnesty. Total and \nimmediate forgiveness for past crimes--these are not things we believe \nin this country. The rule of law is critical. To do so would severely \nundermine the rule of law in this country.\n  As I stated, it is impractical to believe, though, that we can simply \nround up and deport all illegals in this country. It is also unlikely \nwe can coax illegals out of the shadows by offering them a limited \nperiod to remain in this country before we eventually deport them. They \nwill continue to hide and move around in the same networks that have \nprotected them thus far.\n  I believe the solution is earned legalization, and that is why I have \nsupported the McCain-Kennedy bill and the similar bill that was passed \nout of the committee, offered as a substitute by Senator Specter.\n  Some have characterized these bills as amnesty. Amnesty is a general \npardon for a previous crime. By contrast, this reform plan includes \nserious consequences for those who remain in our country illegally.\n  Under the committee bill, an illegal immigrant faces an immediate \n$1,000 fine, a security background check, application for a work visa, \nand an 11-year path to citizenship. Most immigrants who apply for \ncitizenship now achieve that in 5 to 6 years. After staying \ncontinuously employed for 6 years, paying all back taxes, learning \nEnglish--as my colleague from Oklahoma has expressed as being a very \nimportant part of this--learning U.S. history and government, and \npaying another $1,000 fine in application costs, the worker could then \napply for a green card and legalization.\n  That is not going to the front of the line, but it is going to the \nend of the line after those who have already chosen a legal path to \nbegin with. Their green card application, as I said, will go to the \nback of the line behind all the legal applicants who are waiting for \nthose green cards. Finally, this path is only available to the illegal \nimmigrants who were here before January of 2004.\n  This does not sound like amnesty to me. It sounds like a challenge \nbut a challenge that presents excellent rewards instead of the dire \nconsequences\n\n[[Page S2584]]\n\nwe would suffer if we took an irrational reaction to this enormous \nproblem that is growing in our Nation.\n  The other path for an illegal immigrant would be to continue trying \nto hide. But now, under increased enforcement measures and stiffer \npenalties as we have seen that we would put into place under this bill, \nI believe the majority of the people who have come here illegally but \ncame to make a better life for themselves, will emerge from those \nshadows to become legal residents of their communities, to engage in \nwhat we came here to seek, because we have provided for them a pathway \nto become legal.\n  It comes at cost. It comes at great cost to them, both financially as \nwell as the time they have to spend to engage themselves in becoming \nlegal residents of this great Nation. But it is worth it to them and it \nis worth it to us to set this issue straight, to begin to reform a \nproblem that is growing desperately out of control.\n  Many of them already pay local taxes in the communities where they \nare. Some of them are paying into Medicare and Social Security with no \npromise of receiving any of the benefits. But think how we could \nstrengthen those programs if we put them on a pathway to legalization. \nWe know who these 12 million undocumented workers are and we put them \ninto the system to strengthen Social Security and Medicare by assuring \nthat their withholdings are coming out and going into the system as \nwell.\n  I am reminded of an incident in my home State of Arkansas. Recently, \nwe saw law enforcement officials who were acting on a tip from an \ninformant. These were national law enforcement officials. They did not \ncontact the local law enforcement in our small communities there in \nArkansas, but the folks from Washington swooped into a poultry \nprocessing plant and they arrested approximately 120 workers who were \ncarrying forged or illegal identification documents.\n  What occurred there does not make what those illegal immigrants did \nright. It doesn't make it right at all. They were there illegally. They \nwere there with forged documents. Actually, it was a local U.S. citizen \nin the community who had helped produce those documents for them. But I \nwant you for a moment to think about what occurred after these \nWashington law enforcement officials swooped into a community without \nnotifying the local law enforcement and seized 120 workers.\n  Most of these workers were parents. They are parents who were not \nallowed to call home to tell their children what was happening. We had \nchildren who were left behind in the care of the Catholic Church, or \nfriends, or anybody who would take care of these children. Some of them \nwere as young as 12 months old--kids abandoned because the parents were \nnot allowed to call.\n  It was a sudden and brutal act and it separated families and left a \ncommunity divided. Not because people wanted to defend the illegals who \nwere there, the undocumented, or those who were there with false \ndocuments, but because of the way it was handled. That is what we are \nhere to debate. Not that we differ about that. I don't think anybody in \nthis body wants amnesty. They don't. What they want to do is to make \nsure we handle this issue in the right way.\n  I would imagine most of my colleagues in this body learned, as I did, \nat an early age from their parents that there is a right way and a \nwrong way to do everything. We have an opportunity to come together, to \nfigure out the right way that is consistent with the American values we \nall hold dear, to figure out a solution to this enormous problem that \ncontinues to grow. It reflects on who we are as Americans with respect \nfor the rule of law, making sure that people know they have to follow \nthe law and they have to act within the confines of the law, but with \nthe kind of encouragement that every human being should be allowed to \nreach their potential.\n  You can pay those fines, you can take the initiative and learn \nEnglish and learn about this great country. You can get back at the end \nof the line after having tried to break into the line in front and \nstill have the ability to reach that potential if you are willing to \npay for your mistakes. That is what this bill is about.\n\n  When I think of the calls for the arrest and the deportation of 10 to \n20 million undocumented immigrants in this country, I think of that \nfrightful night in Arkansas where children and parents were severed in \nan unruly way. Their families were destroyed. Children were left by \nthemselves without anyone to care for them because law enforcement had \nnot thought that out.\n  I think of that frightful night in Arkansas and then I see it \nmultiplied thousands of times across this country. That is not the \nright way to handle this issue. As Americans, we can be smart. Yes, we \ncan be diligent and we can even be tough. But we can be tough in a way \nthat reflects the values of who we are and how this Nation was \ncreated--by giving people opportunity and requiring responsibility.\n  We stand at a crossroads in this country. Over the last decade and a \nhalf, the Latino population has expanded in every area of our country, \nmany of them coming here legally but some illegally. We are faced with \na decision that gets to the heart of what values we hold dear as \nAmericans. We have always said: If you work hard and you play by the \nrules, there is a place for you in America to raise your children and \ncontribute to our great melting pot, to strengthen our communities, to \nbe a part of this great land.\n  We are faced now with what to do with some who have broken the rules \nto come here but have since worked hard to provide for their families. \nI hope the Senate will give this very difficult question the reasoned \nand thorough debate it deserves, but that we will not forget the \nbalance, the very intricate balance of American values that brings out \nthe rule of law and the importance of the rule of law but also the \ndesire and the compassion we feel. That is what the American spirit is \nall about.\n  I believe the Senate will agree to welcome those who came here \nillegally if they are willing to show another American value, and that \nis sacrifice. We all know a great deal about sacrifice as we see \nincredible Americans, men and women in the Armed Forces and all over \nthis country, whether it is our emergency responders or others. If we \nsee those who have come here illegally showing that willingness to \nexhibit that American value of sacrifice, then I think we as a body \nwill be able to produce something to welcome them into our great \nsociety and our great Nation.\n  I urge my colleagues, as we continue in this debate, that we keep our \nheads calm and our minds open.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3206 to Amendment No. 3192\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl], for himself and Mr. \n     Cornyn, proposes an amendment numbered 3206 to amendment No. \n     3192.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with and that this be designated the Kyl-Cornyn amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n      (Purpose: To make certain aliens ineligible for conditional \n              nonimmigrant work authorization and status)\n\n       On page 329, line 11, insert ``(other than subparagraph \n     (C)(i)(II) of such paragraph (9))'' after ``212(a)''.\n       On page 330, strike lines 10 through 15, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(3) Ineligibility.--An alien is ineligible for \n     conditional nonimmigrant work authorization and status under \n     this section if--\n       ``(A) the alien is subject to a final order of removal \n     under section 217, 235, 238, or 240;\n       ``(B) the alien failed to depart the United States during \n     the period of a voluntary departure order entered under \n     section 240B;\n       ``(C) the Secretary of Homeland Security determines that--\n       ``(i) the alien, having been convicted by a final judgment \n     of a serious crime, constitutes a danger to the community of \n     the United States;\n       ``(ii) there are reasonable grounds for believing that the \n     alien has committed a serious crime outside the United States \n     prior to\n\n[[Page S2585]]\n\n     the arrival of the alien in the United States; or\n       ``(iii) there are reasonable grounds for regarding the \n     alien as a danger to the security of the United States;\n       ``(D) the alien has been convicted of any felony or three \n     or more misdemeanors; or\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3207 to Amendment No. 3206\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3207 to amendment No. 3206.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment add the following:\n       This provision shall become effective 1 day after \n     enactment.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, Senator Cornyn and I introduced this \namendment, which is very simple in its terms but we think very \nimportant. The essence of it is to say that criminals should not \nparticipate in the temporary worker program and path to citizenship \nprogram that is allowed for under the bill that passed out of the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  It seems rather elemental that whatever program we have for \nimmigrants to this country, that they be people who have worked hard \nand played by the rules, as some people characterize it, that they be \nhard-working people who, other than perhaps coming into the country \nillegally, have been law-abiding citizens. That seems fairly elemental.\n  As a matter of fact, in the 1986 law that many have described as \namnesty and few think worked very well, there was a specific \nprohibition of that law applying to people who had been convicted of a \nfelony or three misdemeanors. That is the exact term that our amendment \nprovides for. If you have been convicted of a felony or three \nmisdemeanors, you are not eligible to participate in this program.\n  In addition, if you have been ordered by a judge to depart the United \nStates and you have violated that court order, you would not be \npermitted to participate in this program. Those are the two key points.\n  There is one other element to it, and that is having to do with prior \nconvictions of crimes and posing a threat to the United States. If the \nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary determines that you have been \nconvicted by final judgment of a serious crime and you constitute a \ndanger to the United States or that there are reasonable grounds to \nbelieve you have committed a serious crime outside of the United States \nbefore you arrived or that you are a danger to the security of the \nUnited States, then you would not be able to participate in this \nprogram either.\n  Now, as I said, this seems rather straightforward. Why would we allow \ncriminals to become citizens of the United States? Why, indeed? Why was \nthis provision left out of the underlying bill? Whatever the reasons, \nit shouldn't have been. This amendment fixes that.\n  Why is it important? For one reason, we have an awful lot of \ncriminals that have either come into the United States or people who \nhave illegally entered the United States and then committed serious \ncrimes, serious enough that they have had to be imprisoned in U.S. \nprisons. In fact, one of the exercises we go through every year around \nhere is to try to get Federal funding under SCAAP, which is called the \nState Criminal Alien Assistance Program, SCAAP funding, to reimburse \nStates and local governments for housing illegal-immigrant prisoners.\n  In the past, we felt that since it is the responsibility of the \nFederal Government to control the border and that has not been done, \nthat when one of these people commits a crime and is convicted of that \ncrime and imprisoned, the Federal Government ought to at least pay part \nof the expenses. It has usually been in the neighborhood of a fourth to \na third of the expenses.\n  Part of what Senator Cornyn and I propose is that we would increase \nthe amount of Federal support for the State and local governments for \nhousing these criminal illegal immigrants.\n  How big is the problem? Of the 1.5 million State and Federal \nprisoners in 2004, over 91,000 were foreign nationals. Think about \nthat: 91,000 criminals in prison were foreign nationals. About 57,000 \nin State prisons, about 34,000 in Federal prison.\n  The SCAAP funding gives us some idea of the number of these people. \nAs I said, it has paid roughly about a third of the expenses when we \nspend about $600 million a year; unfortunately, last year we only \nfunded $305 million. Even if it were funded at $700 million, it would \nrepresent about a third of State costs. That gives some idea of the \nmagnitude of expense associated with the housing of these illegal \nimmigrants.\n  With regard to the provision that deals with the so-called \nabsconders, people who went before a judge and the judge said, for \nwhatever reason, you must depart the United States, you are under court \norder to leave, but they don't, they just meld back into society, the \nBureau of Immigration Customs Enforcement estimates that there are more \nthan 400,000 such absconders and 80,000 fugitive criminal aliens with \noutstanding final orders of removal who are hiding in the United \nStates. These are people who have committed serious crimes. There is no \nway that these people should be allowed to get on this path to \ncitizenship or participate in this worker program.\n  The Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement estimated earlier \nthis month that the number of fugitive aliens in the United States is \nabout 465,000. Fugitives are foreign nationals who have been ordered \nremoved by a Federal immigration judge but failed to comply with the \norder.\n  From March 1 through September 30, 2003, which is when ICE began \ntracking fugitive apprehensions, there were 3,409 fugitives with final \norders of removal who were apprehended. In the same period, 2004, they \napprehended 7,239 fugitives with final orders of removal, which was an \nincrease of 112 percent over that period in 2003.\n  The point is that there are more and more criminal aliens coming to \nthe United States or people committing crimes while they are here or \npeople who are being given orders to depart and who are not doing so.\n  I noted before that between 10 and 15 percent of the apprehensions of \nillegal immigrants today are people who have criminal records. And they \nare serious criminal records. We are talking about murder, homicide, \nkidnapping, drug offenses, rape, assaults, and the like. These are \nserious criminals.\n  In Arizona, my own State--the most recent figures are about a year \nold--almost one in six inmates is a Mexican citizen. I don't mean to \nsuggest by this that Mexican citizens are somehow more prone to be \ncommitting crimes. I don't have the statistics for foreign nationals of \nother countries. But the bottom line is, from only one foreign country, \nwe have almost one in six inmates in Arizona prisons of this one \nforeign country. If you add the others, the number, obviously, will be \nlarger.\n  In March of 2005, Phoenix jails housed 1,200 criminal aliens who by \nlaw should have been deported. And even when deportation is ordered, \naccording to a FOXNews report, about 60 percent of those orders are \nignored. So you still have a huge number of people who are unaccounted \nfor.\n\n  In Los Angeles, in that same period, 95 percent of all outstanding \nhomicide warrants and 60 percent of outstanding felony warrants were \nfor illegal aliens. This is according to a FOXNews report. Let me \nrepeat that statistic. If you want to know why we have offered this \namendment, in L.A., a year ago, 95 percent of all outstanding homicide \nwarrants and 60 percent of outstanding felony warrants were for illegal \naliens. That is an astounding figure.\n  So while it is true many people come to this country to work and \nprovide a better living for their families and the only crimes they \nhave committed are coming into the country illegally and using \nfraudulent documents for employment and other purposes, it is also true \na large amount of crime is associated with this phenomenon of illegal \nimmigration.\n  One of the first things we should do when we talk about enforcement \nof the law is to ensure we are not adding those criminals to the group \nof people who would be authorized to participate in what is going to be \na very humane program of temporary worker, and for some a pathway to \ncitizenship.\n\n[[Page S2586]]\n\n  Let me cite two other statistics, and then I would like to yield to \nmy colleague from Texas.\n  In September of 2004, of the 400,000-plus illegal immigrants who were \nordered to be deported, 80,000 had criminal records. Now we do not know \ntheir whereabouts, including the countries from which they came. The \npoint here is that many were from countries that we call countries of \ninterest; that is to say, countries where terrorists come from. We know \nthere are tens of thousands of illegal immigrants today who are \napprehended coming from those countries and probably three times as \nmany who are not apprehended. So in addition to people who have \ncommitted crimes in the United States, there is a significant \npossibility some of these people pose the kind of threat this amendment \nwould go to as well.\n  Considering this group of so-called other than Mexicans, people who \ncannot simply be repatriated to Mexico who have to be sent to their \nhome country, this number has increased dramatically. In 2000, the \nnumber was only 28,598, although that is a lot of people. In 2004, it \nwas 65,000. In the first 8 months of 2005, that number grew to over \n100,000. And we are told that the end result from last year, if my \nrecollection serves me correctly, was about 165,000.\n  So the bottom line is that, No. 1, there are illegal immigrants who \nare criminals coming into this country. There are people who are \nillegal immigrants who, once they get here, are committing serious \ncrimes. There are people who clearly could be suspected of being a \ndanger to the United States. And finally, there are close to half a \nmillion people who have been ordered by a judge to leave the country \nfor one reason or another under our laws that constitutes a serious \nenough offense that they are required to leave--who are absconders; \nthey have decided to ignore the court order--and have not done so.\n  These are not the kind of people we want to become U.S. citizens. \nThese are not the kind of people we want caring for our lawns or caring \nfor our children or doing any of the other work that has been discussed \nhere earlier today.\n  The bottom line is, there are plenty of people who can do those jobs. \nWe do not want to be adding to the problems of crime in this country by \naccepting on an equal footing, with the other kinds of folks whom we \nare happy to have here working with us on a temporary basis, known \ncriminals, people who should not be in this country under any \ncircumstances, certainly not under the generous provisions of the bill \nbefore us. I hope when we have a chance to vote our colleagues will \nagree that, whatever else, criminals should not be participating in \nthis program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this debate we are having on this \nimportant legislation is critical to our Nation. It is long overdue. I \nam glad we are finally talking about border security and immigration \nreform in a comprehensive way.\n  I know, as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, our chairman, \nSenator Specter, and the committee have worked very hard on this \nlegislation. There is a lot of the legislation that I think is very \ngood. For example, the border security component of the bill is very \nstrong. I am proud to say that a good chunk of that came from \nlegislation Senator Kyl and I have drafted and has been out there for a \nyear or more.\n  But I believe with all my heart that what has brought us to this day \nand this debate on the Senate floor is because Americans are terribly \nconcerned that in a post-9/11 world, we simply do not have control of \nour borders. And they believe--and I believe they are correct--it \nexposes us to a danger and that the Federal Government has a primary \nresponsibility of making sure our security interests are protected. As \nI said earlier today, border security is national security.\n  Now, how did we get here? I believe this is important because I do \nnot want people to get the wrong impression. We are a proud nation of \nimmigrants. All of us--no matter who we are, how we pronounce our last \nname, where we were born--came from somewhere else. America has been \nthe net beneficiary of the fact that we have been that beacon of \nfreedom and opportunity which has attracted people from all around the \nworld. What distinguishes this country from the rest of the world is \nthat once you come to America, you become an American, not because of \nthe color of your skin or your religious affiliation or beliefs or the \ncountry where you were born, you become an American because you believe \nin the American ideal and you believe that everyone, no matter who they \nare, is entitled to the opportunity to achieve their own American \ndream. That is really one of the greatest legacies this Nation will \never have.\n\n  But we are also a nation of laws. To me, the toughest part about this \nlegislation has been, how do we reconcile that vision--our American \nvalues of a nation of immigrants--with this important notion and ideal \nof a nation that also believes in the rule of law?\n  One of the reasons I so strongly support this amendment is that while \nwe are a welcoming nation and we open our arms to people who want to \ncome to America to achieve a better life--hopefully through legal \navenues of immigration--we know there are some who have not come here \nthrough those legal avenues. What we are attempting to achieve in this \nlegislation is to create legal avenues of immigration into this \ncountry.\n  Some people may decide they want to come here to become legal \npermanent residents and citizens and become Americans. Others might \nfigure they want to come to this country on a temporary basis to work \nand to earn a living so they can support their family, so that they \nultimately can return to their country of origin with the savings and \nskills they have acquired while working in the United States. But in a \nvery real sense, these temporary workers do not intend to become \nAmericans. They do not intend to sever their relationship with their \ncountry and their family and their culture.\n  The fact is, we need those legal workers here in the United States. \nWe ought to create--and I do support creating--a legal avenue for them \nto come and work for a time and then to return to their country of \norigin. The fact is, that serves America's national interests. It also \nserves the national interest of those countries from whence they come. \nIndeed, one of the components of that, which we will talk about more as \nthis debate continues, has to do with establishing a legal opportunity \nfor people to work for a while in the United States and then to go home \nwith savings and skills they have acquired here.\n  The reason that is important--and this should not be overlooked--is \nthat no country could sustain the permanent exodus of its hard-working \nyoung people, which is what is happening to many countries south of our \nborder today. Those economies are handicapped dramatically because of \nthe massive immigration and permanent exodus of their young people to \nthis country.\n  What we ought to be about, not only in our national interest but as a \nmeans of reaching out to those countries and enabling them to create \neconomic opportunity there at home, is a way for them to build their \nown economy to create opportunity in their homeland.\n  While there are certainly people who will want to immigrate to the \nUnited States permanently, there are many others who, if given the \nopportunity to work for a while in the United States, would be more \nthan happy to maintain their ties to their country and their culture \nand their family and return home and possibly to come back after a \nperiod of time.\n  But I say all that by way of predicate to say that we have a right as \na sovereign nation not only to protect our own borders, we have an \nobligation to make sure the American people are not exposed to \nextraordinary danger that might occur if common criminals are given a \nfree ride, inadvertently, in this bill.\n  Now, I do not imagine for a minute the authors of this bill intended \nthat felons, persons who were guilty of three successive misdemeanors, \npeople who are under final orders of deportation or criminal \nabsconders--I do not actually believe the authors of this bill intended \nto grant an amnesty or to forgive those crimes or to welcome those \npeople into the United States because I believe either these \nindividuals, by virtue of the crimes they have committed,\n\n[[Page S2587]]\n\nshould not be accepted into the United States--and we certainly have a \nright to control who comes and who does not come, and I think these \npeople have disqualified themselves by virtue of their criminal \nactivity--but there is also another segment of people, some 400,000 \nindividuals, who have had their day in court, who have been ordered \ndeported because they have had their due process, and they simply have \nfailed to reappear so the law may be carried out. So they are what is \ncalled an absconder. And 80,000 of those some 400,000 people are \ncriminal absconders, people guilty of felonies in the United States, \npeople who have, since they have come here, disqualified themselves by \nvirtue of their failure to comply with our law and no longer deserve to \nbe able to live in the United States.\n  So I believe it is very important to make those distinctions. We \nought to be able to distinguish between those individuals who have come \nto the United States because they do not have any opportunity, they do \nnot have any hope of providing for their families where they live--we \nare willing to find a way to provide them a way to work in a legal \nsystem or, if they are willing to comply with the requirements of the \nlaw, to exit the country and return in a legal way and work and live in \nthe United States, should they choose to do so and should they be \nqualified--but surely we can all agree there are certain persons who, \nby virtue of their misconduct, as evidenced by their unwillingness to \ncomply with our laws and exposing the American people to danger in the \nprocess, that we ought to be able to protect the public safety and \ndistinguish between people who have violated the immigration laws and \nthose who have committed far more serious crimes or abused their rights \nand had the opportunity to be heard and are under final orders of \ndeportation.\n  I will not go into any more detail other than just to say a few \nthings about this amendment that I gladly join.\n  One of the reasons I am concerned that under the Judiciary Committee \nbill some people might perceive that what is granted is an amnesty is \nbecause while there may be some definitional disputes about what \nconstitutes an amnesty, what I am confident of is that people will \nagree that in 1986, we had an amnesty. And I am confident the vast \nmajority of people will agree with me, not only was it an amnesty, they \nwill agree with me, I believe, that it was a complete and total \nfailure. The tradeoff for the amnesty of 3 million people was to get \nworksite verification and employer sanctions, yet the Federal \nGovernment did not step up and provide that capacity. So what happened \nis that 3 million now becomes 12 million today. One reason I am so \ndetermined not to repeat the mistakes of 1986 is because I believe it \nwould be a magnet for further illegal immigration.\n\n  This amendment is sensible. It provides that criminals can't get a \ngreen card, and those who have had their day in court and proven \nthemselves disqualified from further opportunity to immigrate to the \nUnited States legally and become American citizens or permanent \nresidents should not be included in what some might regard as a \nrepetition of the amnesty that was issued in 1986.\n  It is with pleasure that I join Senator Kyl in cosponsoring this \namendment. We urge our colleagues to support us.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a couple \nquestions.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Certainly.\n  Mr. KYL. First, does our amendment criminalize anything that isn't \nalready criminalized?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Absolutely not. That has been one of the misconceptions \nor perhaps straw men that have been hoisted out there because some \npeople have suggested we are trying to criminalize people who merely \nwant to come to this country for economic opportunity to provide for \ntheir families. This does nothing of the kind. These are people who \nhave already been convicted of felonies in the United States or three \nmisdemeanors or have committed serious crimes out of the United States, \nor that the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security believes \nare a safety risk to the American people.\n  Mr. KYL. So nothing in our amendment makes any new kind of conduct a \ncrime. It simply deals with people who have already committed crimes?\n  Mr. CORNYN. That is entirely correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I think that is a very important point. I \nknow there are many people who were concerned about the House bill. \nMuch of the marching that was done last week was against the House bill \non the grounds that it was creating new crimes and even felony crimes. \nNothing in either the legislation that Senator Cornyn and I have \nintroduced nor in this amendment creates any felony offense, nor does \nthis amendment create any misdemeanor offense. It simply says people \nwho have already committed crimes should not participate in this \nprogram or who have violated a court order of removal.\n  There are millions of people who have come to the United States \nillegally but who otherwise, other than perhaps using false documents, \nhave worked hard and abided by the rules. It is not in their interest \nto violate our laws. Yet when the subject is discussed, it is easy to \nroll all of the people up in one group and suggest that good and decent \npeople are no better than people who have committed crimes, and they \nought to all be treated the same. And some people have even said they \nought to all be made criminals and thrown out of the country.\n  While we may not like the fact that we have permitted people to come \ninto this country illegally, I believe it does a great injustice to \npeople to assume they are all alike and to bunch them up into the same \ngroup. We need to extract out of this group of people who all of us \nintend to try to treat in the most humane and responsible way we can, \nhowever, the ultimate framework of a guest worker program or other \nprograms are developed, we need to separate that group of people from \nthose who have committed crimes, people whom we don't want to be here. \nThat is the purpose of our amendment. We have decided it is important \nfor us to distinguish between the people who do not deserve to be \nautomatically eliminated from consideration for whatever program is \ngoing to be adopted here, those people who have actually committed \ncrimes and whom we would not want to bring into the country if we had a \nchoice in the initial instance, in other words, people who would be \nadmittable in the country, certainly people who would be deportable for \nhaving committed these kinds of crimes. So clearly if they should not \nbe admitted into the country or they should have been deported for \ncommitting certain kinds of crimes, it wouldn't make any sense to allow \nthem then to participate in a guest worker program or to put them on \nthe path to citizenship.\n  That is the essence of our amendment. Of all of the things we \ndisagree about--we understand there are many--we think it is important \nto distinguish between that group of people who otherwise have been \nlaw-abiding people and the group of people who have committed crimes. \nAnd ironically, most often the crimes these people are in jail for are \ncommitted against other immigrants, frequently illegal immigrants. They \nrape them. They rob them. They beat them up. They hold them for ransom. \nIn all of the big cities in the Southwest, the largest number of crimes \nare committed by illegal immigrants against primarily illegal \nimmigrants. So to help those who are otherwise innocent from being \nfurther preyed upon, we need to remove from this country, not allow \nthem to participate in the program, to remove those people who would \ncontinue to prey upon the innocent. That is what our amendment would \ndo.\n  I hope when it comes time to vote, our colleagues will recognize that \nwhatever other disagreements there are, these are the people who should \nnot be allowed to participate in the program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, before commenting on the pending \namendment, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Hagel be added as a \ncosponsor to the committee bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. First, I thank Senator Kyl and Senator Cornyn for coming \nto the floor to start the debate and\n\n[[Page S2588]]\n\noffer an amendment. We are trying to push ahead with this bill. It is \nappreciated that they have come early. I am advised that the other side \nof the aisle would not be prepared to vote on this amendment today or \ntomorrow. What we are trying to do is to line up a series of votes for \nMonday afternoon. I am advised that Senator Bingaman wishes to offer an \namendment to add resources to Border Patrol, and on the surface, \nwithout final commitment, it looks as if it is an acceptable amendment. \nWe want to have an opportunity there. Senator Alexander has already \nspoken about an amendment which has a number. It has not yet been \ncalled up.\n  We are anxious to move ahead. It is always difficult getting started \non a bill, but it had been my hope that on a Thursday afternoon, when \nwe went to this bill yesterday, had opening statements and had a full \nafternoon of discussion and extensive discussion today, that we would \nhave been prepared to have amendments and have some votes. Thursday is \nsupposed to be our late night. Maybe more accurately stated, our late \nnight, if we ever have a late night. Well, we are not going to have a \nlate night tonight because there is not a whole lot we are going to be \nable to do.\n  I believe the thrust of the Kyl-Cornyn amendment is a good one.\n  If I may have the attention of Senators Kyl and Cornyn while I am \nsaying good things about them.\n  Mr. KYL. We are all ears.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I believe the thrust of the amendment is a good one. I \nwant to take a look to see what is meant by ``voluntary departure'' \nunder 240B. But it looks to me when you want to exclude the criminal \nclass from being on the path for working in this country, the \ncitizenship path, that is desirable.\n  It is my hope we can move ahead and transact some business and hear \nsome amendments and hopefully move to votes at the earliest possible \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I see Senator Bingaman. I will be brief \nin my remarks because I assume he wants to speak. If I could say to the \nchairman, who was here earlier, I hope very much we can begin to move \nto votes. I spoke earlier today about an amendment which I filed which \nis amendment No. 3193. It is filed at the desk. It already has the \ncosponsorship of Senators Cornyn, Isakson, Cochran, and Santorum. I ask \nunanimous consent that Senators McConnell and McCain be added as \ncosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The majority leader, Senator Frist, is also a \ncosponsor.\n  While I do understand and am disappointed by the fact that we are not \ngoing to be moving to votes tonight, this is not a new idea that I have \nmade in my amendment. My first speech on the floor of the Senate in \n2003 was about the importance of becoming American, how in our country \nwe are unique because we do not base our backgrounds on race or \nancestry but on a set of ideas, and how important it was for us to put \nthe teaching of American history back in its rightful place in our \nschools so our children can grow up learning what it means to be an \nAmerican.\n  Senator Reid, the Democratic leader, joined me on that. Senator \nKennedy joined me and Senator Reid. He and I are working together to \ncreate Presidential academies for students and teachers of American \nhistory. We are trying to take the National Assessment of Educational \nProgress and make sure that it includes another way of putting the \nteaching of American history back in the right place in our curriculum.\n  The reason we do that is because our common schools were created to \nhelp immigrant children learn the three Rs and what it means to be an \nAmerican. Because if you don't know the principles upon which our \ncountry is based, it is difficult to become an American. We have this \nadvantage over other countries in the world who base their nationality \non race or on the color of their skin or their ancestry. We don't do \nthat. It is important to become an American by understanding the \nprinciples of our country. We agree on that. It is those principles \nthat we debate here.\n  This is not a debate about who is pro or anti-immigrant. We are all \npro-immigration because that is an important part of our character. But \nwe have more than one principle at issue here. The first one is the \nrule of law. We are all for the rule of law because people who come to \nthis country don't come to a country where we don't stop at stop signs \nand we don't observe contracts and we don't follow the law. We follow \nthe law here or there are consequences. We have those principles. And \nwe have the principle of equal opportunity. And we have the principle \nof a free market or laissez faire. We have the principle above the \nPresident's desk of E Pluribus Unum. Our great achievement is that we \nhave taken this magnificent diversity and forged it into one country. \nWe are the United States of America, not the United Nations.\n  Therefore, the amendment that I had filed today and is ready to be \nvoted on tonight or tomorrow or Monday, whenever we are ready, ought \nnot to be very controversial. It is simply to help the half million to \na million people from other countries who are legally here and ready to \nbecome citizens, to help them become Americans. It does that by \nproviding them with $500 grants so they can learn our common language. \nIt doesn't make them learn it; it helps them, if they want to learn it. \nIt says to those who become fluent in English that they may become \ncitizens in 4 years instead of 5. It doesn't penalize them. It gives \nthem rewards. It gives grants to organizations to help them learn our \nhistory. It codifies the oath of allegiance George Washington and his \ntroops took and that millions of Americans have taken which basically \nsays I am not Scotch-Irish anymore, which my family was. I am an \nAmerican. I am proud of my Italian heritage, but I am proud to be \nAmerican. That has been our history.\n  Senator Schumer and I in two Congresses have introduced legislation \nmaking that oath a law, not just some administrative dictum that \nsomeone could mess around with, but put it right up there with the \nStar-Spangled Banner, the National Anthem, and other great symbols of \nAmerica.\n  My amendment establishes a reward to recognize the contributions of \noutstanding new citizens. It asks the Department of Homeland Security \nand the National Archives to develop ways to dignify and celebrate \nthese wonderful ceremonies such as the one the President attended on \nMonday where 30 people stood up and said: I have been here 5 years. I \nhave demonstrated good character. I have learned English, and I am \nproud of where I came from. But I am prouder to be American. I swear \nallegiance to this country, the same oath George Washington and the \nofficers took at Valley Forge in the year 1778 and which new citizens \nhave taken in this country ever since then.\n  We could talk about border security. It is important, and that is the \nrule of law. We can solve that problem. We know how to do that. We can \nagree on that. We can talk about how many guest workers we want. We \nalready authorize 500,000 or more work visas a year. Perhaps we need \nmore. We can figure that out. The distinguished Senator from New Mexico \nand I have been working for a year with the National Academy of \nSciences to make certain that we in-source brainpower so we can keep \nour jobs from going to China and India. I would like, through this \nlegislation, to make it easier for the brightest people in the world to \ncome here and help us create our high standard of living.\n  I mentioned earlier in the day that the top three jobs at the Oak \nRidge National Laboratory, our largest science lab in America, are held \nby three foreigners with green cards from England, Canada, and India. \nThe Senator and I have worked together to recapture our advantage in \nsupercomputing in America so that America can be the leader in \ncomputing. Who runs that program? It is a citizen of India who is \nliving here. Not only is there nothing wrong with that, but he is here \nhelping improve my standard of living and the next person's standard of \nliving.\n  I want our discussion to be a comprehensive discussion. I want us to \ndeal with border security. That is the rule of law. But I want us to \nset rules for welcoming the people who temporarily work here and study \nhere, but I also want us to make sure we do the most\n\n[[Page S2589]]\n\nimportant thing and remember those three words up there in the Senate \nChamber, ``e pluribus unum.'' They are not there by accident. They mean \nthat we need to devote extra effort to making sure that those who come \nhere legally also become Americans. That is the real limit on the \nnumber of new citizens who can come here--whether they can become a \npart of our culture, a part of our country, and become Americans.\n  If we don't do that, we are nothing more than a united nations; we \nare not the United States of America. I think there is broad agreement \nin this body about that. That is why Senator Schumer and I introduced \nthe oath of allegiance bill. That is why myself and others are working \non helping to put American History back in our schools for children. I \nam ready to vote on this amendment tonight or tomorrow, but I certainly \nhope the chairman and the leaders on both sides of the aisle would \nallow Senator Bingaman's amendment and my amendment and others to be \nvoted upon as soon as possible.\n  The American people are expecting us to deal with immigration. We are \nhere and we are ready to do it. Let's get on with it. It is time to \nstop debating and start acting, and a good way to start would be to \nhelp prospective citizens become Americans. That would finish a \ncomprehensive bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendments so that I may offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3210 to Amendment No. 3192\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I send an amendment to the desk to amendment No. 3192.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3210 to amendment No. 3192.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide financial aid to local law enforcement officials \n          along the Nation's borders, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n              TITLE __--BORDER LAW ENFORCEMENT RELIEF ACT\n\n     SEC. _01. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Border Law Enforcement \n     Relief Act of 2006''\n\n     SEC. _02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) It is the obligation of the Federal Government of the \n     United States to adequately secure the Nation's borders and \n     prevent the flow of undocumented persons and illegal drugs \n     into the United States.\n       (2) Despite the fact that the United States Border Patrol \n     apprehends over 1,000,000 people each year trying to \n     illegally enter the United States, according to the \n     Congressional Research Service, the net growth in the number \n     of unauthorized aliens has increased by approximately 500,000 \n     each year. The Southwest border accounts for approximately 94 \n     percent of all migrant apprehensions each year. Currently, \n     there are an estimated 11,000,000 unauthorized aliens in the \n     United States.\n       (3) The border region is also a major corridor for the \n     shipment of drugs. According to the El Paso Intelligence \n     Center, 65 percent of the narcotics that are sold in the \n     markets of the United States enter the country through the \n     Southwest Border.\n       (4) Border communities continue to incur significant costs \n     due to the lack of adequate border security. A 2001 study by \n     the United States-Mexico Border Counties Coalition found that \n     law enforcement and criminal justice expenses associated with \n     illegal immigration exceed $89,000,000 annually for the \n     Southwest border counties.\n       (5) In August 2005, the States of New Mexico and Arizona \n     declared states of emergency in order to provide local law \n     enforcement immediate assistance in addressing criminal \n     activity along the Southwest border.\n       (6) While the Federal Government provides States and \n     localities assistance in covering costs related to the \n     detention of certain criminal aliens and the prosecution of \n     Federal drug cases, local law enforcement along the border \n     are provided no assistance in covering such expenses and must \n     use their limited resources to combat drug trafficking, human \n     smuggling, kidnappings, the destruction of private property, \n     and other border-related crimes.\n       (7) The United States shares 5,525 miles of border with \n     Canada and 1,989 miles with Mexico. Many of the local law \n     enforcement agencies located along the border are small, \n     rural departments charged with patrolling large areas of \n     land. Counties along the Southwest United States-Mexico \n     border are some of the poorest in the country and lack the \n     financial resources to cover the additional costs associated \n     with illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and other border-\n     related crimes.\n       (8) Federal assistance is required to help local law \n     enforcement operating along the border address the unique \n     challenges that arise as a result of their proximity to an \n     international border and the lack of overall border security \n     in the region\n\n     SEC. _03.

ENFORCEMENT OF FEDERAL IMMIGRATION LAW.\n\n       Nothing in this title shall be construed to authorize State \n     or local law enforcement agencies or their officers to \n     exercise Federal immigration law enforcement authority.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is to \nassist\n\n[[Page S2590]]\n\nborder law enforcement agencies--that is, local law enforcement \nagencies--in addressing border-related criminal activity.\n  Border law enforcement agencies incur significant expenses in dealing \nwith crimes, such as human smuggling, vehicle thefts, drug trafficking, \nand the destruction of private property. These crimes occur and this \nenforcement is required because of their proximity to the international \nborder and because of the failure of the Federal Government to \nadequately secure that international border.\n  According to the study by the Border Counties Coalition, criminal \njustice expenses related to immigration alone exceed $89 million a \nyear.\n  Mr. President, it is time that the Federal Government help these \nborder communities cover some of those costs. Specifically, this \namendment that I have offered, which is based on the bill I earlier \nintroduced entitled ``the Border Law Enforcement Relief Act of 2006,'' \nwould establish a grant program within the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to help local law enforcement situated along the northern and \nsouthern borders to obtain the resources they need to secure our border \ncommunities. It would authorize $50 million a year to help law \nenforcement hire additional personnel, obtain necessary equipment, \ncover overtime expenses of their personnel, and cover transportation \ncosts of their personnel.\n  Eligible applicants would include agencies serving communities within \n100 miles of the U.S. border--the border with Mexico or with Canada--\nand any other department located outside of that jurisdictional limit \nif it is designated by the Secretary of Homeland Security as a high-\nimpact area. The designation would be made because that area is greatly \nimpacted by the flow of illegal immigration, drugs, and other such \nproblems.\n  Securing our Nation's borders is the responsibility of the Federal \nGovernment. However, as we all know, the Federal Government has failed \nto provide adequate security along our international borders. The \nresult is that local communities are having to pay for a variety of \ncosts, from health care to law enforcement. It is wrong to place this \nadditional burden on these local communities. They do not have the \nresources to deal effectively with these increased burdens.\n  It is time that Congress recognizes the tremendous burden with which \nlocal law enforcement agencies along our borders have been saddled. I \nhope my colleagues will support this important measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3193\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside and amendment No. 3193, which I filed at \nthe desk, be considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Alexander] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3193.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3206\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, a short while ago, Senators Kyl and \nCornyn offered an amendment. They claim that the committee bill would \nallow criminals to become permanent residents under the committee bill, \nand this is not correct.\n  The committee bill requires all applicants to undergo criminal and \nsecurity background checks, and all applicants must also show that they \nhave not committed any crimes that make them ineligible under our \nimmigration laws.\n  As many Senators know, Congress passed sweeping changes to our \nimmigration laws, and just about any crime makes one ineligible for a \ngreen card. This includes aggravated felonies, crimes of violence, drug \ncrimes, crimes of moral turpitude, money laundering, murder, rape, \nsexual abuse of a minor, drug trafficking, possession of explosives, \ntheft offenses, child pornography, forgery, counterfeiting, bribery, \nperjury, and many others.\n  Anyone who has committed any of these crimes cannot--cannot--and will \nnot get a green card under the committee bill.\n  What the amendment does, though, is undermine the earned citizenship \nprogram in the bill. Millions of Mexicans, Central Americans, Irish, \nand nationals from other countries would be prevented from applying for \nlegal status not because of criminal crimes but status violations. The \ngoal of comprehensive immigration reform is to encourage illegal \nworkers to come out of the shadows, be screened, and be given work \npermits, and if they are on the track to eventually being eligible for \ncitizenship, they have to earn it. This is not an amnesty program. No \none is forgiven. Anyone who wants to get on this path has to pay a \nfine, demonstrate that they have a work record, also demonstrate that \nthey paid their taxes, and then get to the end of the line of those who \nwant to come to the United States, and for 11 years meet those \nresponsibilities.\n  That is one part of this legislation. This amendment that is offered \nwould end the possibility for earned legalization. That would be the \neffect if this amendment is accepted.\n  If the proponents of the amendment are interested or concerned just \nabout crimes, other crimes being added to the list, we are ready to \ntalk with them, and we will try and engage them in a conversation and \nsee if that is their purpose. If their purpose is to undermine a key \nelement of the proposal, that would be unacceptable, and we will have \nthe opportunity to express our views with a vote in the Senate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, there is one more thing I wanted to say this \nevening about the amendment Senator Cornyn and I offered, an amendment \nwhich provides that criminals cannot participate in the program that we \nadopt here--whatever that program is--in terms of being temporary \nworkers or being put on the path of citizenship, or however this body \nultimately defines what happens to immigrants who have come here \nillegally, or so-called future flow workers. I think almost everybody \ncan agree it shouldn't apply to criminals, or to people who have \nviolated a court order to depart the country.\n  I made the point earlier, and I want to reiterate it, that it is \nimportant to separate out the group of people who have come here, \nalbeit illegally, to do hard work and not otherwise violate our laws, \nexcept perhaps using fraudulent documents. Those people end up being \nthe primary targets of other illegal immigrants who commit heinous \ncrimes against them.\n\n  So one of the reasons for denying these criminals the right to \nparticipate in the same program is to get them away from the people who \nare most susceptible to being preyed upon.\n  We talked to chiefs of police, to sheriffs, to the Border Patrol, to \nother law enforcement officials, and they have different statistics, \nbut by and large they all agree that predominantly the serious crime in \ntheir communities, particularly large communities, is immigrant on \nimmigrant and it is mostly illegal immigrant. And the crimes that are \ncommitted would just break your heart.\n  There are stories like this. Immigrants pay a couple of thousand \ndollars, roughly $2,000 is the going price now, to a coyote to be \nsmuggled into Arizona from Mexico. They may have had to pay different \npeople along the way on the bus up to Altar, where they could then come \nacross, or wherever. But the fee is probably in the neighborhood of \n$2,000.\n\n[[Page S2591]]\n\n  Before they come across somebody comes and says it is now going to \ncost you an additional $500 or, I am sorry, we can't do it. So they \nhave to somehow communicate to somebody else in their family or a \nfriend to come up with some more money.\n  They then attach themselves to the coyote who brings them across the \nborder. A lot of different things can happen. First of all, another \ngroup vies for that group of illegal immigrants because they are all \nworth money. We had a shootout on Interstate 10 between Tucson and \nPhoenix involving two vehicles with illegal immigrants in them with two \ndifferent coyote gangs. They were having a shootout on the freeway, and \npeople were killed and injured, over who was going to control the load \nof immigrants because that is value. You could hold the illegal \nimmigrants here in a safe house and tell them that until they come up \nwith another $1,000, let's say, they are going to be held hostage, \nbasically, or the coyote or his friends will call the police or Border \nPatrol if they don't come up with the money.\n  Women are forced to commit improper acts. There are assaults, sexual \nassaults. There is a great deal of crime perpetrated on these illegal \nimmigrants. If they have not been beaten or raped or robbed or held \nransom for more money, then what happens is they are waiting in the \nsafe house and the Phoenix Police Department shows up at the safe house \nbecause they have gotten a call of a disturbance in a house.\n  It wasn't a disturbance at all. It was the coyote calling the Phoenix \npolice because he has another load coming in that night and he needs to \nget rid of these people. He has gotten all he can out of them. He \nsucked them dry. They don't have any more money. He has taken all they \nhave. They don't dare go to the police. Now he has called the police \nand said there is a disturbance. They show up at the house and pick up \nthese illegal immigrants. If they are from Mexico they are put on a bus \nback to Mexico.\n  That is what can happen to these people. These are the ones who do \nnot die in the desert and who are not abused some other way. We cannot \nallow the criminal element here, people who have committed crimes, who \nare criminals, to continue to prey on these people. It is one of the \nreasons our amendment says that criminals cannot participate in this \nprogram.\n  There is another reason. Citizenship in this country is a tremendous \nprivilege. Anyone who knows immigrants who have come here or who has \nparticipated in a swearing-in ceremony knows how much legal immigrants \nvalue this privilege. As I said before, my grandparents came here and \nthey were so proud of their American citizenship. They felt so \nprivileged to have been able to come here. It is not fair to them or \nfor the millions who are waiting in some country, waiting to come here \nand who have to attest to their good character. They have abided by the \nlaws. They have committed no crimes. To then see somebody else who has \nnot only entered the country illegally but also in some other way has \ncommitted crimes or has refused to depart after a judge's order, to \nthen be able to participate in a legal program allowing them to become \na temporary worker or be on a path to citizenship--what kind of a \nsignal does that send? It cheapens American citizenship. It cheapens \nlegal permanent residency.\n  It is wrong to simply say that because we have a hard time with the \namount of people who have come here illegally, we are not going to \ndifferentiate among them in any way, we are just going to take them all \nin and let them all get on this path to citizenship. That is wrong. I \ndo not think the American people will allow us to permit that kind of \nindividual to participate in this program.\n  That is what the underlying bill allows. There are a lot of things \nwrong with this underlying bill. This is just one of them. But I hope \nwith each of these things that we point out, our colleagues will come \nto realize that there is an answer here somewhere, but it is not every \nprovision of this bill. So, piece by piece, we will focus attention on \nthis bill to try to determine where we can make changes so at the end \nof the day we have a good product--comprehensive immigration reform, \nenforcement, and an opportunity for people our society needs to work \nhere on a temporary but legal basis.\n\n  If we can do that, we will have succeeded. But if we simply pass a \nbill that has a tremendous number of flaws in it, we will have failed. \nI hope we can correct this first flaw with the amendment that Senator \nCornyn and I have offered to at least ensure that criminals can't \nparticipate in this program.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, just for a question. I want to first say how much \nI value the insights of the Senator from Arizona into this important \nissue. On the Judiciary Committee he is one of the Senate's most \nknowledgeable members on immigration issues, and one of the best \nlawyers here. I think he has raised a very troubling point.\n  This is part of the legislation that is moving forward, for reasons I \nam not quite sure of. But it does seem to have moved too fast, and it \nhas a lot of real problems--almost anybody would agree.\n  But this deal about crime is a very important issue. I have had the \nsense that we may be seeing more criminality on the border. Sheriffs \nfrom Arizona and Texas came up and told us about the rising crime rate, \nthe increased number of assaults on their people and Federal people.\n  I recall a recent trip I just took with the Armed Services Committee \nto Europe. I met with General Jones, who has Africa. He talks about the \nborder areas that tend to be the areas that are the most dangerous.\n  Is the Senator concerned that we are creating areas in the country, \nas a result of lack of enforcement around the borders, that are really \nmore dangerous than other parts of his State?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would say to the Senator from Alabama, that \nis exactly the case. I would cite two parts of the testimony before our \nSubcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Homeland Security.\n  We had the U.S. attorney for Arizona testify that just from last \nyear, the number of assaults at the border has gone up 108 percent. It \nis not just on law enforcement officers, but a lot of the assaults are \nperpetrated against them. I intended to get the statistics on the \nnumber of homicides. But there are homicides and then there are an \nawful lot of other kinds of assaults. The border, in many places, is \nbecoming a very violent place.\n  There is one good news element that was confirmed by the testimony \nthat was taken in the committee. The reason for this increased \nviolence, they said, was that the Border Patrol was actually improving \nits ability to control territory. Territory that previously had been \nthe sole jurisdiction of the cartels and the coyotes was now being \ncontested by law enforcement. So naturally they were fighting back.\n  The bad news, of course, is they fight back with high-caliber \nweapons. They are organized. It is a very dangerous place. As a result, \nour officers are seeing assaults every day.\n  The other thing that this testimony confirmed was that it is not just \nnice people coming across the border, it is over 10 percent who are \ncriminals. I mean, if you stop and think about it, if you have 600,000 \npeople coming into the country illegally who are apprehended, so it is \nmaybe three times that many who are coming in who are not apprehended, \nand over 10 percent of them are criminals, you are talking about tens \nof thousands of people who have decided that this is a good way to get \ninto the United States, come in as an illegal immigrant. These are not \nthe kind of people we want in our country.\n  When you look at the type of crimes that the people who have been \napprehended have been accused of committing or have been convicted of \ncommitting, it is homicides, it has been rapes, serious assaults, drug \ncrimes--serious crimes. So not only is the border becoming more \nviolent, but the people coming into the United States are an \nincreasingly criminal element, and they are continuing to commit crimes \nin our cities, in particular against other illegal immigrants. That is \nwhy we believe it is very important that at least one group that ought \nnot to be able to participate in whatever program we adopt is this \ngroup of criminals. That is another reason our first effort should be \nto get control of the border.\n\n[[Page S2592]]\n\n  Forget the problem of people coming here to work. If for no other \nreason, you want to keep the people from terrorist countries out, keep \nout the people smuggling methamphetamine into the country, and keep \npeople with criminal records out of this country.\n  That is why many of us think the first thing we ought to do is get \ncontrol of the border.\n  I went on a little long in answering the question.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is good. I wanted to follow up because the Senator \nmentioned methamphetamine. I had an opportunity today to meet with the \nexecutive director of the Alabama District Attorneys Association. \nThrough Alabama laws and the Federal law we passed pseudoephedrine is \nnot so available now, from which methamphetamine is being made in the \nUnited States. He just told me casually this morning, now all the \nmethamphetamine is coming in from Mexico.\n  You are on that border. Do you sense that there is a growing problem \nwith methamphetamine being brought in across the unsecure border?\n  Mr. KYL. I would say to the Senator from Alabama, this is what we \nhave been briefed. The President was at the border. He was briefed \nlikewise on this phenomenon. Sheriff Larry Dever from Cochise County, \nSheriff Ralph Ogden from Yuma County, they both told me this. The \nchiefs of police in Tucson and Phoenix told me this, the Chief of the \nBorder Patrol in both the Tucson and Yuma sector, all of them agree \nthat methamphetamine is now the No. 1 drug coming across and, by the \nway, also underneath--in some of these tunnels. We need to make that a \ncrime as well. It is not even a crime to dig a tunnel under the border. \nBut we have an amendment that hopefully will cure that. But now a \nbackpack of methamphetamine is said to be worth, by these law \nenforcement officials I identified to you, to be worth between a \nquarter of million and a half million dollars. You can take a poor, \nillegal immigrant, many of them in a group, and put this backpack on \neach of them and give them $10,000--more money than they have seen in a \nlong time--and say: You scoot across the border and you'll be met by \nXYZ. That is a cheap way to get it across. They are not making it as \nmuch in Arizona, in fact, anymore. It is all coming across the border, \nas you pointed out.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. One more question because I think this is very \nimportant for all of us here who strive to be responsible to the \ncitizens we serve, and that is, we have had some amendments, some of \nwhich were accepted that I offered, that would increase bed space or \nincrease Border Patrol agents and that kind of thing to improve \nenforcement. That is part of the bill that is before us. But I have \nbeen here long enough to get a little bit dubious about some of these \nthings and learn the ropes around here.\n  One of the things that I have learned is, just because you put \nsomething in an authorization bill, that you authorize a barrier, you \nauthorize more patrol officers, you authorize more detention space, \ndoes not mean it will actually be created and done.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Alabama, I have to \nsummarize this answer because welling up in my chest is a big complaint \nabout the Congress, about the Clinton administration, about the Bush \nadministration. Let's be honest. Nobody has done their job completely \nhere.\n  We authorized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is the committee you serve on, Judiciary, the \nauthorizing committee, and that I serve on.\n  Mr. KYL. That is right. Senator Feinstein and I got an amendment \npassed in 1996 to double the number of Border Patrol agents. It passed \nthe Judiciary Committee, passed the Congress. It is an authorization. \nDo you think that in 5 years we had double the Border Patrol agents? \nNo.\n  We couldn't get the administration to ask for enough funding in the \nbudget, and, of course, if it is not asked for, then Congress is loathe \nto appropriate. So it took us about, as I recall, 7 years or maybe 8 \nyears to get the number of agents doubled. We have succeeded in \ndoubling them and adding another 2,000 or 3,000 on top of that. But it \ntook far longer than it should have.\n  We have authorized SCAAP--the State Criminal Alien Assistance \nProgram--that reimburses the jails and prisons in your State, my State, \nand other States for the criminal aliens housed in those prisons. The \nprogram is authorized. This administration this year requested in the \nbudget exactly how much money for this program? Zero, nothing; same as \nlast year. Congress had to find the money. And we ended up \nappropriating about $300 million, which is less than half of what we \nshould have. Had we done $700 million, we would have reimbursed the \nStates about one-third of their expenses. We only did $305 million, as \nI recall.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Isn't it a Federal responsibility?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, regular order.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I believe Senator Kyl has the floor. I \nwas asking a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). The Senator from Arizona, Senator \nKyl, has the floor and has yielded for a question.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the bottom line is that many things we have \nauthorized--additional Border Patrol agents, additional equipment, \nadditional aircraft, radar, UMVs, cameras--neither the President nor \nthe Congress over the years has seen fit to provide. We have gotten a \nlot more in recent years than we have in the past. But the bottom line \nis merely because we authorize something doesn't necessarily mean it is \ngoing to be appropriated.\n  It is not just a matter of money. Sometimes it is a matter of \nenforcing laws that we have on the books--such as the employers who \nfind it very difficult to differentiate fraudulent documents and, \ntherefore, they end up hiring illegal immigrants. But we don't enforce \nthat law. It is hard to blame the employer, but the Government isn't \ntrying to enforce it, either. Simply authorizing something doesn't \nnecessarily mean it will happen.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask the Senator, isn't that in fact \nwhat happened in 1986? We passed the amnesty bill, and the American \npeople were told this would be a one-time thing, it would solve this \nproblem, and we are going to have enforcement on the border. That was \npromised. But, in fact, it never occurred. The monies were never \nappropriated. The President never aggressively asked for the resources \nnecessary to make this occur, and we ended up not enforcing the law.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, my perception is that \nhaving passed the law, one reason people referred to it as amnesty is \nbecause it was not enforced. There was a commitment to enforce it. I \ndon't know the reasons why it wasn't enforced, but in many respects it \nwas not.\n  The key thing we need to do here, since the American people are \nskeptical of our ability and our commitment to enforce the laws, in \norder to be able to adopt the guest worker program and deal with the \npeople who are here illegally and have a work program, in the future we \nare going to have to demonstrate to them we have the ability and we \nwill make the commitment to enforce whatever law we end up adopting.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I wish to make a few comments.\n  I see Senator McCain. Maybe there is time he wants to use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator from Alabama seeking \nrecognition?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I seek recognition from the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this is a very real concern Senator Kyl \nand I have talked about. The concern is we are basically telling the \nAmerican people that in good faith we are going to recognize that \nsomehow we failed to follow the law, that we failed to enforce the law \nand create a workable system. The last time in 1986 we said we had a \nmillion people here illegally, and we admitted we were going to give \nthem amnesty, and that we were going to try to create a system in the \nfuture that would not lead to these kinds of problems again.\n  What happened was 3 million people showed up--not 1 million--and they \nclaimed amnesty. We never enforced the borders. Here we are 20 years \nlater, and we have an estimated 11 million people, although I think one \nof the survey firms in the country said there may be 20 million people \nhere. We will find out, I guess, when this passes.\n\n[[Page S2593]]\n\n  But the question is, What will we do to ensure with this implied \npromise we are making to the American people that won't happen again?\n  The truth is, President Carter, President Reagan, President Bush, the \nformer, President Clinton, and this President Bush have not come to the \nCongress and said, Congress, we are not getting the job done on the \nborder. Give us more money and we will fix it. We have this problem. We \nneed a computer. The employers are telling us they can't ask the proper \nquestions because of this law or that law. The employment enforcement \nis not working. Help us change the law, Congress, so we can create a \nworkable system. They never asked for it. They never did anything to \nsuggest that. The system has gotten completely out of control.\n\n  How do we know, when we pass this legislation and immediately provide \nfor the benefit of those who come illegally new rights and privileges \nand a path that would lead them straight to citizenship, how do we know \nwe are not going to have the problem again?\n  That is all I am asking. I don't know how you can do it.\n  You could say, Well, this law won't take effect until we have a \nborder system that works. Is that the way we will do it? I am not sure.\n  But the American people have every right to be skeptical. They have \nevery right to be skeptical. They have a right to wonder if we are at \nall serious about what we are saying here.\n  I was a Federal prosecutor for 15 years. That is what I have done the \nbiggest part of my professional life. I tell you it breaks my heart to \nsee a legal system so ineffective. What has been going on here is a \nmockery of law.\n  Time and again we come back and we admit we haven't enforced the law. \nWhat good is the law if it is not enforced, let me ask you. You can't \nmake everybody happy. You can't do everything for everybody.\n  I believe very strongly that this Nation is a nation of immigrants. I \nam perfectly prepared to approve allowing quite an additional number of \npeople to come into this country legally. But in exchange for that, I \nthink we have to have the balancing act of a legal system that works so \nwe do not continue to see the large numbers of people coming in \nillegally.\n  I will summarize again what I have said before. I think we can do it. \nThis is not that difficult. We increase border security, we use \nbarriers, we use the virtual fence concept, we use computer systems and \nbiometric identifiers, the United States VISIT Program, which needs to \nbe completed, and then we use enforcement in the workplace.\n  As C.J. Bonner--people who have followed this heard him speak out \nbefore. He represents the Border Patrol agents. He said that absolutely \nwe can do this. It is not going to cost a fortune and it is not going \nto break the Treasury of the United States, but it is going to cost \nsome money.\n  If we will step it up and do these things, we can create a tipping \npoint where people come into the country legally instead of illegally. \nThat is it.\n  Right now, they come illegally. Why? It is easier to come illegally, \nthat is why. People do what they are allowed to do.\n  I believe we can make this system better. I believe the legislation \nthat came out of committee moved far more aggressively to the amnesty \ndirection in the bill that Chairman Specter started out with.\n  The legislation that is pending before the Senate today does not \nrepresent the settled opinion of the American people. Once they find \nout about it, they will not be as happy as we would like them to be.\n  It is time to slow down, listen carefully to what is occurring, make \nsure we have a plan in place that will guarantee enforcement on the \nborder, that will guarantee workplace enforcement and a plan that will \nallow more people to come in a legal way, an effective way, using a \nbiometric identifier so they can come through the border and maybe go \nback and forth every weekend if that works for them and create a system \nby which this country can decide how many workers and what category we \nneed so that if we have a downturn in our economy, we are not driving \nAmericans out of work in large numbers. Those are things that a \nrational country would do.\n  This legislation, as presently configured, does not do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Alabama. He is a man of passion \nand commitment and willing to stay late no matter what to make his \npoints and advocate his positions. I always enjoy doing business with \nthe Senator.\n  I want to make one comment; that the President of the United States \ntoday in Cancun made a very positive statement about what we are doing \nin the Senate. I am very appreciative of his comments. He said that we \nhave to obviously put people at the back of the line that want to be \ncitizens, but he also felt very strongly that we needed a viable guest \nworker program.\n  I am hoping over the weekend we can all think about our positions and \nperhaps get into some associations so that we can resolve this issue \namongst everyone because it seems to have generated not only a lot of \nattention but a lot of controversy as well, particularly in the media.\n  I know we are all trying to achieve the same goal of securing our \nborders and at the same time resolving the issues of how people can \ncome here and work legally if they are both qualified and needed, and, \nof course, addressing the issue of the 11 to 12 million people who are \nalready here, some of them coming yesterday, some of them here 50 or 60 \nyears.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I have an amendment to fix a broken \nbureaucracy and help noncitizens who are serving in our military become \ncitizens of the United States.\n  There are over 40,000 non-U.S. citizens serving in the U.S. military \ntoday. Many want to become U.S. citizens but are caught up in red tape \nand paperwork, bureaucratic run-arounds and backlogs. That is wrong--\nmany of these young people are on the front lines in Iraq, Afghanistan, \nand throughout the world fighting terrorists. They are focused on \nfighting the enemy; they shouldn't also have to fight the bureaucracy \njust to become a citizen of the country they are fighting for. My \namendment makes sure that it is easier and quicker for non-U.S. \ncitizens serving in our military to become citizens.\n  This amendment is called the ``Kendell Frederick Citizenship Act of \n2005.'' Why? Because Kendell Frederick's death in Iraq shows clearly \nhow broken our bureaucracy is, and why it is so important to pass this \nbill. Kendell Frederick was an Army soldier from Maryland killed in \nIraq on October 19, 2005. He was 21 years old. Kendell was killed by a \nroadside bomb on his way to be fingerprinted to become a U.S. citizen. \nBut he was also killed by the botched bureaucracy of the U.S. \nGovernment: by their incompetence, by their indifference, by their \nineptitude. This is inexcusable.\n  Every military death in Iraq is a tragedy, but this one did not need \nto happen. Kendell died in Iraq, fighting for America. Yet he wasn't \nborn in America, he was born in Trinidad. He came to this country when \nhe was 15 years old. As many who come to this country to pursue the \nAmerican dream, he was filled with hopes about his future in this \ncountry. He got an education and graduated from Randallstown High \nSchool in 2003. While in high school, he decided to join ROTC. After he \ngraduated from high school, he decided to join the Army with hopes that \nhe would be able to go back to school.\n  In the Army, Kendell was a generator mechanic assigned to a heavy \ncombat battalion. His job was to keep all of the generators running, \nwhich kept his battalion running. Kendell wanted to become an American \ncitizen. Yet a series of bureaucratic screwups and unnecessary hurdles \nprevented that--and cost him his life.\n  Kendell had been trying for over a year to become a U.S. citizen. He \nstarted working on it when he joined the Army, while he was training \nand learning how to become a soldier. Kendell sent his citizenship \napplication in and checked the wrong box. Specialist Frederick was busy \ntraining for war, packing to go to Iraq, saying goodbye to his mother, \nhis brother, and his two sisters. All the while, he was also worrying \nwhich box to check to become a U.S. citizen.\n  After that, Kendell's application was derailed by immigration three \ntimes. First, after his mother checked the\n\n[[Page S2594]]\n\ncorrect box saying Kendell was in the military, Immigration sent the \napplication to the wrong office, not the office that handles military \napplications.\n  Second, Immigration rejected the fingerprints he sent them, with no \nexplanation. Kendell had his fingerprints taken when he joined the \nmilitary. He had an FBI background check for the military. We have high \nstandards to be in the U.S. military. There was no reason Immigration \ncould not have used the fingerprints taken when he joined the military, \nbut they refused.\n  Third, and finally, Kendell was told to get his fingerprints retaken \nin Maryland--but he was in Iraq fighting a war. His mother called 1-800 \nImmigration. That's supposed to be the HELP line. She told them: My boy \nis in Baghdad, he can't come to Baltimore to get fingerprinted. She \nwould have loved for her son to come to Baltimore, but he was fighting \nin a war, fighting for America. Immigration told Kendell's mom there \nwas nothing they could do. They were wrong. That was the wrong \ninformation. They were no help.\n  On October 19, Specialist Kendell Frederick was traveling in a convoy \nto a base to get fingerprinted. He did not usually go on convoys, but \nthat day he was in the convoy. Kendell Frederick was killed when a \nroadside bomb struck that convoy. He was granted his United States \ncitizenship a week after he died. He was buried in Arlington National \nCemetery. Kendell was trying to do the right thing, yet he was given \nwrong information. He got the run-a-round. His sergeant tried to help, \nbut he didn't know all the rules. It was not his job to know the \nrules--he was fighting a war. Kendell's mother did the right thing: she \ntried to cut through the bureaucracy, making phone calls, sending \nletters. She was diligent and relentless. The system failed--again and \nagain. And a wonderful young man lost his life.\n  Kendell's mother, Michelle Murphy, could have just sat there. She \ncould have boiled in her rage, but, no, she wanted to do something with \nher grief. When I spoke with her, she told me she didn't want any \nmother to have to go through what she went through, what her son went \nthrough. Service members and their mothers should not be worrying about \nwhat box to check on a citizenship application, which of many addresses \nis the right address to mail it to, or where to get fingerprints taken. \nWhen a service member is fighting for America, mothers have enough to \nworry about. Service members have enough to worry about.\n  This amendment makes it easier for military service members to become \ncitizens. The provisions of this amendment cut through the red tape. \nFirst, it requires Citizenship and Immigration Services, CIS, to use \nthe fingerprints the military takes when a person enlists in the \nmilitary, so a service member doesn't have to keep getting new \nfingerprints. Second, it requires the creation of a military \nCitizenship Advocate to inform the service members about the \ncitizenship process and help with the application. Third, it requires \nCIS to set up a customer service hotline dedicated to serving military \nmembers and their families. Finally, it requires the Government \nAccountability Office to conduct an investigation into what is wrong \nwith immigration services for our military.\n  No one should ever again have to go through what Kendell and his \nmother went through. I am proud to stand here today with Senator \nKennedy to offer this amendment named after Kendell Frederick, just as \nhis mother asked me to do. The Kendell Frederick bill will make sure \nthat anyone in the military who wants to be a U.S. citizen will be able \nto do so, quickly and easily. If you are willing to fight and die for \nAmerica, you should be able to become an American. I urge my colleagues \nto join with me in passing this important amendment. Help the brave men \nand women fighting for this country become the U.S. citizens they \ndeserve to be.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the passing of \nan exceptional leader, as well as a respected Floridian. VADM John \n``Jack'' Fetterman passed away last Friday at his home in Pensacola, \nFL, at the age of 73.\n  Following graduation from Albright College in Pennsylvania and \nAviation Officer Candidate School in Pensacola, Admiral Fetterman began \nhis career as a naval aviator. He later went on to become a Pacific \nFleet naval Air Force commander in 1987 and was promoted to vice \nadmiral.\n  I had the pleasure of meeting and working with Admiral Fetterman \nduring the Base Closure and Realignment process last year. I found him \nto be a fierce and eloquent defender of the Navy and of the military.\n  Admiral Fetterman, in 1991, became the chief of Naval Education and \nTraining at Pensacola Naval Air Station. He created and was the father \nof the Core Values Training Program, which earned him the title of the \n``Father of Navy Ethics.''\n  Admiral Fetterman retired as a three-star admiral in 1993. But upon \nhis retirement, he did not just retire, he continued his love of the \nNavy and his service to the Nation by becoming the president and CEO of \nthe Naval Aviation Museum Foundation.\n  Admiral Fetterman, with a great deal of love and care, guided and \ndirected the Museum of Naval Aviation in Pensacola, which is truly a \nwonderful and remarkable place where the many heroic feats of people \nover the years connected to naval aviation are recorded and \nappreciated.\n  Admiral Fetterman, to the very last, continued to serve his Nation \nand his country well. I extend my condolences to the members of his \nfamily, to his beloved wife, and to all those in the community, in the \nnaval community, who came in contact with such a fine American, who \nserved his country so well.\n  At times such as this, I know we are always reminded that life is \nfinite, and that we also have to harken and always appreciate a life \nwell lived, as was Admiral Fetterman's.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/30/senate-section/article/S2594-3", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2594-S2595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                CAMBODIA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today is a tragic anniversary for \nCambodia.\n  Nine years ago, on March 30, 1997, a peaceful and legal rally held by \nthe opposition Khmer Nation Party was disrupted by a grenade attack. To \ndate, there has been no justice for the victims or their families, \nincluding American Ron Abney who was injured in the attack.\n  While I am aware of the many lawsuits relating to this incident that \nhave been filed, dropped, or dismissed, I encourage the State \nDepartment to work with the Government of Cambodia to secure the return \nof the Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI, so that the FBI can \nconclude its investigation into this crime. Bringing the perpetrators \nto justice is the only way to honor those killed and injured on that \ntragic day.\n  I am hopeful that the ongoing dialogue between Prime Minister Hun Sen \nand opposition leader Sam Rainsy will continue and that Hun Sen's \npledges for reform are matched by concrete and measurable actions. My \nonly advice to the Prime Minister is that he thinks before he speaks. \nIt is counterproductive, at best, to call for the sacking of Yash Ghai, \nthe U.N.'s special representative for human rights in Cambodia, because \nof critical comments he made on the Government's crackdown on dissent.\n  The desire for democracy and justice in Cambodia remains strong \ntoday, and I encourage the Cambodian people to remain vigilant. It is \nmy hope that they, one day, know freedom from fear, can rely on good \ngovernance, and know\n\n[[Page S2595]]\n\nthat justice is neither bought nor sold. The Government of Cambodia \nbears the burden of proving that it is part of the solution--and not \npart of the problem. International donors should not forget for a \nsingle moment that those killed 9 years ago were peacefully calling for \njudicial reforms.\n  As I have in the past, I ask unanimous consent that the names of \nthose murdered on March 30, 1997, be printed in the Record following my \nremarks. I know they remain in the thoughts and prayers of their \nfamilies and friends in Cambodia, as do they in ours.\n  There being no objection, the names were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows: Mr. Cheth Duong Daravuth, Mr. Han Mony, Mr. Sam \nSarin, Ms. Yong Sok Neuv, Ms. Young Srey, Ms. Yos Siem, Ms. Chanty \nPheakdey, Mr. Ros Sear, Ms. Sok Kheng, Mr. Yoeun Yorn, Mr. Chea Nang, \nMr. Nam Thy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/30/senate-section/article/S2595-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              FRAUDULENT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS IN BELARUS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I want to express my concerns \nabout the recent presidential election in Belarus.\n  I have previously noted the tremendous hardships Belarus has endured \nthroughout its history. For centuries, Belarus has been fought over, \noccupied and carved up. But Belarus' declaration of independence from \nthe Soviet Union in 1991 held great promise for a better future. As it \nbroke from communist rule, it had the opportunity to build a free \nnation and become part of a peaceful, more secure Europe. The country \nbegan to embrace economic and political reforms and democratic \nprinciples. It established a constitution and held its first \nPresidential election in 1994.\n  Unfortunately, the prospect of democratic change in Belarus was \nquickly frozen as its first President, Alexander Lukashenka, adopted \nincreasingly authoritarian policies, including amending the \nconstitution in a flawed referendum to extend his term and broaden his \npowers. Lukashenka's regime has been marked by a terrible human rights \nrecord that is progressively getting worse, with little respect for \nfreedom of expression, assembly or an independent media. A pattern of \ndisturbing disappearances of opposition leaders fails to be seriously \ninvestigated by authorities. The living conditions in Belarus are \ndeclining and Lukashenka's refusal to institute economic reforms has \nonly aggravated the situation.\n  The 2005 State Department Human Rights report states that ``the \ngovernment's human rights record remained very poor and worsened in \nsome areas with the government continuing to commit numerous serious \nabuses.'' The report goes on to acknowledge that Lukashenka \n``systematically undermined the country's democratic institutions and \nconcentrated power in the executive branch through flawed referenda, \nmanipulated elections, and undemocratic laws and regulations.'' Mr. \nPresident, the litany of human rights abuses documented in this report \nshow that Lukashenka has only used the last 12 years to increase the \nreign of tyranny and oppression in Belarus.\n  The elections of March 19, 2006 continued Lukashenka's repressive \ntactics and total disregard for democratic principles. The Organization \nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe, OSCE, which observed the \nelections, stated in its report that ``the arbitrary abuse of state \npower, obviously designed to protect the incumbent President, went far \nbeyond acceptable practice. The incumbent President permitted State \nauthority to be used in a manner which did not allow citizens to freely \nand fairly express their will at the ballot box.'' The report cited a \n``climate of intimidation and insecurity'' and a ``highly problematic'' \nvote count during and after the election.\n  The recent so-called ``color revolutions'' in Georgia, the Ukraine, \nand Kyrgyzstan, showed what can happen when a country's people become \nfed up with the oppression of tyrants and call for democratic, \nrepresentative government. Let us hope that the fledgling democracy \nmovement in Belarus has a similar chance to flower. A number of \ncourageous Belarusians braved intimidation and took serious risks to \ndenounce the election results in peaceful public demonstrations; \nunfortunately, these risks were made imminently clear when Belarusian \nsecurity forces marched into the public square where they were rallying \nand forcibly detained a number of them in the early morning hours of \nMarch 24. I add my voice to the chorus of those calling for the \nBelarusian authorities to respect the rights of their citizens, hold \nvalid elections, and immediately release those who were detained simply \nfor peacefully expressing their views.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/30/senate-section/article/S2595-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On November 14, 2001, Pablo Parrilla was charged with first-degree \nintentional homicide in the shooting death of his sister's girlfriend, \nJuana Vega. Parilla confronted Vega outside her Milwaukee, WI, house \nand shot her repeatedly. According to reports, Parrilla was shouting \nsexually derogatory slurs toward Vega throughout the attack.\n  I would note that recently in the House, hate crimes legislation was \npassed in a bipartisan vote. I strongly believe that we must also move \nsimilar legislation in the Senate. In the months ahead, I look forward \nto working with Senator Kennedy as we continue our work in passing a \nhate crimes bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/30/senate-section/article/S2595-3", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2595-S2596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate National \nWomen's History Month.\n  This is an important national observance that reminds us to celebrate \nthe immense accomplishments and everlasting contributions of women. \nWomen have helped shape our society since the first settlers landed on \nAmerica's shores, and women continue to lead us into the future.\n  It is important that we remember the efforts of women such as Harriet \nTubman, Amelia Earhart, Eleanor Roosevelt, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, \nMadeleine Albright, Maya Angelou, Ella Fitzgerald, Betty Friedan, Ruth \nBader Ginsburg, Billie Jean King, Margaret Mead, Sacagawea, and Chien-\nShiung Wu. We celebrate the diverse contributions of each of these \nremarkable women to all facets of American society.\n  The State of New Jersey is home to many commendable women. Alice \nPaul, Elizabeth Coleman White, Mary Norton, and Mary Roebling are just \na few.\n  Alice Paul was as a leader of the women's suffrage movement, founder \nof the National Women's Party, and author of the equal rights \namendment. This longtime activist for women's equality is well known \nfor picketing the White House, which landed her in jail during the \nsummer of 1917 but helped secure women's right to vote. Few have had as \ngreat an impact on American history as Alice Paul.\n  Elizabeth Coleman White was born on her family's cranberry farm in \nNew Lisbon, NJ. She partnered with Frederick Coville on her farm to \ncreate the first commercial crop of blueberries. Ms. White was also the \nfirst person to use a cellophane wrap in fruit shipment.\n  Mary Norton was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1924 \nand served in Congress for 26 years. She was a member of the famous \nPetticoat Front in the 80th Congress, which was a bipartisan group of \nwomen who fought to gain equal footing with men as legislators. At the \ntime, only seven women served in the Congress. Today, thanks in part to \nMary Norton's pioneering efforts, a record 84 women are Members of \nCongress.\n  Mary Roebling was the first woman to head a major commercial bank, \nthe Trenton Trust Company, and in 1958 she became the first female \ngovernor of the New York Stock Exchange. She has proven that women can \nbe just as successful in the business world, and any sector, as men.\n\n[[Page S2596]]\n\n  These four women are only a handful of those who deserve recognition \nfor their contributions to America.\n  In 1981, Congress passed a resolution establishing National Women's \nHistory Week, which coincides with International Women's Day. At the \nrequest of the National Women's History Project, this was expanded to a \nmonth in 1987. I have always been proud to support this effort.\n  I hope that National Women's History Month will continue to help \neducate Americans about women's accomplishments and inspire more women \nto reach for the stars.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/30/senate-section/article/S2596-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          A SPEAKER FOR IDAHO\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I never had the opportunity to serve with \nBruce Newcomb in the Idaho State Legislature, but having been \nprivileged to get to know him, I very much would have enjoyed working \nwith a man of his caliber.\n  Bruce is retiring from the Idaho House of Representatives at the end \nof the 2006 session, and he will be sorely missed by his colleagues in \nthe legislature and his constituents in Idaho. Bruce has developed a \nreputation of being an honest and evenhanded speaker of the house whose \nsense of humor helps in tackling contentious issues and a heavy \nworkload. In addition, he is a strong leader who is not afraid to make \na strong stand when the situation calls for it.\n  Having grown up on a working farm and ranch in Idaho myself, I \nunderstand the difficulty of going to Boise to serve in the legislature \nin the middle of the calving season. Bruce has been able to handle his \nwork as a rancher while serving the constituents of Idaho, without \nsacrificing the quality of either profession--not to mention his \nimportant duties as a family man, the husband of Celia Gould and father \nof five children. It takes a truly talented man to handle all these \nresponsibilities and continue to have such strong loyalty and respect \nfrom colleagues, family, and friends.\n  Over the 2006 President's Day recess, I had the opportunity to share \nthe floor with Bruce at the Mini-Cassia Lincoln Day Luncheon in Burley, \nID, to answer questions from the constituents of Idaho. Bruce fielded \nall the State-related questions and handled them with impressive \nknowledge, not to mention a down-home country charm which made \ncomplicated issues easy to understand. After seeing Bruce in action \nwith his constituents in his home district, it is easy to understand \nwhy he will leave such huge boots to fill when he retires.\n  Bruce served 20 years in the Idaho House of Representatives, where he \nheld many different leadership roles: majority caucus chairman, \nassistant majority leader, majority leader, and four terms as speaker \nof the house. His four terms as speaker marks him as the longest-\nserving speaker in the Idaho House of Representatives.\n  Bruce, thank you for your service to our State. You truly are a \nspeaker who speaks for Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, when the 2006 session of the Idaho State \nLegislature adjourns this year, it will signal the end of an era. The \nlongest-serving speaker of the Idaho House of Representatives will be \nretiring. Bruce Newcomb, a rancher from Burley, will leave the \nlegislature after a total of 20 years. He spent the past four terms as \nspeaker and leaves boots that will be difficult to fill, to say the \nleast.\n  Bruce and I served together in the legislature in the late 1980s. My \nformer colleague is a thoughtful man of principle and a terrific sense \nof humor. Bruce is also one of my closest friends. Over the years, I \nhave worked with him on many issues important to Idaho, and I know that \nI can always turn to him for solid advice and counsel. His reputation \nfor cooperation and collaboration is well deserved. He consistently \nseeks out fair and just solutions to policy challenges, even the more \ncontentious and divisive such as water issues and term limits. \nNevertheless, Bruce is unafraid to take a respectful but strong stand \nwhen circumstances require it. He earned such loyalty among colleagues \nand coworkers that when he lost his hair in a bout with cancer in the \n1990s, many of them shaved their heads in a show of solidarity.\n  Bruce takes his public service very seriously. Idaho has gained from \nhis wisdom, love for our State and ability to see clearly a path \nforward. Idaho's legislature is losing a remarkable man who has served \nall Idahoans faithfully and with excellence. I wish him and his family \nthe very best in retirement, and thank him for his steady, close \nfriendship over the years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/30/senate-section/article/S2596-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            COMBAT METH ACT\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to include in the Record \nan additional comment regarding the Combat Meth Act, which was passed \ninto law earlier this year as part of the USA-PATRIOT Reauthorization \nAct.\n  While much has been said about the portions of this bill that address \nthe national meth problem, I wish to highlight the commonsense approach \nthis legislation provides for preventing the diversion of controlled \nsubstances.\n  The Controlled Substances Act requires its registrants to ensure that \ncontrolled substances do not fall into the wrong hands in the places \nwhere they are manufactured, distributed, or sold. To this end, it has \nalways been the Drug Enforcement Administration's goal to encourage \nsuch registrants to investigate fully the backgrounds of potential \nemployees who might have access to such substances, specifically for \ndrug-related criminal convictions.\n  However, certain State and local privacy laws have had the potential \nto hamper this objective. These laws frustrate the purpose of the \nControlled Substances Act and the objectives of the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration by, among other things, purporting to prohibit \nregistrants from asking questions relating to an applicant's experience \nwith controlled substances, including whether they have been convicted \nof drug-related crimes. The real-world implication has been, in a word, \nnonsensical. In my own State of California, for example, there is a \nState law that provides that employers are not allowed to question a \npotential employee about certain drug-related criminal convictions that \nare older than 2 years. This prohibition also purports to cover \nemployers who are registered under the Controlled Substances Act. If a \nregistrant complied with this State law, it could mean that a \nresponsible pharmacy could hire someone to work at the cash register \nwho would be in a position to divert pharmaceutical products, and the \nemployer would never have any clue about the applicant's past. This \nruns counter to the purpose of the Controlled Substances Act and \nundermines the DEA's efforts to prevent the unlawful diversion of \ncontrolled substances.\n  The law we passed clarifies once and for all that registrants can and \nshould fully vet applicants, including asking them about any and all \ndrug-related criminal convictions--not as an infringement on someone's \nprivacy but as a safeguard to ensure that people with access to \ncontrolled substances do not pose risks to the public welfare. This \nlegislation makes clear that those on the frontlines of preventing \ncontrolled substance diversion have a crucial tool they need to do \ntheir job.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/30/senate-section/article/S2596-3", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2596-S2597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RELEASE OF JILL CARROLL\n\n  Ms. STABENOW.

I want to thank the Arab-American and \nMuslim-American leaders in Michigan and across the country for their \nhard work.\n  The Islamic Shura Council of Michigan which represents more than two \ndozen mosques and Islamic organizations in Southeast Michigan held a \npress conference publicly calling for her release. The Council on \nAmerican-Islamic Relations sent a delegation to Baghdad to lobby for \nher release. The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, The Arab \nAmerican News and the Congress of Arab American Organizations also \nissued public statements calling for Jill Carroll's release.\n\n[[Page S2597]]\n\n  These groups spoke out not just because of Jill Carroll's ties to \nMichigan or because this was a humanitarian issue, but because \nkidnapping and killing are an affront to the principles and values of \nIslam and Arab-American culture.\n  I want to wish Jill Carroll and her family the very best.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nremarkable woman in Bangor, ME, the city I am proud to call home.\n  Her name is Katherine Lebowitz, but her friends call her Kay. And she \nhas lots of friends: the citizens of Maine she represented so well in \nthe State legislature, the residents of Bangor she served as mayor, the \ncountless people who benefit from her tireless volunteer work for \neducational, cultural, and charitable causes.\n  Also among her close circle of friends are the more than 260,000 \nmembers of the U.S. Armed Forces who have passed through Bangor \nInternational Airport during the last 3 years of conflict. Whether \nBangor is their last stop before going overseas or the first American \nsoil they touch on the way home, Kay Lebowitz and the wonderful Bangor \nTroop Greeters are there. Nearly 1,500 military flights have landed in \nBangor since 2003, and the Troop Greeters have met every one day or \nnight with cookies, homemade fudge, cell phones to call loved ones back \nhome, cheers of gratitude, and hearty handshakes.\n  At the age of 90 soon to be 91 Kay has arthritis that prevents her \nfrom shaking hands, so she hugs. She hugs until her arms ache, but \nthere is a hug for everyone. To the returning troops, she says, \n``Welcome home.'' To those headed out, it is ``See you on the way \nback.'' And she will.\n  Today K-I-S-S radio in Bangor is holding a roast in honor of Kay \nLebowitz. This event will include the ceremonial ``retirement'' of a \npair of her trademark eyeglasses very stylish eyeglasses into the Troop \nGreeters Hall of Fame at Bangor International Airport. This is \nprecisely the kind of lighthearted gesture Kay enjoys most, and it is \nfully in keeping with her generous spirit.\n  I am sure my Senate colleagues join me and all Americans in thanking \nthe Bangor Troop Greeters for their extraordinary efforts in expressing \nthe gratitude we all share, and in wishing the very best on this \nspecial day to Kay Lebowitz. She is a remarkable woman and a great \npatriot.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/30/senate-section/article/S2597-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 CONGRATULATING LAHAINALUNA HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I extend my warmest congratulations \nto a secondary school in my State of Hawaii, on the island of Maui, \nthat has reached a significant milestone this year. All my best to \nLahainaluna High School, as it proudly celebrates its 175th \nanniversary. Lahainaluna sits in the foothills of the West Maui \nMountains overlooking Lahaina, a former whaling village once the \ncapital of Hawaii.\n  As with many schools, Lahainaluna, known as ``the leading star of the \nPacific,'' began as a seminary for young men. It opened on September 5, \n1831, following a vote of the Hawaiian Mission of the American Board of \nCommissioners to create the institution. Rev. Lorrin Andrews served as \nthe school's first headmaster for 25 students. By June of 1836, the \nclass size increased to accommodate 32 boys, some of them beginning the \ntradition of boarding that continues today.\n  Lahainaluna's initial curriculum included subjects that missionaries \nto Hawaii wished to require of teachers. These were traditional \nsubjects such as arithmetic, writing, geography, and natural history, \nand later, advanced mathematics, astronomy, scriptural history, and \ntheology. Students were also instructed in useful trades including \nfarming, animal care, carpentry, navigation, surveying, printing, and \nengraving. Members of this institution were inventive and innovative, \nand on February 14, 1834, the first issue of Ka Lama Hawaii, the first \nnewspaper published west of the Rocky Mountains, was printed at the \nschool.\n  The school's curriculum expanded tremendously from its original \nofferings by the turn of the century. Students learned grammar, \nbookkeeping, typing, mechanical and architectural drawing, sanitation, \ncivics, business math and English, in addition to vocational subjects \nsuch as auto repair and agriculture.\n  Lahainaluna kept pace with the times and in 1923 became known as a \n``public high school'' for boys and girls, rather than as a ``special \nschool.'' Two years later, the school became a 4-year high school and \ngraduated its first senior class in June 1926.\n  Statehood came for all of us in Hawaii on August 21, 1959. About 20 \nyears after that, Lahainaluna's traditionally male boarding department \nopened its doors to admit female boarders.\n  Lahainaluna was accredited in 2004 by the Western Association of \nSchools and Colleges for a 6-year term. It received a 2006 Superior \nSchools award at the Environmental and Spatial Technology conference in \nHot Springs, AR.\n  Today, Lahainaluna continues to be one of Maui's flagship high \nschools, educating a diverse student body of 1,000 students each year \nand sending them to colleges across the country. Certainly, the school \nhas weathered many changes, particularly the rise and fall of Maui's \nsugar industry, and the inevitable impacts on the families of its \nstudent body. It is my hope that the school will continue for many \nyears into the future to educate bright, young minds and inspire them \nto become productive citizens who give back to the community.\n  Congratulations to Principal Michael Nakano, members of his \nadministration, faculty, staff, current students, and their families, \nand all of its alumni who have continued Lahainaluna's proud traditions \nand seen the school to its memorable 175th anniversary this year.\n  The school's philosophy is an enduring one, and I will end by noting \npart of it here, ``We recognize the importance of each student. All \nstudents can learn and we must give them the opportunity to maximize \ntheir potential. We encourage students to think independently, to have \na sense of responsibility for themselves and for society and to \nexperience the satisfactions and rewards that come from \ncreativity.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/30/senate-section/article/S2597-3", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ROSWELL PUBLIC LIBRARY\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am proud to join the citizens \nof southeastern New Mexico in celebrating the 100th anniversary of the \nRoswell Public Library. That this should happen on the cusp of National \nLibrary Week makes the distinction even more gratifying. I would like \nto take this opportunity to commend Library Director Betty Long and the \nRoswell Public Library staff, both former and present, for their hard \nwork and dedication to the public library system. Their devotion and \ncommitment to the citizens of Roswell and Chaves County are exemplary.\n  On April 2, 1906, through the perseverance of the Roswell Woman's \nClub, the library opened at its original location on Richardson and \nThird Streets. The Roswell Public Library was established before New \nMexico received statehood; it also preceded the historic Chaves County \nCourthouse. Throughout the decades, the Roswell Public Library has \nremained steadfast in providing Roswell the scholarly and leisure \nresources necessary to stimulate a vibrant and growing community.\n  During my time in the Senate I have come to understand the importance \nof increased funding for and awareness of library services in the 21st \ncentury. Libraries do more than just loan books; they serve as meeting \nplaces, repositories of knowledge, and safe havens where ideas can be \nstrengthened or challenged. They have played a vital role in the \ndevelopment of human culture throughout history. It is clear that the \nrole of the Roswell Public Library in this most worthy pursuit will be \neven greater in the decades to come.\n  Once again, I would like to congratulate the Roswell Public Library \non their centennial. I wish them continued success as they move \nforward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/30/senate-section/article/S2597-4", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2597-S2598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MESABI EAST SCHOOLS, AURORA, MINNESOTA\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Mesabi \nEast School\n\n[[Page S2598]]\n\nDistrict, in Aurora, MN, which recently earned an Award for Excellence \nin Education for its exceptional and innovative achievements in \neducating children.\n  The Mesabi East School District is truly a model of educational \nsuccess. The district believes the education of our students goes \nbeyond the classroom walls to include helping children develop \ncompassion and the desire to serve their community.\n  Toward that goal, for the past 9 years, the Mesabi East Schools have \nsponsored Project Elf, which provides clothing, food, and toys for less \nfortunate families in the area who apply for the assistance. Donations \nare solicited from local merchants, and student volunteers receive a \nbudget to shop for each family. All names are kept confidential. \nRecently, Project Elf inspired another initiative, called Elf Central. \nParticipating students and staff volunteer to stay after school to make \ngifts for people in need of a cheerful message. The effort became a \ngroundswell; now, 457 students volunteer often, throughout the year.\n  Students' community involvement exceeds helping families and those in \nneed. Over the past 6 years, the students of the Mesabi East Schools \nhave sponsored a carefully planned Veterans Day celebration to honor \nthe men and women who have given so much for their country. The \nVeterans Day ceremony has become a hallmark of community pride and a \nwonderful form of appreciation for the sacrifices of all our Nation's \nveterans.\n  In addition, the Mesabi East District has focused particular \nattention on early childhood education. Recently, the District created \na nonprofit entity dedicated to researching the best possible way to \nprovide services to families. This group has quickly organized a \nvariety of early childhood activities within the community.\n  Much of the credit for the success of the Mesabi East School District \nbelongs to its superintendent, Gene Paulson; the principals, Sam Wilkes \nand Jorma Rahkola; and all the dedicated teachers. The students and \nstaff at Mesabi East Schools understand that, in order to be \nsuccessful, a school must go beyond achieving academic success; it must \nalso provide a nurturing environment where students can develop the \nknowledge, skills, and attitudes for success throughout life. All of \nthe faculty, staff, and students at Mesabi East Schools should be very \nproud of their accomplishments.\n  I congratulate the Mesabi East School District in Aurora for winning \nthe Award for Excellence in Education and for its exceptional \ncontributions to education in Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/30/senate-section/article/S2598-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           JOHN A.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor John A. \nJohnson Achievement Plus Elementary School, in Saint Paul, MN, which \nrecently earned an Award for Excellence in Education for its \nexceptional and innovative achievements in educating children.\n  John A. Johnson Elementary School is truly a model of educational \nsuccess. A state-of-the-art community school, it was the first \nrecipient of the Richard W. Riley Award for Excellence in Community \nSchools, which is conferred by the KnowledgeWorks Foundation, a public \neducation philanthropy in Ohio. John A. Johnson Elementary, which \nserves 320 children in kindergarten through grade six, was deemed the \nbest community school in the Nation and won this distinction merely 4 \nyears after opening its doors.\n  As one of Minnesota's best-performing schools serving children of a \npredominantly low-income population, Johnson has accumulated truly \nimpressive academic accomplishments. For example, during the school's \nfirst 2 years of operation, 2000-2002, only 50 percent of the children \ntested average or above average on standardized reading tests. However, \nfor the past 2 years, nearly 80 percent scored average or above \naverage.\n  Improvements in math scores at John A. Johnson Elementary are equally \nremarkable. Last year, standardized test scores in math were within two \npercentage points of the district average. Only 3 years ago, John A. \nJohnson pupils were 30 points below the district average.\n  John A. Johnson Elementary does more than teach children; it is \nstructured to assist families and reduce barriers to education that \nimpede children's learning. The school integrates support services by \nforming partnerships with many community organizations and making these \nservices available to help parents.\n  Much of the credit for John A. Johnson Achievement Plus Elementary \nSchool's success belongs to its principal, Frank Feinberg, and the \ndedicated teachers. The students and staff at John A. Johnson \nElementary School understand that, in order to be successful, a school \nmust go beyond achieving academic success; it must also provide a \nnurturing environment where students can develop the knowledge, skills, \nand attitudes for success throughout life.

Students are given the privilege of \nmeeting other young people of many different cultures, experiences, and \nabilities. Students come to Lake Harriet Community School from a \nvariety of Minneapolis neighborhoods, and the school is proud of its \nrecord of fostering respect and appreciation for diversity.\n  The academic achievements of the students who attend Lake Harriet \nCommunity School are among the highest in Minnesota. For 2 successive \nyears, the school has earned five-star status in both reading and math \nfrom the Minnesota Department of Education, an accomplishment realized \nby fewer than 5 percent of all schools in the State of Minnesota.\n  Much of the credit for Lake Harriet Community School's success \nbelongs to its principal, Marsha Seltz, and all the dedicated teachers. \nThe students and staff at Lake Harriet Community School understand \nthat, in order to be successful, a school must go beyond achieving \nacademic success; it must also provide a nurturing environment where \nstudents can develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes for success \nthroughout life.

Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a \nremarkable young man, Brad Cohen. Brad is a teacher and an author. Brad \nCohen is one of the more than 100,000 people in the United States who \nhave full-blown Tourette syndrome.\n  I first met Brad through his loving father and my friend Norm Cohen. \nLater, as chairman of the State Board\n\n[[Page S2599]]\n\nof Education, I visited Brad in his classroom at Mountain View \nElementary. I marveled at Brad's ability to teach and hold young \nchildren spell-bound. I watched as Brad's occasional twitches and \nnoises went unnoticed by his class. I watched a young teacher master \nboth teaching and Tourette syndrome through determination and personal \ncommitment.\n  Brad has authored a book titled ``Front of the Class, How Tourette \nSyndrome Made Me the Teacher I Never Had.'' It is a story of personal \nchallenge and determination. It is a story of a young man's dreams \ncoming true. Brad's book is for everyone, and his twenty motivational \ntips on living with a disability are an inspiration for anyone. I \ncommend Brad Cohen on the power of his life of achievement and the \ninspiration he has to the children he teaches.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/30/senate-section/article/S2599-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO HOOSIER ESSAY CONTEST WINNERS\n\n Mr. LUGAR.

It's amazing!\n       Wheat Gal: Yeah, and to think these items are so delicious \n     and nutritious!\n       Corn Man: This is the best cookout ever!\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 Memorable Cookouts From Hoosier Farms\n\n                  (By Brittany Blazier--Wells County)\n\n       ``Lunch time!''\n       My head popped out of the chilly lake water like a jack-in-\n     the-box. I didn't need to be told twice. Scrambling out of \n     the water, I ran to the shore and flung a sun-warmed towel \n     around me, the breeze making goose bumps on my skin. It was \n     another beautiful day in Indiana.\n       ``What are we eating?'' my brother asked as he sat down at \n     a picnic table.\n       ``The usual,'' I shrugged.\n       Of course, as Grandma and Mom brought out plate after plate \n     of piping hot food, ``the usual'' was absolutely music to my \n     taste buds. Corn on the cob, strawberries, and an apple pie \n     looked especially appetizing.\n       Quickly buttering my corn, I felt my mouth water. ``This is \n     your corn, isn't it, Grandpa?''\n       Indiana is the seventeenth largest producer of sweet corn \n     in the nation. In 2003, it produced 18,600 tons! Along with \n     the fact that sweet corn tastes delicious, it's also very \n     healthy. Corn is a good source of protein, carbohydrates, \n     fiber, iron, and potassium.\n       After the corn, I moved on to devour the strawberries. Also \n     grown in Indiana, strawberries are jam-packed with vitamin C. \n     In fact, one cup of strawberries is eighty-two milligrams of \n     vitamin C, which is twenty-two more than my diet requires.\n       Finally, the apple pie was last with apples straight from \n     our orchard. Indiana ranks sixteenth in the country for apple \n     production. Apples are another great source of vitamin C and \n     other nutrients.\n       I put my fork down and sighed with happiness. My stomach \n     was full, and so was my heart. These memorable cookouts with \n     our homegrown food--heavenly Hoosier horticulture--are \n     ineffably priceless.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    2005-2006 District Essay Winners\n\n       District 1: Elizabeth Zubrenic (Lake County) and Michael \n     Rice (Marshall County).\n       District 2: Jeff Teeters (Allen County) and Megan Ramus \n     (DeKalb County).\n       District 3: Jill Griffin (Carroll County) and Victor \n     Gutwein (Jasper County).\n       District 4: Jared Wilkinson (Miami County) and Brittany \n     Blazier (Wells County).\n       District 5: Andrew Keck (Hendricks County) and Chelsea \n     Carroll (Morgan County).\n       District 6: Nick Johnson (Hamilton County) and Cierra \n     Edwards (Randolph County).\n       District 7: Sangeeth Jeevan (Vigo County) and Amy Goodman \n     (Green County).\n       District 8: Megan Hein (Johnson County) and Doug Wicker \n     (Rush County).\n       District 9: Blake Kleaving (Perry County) and Austen McBain \n     (Posey County).\n       District 10: Julia Hunter (Floyd County) and Jordan Agan \n     (Washington County).\n\n                     2005-2006 County Essay Winners\n\n       Adams: Elizabeth Goebel.\n       Allen: Jeff Teeters and Ivy Strubel.\n       Bartholomew: Chrissy Day.\n       Benton: Michael Strasburger and Allyson LaGrange.\n       Brown: Sherry Lynn Bube.\n       Carroll: Jill Griffin.\n       Cass: Ethan Sell and Katelyn McKaig.\n       Clark: Austin Mann.\n       Daviess: Elizabeth Anne Bohnert.\n       DeKalb: Dean Behrendsen and Megan Ramus.\n       Dubois: Matthew Wilmes and Katie Whitsitt.\n       Elkhart: Bennett Tyson and Emily Zimmerman.\n       Floyd: Stephen McCoskey and Julia Hunter.\n       Franklin: Chase Howell and Molly Schwab.\n       Greene: Corbyn Bales and Amy Goodman.\n       Hamilton: Nick Johnson and Meera Chander.\n       Hendricks: Andrew Keck and Rachel Douglas.\n       Henry: Zach Emerson and Emily Thornburgh.\n       Jackson: Derrick O'Sullivan and Kourtney Tiemeyer.\n       Jasper: Victor Gutwein and Lindsey Park.\n       Jay: Ben Vance and Kellie Howell.\n       Jennings: Aaron Simmons and Morgan Siener.\n       Johnson: Ben Diekhoff and Megan Hein.\n       Lake: Patrick Cudzilo and Elizabeth Zubrenic.\n       Madison: Jessica Driggers.\n       Marion: Alex Schroeder and Anasuya Shekhar.\n       Marshall: Michael Rice and Rachel Conley.\n       Miami: Jared Wilkinson and Adeline Jackson.\n       Monroe: J.P.

LORD\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and pay \ntribute to\n\n[[Page S2600]]\n\nGEN Lance W. Lord, commander of Air Force Space Command, and his wife \nBeccy for their lifetime of service and unfaltering dedication to the \nU.S. Air Force and our great country.\n  As both an airman and leader, spanning 37 years of military service, \nGeneral Lord's contributions to our Nation's strategic deterrence and \nspace missions were critical to the warfighter, global economy, and the \nsafety of our families. General Lord's leadership was an essential \nelement in winning the Cold War and vital to Air Force Space Command's \nsupport of combat operations around the world to include Operations \nEnduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, and the global war on terrorism.\n  General Lord prepared for his illustrious Air Force career by \ngraduating from Otterbein College and its Reserve Officer Training \nCorps in 1968. In January of 1969, General Lord was introduced to the \nAir Force through Intercontinental Ballistic Missile, ICBM, operational \nreadiness and combat crew missile training. This training led to his \nfirst assignment to North Dakota as a Minuteman II combat crewmember. \nGeneral Lord's Air Force journey would take him and Beccy through a \nseries of Air Staff and Department of Defense assignments relating to \nspace and strategic and tactical missile systems. He was assigned as \nthe military assistant to the director of Net Assessment and directed \nthe Ground-Launched Cruise Missile Program in Europe. He served as the \ncommander of the 10th Strategic Missile Squadron in Montana, vice \ncommander of the 351st Strategic Missile Wing in Missouri, and later \ncommanded two ICBM wings in Wyoming and North Dakota. In California, \nGeneral Lord commanded the 30th Space Wing responsible for satellite \nlaunch and ballistic missile test launch operations. Leading \nprofessional development and educational programs was a hallmark of \nGeneral Lord's career. He led Air Force's education and training \nprograms as commandant of Squadron Officer School, commander of Second \nAir Force in Mississippi, and commander of Air University in Alabama. \nPrior to assuming his current position, General Lord served as the \nassistant vice chief of staff for Headquarters, U.S. Air Force.\n  During General Lord's tenure as commander, Air Force Space Command, \nhe provided inspirational leadership to over 39,000 service men and \nwomen responsible for a global network of satellite command and \ncontrol, communications, missile warning, space launch, and ensured the \ncombat readiness of America's ICBM force. General Lord guided the \ncommand to a number of historic firsts: 44 successful consecutive \noperational space launches, establishment of National Security Space \nInstitute, the launch of the last Titan IV, and transition to the \nEvolved Expendable Launch Vehicle, deactivation of the Peacekeeper ICBM \nweapon system, and the establishment of the quarterly High Frontier, \nAir Force Space Command's first scholarly space and missile journal. \nGeneral Lord has been a stellar Air Force advocate for the creation of \nthe Space Power Caucus, orchestrated the ``50 Years of Air Force Space \nand Missiles'' celebration, and developed the Space Professional \nDevelopment Strategy. Most recently, he answered the President's call \nto service with the creation of the High Frontier Adventures, a program \ndesigned to inspire students to explore space, mathematics, science, \nengineering and technology.\n  General Lord's impeccable service is characterized by his Command \nSpace Badge, Space Professional Level III certification, operational \nspace experience in nuclear operations and spacelift, weapon systems \nexpertise in the Minuteman II, Minuteman III, and Peacekeeper ICBMs, \nand the Atlas E, Delta II, Titan II, and Titan IV Boosters. General \nLord is the recipient of numerous prestigious recognitions: Space \nChampion Award, General Bernard A. Schriever Award, General Jimmy \nDoolittle Fellow Award, General James V. Hartinger Award, and the \nGeneral Thomas D. White Space Trophy.\n  Today, I have mentioned but a few of GEN Lance W. Lord's many \nachievements. General Lord is a visionary, steadfast military leader, \nand honorable man. I know my colleagues join me in paying tribute to \nhim and his wife Beccy and their two sons, Jason and Joshua, for the \nyears they have dedicated to our country and to the betterment of the \nU.S. Armed Forces. As a distinguished space pioneer, General Lord \nwidely proclaimed the mandate, ``If you're not in space, you're not in \nthe race.'' General Lord, we wish you well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/30/senate-section/article/S2600-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/30/senate-section/article/S2600-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/30/senate-section/article/S2600-3", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  At 12:21 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 1259.

A bill to authorize funding for State-administered bridge \nloan programs, to increase the access of small businesses to export \nassistance center services in areas in which the President declared a \nmajor disaster as a result of Hurricane Katrina of 2005, Hurricane Rita \nof 2005, or Hurricane Wilma of 2005, to authorize additional disaster \nloans, to require reporting regarding the administration of the \ndisaster loan programs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor with my ranking \nmember and leader on this issue, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, \nto speak for a few moments about a bill the two of us are going to \nintroduce today, the Gulf Coast Open for Business Act of 2006, by \nSenators Landrieu, Kerry and others. Let me first commend my colleague \nand thank him for joining me here today. He will be giving more details \nabout the act, which he has worked with my staff and others to craft, \nso let me add some personal perspective.\n  I stand here again, on behalf of the people of Louisiana, and the \nwhole gulf coast, who have just been devastated by the two most \npowerful storms to ever hit the United States in recorded history, and \nas you yourself know, because you were down in the gulf and have been a \nfrequent champion for our cause. It is still hard, though, to describe \nto our colleagues the current situation there. Not only were these two \nhurricanes quite powerful, at some point category 4 and 5, which are \nkiller storms, but just as devastating was the flooding that ensued by \nthe collapse of the Federal levee system--a collapse because of \ninadequate engineering. Both the hurricanes and the flooding have \nliterally devastated a major metropolitan area which sits in the heart \nof America's only energy coast, the gulf coast, and has been \ndevastating to large and small businesses alike. We are here today to \ntalk about our small businesses and their struggle for survival. They \nare indeed the backbone of our economic recovery.\n  We have first focused on levees, appropriately, and gulf coast \nrestoration efforts, without which no recovery will be possible. We \nhave also tried to struggle keeping children in school, keeping \nfamilies sheltered, literally from the elements in temporary housing, \nwhen we think 7 months on after Katrina and Rita, recovery is going to \nstart with our small businesses.\n  As I mentioned, yesterday marked the seven month anniversary of \nHurricane Katrina. Katrina was the most destructive hurricane ever to \nhit the United States. The next month, in September, Hurricane Rita hit \nthe Louisiana and Texas coast. It was the second most powerful \nhurricane ever to hit the United States, wreaking havoc on the \nsouthwestern part of my state and the east Texas coast. This one-two \npunch devastated Louisiana lives, communities and jobs, stretching from \nCameron Parish in the west to Plaquemines Parish in the east.\n  We are now rebuilding our State and the wide variety of communities \nthat were devastated by Rita and Katrina, areas representing a diverse \nmix of population, income and cultures. We hope to restore the region's \nuniqueness and its greatness. To do that, we need to rebuild our local \neconomies for now and far into the future.\n  Before last year's storms, Louisiana had 86,000 small businesses, \nemploying over 850,000 people. Their annual payroll was $21.9 billion.\n  My State estimates that there were 71,000 businesses in the Katrina \nand Rita disaster zones. A total of 18,752 of these businesses \ncatastrophically destroyed. However, on a wider scale, according to the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, over 125,000 small and medium-sized \nbusinesses in the gulf region were disrupted by Katrina and Rita. As of \nthis month, local chambers of commerce report that as many as two-\nthirds of their members had not resumed business operations. We will \nnever succeed without these small businesses. They will be the key to \nthe revitalization. I am here with my colleague to say that the regular \napproach, the standard operation, the mousetrap that we created to \nhandle past disasters is simply not sufficient.\n  Some of the people who work for the Small Business Administration and \nFEMA are terrific. You could not find better human beings on the face \nof the Earth. But it is not the individual human beings who are lacking \nhere; it is the system that is insufficient and inadequate to the task.\n  Senator Kerry and I come to the floor today to speak about this bill \nthat will create new models, create enhanced help from the Federal \nGovernment so that the businesses in Louisiana can at least be met \nhalfway in their struggle to get their roofs back on, their inventories \nback in supply, and new markets opened up, since the markets around \nthem have collapsed. The communities they served and hold to are in \nsome cases destroyed, in others dispersed across the country. If we \ndon't help them now, building a strong gulf coast will be all the more \ndifficult without our small businesses.\n  After talking to the business leaders and small businesses in my \nState, there are three things that they need right now: technical \nassistance, contracting assistance, and assistance with SBA disaster \nloans. For example, many of our small businesses need help navigating \nthe SBA assistance programs or, with much of their customer base in \nother States, others are now looking overseas for new markets. Our bill \nincludes a provision to waive the $100,000 cap on portability grants to \nSBDCs and allows SBDCs to receive these grants for disaster relief. Our \nbill also contains funds for the SBA to create a gulf coast \ninternational finance specialist, based in the gulf, who would provide \nessential technical assistance for small businesses looking for export \nfinancing.\n  It is vital to the economic recovery in Louisiana that our small \nbusinesses are given the opportunity to take part in the reconstruction \nof their State. Our businesses want to help rebuild their communities, \nbut continue to have trouble getting Federal recovery contracts and \nkeep getting mixed signals from FEMA.\n  With these facts in mind, our bill sets a small business prime \ncontracting goal of 30 percent for Federal emergency contracts to \nrebuild the affected areas. This is to ensure that small businesses, \nparticularly those located in the disaster area and that employ \nindividuals in the affected areas, should receive a fair share of \nFederal contracting dollars. Our bill also makes the disaster areas \neligible for HUBZones status to promote business growth.\n  Our businesses are struggling to deal with the SBA bureaucracy. Too \noften, when they get action on their loan application, it is a letter \nof rejection rather than a check.\n  The SBA has repeatedly touted how it has staffed up and increased its \nloan\n\n[[Page S2605]]\n\nprocessing productivity in recent months. They even cite record loan \napprovals in the gulf. But recent numbers show it is still taking the \nSBA 104 days to process and close on a business application. That is \ntime many struggling businesses that are holding on by their \nfingernails in a challenging environment simply do not have.\n  Many times, when businesses are approved for an SBA loan, they find \nthe terms and conditions to be unduly burdensome. Some are put in the \nposition of having to make payments while they take care of expenses \nthey have incurred for the months they spent waiting for the loan.\n  Our bill provides substantive relief to small businesses in the \ndisaster areas by allowing them to defer repayment of disaster loans \nfor 1 year from the time they received the loan. This will give them \ntime to resume operations and build back a customer base as displaced \nresidents gradually return home. Our bill also increases the SBA's \ndisaster mitigation loan amounts so that borrowers can more effectively \ninvest in products such as sea walls or storm shutters, that mitigate \nagainst damage from future disasters.\n  It is important to not only address our current needs from past \nhurricanes but to also look ahead to the next hurricane season--which \nis only 63 days away. I am concerned that the SBA has not incorporated \n`lessons learned' from recent storms. I am concerned that they remain \nunprepared for what may be another active hurricane season--if not in \nmy State then perhaps in other coastal States in 2007.\n  One provision included in our bill is a requirement that the SBA \nsubmit to Congress a detailed proactive disaster response plan by June \n1, 2006, the start of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season. I want to \nmake sure the SBA is ready to respond should that become necessary.\n  As we reflect on the 7-month anniversary of the worst natural \ndisaster to hit our Nation, now is the time for action--not words or \nempty promises. Today, right here in the Senate, is a time for fresh \nideas and fiscally responsible plans to help our small businesses \nrebuild.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  With that, I turn the floor over to Senator Kerry who will go into \nadditional detail about the Gulf Coast Open for Business Act. I thank \nhim for his leadership, not only for this week but since the week of \nthe storm. Our chairwoman, Senator Snowe along with Senator Kerry, have \nfocused a great deal of their own efforts from outside of our region to \nhelp our small businesses. I commend them for their continued efforts \nand, along with my fellow Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Vitter, look \nforward to working with them in the coming months to give our small \nbusinesses the help they need so that they may rebuild and prosper once \nagain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Senator from \nLouisiana. She has been terrific to work with on this issue, but, more \nimportant, she is absolutely tenacious with respect to the recovery \nissues in her State. I think she has offered tremendous leadership in \nthe Senate on a constant basis. On almost every bill that comes \nthrough, she has fought to find a way to assist with the recovery. It \nhas been a pleasure to work with her. I know she has to go to another \nmeeting. I am pleased to join with her in introducing this legislation \ntoday.\n  Senator Landrieu has tried to spread the word that New Orleans has \nplenty to offer, that people should not be scared away by negative \npress reports but instead be looking for opportunities to help rebuild \none of our greatest cities.\n  According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, more than 125,000 small \nand medium sized businesses were disrupted or destroyed by the \nhurricanes. It's been seven months since the Gulf was hit by the \nhurricanes, and it is time to take a look at the long-term needs of \nbusinesses in the region if we are going to truly foster an economic \nrecovery.\n  It is well known, the SBA's disaster loan program has done an abysmal \njob of getting out capital to businesses and homeowners over the past \nseven months, still with almost 80,000 applications to be processed out \nof 400,000 applications submitted. To help clear out the backlog, this \nbill enlists the agency's private-sector lending partners to help \nprocess loans. They are experienced SBA lenders, and in exchange for \ntheir expertise, SBA would pay them a fee to process loans. This is \nmuch faster than building a separate infrastructure of lenders, losing \ntime to train them, when the experience and infrastructure already \nexists. Along with the American Bankers Associations, we urged the SBA \nback in November to enlist the agency's private-sector lending partners \nto help process loans. SBA refused, saying they had a better idea. That \nidea failed. With this bill, SBA can increase processing, get small \nbusinesses their loans faster, and local lenders can participate in the \nrecovery of their communities.\n  We also identified a need for export assistance. There is an \ninteresting phenomenon occurring right now as a result of Katrina. \nCompanies from around the globe, having witnessed the tragedy of New \nOrleans, are trying to reach out to businesses along the Gulf Coast. \nFor companies that had already established relationships overseas, this \nhas meant big bucks. Many smaller businesses, however, don't have those \nrelationships and are struggling to take advantage of these new \ninternational opportunities. The U.S. Export Assistance Centers, or \nUSEACs, are ready and willing to help, and they are a tremendous \nresource for businesses looking to branch into foreign markets. But the \nproblem is that the Small Business administration doesn't have an \nemployee in the New Orleans USEAC to help direct businesses to the \nfinancing programs that they need. Senator Landrieu and I recognize \nthat this is because the SBA's international trade resources are \nstretched too thinly, so we are authorizing extra funds for the SBA to \nuse in hiring an employee for the New Orleans USEAC.\n  Shortly after Hurricane Katrina hit, Small Business Development \nCenters across the country decided to devote all the funds in the \nportability grant program, which is designed to help communities \nrecover after suffering significant job losses, to helping the Gulf \nCoast SBDCs. Not only did the SBDC community sacrifice money to help \ntheir colleagues in the Gulf, they tried to volunteer employees and \nother resources. Unfortunately, the good intentions of the SBDC network \nwere stopped by legal technicalities. Limitations on the amount of \nmoney a State could get for a portability grant and restrictions on \nSBDC employees working outside of their State hampered recovery \nefforts. Senator Landrieu and I were disturbed to hear of these \nproblems, and with our legislation today we will correct these problems \nso that bureaucracy isn't preventing the Gulf Coast recovery.\n  This bill also focuses on contracting opportunities for small \nbusinesses. The full participation of this Nation's small businesses, \nparticularly those in and around the affected region, in the rebuilding \neffort is essential to the long-term success of the region's economy. \nNew Orleans, in particular, was a city built on a foundation of small \nbusiness and they will be the driving force behind its rebuilding.\n  Unfortunately, not enough is being done to ensure this participation. \nJust last week, I sent a letter to FEMA about their failure to award \napproximately $1.5 billion in relief, recovery, and rebuilding \ncontracts to small businesses. They told Senator Landrieu and me, and \nthe other members of the Small Business Committee in November that they \nwould award those contracts by February 1. We were disappointed that it \nwould be another four months to get those funds to small businesses \nthat desperately needed the work, but we were even more appalled when \nthe deadline came and went, with no action from FEMA.\n  Thus, this legislation has a number of provisions to help small \nbusinesses in the disaster areas compete for Federal contracts in the \nshort term and in any future disaster recovery effort.\n  This bill would make the declared disaster areas an Historically \nUnderutilized Business Zone (HUBZone). This would give a preference to \nsmall businesses in the disaster zone when they bid on Federal \ncontracts.\n  To help jumpstart the local economies affected by Hurricanes Katrina \nand Rita and Wilma, the bill requires the Federal Government to award \n30 percent of prime contracts and 40 percent of subcontract dollars \nspent on\n\n[[Page S2606]]\n\ndisaster relief, recovery or reconstruction in the four affected States \nto be awarded to small businesses. Small businesses performing work in \nthe area are more likely to turn over Federal dollars in the local \neconomy, reinvigorating the local economy. The provision also includes \na requirement of a weekly small business utilization report from the \nGulf Coast region.\n  The bill includes a change to the Stafford Act, requiring that 10 \npercent of immediate disaster recovery contracts, such as debris \nremoval, distribution of supplies, and reconstruction are awarded to \nfirms located in or near an area designated as a federal disaster area \nby the President. This will put more local people back to work and help \na region's economic recovery after a disaster.\n  This legislation will increase access for small businesses seeking \ncontracting opportunities but limited by their ability to get bonded. \nExpanding access to bonding will increase small business participation, \nbut will also protect the Federal Government from significant cost \noverruns and lack of performance in a contract.\n  Mr. President, 43 percent of businesses that close following a \ndisaster never reopen, and an additional 29 percent of businesses close \ndown permanently within two years of a natural disaster. It's been \nseven months, but we still have a chance to make a difference and \nmitigate bankruptcies and foster the startup and growth of new small \nbusinesses to rebuild the Gulf region. I hope that my colleagues and \nthe administration will give this bill consideration and not repeat the \npast months of obstruction that have hurt local small businesses and \nhomeowners. It is inexcusable that the bipartisan bill we put forward \nwith Senators Snowe and Vitter in September has been stalled.\n  I thank my colleague Senator Landrieu for her leadership and look \nforward to traveling with her soon to Louisiana to visit with \nbusinesses and families that still need our help.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. ENSIGN (for himself, Mr. Vitter, and Mr. Isakson):\n  S. 2483. A bill to establish a Law Enforcement Assistance Force in \nthe Department of Homeland Security to facilitate the contributions of \nretired law enforcement officers during major disasters; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, the hours immediately following a disaster \nare critical to rescue and recovery efforts. Local law enforcement is \noften overburdened and staff is spread thin. As we saw in New Orleans, \na lack of police presence can result in chaos and disorder which can \naffect the ability of first responders to conduct rescue operations.\n  In the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, volunteer first \nresponders from throughout the country went to New Orleans and Biloxi \nto assist local law enforcement. Unfortunately, many of these \nvolunteers encountered red tape that left them frustrated and idle \nrather than using their expertise to aid efforts.\n  Because there is a desire from retired police officers to offer their \nexperience and expertise in times of crisis, today, along with my \ncolleague Senator Vitter, I will be introducing the Law Enforcement \nAssistance Force Act to assist local law enforcement.\n  The Law Enforcement Assistance Force Act would allow a retired law \nenforcement officer, whose certifications are current, to apply to the \nSecretary of Homeland Security to serve in the force. These retired \npolice officers would be detailed to Federal, State, or local \ngovernment law enforcement agencies to assist in the event of a major \ndisaster. They would work under the direct supervision of existing law \nenforcement agencies and would be deputized and certified to perform \nthe duties of a law enforcement agent. The force would serve as \ntemporary first responders to supplement local efforts in search and \nrescue efforts as well as in protecting public safety. These retired \nofficers have the skills to save lives and we should empower them to do \nso.\n  At a time of emergency when we should be tapping into all available \nresources, we cannot ignore the expertise of retired law enforcement \nofficers who still have the ability and willingness to help those in \nneed. We should take advantage of the fact that retired officers \npossess a wealth of talent and experience in dealing with emergency \nsituations. Their assistance can save lives and contribute greatly to \nour communities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Obama, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Menendez, \n        Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Biden):\n  S. 2486. A bill to ensure that adequate actions are taken to detect, \nprevent, and minimize the consequences of chemical releases that result \nfrom terrorist attacks and other criminal activity that may cause \nsubstantial harm to public health and safety and the environment; to \nthe Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Chemical \nSecurity and Safety Act, a bill to protect our communities and citizens \nfrom terrorism. This measure is cosponsored by Senators Obama, Kerry, \nMenendez, Durbin, and Biden.\n  All of our States have a significant number of industrial facilities \nthat manufacture or use chemicals. And we are all concerned about the \npotential of terrorist attacks on these facilities, which could \nthreaten millions of lives.\n  I have advocated stronger security measures for chemical facilities \nfor years. We needed better security at our chemical facilities even \nbefore 9/11--and that need is even more urgent today. Richard \nFalkenrath, a former top presidential advisor on homeland security, has \nsaid, ``I am aware of no other category of potential terrorist targets \nthat presents as great a danger'' as chemical facilities.\n  There are about 15,000 chemical manufacturers and storage facilities \nnationwide, including about 110 in heavily populated areas. The \ngreatest area of vulnerability is in South Kearney, NJ, where 12 \nmillion people live in proximity to the Kuehne Chemical plant. A \nchemical catastrophe at this facility could endanger the life and \nhealth of people caught in the path of the prevailing winds.\n  The State of New Jersey has taken strong action to protect its \ncitizens from this threat. Last year, New Jersey required that chemical \nfacilities adopt a practice known as inherently safer technology. That \nmeans exactly what it says--if products can be manufactured using safer \nchemicals, then factories must do so.\n  But last week, the Bush administration sent a signal that it wants to \noverride the right of States to require inherently safer technology. \nBasically, the administration wants to trust chemical facilities to \nprotect the American people.\n  This approach is wrong, and it is a timid response to a dangerous \nthreat. Trusting large corporations to do the right thing didn't work \nwith Enron--and it won't protect the American people from a chemical \ncatastrophe.\n  The Chemical Security and Safety Act offers real protection from a \nchemical catastrophe. It will require every chemical facility in the \nNation to adopt inherently safer technology. It will protect the rights \nof States to enact tough chemical security standards to protect their \ncitizens. It will improve physical security at chemical plants, with a \nrequirement for stronger perimeter barriers. And it will establish \nwhistleblower protections for employees who expose security risks at \nchemical facilities, and guarantee that workers have a role in securing \nthe safety of facilities.\n  This is a strong, comprehensive approach. Some might say it goes too \nfar. But as someone whose State lost 700 people on 9/11, I don't think \nwe can ever go too far in protecting the American people from a \nterrorist attack on a chemical facility.\n  We have waited long enough. We need to take action now to protect the \nAmerican people from a chemical catastrophe. I hope all of my \ncolleagues will support the Chemical Security and Safety Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Chemical Security and \nSafety Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2486\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Chemical Security and Safety \n     Act of 2006''.\n\n[[Page S2607]]\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Lautenberg, who has \nbeen a leader on chemical plant security for more than 20 years. He \nfirst introduced chemical safety legislation in 1985 and is an expert \non the issue. I am proud to join him in introducing this bill.\n  The dangers that chemical plants present to our homeland security \nhave been well documented. Industrial chemicals, such as chlorine, \nammonia, phosgene, methyl bromide, hydrochloric and various other acids \nare routinely stored near cities in multi-ton\n\n[[Page S2612]]\n\nquantities. These chemicals are extremely hazardous and identical to \nthose used as weapons during the First World War.\n  Today, there are 111 facilities in the country where a catastrophic \nchemical release could threaten more than 1 million people. These \nplants represent some of the most attractive targets for terrorists \nlooking to cause widespread death and destruction.\n  Despite this, security at our chemical plants is voluntary--left to \nthe individual plant owners. While many chemical plant owners have \ntaken steps to beef up security, too many have not. In Illinois, there \nhave been recent reports by ABC-7 in Chicago of chemical plants with \ndilapidated fences, insufficient guard forces, and unprotected tanks of \nhazardous chemicals. These plants are basically stationary weapons of \nmass destruction. Their security is light, their facilities are easily \nentered, and their contents are deadly.\n  Nearly five years after September 11, the Federal Government has done \nvirtually nothing to secure chemical plants. It is one of the great \nfailures of this administration that needs to be addressed this year.\n  The Lautenberg-Obama bill is a huge step forward. It protects our \ncommunities in a responsible, but balanced way. There are features of \nthis bill that should be a part of any chemical security legislation \npassed by this Congress.\n  Our legislation is risk-based. While all chemical facilities would \nhave to take a number of concrete steps to improve security, only the \nhighest-risk facilities would be subject to bill's strictest scrutiny \nand regulation by the Department of Homeland Security. These high-\npriority facilities would have to perform vulnerability assessments, \ndevelop prevention and response plans, submit to unscheduled \ninspections, and perform practice drills.\n  Our legislation is strict, but fair. Our bill replaces volunteer \nsecurity standards with clearly defined Federal duties and regulations. \nWhile plant owners would not be able to substitute their own security \nstandards, they would be able to come up with security plans that are \ntailored to each facility. And while the bill includes tough penalties \nfor noncompliant facilities including strict fines and the threat of \nshutting down plants, it also minimizes duplicative requirements under \nother Federal laws.\n  The Lautenberg-Obama bill also protects state and local rights to \nestablish security standards that match their local needs. States like \nNew Jersey have been leaders in chemical security, and we do not want \nto cut these efforts off at the knees. The legislation also gives \nemployees a seat at the table, by creating employee security \ncommittees, ensuring that employees are part of the security planning \nprocess, establishing security training requirements, and establishing \ntough whistleblower protections.\n  Our bill also includes all the methods to reduce risk. Our \nlegislation requires security forces, perimeter defenses, hazard \nmitigation and emergency response. These are the ``guns, gates and \nguards'' that prevent terrorists from attacking plants and minimize the \nimpact of an attack. But there are other ways to reduce risk that need \nto be part of the equation. Specifically, by employing safer \ntechnologies, we can reduce the attractiveness of chemical plants as a \ntarget.\n  This concept, known as Inherently Safer Technology, involves methods \nsuch as changing the flow of chemical processes to avoid dangerous \nchemical byproducts, reducing the pressures or temperatures of chemical \nreactions to minimize the risk of explosions, reducing inventories of \ndangerous chemicals and replacing dangerous chemicals with benign ones. \nEach one of these methods reduces the danger that chemical plants pose \nto our communities and makes them less appealing targets for \nterrorists.\n  The concept of IST was created thirty years ago by chemical industry \ninsiders, and it has been embraced at different times by the Department \nof Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, the Environmental \nProtection Agency, foreign governments and states like New Jersey. Even \nthe chemical industry itself has embraced IST, and many facilities \nacross the country have already employed safer technologies.\n  Unfortunately, the chemical industry has been lobbying nonstop on \nthis bill. They do not want IST, they do not want protection of state \nlaws and they do not want strict regulations. So far, because the \nindustry wields so much influence in Washington, it's been getting its \nway. For example, the Department of Homeland Security initially \nembraced the concept of Inherently Safer Technology in a 2004 draft \nchemical security plan, only to reverse itself after heavy industry \nlobbying in 2006. Secretary Chertoff's announcement last week, in front \nof an audience of chemical industry executives, very closely tracked \nthe industry's talking points.\n  This is wrong. We cannot allow chemical industry lobbyists to dictate \nthe terms of this debate. We cannot allow our security to be hijacked \nby corporate interests.\n  Senator Lautenberg and I will fight for strong legislation to pass \nthe Senate. We believe that we can work with chemical plants so that \nnew safety regulations are implemented in a way that is flexible enough \nfor the industry yet stringent enough to protect the American people. I \nurge my colleagues to come together to pass meaningful security \nlegislation this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/30/senate-section/article/S2612-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 415--EXPRESSING THE CONTINUING SUPPORT OF THE SENATE \nTO THE JUNIOR RESERVE OFFICERS' TRAINING CORPS (JROTC), AND COMMENDING \n  THE EFFORTS OF THAT VITAL PROGRAM AS IT CARRIES OUT ITS MISSION OF \n  INSTILLING THE VALUES OF CITIZENSHIP AND SERVICE IN THE HEARTS AND \n                MINDS OF THE YOUTH OF THE UNITED STATES.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Armed Services:\n\n                              S.

Mr. BINGAMAN proposed an amendment to amendment SA 3192 \nsubmitted by Mr. Specter (for himself, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Hagel) to the \nbill S. 2454, to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to provide \nfor comprehensive reform and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n               TITLE __BORDER LAW ENFORCEMENT RELIEF ACT\n\n     SEC. __01. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Border Law Enforcement \n     Relief Act of 2006''\n\n     SEC. __02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) It is the obligation of the Federal Government of the \n     United States to adequately secure the Nation's borders and \n     prevent the flow of undocumented persons and illegal drugs \n     into the United States.\n       (2) Despite the fact that the United States Border Patrol \n     apprehends over 1,000,000 people each year trying to \n     illegally enter the United States, according to the \n     Congressional Research Service, the net growth in the number \n     of unauthorized aliens has increased by approximately 500,000 \n     each year. The Southwest border accounts for approximately 94 \n     percent of all migrant apprehensions each year. Currently, \n     there are an estimated 11,000,000 unauthorized aliens in the \n     United States.\n       (3) The border region is also a major corridor for the \n     shipment of drugs. According to the El Paso Intelligence \n     Center, 65 percent of the narcotics that are sold in the \n     markets of the United States enter the country through the \n     Southwest Border.\n       (4) Border communities continue to incur significant costs \n     due to the lack of adequate border security. A 2001 study by \n     the United States-Mexico Border Counties Coalition found that \n     law enforcement and criminal justice expenses associated with \n     illegal immigration exceed $89,000,000 annually for the \n     Southwest border counties.\n       (5) In August 2005, the States of New Mexico and Arizona \n     declared states of emergency in order to provide local law \n     enforcement immediate assistance in addressing criminal \n     activity along the Southwest border.\n       (6) While the Federal Government provides States and \n     localities assistance in covering costs related to the \n     detention of certain criminal aliens and the prosecution of \n     Federal drug cases, local law enforcement along the border \n     are provided no assistance in covering such expenses and must \n     use their limited resources to combat drug trafficking, human \n     smuggling, kidnappings, the destruction of private property, \n     and other border-related crimes.\n       (7) The United States shares 5,525 miles of border with \n     Canada and 1,989 miles with Mexico. Many of the local law \n     enforcement agencies located along the border are small, \n     rural departments charged with patrolling large areas of \n     land. Counties along the Southwest United States-Mexico \n     border are some of the poorest in the country and lack the \n     financial resources to cover the additional costs associated \n     with illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and other border-\n     related crimes.\n       (8) Federal assistance is required to help local law \n     enforcement operating along the border address the unique \n     challenges that arise as a result of their proximity to an \n     international border and the lack of overall border security \n     in the region\n\n     SEC. __03.

Mr. President, this week, the National Medical Association \nsponsored American Diabetes Alert Day, with the purpose of bringing the \npublic's attention to this distressingly prevalent disease.\n  Approximately 20.8 million people in the United States have diabetes; \n6.2 million, or about a third of that number, are unaware that they \nsuffer from the disease, although they have it.\n  Among African Americans, approximately 3.2 million people, age 20 or \nolder, have diabetes, with as many as one-third of that number \nremaining undiagnosed. Yet the ravages of that disease, which can be \nquite silent at first, continue.\n  These disparities also mean higher rates of heart disease, \namputations, loss of eyesight, and a host of other serious \ncomplications caused by diabetes.\n  African Americans are over two times as likely as non-Hispanic Whites \nto die from the disease. Today, nobody knows exactly why, and it needs \nto be explored and it needs to be eliminated.\n  I strongly believe that the troubling persistence of health \ndisparities, these gaps and differences that are based on race, and \neven where you live at times, based on socioeconomic status--diabetes \nbeing one example--is a national issue that almost by definition \naffects us all.\n  I congratulate the National Medical Association, a very active \norganization, a tremendous organization, for their outreach, which they \nhave explored through conferences and through e-mail and direct mail, \nfor raising this awareness. A third of the people don't know they have \ndiabetes.\n  All this is an issue of our common humanity, our oneness, and our \ncommitment to one another as deserving, equal, and comparable citizens. \nYet these disparities exist. Even if a person disagrees with my \nreasons, as others have pointed out, we all suffer the economic \nconsequences in higher insurance rates and a compromised health system.\n  As a doctor, I have had the opportunity to interact with hundreds, \nactually thousands, of patients with a\n\n[[Page S2675]]\n\nwhole variety of health problems. Oftentimes, these patients have heart \nproblems, cardiovascular problems, as a result of diabetic \ncomplications. Some of our patients with diabetes had to have heart \ntransplants, developing a diabetes cardiomyopathy. That was in \nmedicine, but today in the Senate, as the majority leader, working with \nmy colleagues, I have had the opportunity to address this issue through \nlegislative remedies.\n  Two years ago, in 2004, I joined a number of our colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to cosponsor legislation that I have written called \nClosing The Health Care Gap. It was bipartisan and it addressed the \nissue of disparities. Our work has been ongoing, and I look forward, in \nthe coming weeks, to addressing another bipartisan bill with the help \nof, again, many of the same colleagues, including Senators Kennedy, \nEnzi, and many others, that addresses these health care disparities, \nincluding diabetes.\n  Together we are working to craft the very best possible strategies to \neliminate health care disparities all across the country. With the \ngreat work of groups such as the National Medical Association, we are \nable to explore and educate at the grassroots level, building support \nfor not just this legislation but for the policies in this legislation \nthat can eliminate these gaps over time.\n  Speaking of grassroots, in Nashville, TN, my hometown, on April 8, \ncitizens will go out to the location at our Nashville Zoo for the 15th \nannual ``Walk on the Wild Side.'' It is also known as ``America's Walk \nfor Diabetes.'' This is a nationwide walk, and it is the American \nDiabetes Association's signature special event.\n  With strong support from the business community, including \nsponsorship and corporate teams, the walk raises nearly $20 million \nnationwide to find a cure for diabetes and to support the overall \nmission. I encourage those listening to sign up and throw their support \nbehind those worthy efforts.\n  Dr. James Galvin, III, a close friend of mine, president of Morehouse \nSchool of Medicine, someone who has been a colleague, somebody I admire \ntremendously in his work at Morehouse, has said:\n\n       Diabetes is a disease about which we can do a great deal, \n     but only when those affected are informed and empowered to \n     take the kind of control of this disease that is now \n     possible.\n\n  I agree. I wholeheartedly agree. I look forward to the day when all \nof our citizens around the country have access to quality care, no \nmatter what location they live in, who they are, or where they are \nfrom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/30/senate-section/article/S2675-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, MARCH 31, 2006\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, today we had some good debate, made good \nprogress, had good discussion on this border security bill. We had \nhoped to have more votes on amendments to this bill this evening. We \nwere unable to make that progress. But we will return tomorrow and try \nto set up votes on the three pending amendments.\n  Again, I am disappointed we could not schedule more action on this \nbill this week in terms of votes. We have Senators who are waiting to \noffer amendments, so I hope tomorrow we can reach agreement for a time-\ncertain for the next votes. It is clear to me at this point that we \nwill not be able to set any votes for tomorrow, and therefore I \nannounce now that there will be no votes tomorrow. We will have \nmultiple votes on Monday, and we will announce that schedule on Friday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/30/senate-section/article/S2675-3", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
