Those votes will occur tomorrow morning, and Senators \ncan expect votes early tomorrow morning on those.\n  I will be talking to the Democratic leader about the timing of the \nvote on the deficit reduction measure. We will need to confer with \nthose managers to see how much of the 8 hours will be necessary so we \ncan alert Members as to when they can anticipate the vote.\n  Senators should be around and ready to be here on time over the next \nday or two as we schedule these votes.

Mr. President, we have, for example, Governor-elect Corzine \nwho is doing work in New Jersey, and we need some notice as to when the \nvote will take place to get him back here. He is, of course, coming. It \nappears very likely that the Vice President may need to vote on this \nhimself. From the numbers we have, it is going to be extremely \nclose. It would be important we have some notice as to when the leader \nwould like to handle and have that vote. If all the hours are used and \neven if we charged the time for debate during our caucus lunches, it \nwould be 4 o'clock or 5 o'clock. If all time remaining is used on this, \nwhen would the vote take place if we go straight through?\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. About 6 p.m.\n  Mr. REID. I know the Vice President has been in Pakistan. At least I \nhave been told he is coming back. Does the leader know when?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I do not, but we will be able to decide \nshortly after talking among everyone when that vote will be. For sure \nwe will have these cloture votes tomorrow morning. We need to make sure \nall Members are back for the postcloture votes with regard to the \ndeficit reduction bill. If we use all time, it would be 6 o'clock, but \nover the course of the morning we can decide when the most appropriate \ntime for that vote would be.\n  Mr. REID. One of the things that could be done to make sure everyone \nis here, when we move to the Defense appropriations bill we could have \nthat cloture and point of order. I am thinking at this time, even \nthough the leader has filed cloture on the Defense authorization, I \ndon't think we would have to have cloture on that. We could have final \npassage. One of the things the leader should think about is maybe doing \nthem all at once. We could start fairly early in the morning and try to \nget them all done.\n  If that were the case, I assume we could speed through them fairly \nquickly tomorrow if things turned out the way we think.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, a couple of things. First, we do not want \nto delay any votes that will delay when we finally are able to depart. \nWithin the next 48 hours we will have a number of votes. We will work \non scheduling so we can let people know with certainty. I have told our \npeople to be around and ready to vote when we decide. I don't want \nMembers staying in New Jersey, New York, California, or Texas waiting \nfor us to give a final time. We need to have people accessible and \nready to get back.\n  Having said that, let's try to consolidate these votes at a time \nwhere people can come back, can be here, and we vote all at once or in \na series.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think I have outlined the major votes I \nknow of. There would be some housekeeping stuff to do. Who knows, we \nmight get lucky and be able to do some other things.\n  Mr. FRIST. And with regard to that, we have a number of nominations, \nwe have a number of judges, as well, we very much would like to be able \nto address. There are other issues with regard to the PATRIOT Act, \nLabor-HHS. We have a lot to do, all of which we need to address in the \nnext day, 2 days.\n  We will maximize, from a scheduling standpoint, when everyone can be \nback.\n  Mr. REID. The other thing I mention is, in a meeting I had this \nmorning, I think it is fairly clear it will not be necessary, even \nthough we do not like the conference report on HHS, I don't think there \nwill be a necessity for cloture on that. The leader should anticipate \nhaving a straight up-or-down vote on that at some time.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will speak on another issue and then we \ncan come back and talk further.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the leader yield for a question on the last subject \nof scheduling votes?\n  Mr. FRIST. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I don't see any reason why we can't finish all our voting \ntomorrow. We all know what the issues are. We all know what the votes \nare. I don't see any reason to delay. We ought to vote.\n  There are so many families here, so many spouses, so many children, \nfamilies want to get together. This is, after all, Christmas. I don't \nknow why in the world we don't schedule all of our votes by tomorrow so \nat the very least by tomorrow we can start to head home with our loved \nones. Can't the leader work that out?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, indeed, he is going to do his very best.\n  Votes tomorrow, where the other side of the aisle causes us to have \nrollcall votes on motions to proceed and then cause us to file cloture, \nmake it difficult. I was ready to get out 2 days ago. If we could do \nthe up-or-down votes instead of filing the cloture motions, I am all \nfor it.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. All the cloture votes can occur tomorrow.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, my goal would be to be out, for sure, \ntomorrow. I think we can work on that. I appreciate the appeal from \nthat side of aisle to be out tomorrow. We can't have obstruction. \nGetting the votes done and finishing everything tomorrow would be a \ngood goal. I am all for it. It means we cannot have delay and \nobstruction.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. Let me make a statement now. I ask unanimous consent\n\n[[Page S14073]]\n\nmy statement be made on our time on the reconciliation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/20/senate-section/article/S14073-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              SMART GRANTS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, Thomas Friedman, in his book ``The World Is \nFlat,'' concludes that jobs in this country--and he says this with a \nbackdrop of global competitiveness--ultimately depend on education of \nour young people. More specifically, jobs of the future are going to \ndepend on a prepared workforce of youth well educated in math, science, \nengineering, the sorts of fields that prepare people for the jobs of \nthe future. He very nicely said in his book--and I wholeheartedly \nagree--that those jobs are going to require that preparation.\n  If we prepare our youth in math, science, engineering, we will \nprepare them for jobs for the future which will improve our global \ncompetitiveness. That means this competition will be addressed between \nChina and India for jobs, for people who are trained or study in \nVirginia, in truth, will be competing with students in China and India.\n  In the legislation we are considering over the next 2 days, Congress \nis very specifically addressing this link between global \ncompetitiveness, jobs of the future, and education in this country--\nspecifically math, science, and engineering education.\n  I will spend a couple of minutes on a new student aid program I \ncreated called the SMART grant. SMART grants very simply will provide \n$4,000 per year to eligible low-income students who are majoring in \nmath, in science, in engineering, in technology, in foreign languages, \nthat are critical to our national security, during the third and fourth \nyears of their higher education, those years of college. That is $4,000 \na year to eligible low-income students.\n  That means a low-income college student will obtain up to $8,000 to \npay for the cost of college if he or she chooses to major in one of \nthose fields, those fields that are so necessary to preparing for jobs \nfor the future and thus our global competitiveness. SMART grants mean \nlow-income students save an average of 52 percent on the cost of \ncollege in this legislation we will pass over the next 48 hours.\n  These funds will encourage more students to major in these time-\nintensive studies. These funds will help America produce the workforce \nit needs to be able to compete in that global economy.\n  The bill also provides academic competitiveness grants to first and \nsecond-year college students; $750 will go to first-year students who \ncomplete a rigorous high school curriculum, and $1,300 to second-year \nstudents who complete a rigorous high school curriculum and maintain a \n3.0 grade average in college. These are eligible low-income students. \nPresident Bush and Representative Boehner in the House deserve praise \nand credit for creating these grants.\n  These SMART grants and these academic competitiveness grants are \nauthorized at $3.7 billion over 5 years. They are paid for with program \nsavings included in the budget deficit reduction bill we are currently \ndebating in Congress.\n  Right now, America must be more competitive. We are targeting \nprecious resources in a responsible way to meet that challenge. Indeed, \nthese grants will sustain America's global legacy as a land of \ninnovation, imagination, and initiative.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/20/senate-section/article/S14073-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am not sure of the exact order of \nprocedure on the floor, whether the ranking member is yielding time on \nthis bill at this point.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to be yielded 5 minutes to speak.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask the leader, the ranking member, that \nI be recognized after that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Illinois. And then how much time would the Senator from \nMontana like?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. About 25 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent that after the Senator from \nIllinois, we go to the Senator from Montana for 25 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, those who followed the conversation on the \nfloor of the Senate this morning are aware of the fact we are still in \nsession, as the House has left at least for the time being. Of course, \nwe are close to the holiday season, when most Members assumed they \nwould be home with their families, where we want to be. But instead we \nare here. I think it is worth noting why we are here.\n  At the risk of hurting some muscle in my body here, I want to lift \nwhat we are now considering in the Senate in the closing hours: 4,000 \npages--4,000 pages--that come to us at the close of the session; 989 \npages on the appropriations for the Department of Defense, about 1,628 \npages on the Defense authorization bill, and roughly 1,400 pages on the \nDeficit Reduction Act.\n  I can tell you, having been around Congress for a few years, that \nwithin these pages are things which will come to embarrass us. Some of \nthem we know. Some of them we will learn after we leave. Of course, \npeople who are following this debate say: Well, Senator, haven't you \nsat down to read all this? The honest answer is, it is physically \nimpossible because good craftsmen of legislation realize that changing \npunctuation in the law can change the meaning of the law, and so what \nappears to be just a cosmetic change on a page here turns out to have \ndramatic consequences. So we try our best. My staff has been working \nstraight through since many of these bills have been produced to try to \ncome up with an understanding of what is included in these bills.\n  But there are several things we do know about these bills. We know, \nfor one thing, that the Defense bills are the last bills in the \nsession, which is a dramatic change from the past. Historically, the \nDefense bills are passed early in the session, for obvious reasons. The \nargument is, for goodness' sake, before you get embroiled in a \npolitical controversy, take care of the troops. So historically we \nwould pass a Defense authorization bill and a Defense appropriations \nbill early in the session and be done with them. That did not happen \nthis time.\n  The Defense authorization bill was taken off the calendar by the \nRepublican leadership in July so they could make room for special \ninterest legislation from the gun lobby on the question of liability. \nSo that bill was intentionally delayed by the Republican leadership, \nthe bill for our troops. Now, here, in the closing hours of the \nsession, the bill comes back in the form of an authorization bill of \nsome 1,600 pages, at the close of the session.\n  The Defense appropriations bill has historically been a bill we \nconsidered first. It is the bill in which we want to make sure we take \ncare of the troops, take care of the Department of Defense, and meet \nour obligation. Why is it last? Why is this 1,000-page bill coming at \nus at the last moment? I will tell you why. Because Senators have come \nto understand this bill has to pass. So they put some of the most \ncontroversial provisions, some of the most outrageous provisions in the \nbill for our troops and for our national defense.\n  There is a provision in here which is well known now and well \nreported, put in by the Senators from Alaska, for drilling in the \nArctic National Wildlife\n\n[[Page S14074]]\n\nRefuge. That is put in the Department of Defense appropriations bill. \nWhy? Why in the world would you put that provision, that controversial \nprovision, in a bill which has to pass for our troops? Well, it is high \nnoon. It is a showdown. It is a question about who will flinch first. \nIf you load up the bill that has to pass with these outrageous and \ncontroversial provisions, the Senators who put them in there are \ndefying the membership of the Senate to stand up and say no. And they \nwant to be prepared to say: Oh, you are going to vote against the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill or hold it up. That is just \nan outrage.\n  I will tell you what is an outrage. An outrage is using this bill, \nwhich is designed for our troops and our soldiers, as a political \nvehicle.\n  There are things in here which are nothing short of amazing--not only \nthis Arctic National Wildlife Refuge drilling, which has been debated \nfor years around here, but an allocation of the resources from that \ndrilling to the State of Alaska, and others, in ways that are very \ngenerous to that State, at the expense of other States and at the \nexpense of the Treasury. There is a provision in this bill about the \nliability of pharmaceutical companies when they manufacture vaccines. \nThat is in the Department of Defense appropriations bill.\n  Of course, there are provisions in here for Katrina victims. I am \nglad they are in here. I thought they would be part of some emergency \nappropriation, but it just shows you that this bill, and all its \ncomplications, is an example of why we are still here this week. It is \na failure of leadership. It is a failure to really address the issues \nthat present themselves to the Senate in a forthright manner.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Under the consent agreement, the Senator from Montana is recognized \nfor 25 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I echo a lot of the same concerns just \nvoiced by the Senator from Illinois. We have all been here a few years, \nand we see some things that are questionable. But the actions taken by \nthe majority in this session of this Congress are beyond questionable. \nIn many cases, I think they are outrageous, and I am very glad the \nSenator from Illinois brought the Senate's attention to them.\n  Mr. President, I am here to speak on the pending legislation, and \nthat is the budget reconciliation bill that is before us. I oppose this \nbudget reconciliation bill, and I do so for a couple of very basic \nreasons.\n  First of all, this bill would cause many of America's poorest \ncitizens to go without needed medical treatment. Just think of that: \nsome of the poorest citizens in our country to go without needed \nmedical treatment. It would make it harder for many of America's \nneediest citizens to move off of welfare and on to work. It would make \nit harder, not easier, to get off of welfare and on to work. It would \nalso deprive many single parents help in getting child support from \ntheir deadbeat spouses. It makes it harder to get child support from \ndeadbeat spouses. That is what this bill does, and I will explain later \nwhy that is the case. And this bill would undercut American lumber \nworkers in their dispute with Canadian lumber.\n  There is a better way. The better way is something much more similar \nto what the Senate passed here, although I opposed it because I thought \nit was so draconian, and I opposed it because I felt it would lay the \nseeds for just what is happening here today, and that is a conference \nreport that is much, much worse than the Senate-passed bill.\n  I think the Senate should vote down this bill. We do not have to pass \nit this year. This is not an appropriations bill. This is not a tax \nbill. It does not have to be passed this year. It should be voted down \nso we can get to work next year and cut the budget in a more fair and \nmore moderate way, rather than this draconian way contained in this \nbill.\n  There is a right way and a wrong way, for example, to control health \ncare spending. We all know health care costs are high, but let's just \nreflect a little bit and try to figure out what is the right way to cut \nhealth care costs to address that situation and do that rather than the \nwrong way.\n  Well, I might say, we in this body included some of the right way in \nthe Senate-passed reconciliation bill. What is that? We included \nprovisions to put us on the road to paying for performance and quality \nin health care. That is the right way to control health care costs; \nthat is, to reimburse providers--doctors and hospitals--a little bit \nmore when they show their outcomes are a little better, they are doing \na better job. That means health care costs will come down because the \nquality will increase and we will not be providing, in many cases, \nhealth care that is irrespective of quality. We have to start \naddressing quality in health care. The Senate-passed bill started to \naddress that. The conference report hardly even touches that. I will \nexplain that a little bit later, too.\n  What does this bill do? Instead, this bill merely cuts holes in the \nsafety net. It cuts holes in the safety net. It does not shore it up \nand try to figure out ways to address the problems; it cuts holes and \nmakes things worse. How? Well, it raises Medicaid copayments for those \nleast able to pay. It raises costs for people on Medicaid. It also \nallows States to cut Medicaid benefits below existing minimum benefits. \nThat is the wrong way to control health care costs. The better way is \nto address paid performance and quality. The wrong way is to just \nwilly-nilly cutting expenditures for the poorest of our Americans; that \nis, for the Medicaid Program.\n  We have also seen how the wrong way works, not in theory but in \npractice. Increasing costs for poor people forces them not to seek \nhealth care when they need it. It has that effect. When the poor people \nin our country have to pay that much more for health care, what do they \ndo? They don't get the health care. What happens? They live a little \nbit more with the illness they have. What is the consequence of that? \nThey come back to the emergency room later when their condition gets \nworse. The system ends up spending more on health care rather than \nless. The burden of uncompensated care grows. You and I and all the \nrest of us who pay for health care end up paying still more for health \ncare because of the increased uncompensated care because the poorer \npeople will not be seeking the health care they need but put it off \nand, therefore, go to emergency rooms, and we end up paying more. That \nis the way the wrong way works. That is the way provided for in this \nbill.\n  Furthermore, this bill is not a moderate package. Far from it. The \nSenate-passed bill was more moderate. Instead, the bill before us hews \nlargely to the House-passed bill which is not moderate. It is extreme. \nIt is draconian. The bill before us, which hews mostly to the House \nside, would impose nearly $2 billion in increased cost sharing on \nMedicaid beneficiaries or about 80 percent of the cost-sharing \nincreases in the House bill. What else? The bill would also allow State \nMedicaid Programs to offer Medicaid beneficiaries an ``actuarially \nequivalent'' benefit package. What does that mean? I will tell you what \nit means. It means reduced benefits. It is a fancy euphemism for \nreduced benefits for Medicaid beneficiaries. States will also be able \nto impose new premiums for coverage and to drop individuals from \nMedicaid if they can't pay.\n  Last week I offered a motion to instruct participants of this \nconference not to harm Medicaid beneficiaries by passing a budget \nreconciliation bill that resembles the House-passed bill. The Senate \noverwhelmingly supported that motion. The vote was 75 to 16. I was \nheartened. I felt good about that action. The Senate was speaking \nclearly and strongly not to let the conferees impose draconian cuts. \nSenators who supported that motion should stick to their guns. They \nshould remain consistent in their support of Medicaid. They should vote \nagainst this reconciliation conference report in view of what the \nCongress has done juxtaposed to that 75-to-16 vote.\n  I am disappointed with many of the provisions included in this budget \nreconciliation bill. I am also disappointed with provisions that were \nnot included in this bill. The conference report does not include \nmeaningful pay-for-performance and quality provisions. We live in a \ncountry that spends twice as much as any other country on health care \nper capita. Yet our country ranks\n\n[[Page S14075]]\n\n37th in the world on quality. Think of that. We spend twice as much per \ncapita as any other country in the world and yet we rank 37th in the \nworld on quality. Our country leaves almost 16 percent of our \npopulation with no health care coverage at all.\n  We are not getting good value for our health care dollar. The value \nthat each health care dollar buys varies widely from patient to \npatient. Consider recent research from Dartmouth that looked at large \nhospitals in California.\n  That research found that per-person Medicare spending on health care \nin the last 2 years of life ranged from $20,000 to almost $90,000. The \nmore expensive patients were not sicker. That is the point. They did \nnot receive higher quality care. That is also the point. But they cost \nthe Medicare Program over four times more.\n  I was proud to work with the chairman of the Finance Committee, Mr. \nGrassley, to write legislation bringing quality improvement and \naccountability to Medicare. We worked hard on that. We got a bill \npassed out of committee. Under our Medicare Value Purchasing Act, \nMedicare providers would be held accountable for the care they provide. \nAnd the best providers would be rewarded accordingly.\n  Doesn't that make sense, that we reward quality? Shouldn't we do that \nin the health care system? We don't today in America. Most every other \nindustry is rewarded for quality, but our health care service by and \nlarge is not. The Senate included our pay-for-performance legislation \nin the budget reconciliation bill that passed this Chamber last month. \nI did not support the larger bill, but I was pleased that our Medicare \nquality legislation was included in the package. But our quality bill \nhas mostly been stripped in the conference report.\n  The conference report expands existing quality reporting requirements \nfor hospitals. It sets up minimal reporting requirements for some home \nhealth. The report includes a study on pay for performance in hospitals \nand some minimal payment changes to discourage a couple of hospital-\nacquired infections. These provisions are only for hospitals and are \nmostly at the discretion of the Secretary.\n  Moreover, these provisions are delayed until years after the \nindependent Medicare Payment Advisory Commission recommended that \nMedicare providers would be ready to be paid for quality. I am \ndisappointed to see Congress setting the bar so low because we have so \nlittle time in which to address the increasing costs of health care and \nall the problems that creates. I oppose this conference report because \nit doesn't begin to address what could and should be done. I remain \nfully committed to seeing Medicare pay-for-performance become law.\n\n  I also supported a motion to instruct conferees related to TANF, the \nNation's welfare program. Offered by Senator Carper, this motion \ninstructed conferees not to reauthorize TANF through the budget \nreconciliation process. That was the motion offered by the Senator from \nDelaware. That passed by a large vote.\n  What happened? First, let's remember that Congress enacted the TANF \nProgram back in 1996. It was enacted to help welfare recipients get \nwork skills and to help low-income families become economically self-\nsufficient. I supported it in 1996. Many Democrats did not, but I \nthought it was a good way to get people off of welfare and a fair way \nto get people back to work. What has happened? Welfare reform has \nmostly succeeded. That 1996 bill was a good bill. States have adopted \ncreative policies to support low-income families making the transition \nfrom welfare to work, and millions have moved to self-sufficiency. It \nis not great, but it is a lot better than what it was prior to 1996.\n  The TANF law expired in 2002. Senator Grassley, chairman of the \ncommittee, and I worked diligently on the TANF reauthorization bill \nthis year. It was a compromise that enjoyed near unanimous support in \nthe committee. We could not get that bill up in the full Senate. There \nwere a few willful Senators who opposed it, even though it had the near \nunanimous support of the Finance Committee. It was a moderate \nreauthorization of TANF.\n  Let's also remember policy changes to TANF--and they are quite \npervasive and significant--do not belong in the fast-track budget \nreconciliation process. It does not belong there. The Presiding Officer \nknows that, as does everybody in this body. That process was designed \nto reduce the deficit, not to reauthorize important safety net programs \nsuch as TANF or other major policy issues. That is particularly true \ngiven the nature of the TANF provisions in this bill. This conference \nreport contains strict new work requirements in TANF. Not only is it a \nreauthorization, it has provisions that make the program not work, make \nit worse. It is not moderate. It makes it worse. It is in this \nconference report.\n  This report undermines the State flexibility necessary to meet the \nstandards of their most vulnerable citizens. This conference report \nprovides only $1 billion in childcare funds, even though we need $12.4 \nbillion in childcare funding to keep up with inflation. How miserly is \nthat? Only $1 billion in childcare, when we really need 12 billion. \nLet's compromise, maybe 6, $7 billion; that is a compromise. That is \nmidway between what this bill provides and what inflation calls for. \nBut no, there is only $1 billion in this bill.\n  The report also foists a set of unfunded mandates on States, mandates \nthat would harm low-income families. Let's not forget these families \nare playing by the rules right now. They are trying to do what is \nright. They are trying to work their way off of welfare and trying to \nget into sustainable employment. But this conference report eliminates \nthe State flexibility that has made the TANF Program a resounding \nsuccess.\n  We should reauthorize TANF. We should improve the program to focus on \nreducing poverty as well as welfare caseloads. And we should ensure \nthat more people can leave welfare for sustainable work.\n  This conference report does just the opposite. More families will \nlose assistance. And our State partners will lose the flexibility that \nthey need to support families in their time of need.\n  Speaking of families, what about the child support enforcement \nprovisions in this bill? This conference report includes a $5 billion \ncut in Federal funding for child support enforcement efforts. That's \nright, a $5 billion cut.\n  States use these funds to track down absent parents, to establish \nlegally enforceable child support orders, and to collect and distribute \nchild support owed to families. These cuts will take billions of \ndollars out of the pockets of mothers and children who are owed child \nsupport. This cut is simply indefensible.\n  This bill also fails to adequately address the health needs of \nKatrina victims. It has been nearly 4 months since Katrina hit, \nresulting in over a thousand deaths, the displacement of over a million \npeople, and a reconstruction bill that may exceed a couple hundred \nbillion dollars. The Katrina disaster was unprecedented. It required an \nunprecedented response by Congress. That's why I worked with Chairman \nGrassley in the days following the hurricane to write S. 1716, the \nEmergency Health Care Relief Act.\n  That bill would have provided 5 months of temporary Medicaid coverage \nfor Katrina evacuees in poverty.\n  That bill would have shored up State Medicaid programs overwhelmed by \nKatrina evacuees. That bill would have reimbursed providers for \nuncompensated care provided to Katrina evacuees. And that bill would \nhave helped States with the unprecedented burden on Gulf State welfare \nprograms.\n  But the Senate did not pass that bill. The Senate could not even take \nit up.\n  We tried to take it up many times. We stood on the floor many times \nand asked unanimous consent to bring up the bill, but we were opposed \nby a band of two or three or four Senators, but we cannot understand \nwhy. I think, basically, they are doing it at the behest of the White \nHouse, the President. The President didn't want to help people down \nthere with their health care needs, and the congressional leadership \ndid his bidding.\n  I appreciate Chairman Grassley's efforts to help Katrina victims. He \nfought to pass S. 1716 legislation against the wishes of the White \nHouse and his congressional leadership. I want him to know that I \nappreciate his efforts.\n  When the Senate eventually passed this budget reconciliation measure, \nit included some Katrina relief. It was an\n\n[[Page S14076]]\n\ninsufficient amount. And I could not support it. It was so paltry, it \nwas an insult. As for this conference report before us today, it is \nstill insufficient. Moreover, its Katrina funding comes in the form of \na block grant.\n  So States affected by Katrina, as well as States treating Katrina \nevacuees, are given $2 billion for their Katrina health-care needs, \nwhether that is a sufficient amount or not. Both the House and Senate \nbills had provided for 100 percent federal financing over the short \nterm for all States with Katrina-related Medicaid costs.\n  Finally, I want to briefly mention an important trade issue. This \nbill repeals the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act, also known \nas the Byrd amendment. This repeal could not come at a worse time for \nthe American lumber industry. The industry has recently suffered a \nseries of setbacks in its long-running dispute with Canada on imports \nof Canadian softwood lumber.\n  The Byrd amendment is one of the few tools the industry still has to \nencourage Canada to settle the lumber dispute once and for all. \nRepealing the Byrd amendment now pulls the rug right out from under the \nindustry. I won't do that. And I urge my colleagues who are friends of \nthe lumber industry to join me in supporting the industry by voting \nagainst this bill.\n  We don't have to pass this bill this year, Mr. President. There is no \nneed. None. So let's not pass it and do what is right in a subsequent \nreconciliation bill.\n  Mr. President, there is a great deal to be disappointed about in this \nspending reconciliation legislation. It does not meet the health and \nwelfare needs of Katrina victims. It makes health care for the poorest \namong us more expensive and lets well-heeled people off the hook.\n  It puts forth an unreasonably austere welfare program in a vehicle \nwhere it doesn't belong. It fails to advance the Medicare quality \nagenda that many of us have worked so hard to make reality. And it \nundermines the U.S. lumber industry at the worst possible moment.\n  In short, Mr. President, the Senate should reject this bill. The \nSenate can do better. I urge my colleagues to do better by the American \npeople by voting ``no.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na lengthy list of all of the groups that oppose this bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The following organizations have urged a ``no'' vote on the \n     spending reconciliation bill:\n       AARP;

This is a lengthy list. I don't have time to read them \nall.\n  The groups that start with A, such as AARP, for example, are at the \nhead of the list. This is seven pages. Let me guess how many groups per \npage. It is about 30 groups per page at least, in groups of seven. So \n30 times 7 is a couple hundred groups that are opposed to this bill--\nfor good reason. This is not something they willy-nilly just came up \nwith; they have looked at this bill. They have concluded, as I have, \nthat we should not pass this bill. We don't have to pass it now. We can \ndo it next year. We should go home for Christmas.\n  This is some Christmas present. This bill cuts Medicaid to people, \npulls the rug out from under the lumber industry, and it hurts low-\nincome people trying to get to work and off of welfare. Some Christmas \npresent. We should go home for Christmas and not pass this legislation \nand then come back next year and do the right thing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I understand Senator Chambliss is on his \nway over. I will yield when he gets here. I want to respond briefly to \nwhat the Senator from Montana said. I have respect for the Senator. He \nis one of the Members who is always constructive in trying to move the \nprocess forward in a way that is usually very bipartisan. But I do \nbelieve on the issue of the Medicaid accounts, he is inconsistent with \nwhere we ended up.\n  The Medicaid issue is really at the essence of this effort to reduce \ndebt through this deficit reduction bill. Why is that? Well, because we \nknow as we look into the outyears, the biggest problem we have as a \nFederal Government from the standpoint of fiscal policy is that we have \nthese huge obligations. Yesterday I said it was $44 trillion. I am told \nby the staff that the Comptroller's office said it is $51 trillion of \nunfunded liability that the American people--especially our children \nand our children's children--are going to have to pay in order to \nsupport the retired population that is now called the baby boom \ngeneration. Of that $51 trillion--a trillion dollars is an impossible \nnumber to conceive, and $51 trillion is absolutely inconceivable. But \nof that number, the vast majority of it, up to $30 trillion, is health \ncare costs in two accounts, Medicare and Medicaid.\n  Why is that? It is because the retiring generation is so huge that \nthe demands it is going to put on the system are so dramatic that \nessentially it is going to bankrupt our children if we do not do \nsomething about addressing it. We know that by the year 2030, under the \npresent flow of spending, the Federal Government, which today takes \nabout 20 percent of the gross national product for everything we do--\nnational defense, education, laying out roads, environmental \nprotection, health care, and veterans care--because of this retiring \ngeneration, 20 percent of the gross national product will have to be \nspent on 3 accounts: Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. There is \nno way you can tax your way out of this unless you are willing to \ndramatically increase the taxes on our children and our children's \nchildren. You have to reform these programs.\n  This bill put our toe in the water, hopefully up to our ankles, on \none of those three major entitlement accounts, specifically Medicaid. \nThe proposals on this bill on Medicaid were proposals that essentially \ncame to us as a Congress from the Governors in a bipartisan commission. \nThe Governors got together and said, How can we improve the Medicaid \nProgram? How can we give more services to more children but do it more \neffectively, thus costing less money and having the rate of growth of \nMedicaid slow a little bit. They came forward with a number of \nproposals which we have essentially adopted in this bill.\n  The practical effect of that is we will expand coverage to children. \nIt is expected that about a million children who are not covered today \nunder Medicaid will be picked up under this bill as a result of giving \nthe Governors more flexibility.\n  As the Senator from Montana said, the concept that we are savaging \nthe Medicaid accounts during the Christmas season is not defensible on \nits face. We will spend $1.2 trillion over this next 5 years on \nMedicaid. We are talking about reducing Medicaid spending during that \nperiod by $5 billion.\n  To give you a chart that reflects what type of reduction that is, the \ngreen line is Medicaid spending. The red line is Medicaid spending \nafter this event, after this passes. There can be no difference because \nMedicaid spending goes up so dramatically during this period. When you \nreduce it by $5 billion, you literally are not dramatically reducing \nthe Medicaid benefits--literally. The numbers still go up. You cannot \neven calculate it in terms of a digit. For example, Medicaid spending \nis going to go up 40 percent during the next 5 years. After this bill, \nMedicaid spending is going to go up 40 percent in the next 5 years. So \nthis representation that we are doing some sort of terrible event to \nMedicaid is absurd on its face because the numbers don't defend it. \nWhat is in this bill that is important to Medicaid is the new policy \nwhich is going to give the Governors more flexibility, which is going \nto keep Medicaid from being abused and gamed by people, people who are \nworth a million dollars or hundreds of thousands of dollars, basically \ntaking their obligations to pay for their retirement and putting it on \nthe American taxpayer generally. That will end. Call it spend down. \nGovernors will be given flexibility to try to reorganize their Medicaid \nPrograms so they can deliver more services to more people.\n  I have to disagree strongly with the representation that somehow we \nhave cut Medicaid. We have not cut it. The facts are that Medicaid is \ngoing to grow 40 percent over the 5-year period. I wanted to get a \nlittle more of a reduction in the rate of growth. I wanted to see us do \n$15 billion, but we compromised, as a result of a lot of different \ninfluences around here, at $5 billion on a $1.1 trillion base. It does \nnot even show up as a statistical change over those 5 years.\n\n  But what is important in this bill is the policy, the policy which in \nlater years, and hopefully as we move through this period, will allow \nGovernors to deliver this program more effectively to more people at \nless of a rate of growth. We have to address this. We can continue to \nbury our heads in the sand, and we have done that now for 8 years. We \nhave not addressed the entitlement accounts for 8 years. This is the \nfirst time we tried to step on this area, which represents 60 percent \nof Federal spending, but if we continue to bury our heads in the sand \nand not pass this small step forward in the area of trying to put \nbetter policy in place for these health care programs, all we are doing \nis saying to our children we don't have the courage to step up and try \nto give you a chance to have a decent lifestyle. We are going to take \nadvantage of you. We are going to tax you so when you want to send your \nkids to college, you will not be able to afford it or when you want to \nbuy a house, you won't be able to afford it because your tax burden \nwill be so high to support this generation, it will be so huge.\n  It is not right for policymakers to take this position. We should \nstep onto this turf called entitlement spending. That is what this bill \ndoes and that is why I think we should pass it.\n\n[[Page S14078]]\n\n  I do not think Senator Chambliss has arrived, so I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, in many ways the chairman has made my \ncase, because the hard reality here is this bill does virtually nothing \nto address the deficit and debt crisis we face as a Nation. This bill \nhas $40 billion of cuts over 5 years. The first year the cut is $5 \nbillion in a budget of $2.5 trillion.\n  According to the math I learned growing up in Bismarck, ND, that is \nreducing the spending by 1/500 of the budget. Of course this is only \nchapter 1 of reconciliation. Chapter 2 is going to cut taxes, either, \naccording to the Senate version, $70 billion, or the House version, $95 \nbillion. In the House version in the first year they would cut the \nspending $5 billion and cut taxes $21 billion. Guess what. The deficit \nis not reduced. The deficit is increased. The deficit is increased, not \nreduced by this package of reconciliation.\n  But it is not just the first year or the 5 years; the thing nobody is \npaying any attention to is the growth of the debt. Last year the \ndeficit was $319 billion, but that is not how much the debt increased. \nThe debt increased by $551 billion. Under this budget plan over the \nnext 5 years, the debt of this country is going up $600 or $700 billion \na year, each and every year. We are going from a total debt in this \ncountry of $7.9 trillion at the end of last year to a projection, by \nthose who are the advocates of this plan, of $11.3 trillion 5 years \nfrom now.\n  Is anybody paying attention? This is a budget that is going to \nincrease the debt of the country, according to its own advocates, by \n$3.4 trillion. There will be $3.4 trillion of added debt. And they have \na title of ``deficit reduction''? No. That is not going to pass any \ntest. It is not deficit reduction we are talking about in this budget \nplan we are now in the final steps of considering.\n  Mr. President, I notice Senator Chambliss is on the floor. He is \nsupposed to be having this time. I will alert colleagues--is Senator \nChambliss prepared to proceed?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Yes, I am.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Why don't we go to Senator Chambliss. My understanding is \nthe Senator will take 15 minutes; is that correct?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Probably not that long, but certainly no more than \nthat.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Whatever time the Senator consumes, we will go to Senator \nKennedy for 15 minutes and then to Senator Schumer, so colleagues have \nan understanding of where we are headed. Then my understanding is we \ntry to slot in Senator Stabenow, and then Senator Allard, we have been \ntold, would like to speak at 11:30, and then Senator Stevens at noon.\n  We have not gotten a formal agreement on that, but that is the \ninformal agreement at this point. If Senator Gregg has a need to \nrespond to something in between, he would certainly have that right.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, that is a good outline. I note that if \nMembers want to speak, it would be nice if they would give us a call \nand tell us they want to speak, and we will make sure they have time to \nspeak. We want to make sure everybody has the time they need to get \ntheir points across.\n  Do I understand that the Senator is yielding time off the bill on his \nside to Senator Chambliss?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, on his side I think will be the most \nappropriate.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield whatever time Senator Chambliss \nuses.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I will say nice things about the \nSenator from North Dakota, so it can come from either side.\n  I rise in support of S. 1932, the Deficit Reduction Omnibus \nReconciliation Act of 2005. Yet I must express some serious concern \nabout the final results of the agriculture title which was negotiated \nby the House and Senate leadership. It was ultimately decided upon, \nfrankly, by the leadership of the other body, but we would not be where \nwe are today without the leadership of Senator Gregg as chairman of the \nBudget Committee.\n  This has been a long and very arduous process that we have gone \nthrough. It has taken us literally almost 12 months to get to where we \nare today. I think, at the end of the day, we are hopefully going to \npass a meaningful deficit reduction package that, while not perfect, \ndoes move us down the road to getting our fiscal house in order.\n  I say to Senator Conrad, who is a member of the Agriculture \nCommittee, that while he didn't agree with what we were doing relative \nto budget reductions in the agriculture title of the bill, during the \ncommittee markup, he was very cooperative and allowed the committee to \nexpeditiously report our title to the budget committee. That is a sign \nof leadership where, even when we disagree, we can still do what is \nbest and that is bring up issues such as this for debate. For that I \ncommend Senator Conrad and thank him for his cooperation in that \nregard.\n  The good news is that the reductions contained in the conference \nreport will reduce the Federal Government's overall deficit and \nborrowing. Unfortunately, the reductions in the agriculture title are \nnot balanced nor fair. I stated throughout the reconciliation process \nthat my ultimate goal was for all components of the farm bill--\ncommodities, conservation, and nutrition--to be fairly treated. This \npackage does not accomplish that goal.\n  I am pleased the final package maintained the Senate position of no \nreduction in the Food Stamp Program. At the end of the day, we decided \nthat was fair and equitable because the Food Stamp Program benefits not \njust those people who need food stamps, but it is also extremely \nbeneficial to farmers.\n  However, continued insistence of no extension of the commodity title \nof the farm bill by the leadership of the other body, the White House, \nand the U.S. Department of Agriculture has resulted in a package that \nnow contains obvious inequities.\n  The Senate strived to preserve the agriculture baseline for all farm \nbill programs with temporary cuts over multiple years. In doing so, \ncommodity programs, conservation, research, and rural development would \nhave contributed in an equitable manner to deficit reduction. These \noptions, along with the extension of the farm bill, would have \nprotected the baseline, treated all components of the farm bill \nequally, and provided security for farmers in future years. However, \nthe leadership of the other body insisted on concentrating deep \ntemporary cuts in the 2006 crop-year only, rather than slight \nmultiyear, across-the-board cuts to commodities which would allow us to \nhave several options to extend the commodity program baseline as with \nconservation.\n  I cannot agree to impose such a heavy financial burden that hits \nproducers still reeling from a season of crop loss and double costs for \nirrigation, fertilizer, and diesel. Until the bitter end, the \nleadership of the other body rejected several Senate alternatives, \nforcing the conference committee to drop multiple-year commodity \nprogram reductions.\n  The imbalance of this package is apparent on its face. While the \nbaseline is preserved for some conservation programs through extension \nin the law, the House Agriculture Committee opposed similar treatment \nfor the commodity title. This final package contains a short-term \nreprieve from cutting crop payments, which means commodities will not \nbe protected like conservation during reauthorization. This will be a \nbig problem for farmers as Congress begins to write the farm bill in \n2007. The constant critics of agricultural programs will blame farmers \nfor escaping their share of deficit reductions, as commodity support \nprograms are about to be considered for reauthorization.\n  In addition, budgetary pressures on the next farm bill will be \nenhanced just as negotiations should be concluded in the World Trade \nOrganization. We have already seen our trading partners and \nnongovernmental organizations target one commodity, cotton, which is \nwidely grown in my home State of Georgia, with many other commodities \nwithin their target sights. With little shared sacrifice in budget \nreconciliation, I am concerned that critics at home and abroad will \nnote that the United States has not moved forward on true reform and \nwill call for deeper and more binding commitments in order to enforce \nthe minimal amount of discipline.\n  We cannot say with the same vigor as we did when the Senate passed S. \n1932\n\n[[Page S14079]]\n\nthat the United States is already reducing the overall level of trade-\ndistorting domestic support. Those who have successfully challenged our \nfarm programs will be given added incentive to attack other \ncommodities, and this may, and likely will, have an even more serious \nand severe impact on family farms across the country.\n  The conference agreement includes reductions for fiscal years 2006 \nthrough 2010 for commodities, conservation, energy, research, and rural \ndevelopment programs. Specifically, it includes no extension of \ncommodity programs and no across-the-board cuts for commodity programs. \nIt reduces direct advance payments to 40 percent for the 2006 crop-year \nand to 22 percent for the 2007 crop-year. The Cotton Step 2 Program is \nterminated effective August 1, 2006.\n\n  The Milk Income Loss Contract Program is extended for 2 years at a \ncost of $998 million but is not subject to the 2.5-percent reduction \noffered and proposed by the Senate.\n  The Environmental Quality Incentives Program is extended in law to \n2010, but the funding is reduced $1.27 billion in fiscal years 2007 \nthrough 2009. It is increased to $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2010.\n  The Conservation Security Program is extended in law to 2011, but \nbaseline funding is kept at $1.954 billion for fiscal years 2006 \nthrough 2010 and at $5.65 billion for fiscal years 2006 through 2015.\n  Additionally, funding for the Small Watershed Rehabilitation Program \nis rescinded.\n  The Renewable Energy Systems and Energy Efficiency Improvements \nProgram is limited to $3 million in fiscal year 2007. Unspent obligated \nfunds from prior years from the Value-Added Agricultural Product Market \nDevelopment Grant Program and the Enhanced Access to Broadband \nTelecommunications Services in Rural Areas Program are rescinded.\n  Funding for the Rural Business Investment Program and the Rural \nStrategic Investment Program and the Rural Firefighters and Emergency \nPersonnel Grant Program are also rescinded.\n  Authorized funding for the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food \nSystems is eliminated for fiscal years 2007 through 2009.\n  Had the commodity title shared more equitably in the deficit \nreductions, these programs that are being rescinded, would not have \nexperienced such deep cuts.\n  My deepest disappointment is with the lost opportunity of this \nnegotiation. We had the opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to \nbalancing the equities among all interests involved in the farm bill \nand establishing the trust that will be needed to reauthorize the farm \nbill in 2007. However, this process, once again, confirms my steadfast \nadmiration for America's farmers and ranchers who are willing to share \nin reducing the deficit burden on their children and their \ngrandchildren.\n  I want to reiterate my intent in reauthorizing the next farm bill to \nprovide a balance to all of America's agricultural interests and end \nwith a product that protects all of agriculture in rural America.\n  I close with one quick comment on the WTO negotiations which \nconcluded in Hong Kong over the weekend but are not totally concluded \nat this point in time.\n  I commend Ambassador Rob Portman, our U.S. Trade Representative, and \nhis staff, particularly his Chief of Staff, Rob Lehman, who have worked \nso hard since Ambassador Portman was appointed to this position to try \nto ensure that while American agriculture participated in the \ndiscussions relative to trade-distorting issues at the WTO, he never, \never made a commitment that would sacrifice the interests of American \nagriculture.\n  It is unfortunate that once Ambassador Portman put a meaningful \nproposal on the table to end the discussions with the European Union, \nthe European Union made a conscience decision that they did not want to \nsee any change in their substantive program from an agricultural \nperspective. Therefore, the European Union basically brought down the \ntalks leading up to Hong Kong, and I do not think we could say in any \nway that anything meaningful came out of the discussions that were \nconcluded in Hong Kong over the weekend.\n  It is my hope that the European Union will go back to the table and \nengage in meaningful discussions that hopefully will lead to some \nagreements that will be of benefit both to farmers in the European \nUnion and obviously, from a parochial standpoint, farmers in the United \nStates. I firmly believe that the future of American agriculture lies \nin our ability to export what we know to be the finest agricultural \nproducts grown anywhere in the world.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time does the Senator from Massachusetts seek?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I expect maybe about 12 minutes. If I \ncould get 15 I will try and yield some back.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota. I \nhope both our colleagues, and Americans, will have a chance to listen \ncarefully to his assessment of the whole budget process that we have \nbeen faced with in the Senate. It has very important implications for \nthe American people. It will impact the financial condition of our \nNation and of Americans and its relationship to the world economy. Most \nof all, I hope our colleagues and friends have listened to him \ncarefully, talking about what the issue is before us in the Senate \ntoday before we vote.\n  As I have said previously, the budget is a question of priorities. \nThe Republican proposal is going to give $95 billion in tax giveaways, \nthe vast majority of which will benefit the wealthiest individuals, \nwith just crumbs for individuals who earn below the $100,000. And who \nis paying for it? The neediest people in our country.\n  The conference report leaves the tax cuts for the rich under the \nChristmas tree but leaves middle-class families out in the cold. This \nis what we are talking about: families who make over $1 million will \nget $32,000 and families with incomes under $100,000 will get $29.\n  Now we have to ask, where will we get those resources? How are we \ngoing to come up with that money? Those who have been the most \nvulnerable in our society are the ones who will be penalized, \nparticularly the elderly and needy who rely on the Medicaid Program and \nalso the young people who rely on the student financial aid program.\n  The portion of the Senate bill reported by the Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee passed on a very strong bipartisan basis, \nunanimous on the education features of it. The bill included $12 \nbillion in new student aid and benefits, $8 billion of this was put to \nneed-based aid, which would be available to young people, to \neffectively raise the Pell grant, which is so important for more than 5 \nmillion families in this country, from $4,050 to $4,500. The bill also \nprovided some additional assistance for those who were focusing on the \nstudy of math, science, and high-need foreign languages, basically a \nrecognition and a response to the need to keep America competitive with \nChina and India, and globally, in terms of engineering and other math \nand science graduates. So we decided to provide some stimulus and \nadditional help to encourage people to study math and science. But we \ndid it in addition to providing an increase for all needy students.\n  Most of the hearings that we have had in our committee, under the \nchairmanship of Senator Enzi, have focused on college access and \naffordability--and I pay tribute to him both for his leadership in \ngetting this proposal through the Senate, and also for battling for any \nhelp for students in the conference.\n  We passed, in the budget resolution last January, a very significant \nincrease for education that would have helped all needy students. The \nSenate Republicans and Democrats went on record to say in our Nation's \nbudget we want to allocate additional resources to education. We \nincreased it by $5.4 billion, and that was struck down by the \nRepublican leadership over in the House of Representatives and \ncompletely lost in the conference report to\n\n[[Page S14080]]\n\nthat bill. So this has been a long battle to try and provide some \nadditional help.\n  What has come back from the conference in this reconciliation bill is \nno different. It is completely unsatisfactory. The conference \ncompletely struck our $450 increase for Pell students, putting the \nmaximum Pell grant right back down to $4,050, where it has been for \nfour years. The conference included some increase for individuals who \nare going to study math and science. As I mentioned, math and science \nis important, but we cannot focus on it at the expense of all other \nstudents. Most thoughtful educators believe that one has to begin with \nmath and science in the very early grades. We are going to do something \nabout math and science, and we have a bipartisan group that want to \nimprove math and science education, but the approach in this \nlegislation is not the answer to the challenge faced by our Nation.\n  This year, over 5 million students rely on the Pell grant to afford \nthe cost of college. In the Senate bill, we gave additional aid to \nevery one of those students. The bill that returned from the partisan \nmeetings with the House takes that aid away from millions of students. \nIn order to qualify for the additional aid in this report, students \nhave to attend full time. Over 40 percent of the students who attend \npublic 4-year colleges in a degree-granting program attend part time, \nso they will see none of the assistance that is provided in this bill. \nThose are hard-working students who have to work 25, 30 hours a week or \nmore, one or two jobs, in order to put themselves through school. They \nwill see no help from this bill.\n  To get any of this additional assistance, the students must maintain \na B average. Is this the message we want to send to the students, that \ntheir aid disappears if they slip to a B-minus? How does this help the \nstudents? To get any additional grant aid in their junior or senior \nyear, they must major in math, science, or engineering.\n  I strongly support and encourage more students to study math and \nscience but not at the expense of other students. What does this say to \nthe young people who want to be teachers? You are out of luck. What \ndoes it say to the millions of people we need to be nurses? You are out \nof luck. You do not benefit one cent with this particular program.\n  The Senate bill took a balanced approach, and made sure that all the \nchildren who needed our help got an increase in aid. That is not what \ncame out of conference.\n  I think that is sending a message to young people: Don't bother \nspending your time being a teacher anymore, don't try to study to \nbecome a nurse because that extra aid and assistance will not be there.\n  Federal need-based aid was established to help all low-income \nstudents afford the higher education of their choice. That was the \nneed. That was the reason for it. We said as a country that we have \nyoung people of talent and ability who can gain entrance into the best \nschools and colleges, but they cannot quite put it all together because \ntheir families can't afford it along with rest of their basic needs. We \nsaid, OK. They are able to gain entry into the schools and colleges of \ntheir choice, and we will help them afford it. Through a combination of \nthe grants and aid programs, work-study programs, and their summer \nincome, they will be able to continue through their degree. Not only \ndid these individuals gain, but the Nation gained. The whole country \nreaped the benefit, because we said that every student matters and \nevery student deserves our help. That is not what this conference \nreport says.\n  During this holiday season, we should be focused on the true meaning \nof Christmas and the special thoughts that Americans of many faiths \nhave at this time of year for their families, their friends and \nneighbors, and peoples everywhere. We're reminded that each of us as an \nobligation to care for one another and to help those in need--to lend a \nhand to the least of those in our midst. As the Bible teaches us, we \nshould ``Love thy neighbor as thyself.''\n  But this budget reconciliation bill does the opposite. It robs from \nthe poor to make room for tax giveaways to the rich. Wealthy Americans, \nbanks and drug companies are big winners under this deal. Those who \nneed hope and help are the big losers. It's a bill Scrooge would love.\n  Sadly, as we complete this measure at Christmastime, it will indeed \nbe the neediest members of our society who have to tighten their belts. \nRepublicans have decided to leave tax giveaways for the wealthy under \nthe Christmas tree, while leaving middle-class families out in the \ncold. Those with incomes over $1 million will receive an average of \n$32,000 in tax cuts. But those with incomes under $100,000 will receive \nan average of only $29. Bah humbug.\n  Children and families struggling to pay for health care will be among \nthose who are hurt the most, and 46 million Americans lack health \ninsurance, but this bill will increase costs and cut health benefits \nfor millions of low-income families. It slashes Medicaid funding by \n$6.9 billion over the next five years, and $28.4 billion over 10 years.\n  Under this administration, the number of uninsured has already risen \nto historic levels. But this Republican bill will send the level even \nhigher, by raising costs and cutting benefits for low-income families \nwho rely on Medicaid for needed health care.\n  The conference report is actually Worse than the Republican House \nbill in many respects. It would take away the guaranteed benefits for \nthe 25 million children who receive health care through Medicaid by \ncreating an ambiguous new state option called ``flexible benefits.'' It \nhurts seniors by increasing the prescription drug co-payments beyond \nthose in the House bill, allowing states to charge up to 20 percent of \nthe cost of each drug, beyond the means of many low-income Medicaid \nfamilies. It indexes cost-sharing to medical inflation, a much higher \nrate of increase than family wages. It allows states to increase cost-\nsharing up to four times the amount allowed under current law.\n  The majority of the savings from these provisions don't come from the \nactual co-payments and premiums paid by Medicaid enrollees. They result \nfrom families using fewer medical services, because the increased costs \nwill put the health services they need beyond their reach.\n  Unlike the Senate bill, which made the majority of its cuts by \nreducing overpayments to drug companies and HMOs, the conference report \ncuts Medicaid by limiting the access of low-income families to needed \nhealth care. Instead of getting rid of the outrageous slush fund for \nMedicare HMOs, it cuts health care for poor children.\n  The Republican Congress is telling hard-working Americans everywhere \nthat they don't care about the hardships they face. Their policies \nencourage failure, not hope for a better life.\n  This bill means that mothers trying to hold down a job and put food \non their table will go without the child care assistance and child \nsupport they need and deserve.\n  Behind closed doors, Republicans also have added a welfare \nreauthorization in this bill despite their repeated efforts to block \ndebate on the reauthorization in the Senate. Democrats supported moving \nforward, but Republican reluctance to spend money on our most \nvulnerable citizens kept the leadership from bringing the bill to the \nfloor.\n  So House Republican leaders decided to avoid the standard legislative \nprocess by unfairly slipping their welfare bill into this massive \nbudget reconciliation bill.\n  The bill includes new work requirements without adequate child care \nfunding. By eliminating the current caseload reduction credit, the bill \nrequires over half the States to increase the number of welfare \nrecipients in federal work activities by two-thirds in 2007, unless \nthey have a substantial drop in their welfare caseload over the next \nyear. Despite this increase in required work, the bill fails to allow \nchild care funds to keep pace with inflation. The bill under-funds \nchild care by $11 billion in terms of what is needed to maintain \ncurrent purchasing power and to meet the increased work requirements. \n  In Massachusetts alone, 13,500 children are already on waiting lists \nto receive these essential services. Under this bill, the situation can \nonly get worse.\n  The bill will make life harder for poor children who rely on child \nsupport to survive. It greatly weakens enforcement efforts to make \ndead-beat dads\n\n[[Page S14081]]\n\nlive up to their responsibilities and provide for their children. Under \nthe Republican plan, nearly $2.9 billion will be lost in child support \npayments over the next five years and $8.4 billion in over the next ten \nyears.\n  In Massachusetts, $58 million in child support payments will be lost \nover the next five years, and $170 million over the next ten years.\n  These are the Nation's poorest children. They are vulnerable and in \nneed. But the Republican plan would abandon them. Merry Christmas. \n  Families having to choose between putting food on the table and \nkeeping warm this winter are also big losers under this bill.\n  In Massachusetts, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, \nLIHEAP, serves 134,000 needy families. These families it will receive a \nmaximum benefit of $765 for the current heating season. This is enough \nfor only one tank of oil. It takes at least two to four tanks to make \nit through the winter.\n  Unfortunately, under this bill, low income families struggling to \nmake it through the winter won't see any additional funds until fiscal \nyear 2007. The bill cruelly ignores the obvious fact that the heating \ncrisis is here now.\n  They claim that they have provided for LIHEAP in other bills. But \nwhen you add up the numbers, they've only provided $2.4 billion in \nregular funds and $1.6 billion in emergency funds. The emergency funds \nare given out at the discretion of the President, so it's possible that \nstates will see little to none of the $1.6 billion this year. \nObviously, the Republican majority had no intention of fully funding \nLIHEAP at its authorized level of $5.1 billion.\n  Republicans mouth the same old rhetoric about wanting to help our \nneediest citizens. But when it comes to putting their money where their \nmouth is they fall short--very short--and it's the nation's poor who \nsuffer.\n  Students struggling to get a college degree are the big losers as \nwell. We know that education is the key to keeping America strong, \nsecure, and competitive. Now, more than ever, we must embrace and \ninvest in education to advance America in the years ahead. \n  To do so requires a commitment to educational opportunity for all--\nespecially for talented youth who have so much potential, but need help \naffording a college degree.\n  The cost of tuition and fees at public colleges has skyrocketed in \nrecent years and Pell grants have fallen far behind. Under current law, \nthis will be the fourth year in a row that the maximum Pell grant has \nnot been increased.\n  For countless families, the gap is so great that college is out of \nreach. Over 400,000 talented, qualified students each year can't go to \na 4-year college because they can't afford it, 170,000 don't attend \ncollege at all. That's unacceptable.\n  But in the face of this crisis, the Republican budget deal abandons \nthe Senate provisions that increased the maximum Pell grant by $450.\n  It includes the biggest cuts in student loan programs ever, in order \nto pay for $13 billion in tax giveaways for the richest Americans.\n  The Senate bill included $8 billion to increase grant aid for all \nPell grant recipients. In contrast, the small amount of funding for \nstudent aid included in this Conference report--$13 billion for tax \ncuts and only $3.75 billion for students--will only be available for a \nvery small number of students eligible for Pell Grants.\n  This bill abandons the government's long-time commitment to ensuring \nthat the neediest students get the most help. It imposes so many \nhurdles to new aid that it is sure to leave behind those who need our \nhelp the most to stay in school.\n  Under this proposal, a single mother who can attend college only \npart-time because she has to work 40 hours a week to put food on the \ntable will not be eligible for a penny in new grant aid.\n  Under this proposal, a student who did not have the opportunity to \ntake rigorous courses in high school because this administration \nunderfunded the No Child Left Behind Act would not be eligible for a \npenny in new grant aid.\n  Under this proposal, a student who decides that the best road to a \ngood job is to pursue a credential, such as a dental hygiene \ncertificate, would not be eligible for a penny in new grant aid.\n  In today's global economy, we need stronger incentives for students \nto study math and science, and the Senate bill did that.\n  We also need to address the broader crisis of hundreds of thousands \nof qualified students who never go to college, because the costs are \ntoo high and student aid is too low. All qualified students should get \nthe help they need to achieve the American dream. \n  Take the case of Carli, from Hampton, NH. She's a junior at a public \ncollege in the State, and she already has $25,000 of debt. She relies \non her Pell grant, but even with that, she has to work 20 hours a week \nduring the school year and 40 hours a week in the summer.\n  She writes, ``This is not a question of not working hard enough. It \nhas been an uphill battle to put myself through school. I am happy to \ndo it, but I just want to know that when I'm through, there is a place \nfor me in the American Dream too.''\n  Becky, from Holyoke, MA is a junior in college and is already in \n$24,000 of debt. She's alarmed at how high her debt will be when she \ngraduates.\n  She writes, ``We students are the future of the USA. By putting us at \nrisk and in a financial crisis, Bush and his cronies are putting the \nfuture of the USA at risk.''\n  In addition to abandoning so many students who so desperately need \nour help, this bill also rejects our Senate-passed proposals to \nincrease competition in the federal loan programs. As a result, private \nlenders will still have their unfair advantage over the more cost-\nefficient federal loan program. The end result will be increased costs \nto taxpayers.\n  The actions taken today hand the keys of the student loan program \nover to profit-hungry banks and lenders. Congress missed the \nopportunity to say students, not banks, should be given a break.\n  American students deserve better. America deserves better. \n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthis letter signed by over 146 organizations that are against the \nreconciliation report.\n  Also, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter \nfrom the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops that finds that this is \nbasically an immoral, unfair, and unjust budget.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter \nfrom a the educational groups who oppose this report.\n  There are even more groups than these who have joined in to oppose \nthis bill. I have not seen groups as united as these in their \nopposition to the way this report fails to prioritize the needs of the \nAmerican family. And they speak loudly and clearly.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          United States Conference\n\n\n                                          of Catholic Bishops,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 13, 2005.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: Last February in my capacity as President of \n     the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, I wrote \n     asking you to give priority attention to the needs of poor \n     and vulnerable people as you developed a budget for our \n     nation. Congress is now nearing completion of the budget with \n     reconciliation bills that reflect not only economic policy \n     preferences but basic moral choices as well. As Congress \n     prepares to resolve the differences between the House and \n     Senate versions of the spending reconciliation package, I \n     wish to express deep concerns and disappointment on the \n     impact of certain proposed cuts on our most vulnerable \n     brothers and sisters. At the same time, the Bishops' \n     Conference is grateful that both bills take steps toward \n     helping those who have suffered due to Hurricane Katrina.\n       In my previous letter, I urged you on behalf of the \n     Bishops' Conference to develop a budget plan that would \n     guarantee adequate funding to assist those who are struggling \n     to move beyond welfare, to educate their children, to gain \n     access to health care or to overcome hunger and homelessness. \n     Unfortunately, the budget proposal developed by the House of \n     Representatives includes provisions that fall well short of \n     that standard. We urge you to choose the Senate's approach, \n     and not include these provisions in the final bill.\n       We urge you to oppose harmful cuts to the Food Stamp \n     program included in the House bill that will result in taking \n     food away from children and others who are being helped now. \n     According to the Congressional Budget Office the House \n     proposal would result in over 250,000 children and adults \n     losing access to Food Stamps. Just under one-third of those \n     would be legal permanent residents\n\n[[Page S14082]]\n\n     who will lose eligibility if the five year waiting period is \n     extended by two years. The Bishops' Conference strongly \n     supported President Bush's successful effort to expand access \n     to Food Stamps for legal immigrants in the last farm bill. We \n     strongly oppose retreating by making legal immigrants wait an \n     additional two years for eligibility.\n       The Bishops' Conference strongly recognizes and affirms the \n     sanctity of human life from conception to natural death. \n     Access to adequate health care is a basic human right and an \n     essential measure of respect for human life and dignity. No \n     one should be denied access to needed health care because of \n     the inability to pay. Allowing states to increase the burden \n     of copayments, deductibles and premiums on Medicaid \n     beneficiaries-including some children and pregnant women--and \n     to erode federal standards of core benefits will have that \n     effect. We urge you to reject including these proposals from \n     the House bill in the final package. Attempts to save money \n     by making it harder for low-income and vulnerable people to \n     get the health care they need is simply unacceptable.\n       The House bill also includes provisions to reauthorize the \n     Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) welfare \n     program. The Conference has not supported earlier iterations \n     of the House TANF proposal because of concerns about how it \n     could impact low-income families and children, given that it \n     increases work requirements, including for mothers of \n     children under 6 years old; fails to provide sufficient child \n     care funding; and fails to restore TANF benefit eligibility \n     to recently-arrived legal immigrants. TANF reauthorization \n     should be considered on its own terms to allow full review of \n     these and other important policy decisions, instead of \n     including it in a budget-cutting exercise.\n       The House bill, by cutting federal funding for state child \n     support services, will make it harder for states to collect \n     child support for low and moderate-income families and result \n     in $21 billion less in child support being collected for \n     children and families than under current law, according to \n     the Congressional Budget Office. This proposal is not good \n     for children or families, and we urge you to reject it. Child \n     support payments are crucial to the economic viability of \n     some families, keeping them out of poverty and off public \n     programs. They can also encourage parental responsibility and \n     help to maintain the connection between children and their \n     non-custodial parent.\n       In addition to these areas where we ask you to follow the \n     Senate bill, we are concerned with the approach both bills \n     take in important areas of agriculture policy. First, the \n     bishops have stated that protecting God's creation must be a \n     central goal of agricultural policies, and we support \n     programs that promote soil conservation, improve water \n     quality, protect wildlife, and maintain biodiversity. We \n     oppose proposals in both bills to reduce spending on key \n     agriculture conservation programs.\n       Second, we are also deeply disappointed that neither bill \n     begins the process of limiting U.S. farm supports and \n     targeting them to those who need them the most--small and \n     moderate-sized farms facing periodic price shocks or \n     unpredictable natural disasters. Such a policy is needed so \n     poor farmers around the world can sell their products and \n     support their families, and to help family farms remain \n     competitive in a volatile market.\n       Finally, the Bishops' Conference is pleased that both the \n     House and Senate bills call for 100% federal financing for \n     health care for victims of Katrina. The House provision goes \n     farther than the Senate bill, providing for full federal \n     Medicaid funding not only for Katrina victims and evacuees, \n     wherever they now live, but for all residents of Louisiana, \n     Mississippi and the most affected counties in Alabama. We \n     urge you to support the more generous House language.\n       The federal budget is more than a matter of accounting: it \n     reflects our values and priorities as a nation. The budget \n     choices you make in the coming days will directly affect the \n     lives of real people, especially ``the least of these'' in \n     our midst. This is a time for a genuinely bipartisan \n     commitment to focus on the common good of all, and on the \n     special needs of the poor and vulnerable in particular. On \n     behalf of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, I \n     urge you to make that commitment by working for a budget that \n     does not neglect the needs of the most vulnerable among us.\n           Sincerely,\n                                    Most Rev. William S. Skylstad,\n     Bishop of Spokane, President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                American Council on Education,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 19, 2005.\n       Dear Senator: The higher education associations listed \n     below, representing the nation's two- and four-year public \n     and private colleges and research universities and the \n     students who attend them, strongly oppose the conference \n     report to S. 1932, the FY 2006 budget reconciliation \n     legislation. The decisions made regarding federal student \n     loans in the conference committee pay for deficit reduction \n     by sending the bill directly to America's college students \n     and their parents.\n       Fully $12.7 billion--or nearly one-third--of the $41 \n     billion in cuts contained in the reconciliation bill are \n     derived from the student loan programs. This is the biggest \n     cut in the history of the federal student loan program.\n       In addition, the legislation creates a new source of \n     competition for scarce Pell Grant and campus-based aid grant \n     funds, while simultaneously destabilizing the delivery of the \n     federal student loan funds. This happens as a result of the \n     bill's transfer of the ``Section 458'' administrative funds \n     from the mandatory to the discretionary portion of the \n     budget, a $600 million annual expenditure.\n       On the plus side, the bill uses a small portion of the \n     student loan cuts to create two new grants for students \n     majoring in math, science, and foreign languages; reduce loan \n     origination fees; provide a modest increase in borrowing \n     limits; and make improvements in the need analysis system. \n     Ultimately, however, these provisions are too small, and in \n     the case of one of the grant programs, far too complex and \n     restrictive to offset the damaging consequences of the cuts \n     to student loans. We are also extremely disappointed that the \n     Senate's ``ProGAP'' program, which stood a real chance to \n     expand college access by increasing need-based grant aid \n     funding, was dropped in the conference agreement.\n       At a time when the nation's future economic prospects are \n     tied more closely than ever before to a college-educated and \n     highly-skilled workforce, it is shortsighted to ask college \n     students and their families to bear so much of the burden of \n     deficit reduction. Student aid programs, including student \n     loans, are an investment in America's future workforce, and \n     now is the time when our nation should be investing more in \n     the higher education of its citizens.\n       We urge you to vote against the budget reconciliation \n     conference report.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       David Ward,\n                                                        President.\n       On behalf of: American Association of Community Colleges, \n     American Association of State Colleges and Universities, \n     American Council on Education, Association of American \n     Universities, Association of Community College Trustees, \n     Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities, Council for \n     Higher Education Accreditation, National Association of \n     College and University Business Officers, National \n     Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, \n     National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant \n     Colleges, National Association of Student Financial Aid \n     Administrators, The State PIRGs Higher Education Project.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                December 19, 2005.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The undersigned organizations are writing to \n     voice our concern about provisions in the conference report \n     on the reconciliation bill. On behalf of the 53 million \n     Americans who rely on Medicaid for their health and long-term \n     care supports and services, we urge the Senate to reject the \n     conference report. In particular, we strongly oppose the \n     provisions of the conference report that would result in \n     higher cost-sharing and fewer benefits for low-income \n     Medicaid beneficiaries.\n       Congress now has the opportunity to take a stand for \n     America's most vulnerable populations and reject the \n     conference report because it harms low-income beneficiaries. \n     The needs of millions of low-income children, seniors, people \n     with disabilities and working families hang in the balance. \n     We are depending on you to vote ``no'' on the conference \n     report in order to keep health care accessible, affordable \n     and comprehensive for Medicaid beneficiaries.\n           Sincerely,\n         AFL-CIO, AIDS Alliance for Children, Youth & Families, \n

Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Frist: AARP strongly opposes the \n     budget reconciliation conference agreement scheduled to come \n     before the Senate for a vote today. Rather than reflecting \n     the rational provisions of the Senate reconciliation bill, \n     the final conference agreement is irresponsible policy.\n       The final conference agreement does not ask for shared \n     sacrifice to achieve budgetary savings. Rather it protects \n     the pharmaceutical industry, the managed care industry, and \n     other providers at the expense of low-income Medicaid \n     beneficiaries and Medicare beneficiaries who will foot the \n     bill.\n       AARP members and your other constituents will question why \n     members of the Senate would vote for a bill that would:\n       Make it harder for Americans needing long-term care to \n     qualify for Medicaid;\n       Force some Americans to forfeit their homes in order to pay \n     for long-term care services;\n       Require all Medicare Part B beneficiaries to pay higher \n     premiums;\n       Reopen the MMA, not to make improvements in the new drug \n     benefit, but to require those with more income to pay higher \n     Part B premiums sooner; and\n       Force low-income Medicaid recipients to pay more for their \n     care--and if they cannot afford to do so--to potentially be \n     denied care entirely.\n       The conference agreement systematically undermines the \n     critical protections built into both the Medicaid and \n     Medicare programs. If the conference agreement becomes law, \n     then over the course of the next few weeks and months we will \n     make sure that our members across the country fully \n     understand the impact of this conference agreement on them \n     and on their families.\n       We urge the Senate to oppose the reconciliation conference \n     package and urge Congress to instead return to the fair and \n     responsible policies of the original Senate package.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William D. Novelli.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If you are concerned about children, the children's \ngroups are strongly opposed to this. If you are concerned about \neducation, virtually the whole education community is strongly opposed \nto it.\n  If you care about those in poverty and the problems our needy \nfamilies face, all those groups that combat poverty are strongly \nopposed to it.\n  I hope my colleagues will look at what is in this report, listen to \nthe grave concerns of all of these organizations, and join me in \nstrongly opposing this legislation. I hope my colleagues will stand up \nfor the American family and vote against this conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we are going have a series of speakers.\n  I wish to respond quickly to the point of the Senator from \nMassachusetts on a couple of areas.\n  First, the purpose of the deficit reduction bill is to slow the rate \nof growth of entitlement programs. It is a net bill. In this bill, \nthere are very major initiatives, especially in the area of education, \nwhich are new and fully paid for. There is $40 billion in debt \nreduction, but the actual reductions in the bill exceed that by a \nconsiderable amount.\n  The new programmatic activity which is fully paid for in the student \narea is $9 billion of additional funds for student activity.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts says we should have the best and the \nbrightest have an opportunity to participate and go to good colleges. \nWe agree with that. In fact, we are doing something about it. We are \nfollowing the proposals of John Adams, a Massachusetts individual of \nnote who helped our country get started and who considered public \neducation and education generally to be the essence of how the American \ndream is going to be fulfilled. He was totally committed to a \nmeritocracy.\n  We are essentially saying in this bill, by creating this new program \ncalled SMART, if you are a low-income student and you are focusing on \nmath and science, we are going to give you a lot of help. If you can \nperform well in those two areas, you are going to get an opportunity to \nreally succeed in this country. But we are going to give you the \nsupport you need to succeed. We are going to give you $4,000 a year on \ntop of your Pell grant, on top of scholarships, on top of your \nborrowing capabilities. You are potentially getting $4,000 a year in \ncollege if you study math and science and have a low income.\n  We forgive $4 billion in student loans. We are going to reduce \nstudent loan taxes and fees by $4 billion, and we are going to provide \n$1.9 billion of loan forgiveness for people who go into special areas \nthat we consider important, specifically teaching, primarily in these \nspecial education areas. This bill structures a $17,500 loan \nforgiveness program for people who go into special education teaching. \nWe recognize special education teachers are, first, needed, and second, \nthey are put under tremendous stress. If we can encourage people to go \ninto that field, we want to.\n  This bill has some very good policy in the area of education. Sure, \nit isn't as strong as what left the Senate, which was actually worked \nout within the HELP Committee. That happened with the House. The House \nwas zero, we were at eight, and we ended up essentially at four. This \nso-called compromise in that $4 billion is a lot of good initiatives in \nthe area of the SMART Program.\n  I yield to the Senator if he has a question. For the purposes of a \nquestion, I will yield time off his time, of course.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I reclaim a minute of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n[[Page S14084]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if the Senator would outline the $9 \nbillion of additional aid and assistance to students, if he would \noutline those figures, they are in complete conflict with the \ninformation we have about what is and what is not in this bill. I hope \nhe's not referring to the higher loan limits that students have been \ngiven which will result in increased profits for the banks. Is he \ntaking into account the higher origination fees that students in the \nDirect Loan program may have to pay under this proposal? What about the \nfact that only 10 percent of the total need-based population is going \nto benefit at all from the math and science program? If he wants to \nprovide it sometime, or list it, we would be enormously grateful. \nThat's not what our calculations say.\n  Mr. GREGG. Should I charge this to the Senator's time? Essentially, I \nam clarifying the Senator's point. I will do this on my time.\n  Essentially, the origination fees are being eliminated under this \nbill.\n  I point out that the initiatives which are in this bill are \ninitiatives which had bipartisan support, the SMART Program \nspecifically. But the new grant and aid for low-income college students \nis about $3.7 billion in this bill. Lower fees charged to students will \ncause students to gain about $4 billion in this bill. The program which \nextends the loan forgiveness program, as I just mentioned, to a number \nof different categories will generate about $1.9 billion in this bill. \nThat adds up to about $9 billion of initiative in this bill.\n  We think this bill has some pretty positive initiatives.\n  As to the loan rates, I didn't insist on staying at this loan rate. I \nthink that came from the other side of the aisle. Did it not? I believe \nit did. I think the Senator from Massachusetts is the person who \nbasically has locked us into this fixed rate when it should be a \nvariable rate. The variable rate would save our students a lot more \nmoney. Unfortunately, my idea of going to the variable rate was \nrejected in committee by, I believe, the Senator from Massachusetts, \nwho wanted to stay at the fixed rate. That costs how many billions? \nOver $5 billion, according to my staff. Now, that is a back-of-the-\nenvelope guess, but that is probably in the ballpark.\n\n  As to rates, I note to the Senator from Massachusetts, I disagree \nwith the policy in the bill, yes. I wish we had gone to my policy and \nsaved another $5 billion. That would be up to $14 billion to save \nstudents.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will include it in the Record at the appropriate time. \nI thank the Senator for trying to make a good case of a bad record. I \nwill include the responses to each of those areas in my remarks.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GREGG. Does the Senator want to outline who he thinks is speaking \nnext?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we have Senator Schumer next, who will \nconsume 10 minutes. Then we have Senator Allard, who probably will be \nhere at that point. We will go to Senator Allard for half an hour. Then \nwe would like to go to Senator Stabenow for 10 minutes. At \napproximately noon, Senator Stevens for half an hour, followed by \nSenator Murkowski from 12:30 to 12:50. We hope to slot Senator Harkin \nfrom 12:50 to approximately 1:30.\n  Mr. GREGG. And Senator Coburn.\n  Mr. CONRAD. And Senator Coburn after that.\n  We are trying to put colleagues on notice. That is basically the \nspeaking order.\n  At this point we yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New York, \nSenator Schumer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2082\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota \nfor extending the courtesy to me.\n  I rise today to talk about the U.S. PATRIOT Act. There has been a lot \nof talk on the subject. With all the smoke and mirrors, let's go to the \nsimple facts.\n  First, every single Democratic Senator wants to extend the present \nPATRIOT Act for 3 months. Every single Democratic Senator, in fact, has \ncosponsored or supports--everyone but one, and Senator Feingold \nsupports--the legislation introduced by the Presiding Officer, the \nSenator from New Hampshire, that extends the PATRIOT Act by 3 months. \nWe also have a number of Republican Senators, led by Senator Sununu of \nNew Hampshire, who also want to extend the act for 3 months. In fact, \nno Member of the Senate wants the PATRIOT Act to expire. That is why \n100 Senators supported a measure to reauthorize the act this summer. It \nspanned the gap from the most conservative Republican to the most \nliberal Democrat, which shows the consensus on this very important \nissue is very achievable.\n  The simple fact is if we extend the PATRIOT Act for 3 months, it \nwon't end. So the act's fate is in the President's hands. We say to the \nPresident: Extend it, don't end it. It is as simple as that. Let me \nrepeat: Extend it, don't end it. That is our position on the PATRIOT \nAct.\n  Lately, based on the comments of some of my friends across the aisle, \nI feel we are characters in the book ``1984.'' It is vintage Orwellian \ndoublespeak to say when 49 Senators from both parties, a near majority, \nare eager to extend the PATRIOT Act, that they are causing it to \nexpire. In fact, if either the President or the majority leader of the \nSenate today were to say they are for extending the act for 3 months, \nmy guess is it would get an overwhelming majority of both parties in \nthe Senate.\n  These Senators have agreed to extend the PATRIOT Act in its current \nform so we can take 3 months to get it in better form. On the one hand, \nI want to give a lot of credit to my colleagues from Pennsylvania and \nVermont. Their compromise and the bill before the Senate is an \nimprovement over present law. It is a significant improvement over the \nHouse bill. It comes a lot closer to the Senate bill than many of my \ncolleagues even on my side of the aisle, at least in my opinion, are \ngiving it credit for.\n  I have two principal problems related to the conference report. First \nand foremost, I have real concerns we did not correct the formula in \nterms of distributing aid, which hurts my State of New York. We have to \ngive law enforcement not just judicial tools and prosecutorial tools \nbut financial tools, as well. Every day when I ride over the Brooklyn \nBridge, whether by car or on my bicycle, I see police cars at either \nend. New York has an undue burden in terms of security. New York and \nother places that are at greater risk should get a greater share of the \nfunding. The House bill readjusted the formula, much to the relief of \nNew Yorkers, but the Senate bill did not.\n  If we took 3 months, we could keep the present PATRIOT Act on the \nbooks and make a real attempt to adjust the formula on the basis of \nneed.\n  Second, the revelations from last week about warrantless wiretapping \nhave also given me pause. If this Government will discard a law that \nhas worked well for over 30 years without a whit of discussion or \nnotice, for sure we better be certain we have safeguards on that \nGovernment. I am extremely troubled the administration, which claims to \nvalue strict construction of the laws and Constitution, has used the \nSeptember 11, 2001, congressional resolution authorizing the use of \nmilitary force to justify secret wiretapping of Americans.\n  I have not read the whole record, but I daresay the word \n``wiretapping'' never came up in that debate. Certainly I, who voted \nfor that resolution, never thought it applied to wiretapping. I don't \nthink anyone else did as well. To say when we authorized the President \nto use force, that allows him to wiretap American citizens without a \nwarrant is stretching it, to say the least.\n  The balance between security and liberty is a delicate one. I agree \nwith the President. Most Americans put security first. It has to be. \nBut liberty and privacy, in particular, are very important to \nAmericans, as well. It is very high on the list. Therefore, this Senate \nand the Government should make every effort to have both security and \nliberty.\n  We came very close. The Senate bill, as I said, had a 100-to-0 vote, \nfrom the most liberal Democrat to the most conservative Republican. The \ncompromise Senator Specter shepherded through was a good attempt. But \nin these crucial areas we can do better. If we simply extend the \nPATRIOT Act--not end\n\n[[Page S14085]]\n\nit, extend it--we can try to make it better.\n  I tend to be fairly hawkish on these types of things. However, there \nis one thing for sure: When you are dealing with the delicate balance \nbetween liberty and security, there ought to be discussion. There ought \nto be debate. The President, whether he be a Democrat or a Republican, \nshould not simply appropriate it to himself to change the law with the \nflick of a pen. That is what our Nation stands for.\n  In light of these problems and concerns, let me say again, when it \ncomes to the PATRIOT Act, my position and that of every Member of the \nDemocratic Party in the Senate and a good number of our Republican \ncolleagues is extend it, don't end it.\n  Why are we talking about ending it if we have so many people who want \nto extend it? The majority leader has opposed extending the present \nPATRIOT Act. The President has threatened to veto an extension of the \nPATRIOT Act.\n  So here we are, on the brink, with 16 important provisions about to \nsunset. If that happens, make no mistake about it, it will be because \nthe distinguished Republican leader has allowed it to happen. It will \nbe because the President has allowed it to happen. The choice is not \nthe present compromise or no PATRIOT Act. There are three choices: The \npresent compromise, which does not have enough support in the Senate to \npass as of now, with bipartisan opposition, letting it lapse, or \nextending it for 3 months.\n  If even in the President's and the majority leader's eyes, they \ncannot get the first, isn't extending it better than ending it? The \nchoice is in their hands. So if it does happen, if the PATRIOT Act is \nallowed to sunset, despite unanimous support for its extension in one \nform or another, I would ask the President to explain why we are \nwithout the PATRIOT Act, why he would not allow a bipartisan measure to \nextend it. It is almost surreal.\n  Can it be that the majority leader of the Senate, the President of \nthe United States, who at every turn has talked about the importance of \nsecurity, who has talked about the importance of the sunsetting PATRIOT \nAct provisions, will force its expiration?\n  Certainly, they have the option of extending it for 3 months so that \ndisagreements, which I say can be resolved, will be. And if they then \npersist in opposition to the 3-month extension and complain, it will be \nsimilar to the child who killed his parents and then complained that he \nwas an orphan.\n  So let us all be reasonable for a day, as we approach our citizens' \nmost sacred time of year, and do the mature thing, the logical thing, \nthe right thing.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 2082, the 3-\nmonth extension of the PATRIOT Act, that the Senate proceed to its \nimmediate consideration, the bill be read a third time and passed, and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, is it the Senator's \nposition that if the unanimous consent request was amended to be a 1-\nyear extension, the Senator would support that unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Well, it is something I would consider. I think 1 month \nwould be--right now we have support--\n  Mr. GREGG. One year.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I understand. Right now we have support for 3 months. It \nis something that could probably be negotiated. My point is, we should \nextend it.\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, if there is an orphan on \nthe floor today, or in this city today, I would suggest it is the \nSenator from New York. As I made the point yesterday, if he wished to \nget to a vote on the PATRIOT Act it could have occurred. But the \nSenator from New York would not allow cloture to be invoked. And now \nthe Senator from New York and the leadership of the Democratic Party \nare coming to the floor claiming that because they would not allow the \nPATRIOT Act to be voted on, they are prejudiced and that they should \nnot be accused of killing the PATRIOT Act.\n  Well, obviously they killed the PATRIOT Act when they did not allow \nit to be voted on. That is a situation such as you referred to, where \nthe individual killed his parents and then threw himself on the mercy \nof the court claiming he was an orphan. So if the Senator does not wish \nto extend the act for a year, then I would say his statements are \nPyrrhic.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. GREGG. First, I am going to object, and then I will yield. But I \nwill not yield on my time. I will yield on the time of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. There is an objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator's time has expired, and the \nSenator from Colorado----\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given 1 \nminute to respond to my colleague from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. As long as the time comes off the bill on the Democratic \nside.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield the minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The point is, we do have large numbers of people who want to extend \nthe PATRIOT Act, not end it, whether it is 3 months or something more \nthan 3 months. That is the point that I think is salient. I would hope \nmy colleague would support 3 months, as his colleague from New \nHampshire--he and his colleague from New Hampshire generally see things \nthe same way--has asked for. But the idea stated by the President and \nthe majority leader, that they would not be for any extension--1 year, \n3 months or anything in between--is what is stymieing us here.\n  The bottom line is very simple. The choice is a simple one. Right now \nwe cannot get the PATRIOT Act through the way the Senator from New \nHampshire would like it. There are not enough votes by the rules of the \nSenate. Do you take your marbles and go home and let it expire or do \nyou try to work out an extension, as opposed to saying: I am upset. I \nam going to end it. We are urging an extension. Right now, the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, who has led the charge on this--not my colleague \nwho is managing this bill, but the Presiding Officer, Senator Sununu--\nhas suggested 3 months. I, for one, am not locked into a specific time. \nBut I am locked in and very eager to see us extend the act, not kill \nit, simply because the compromise does not have the votes to prevail.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, at this point, I will yield to the Senator \nfrom Colorado.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds on \nthis subject.\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, I guess we can certainly give you 30 seconds. But I \nmay take a minute and a half back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator is recognized for 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, it has been suggested that the PATRIOT Act \nhas been killed. The PATRIOT Act has not been killed. The PATRIOT Act \nis alive and well until December 31. So the fact is, we have time to \nget this right. And if we cannot get it right before December 31, then \nwe have the potential to extend it, whether it is 3 months or 6 months \nor 9 months or some other time.\n  The point is, no one has killed the PATRIOT Act. The PATRIOT Act is \nstill on the books. It is alive and well until December 31. So this \nissue has not yet been decided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, prior to yielding to the Senator from \nColorado, I am going to take a minute and a half, which would be the \nminute Senator Schumer had and the half minute\n\n[[Page S14086]]\n\nwhich we so graciously gave the Senator from North Dakota.\n  I would simply point out that the Democratic leader said:\n\n       We killed the Patriot Act.\n\n  So that is where the body lies. It does not lie on this side of the \naisle. It does not lie at the White House. The body lies right there \nbecause of the fact that we were not allowed to go to a vote on final \npassage. That is the way the institution works. The Senator from New \nYork said: Well, we are taking our marbles and leaving. We are not \ntaking our marbles and leaving. We had 50-plus votes willing to \ncontinue the PATRIOT Act under the new law, as it has been drafted, as \nit has gone through the committee process. Fifty-plus votes, that is a \nmajority.\n  What happened, however, was the other side of the aisle did not get \nit exactly the way they wanted it, so they are going to kill it. That \nis where the body lies.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. I think we have continued this long enough. We actually do \nnot have the PATRIOT Act inside the Deficit Reduction Act yet, but it \nis possible we could end up there before we finish.\n  Senator Allard has been very gracious in allowing us to take from his \ntime. I yield to Senator Allard as much time as he may use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized for as \nmuch time as he may consume.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Budget Committee for \nyielding and also express my appreciation for his leadership.\n  Through these budget issues, there has been delay and obstruction all \nalong the route. We are seeing delay and obstruction at the end of the \nsession. We have just seen some of the debate going on as it applies to \nthe PATRIOT Act. I do not want to debate the PATRIOT Act. But what I \nwould like to do is talk about the budget because this is very \nimportant. It is a very critical piece of legislation.\n  This is the first time in 8 years Congress has attempted to control \nthe rate of growth in entitlement spending. I have had an opportunity \nto deal with budget issues, both here and as a Member of the House. I \nwas elected to the House of Representatives in 1990. Shortly \nthereafter, I was able to get on the Budget Committee.\n  I was fortunate enough to get on the Budget Committee when I came \nover to the Senate. I have seen a disturbing trend in our spending \nhabits in the Congress. If we look at the 1990 fiscal year, when I \nfirst began to really look at the budget seriously as a policymaker, we \nhad 48 percent in entitlement and mandatory spending. Another 23 \npercent was defense discretionary, and then we had some 29 percent or \nso that fell into interest, as well as nondefense discretionary. As the \nyears have gone by, in 2000 we find our entitlements and mandatory \nspending are up to 55 percent from 48 percent in 1990. We see that \ndefense discretionary is actually down to 19 percent from 23 percent. \nWe see that our nondefense discretionary net interest rates are staying \nclose to the same.\n  The real problem is in the future. As we look at 2010, we see that \nour entitlements are projected to go up to 58 percent--with another 17 \npercent on defense discretionary and nondefense discretionary and net \ninterest is staying pretty close to the same range. This spells out \nproblems for future generations. I want my children, who are now in \ntheir thirties, as well as my grandkids, to have an opportunity for \neconomic growth. If we continue to push these obligations back and \ncontinue to allow entitlement spending to grow, it is going to take \naway from their discretionary spending. They are not going to have the \nopportunities my generation had. My wife and I have had wonderful \nopportunities. We were able to start a small business by ourselves. We \nwere able to see our local community grow and the State grow, and we \ngrew with them. If we continue to spend in the Federal budget as we are \nnow, that opportunity is going to go away.\n  The budget reconciliation passed by the Congress earlier this year \nhad a requirement of $34.7 billion in savings over 5 years. That is not \nmuch of a reduction in the rate of increase. Remember, these are all \nstill increases that are happening. We only have reductions in the rate \nof increase.\n  Finally, we have a bill before us that is looking to save close to \n$40 billion. We have improved it. But you have to remember that this is \nactually just a reduction in the rate of increase. We are not cutting \nor eliminating any programs; we are just reducing the rate of \nincreases. Only in Washington, DC, is a reduction in the rate of growth \ncalled a cut. In reality, year after year, you see spending increase. I \nhave seen that happen in my experience in the House and now in the \nSenate. We have Members complaining about the cuts that are happening \nin the budget. Yet you look at all these budgets year after year, and \nthey gradually increase. They are just not increasing as much as some \nMembers want. It is like a kid saying, I want to have my allowance \nincreased from $1 a week to $1.50 a week, and you say, No, I will \nincrease it from $1 to $1.25. They would say that is a 25-percent cut. \nIn reality, it is a 25-percent increase in the amount of money they are \ngoing to receive to spend. So the Senate needs to bring common sense to \nthe budget process.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for an inquiry?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Yes, on the Senator's time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, sir. For management of the floor purposes--and I \napologize to the Senator for interrupting him--it would be helpful for \nus to know, because of the time constraints, does the Senator intend to \ntake about 30 minutes?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I have probably about 15 more minutes or so.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is very helpful.\n  I indicate to the Chair and all colleagues, the intention would be to \ngo to Senator Stabenow next. There is not a formal agreement in place, \nbut that is the informal understanding, that after Senator Allard, \nSenator Stabenow would be next.\n  I thank the Senator very much. Again, I apologize for interrupting.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator. I certainly don't mind working with \nhim in lining up speakers as they come down. It is important to give \nMembers adequate notice.\n  So, again, only in Washington is a reduction in the rate of growth \nactually called a cut. The conference report we have before us suggests \nthat we reduce spending by some $40 billion. This is a reduction in the \nrate of increase over a 5-year period. For too long the Government has \nbeen on automatic pilot for mandatory programs. We have done a few \nthings in an attempt to reduce spending in some of the entitlement \nprograms--a very small amount. These entitlement programs are going to \ncontinue to grow, at least at the rate of inflation. We have begun to \naddress the rate of spending and brought it down so that the rate of \nincrease will be less.\n  If we look at the total budget, the entitlements take up a large \npercentage of the budget. Discretionary spending--it gets a lot of \nattention in the media, I might add--that part of the budget only runs \nclose to 30 percent. Sixty percent or so--better than 60 percent is \ngoing into entitlement spending. Mainly, that is Medicare and Medicaid. \nI was astounded by the figure that Chairman Gregg put out in his \ncomments when he was opening the debate this morning on the Senate \nfloor. He noted that we have $51 trillion in unfunded liability. Much \nof that is Medicaid and Medicare. This doesn't paint a good picture for \nmy grandkids when they are going to grow up and look at starting a \nbusiness.\n  One of the big costs I had as an employer was the amount of taxes I \nhad to pay toward Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security. As these \ncosts get higher and higher--and they are going to if we don't control \nspending--it is going to be more difficult for small businesspeople \nlike myself to get started in business. It will be more difficult for \nthem to prosper and grow and to create an opportunity for their kids \nand generation after generation. So we need to make some decisions.\n  I don't think these are tough decisions, by the way. These decisions \nshould be relatively easy. We have a large budget that we passed, and a \n$40 billion reduction over 5 years is a very small amount of reduction \nin the rate of increase. Mandatory spending is growing at an \nunsustainable rate.\n\n[[Page S14087]]\n\n  Entitlements are the fastest growing part of the Federal Government. \nUnless Congress takes steps to address mandatory spending, future \ngenerations will be left with an unsustainable program. The Comptroller \nGeneral estimated unfunded liability somewhere around $51 trillion, as \nI mentioned.\n  The Deficit Reduction Act provides a downpayment toward hurricane and \nrecovery costs.\n  The act also takes steps to reform outdated, inefficient, and overly \ncostly entitlement programs.\n  Medicaid is reformed to expand flexibility of State Medicaid benefit \npackages, expanded home and community-based services, and expanded \nservices for disabled children.\n  Education for low-income students is strengthened through new grant \naid for low-income students and extending certain loan forgiveness.\n  The point is that we have to set priorities, and I think one of the \ntop priorities of this Congress should be an attempt to reduce the \never-escalating costs in spending, particularly on the mandatory \nentitlement spending side. We need to work on all areas, by the way. In \ndiscretionary spending, there are things we can do to bring in more \nefficiency. But the areas where we are seeing the greatest growth, and \nthe areas that are going to cause the greatest liability for \ngenerations, is the growth in entitlement spending.\n  The other side is constantly complaining about not doing enough to \nhold down spending. Here is an opportunity to hold down spending. I \nhope they will join the Republican side in getting the Deficit \nReduction Act passed, the bill we have before us right now.\n  The argument that comes from the other side is basically that they \nwant to increase taxes, they want to increase Federal spending, and \nthey believe that we will all be better off. But that doesn't work. We \nhave seen the President's economic plan work very well in the last few \nyears. We have seen the economy rebound. You can look at all the \neconomic figures you want, but you have to come to the conclusion, \nwhether you look at employment or growth of the economy, interest \nrates, or disposable income, it has all been a good picture. The \nPresident's economic growth package has worked, which says that we cut \nback on taxes.\n  The reason that works is because we allow small businesses, similar \nto what I had, or individuals to keep more money in their pocket. More \nmoney in their pocket means they can buy cars, they will buy homes, \nthey will buy whatever disposable items they have. This keeps our \neconomy turning. If you take that away from them, then it slows \neconomic growth.\n  Time and time again, we have seen in our country's history, whether \nit started with President John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, or now \nPresident Bush, that when we have a high tax burden, and we reduce that \ntax burden, it is going to cause economic growth. In return that means \nmore money coming in to State and local governments, and it means more \nmoney coming in to the Federal Government.\n  State and local governments around the country are now experiencing \nan unexpected return in revenues, and that means they can begin to \naddress the needs of their communities and State.\n  We are seeing that there is an increase in the amount of revenue \ncoming in to the Federal Government. Revenue is increasing because we \ncut taxes to keep the economy going. In spite of the fact we have had \nhigh energy costs, the economy is strong. When it has had to deal with \nhigh energy costs and the cost of the war, it is still showing growth \nfigures, which is remarkable. It speaks strongly of an economic package \nthat has been passed out of this Senate, out of the Congress, and \npushed by President Bush.\n  We need to continue that effort. We should not backtrack. This bill \nkeeps us on track. It says we have to look at holding down spending. \nThe Federal Government doesn't create jobs. It does not create new \nwealth in this country. New wealth comes mainly from the small business \nsector. It comes from families who own businesses. It comes from \nindividuals who own businesses who are innovative, who try to develop \nnew ways to get into the market. That is where all our new technology \ncomes from. We need to make sure we do everything possible to give them \nan opportunity to do that. When we increase the burden of Government on \nsmall business, we make it more difficult for them to make the \ninvestment they need to grow. When they grow, they pay more taxes, and \nthat is going to mean more revenue to Government.\n  The problem is not tax cuts but spending. Tax receipts are growing. \nYet we continue to have deficits because spending is growing even \nfaster. The current Federal deficit is too high and out of control. \nMandatory spending is threatening the economic security of future \ngenerations. This conference report will help keep the U.S. economy \nstrong and growing. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for the \nDeficit Reduction Act of 2005 conference report. It will make a \ndifference. It is a step in the right direction.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 10 minutes off the time on the Democratic side, as agreed to before.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              PATRIOT Act\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the PATRIOT Act \nreauthorization. Our Nation's Founding Fathers could never have \nforeseen the kinds of threats we face today from America's enemies, nor \ncould they have imagined the technologies we use to anticipate attacks \non our country and to prevent them with cell phones, computers, \nelectronic bank reports, and other kinds of efforts. But they did \nforesee the threats of unchecked Government power on the civil \nliberties of each of us as Americans.\n  The fourth amendment was adopted as a protection against the \nwidespread invasions of privacy experienced by American colonists at \nthe hands of the British Government. That is part of our history. That \nis why this debate is so important. That is why we are standing in this \nChamber, just 11 days before the PATRIOT Act expires, to debate this \nreauthorization. And that is why my colleagues and I on both sides of \nthe aisle are fighting to extend the current PATRIOT Act for 3 months \nwhile we work to get agreement on the right balance between our \nsecurity and our right to privacy and due process.\n  I want to particularly say congratulations and lend my admiration to \nthe Senator currently occupying the Chair in this Chamber and thank him \nfor his leadership on this issue. We have come together in a bipartisan \nway under his leadership and other colleagues on both sides of the \naisle. I am very grateful for the Chair's leadership.\n  We all agree that we need to protect our homeland, but we also have \nan obligation to protect the civil liberties that are the birthright of \nevery American. It is important that we get the PATRIOT Act right, not \njust insist on getting it done right now. That is why we say extend it, \ndon't end it. Extend it, don't end it.\n  This is a critical debate. The terrorist threat to our country is \nvery real, and it is vital that we provide the Government with the law \nenforcement tools necessary to protect our Nation, to protect our \nfamilies.\n  I am proud to have offered provisions in the PATRIOT Act to protect \nagainst money laundering. My provision, section 325, gives the Treasury \nDepartment the ability to better monitor anonymous bank accounts which \ncan be used to move terrorist funds. This is an important provision \nthat can be used to prevent terrorist attacks in the United States.\n  We need to use every tool possible to fight terrorism and to protect \nour citizens at home. At the same time, the threat to civil liberties \nis also very real in America today. Last week we were alarmed to learn \nthat under a secret order signed by the President of the United States, \nthe Government has been monitoring the international telephone calls \nand e-mail messages from people inside the United States, American \ncitizens, without court approval. This is not something that is \nauthorized by the PATRIOT Act or by any act of Congress but, instead, \nis being conducted under a secret Presidential order.\n  This debate is not about whether the Government should have the tools \nthat it needs to protect the American people. Of course, it should. \nNobody in this\n\n[[Page S14088]]\n\nChamber disagrees with that. That is why the PATRIOT Act passed \noverwhelmingly 4 years ago.\n  The Senate's bipartisan reauthorization bill passed unanimously in \nJuly. It was an extraordinary effort by leaders on both sides of the \naisle. I am very proud of what we did back in July in unanimously \npassing an improved version of the PATRIOT Act.\n  This debate is not about whether the PATRIOT Act should suddenly \nexpire. Of course, it should not. That is why we say, ``Extend it, \ndon't end it.'' That is why we have offered a bipartisan bill to extend \nthe PATRIOT Act for 3 months to give Congress time to reach a \nbipartisan compromise--again, authored by the Senator from New \nHampshire, who is currently chairing this August body.\n  This extension has 47 cosponsors and counting from both sides of the \naisle. This debate is about balance. It is about ensuring the safety of \nthe American people while at the same time protecting our rights and \nkeeping the Government accountable for its actions. These are not \nmutually exclusive goals. Again, we need to amend the PATRIOT Act, not \nend it.\n  The PATRIOT Act reauthorization conference report does make some \nimportant improvements and I want to thank Senator Specter and Senator \nLeahy for their hard work and leadership on this bill. The conference \nreport contains the 4-year sunsets in the Senate bill instead of the \noriginal 10 years in the House bill. It no longer contains a provision \nthat would have made it a crime merely to disclose the receipt of a \nnational security letter. However, there is a lot more to be done \nbefore we should be passing this bill and sending it to the President.\n  Under section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, known as the library provision, \nthe Government can obtain a secret order to access personal records of \nAmericans without probable cause of a crime. That means the Government \ncan get copies of Americans' medical or financial records, library \nrecords, gun ownership records, purchase records. It also prohibits the \nkeeper of this information, such as a librarian, from telling anyone \nthat they have handed over these records to the Government. Before the \nPATRIOT Act, the FBI had access only to certain kinds of business \nrecords such as hotel and rental car receipts and they had to meet a \nhigher legal standards before a court in order to obtain this \ninformation.\n  The PATRIOT Act did away with these limitations and lowered the \nstandard for obtaining these personal records. The Senate version of \nthe reauthorization bill reestablished a significant check on this \npower, and that is very important. Under the Senate bill, relevance to \nan authorized investigation is not enough. The Government must also \nshow some connection between the records they are seeking and a \nsuspected terrorist or spy. Unfortunately, this basic protection is not \nin the final conference report. The Senate bill also included basic \nprotections for the recipients of a section 215 letter to allow them to \nchallenge the automatic permanent gag order and these protections were \nleft out of the conference report.\n  The conference report's treatment of national security letters, or \nNSLs, also needs significant improvement. NSLs are documents issued by \nthe Federal Government that allow the Government to seize a wide \nvariety of business and financial records without the approval of a \njudge, a grand jury, or a prosecutor. This has been raised as a concern \nby the U.S. Chamber, other business organizations and others throughout \nthe country. Like section 215, a person who receives an NSL is under a \npermanent gag order without any judicial review.\n  Last month, The Washington Post reported that the FBI issues more \nthan 30,000 NSLs per year. That is a hundredfold increase over past \npractices.\n  Lastly, the conference report weakened the critical sneak-and-peek \nprotections that were in the Senate bill. Under section 213 of the \nPATRIOT Act, the Government can conduct secret searches in criminal \ninvestigations. With a section 213 warrant, investigators can enter \nsomeone's home or their office, conduct a search, take pictures, seize \nitems, without telling the person for weeks, months, or in some cases \nmore than a year. The Senate bill replaced this standard with a 7-day \nrule, permitting the Government to obtain additional 90-day extensions \nwhen necessary. The conference committee changed that.\n  Our Founding Fathers may not have foreseen the threats we face from \nour enemies today, but they did foresee the threats of unchecked \nGovernment power on the civil liberties and freedoms of all Americans. \nProtecting Americans from unlawful search and seizure is one of the \nNation's founding principles. To ignore that is to undermine our \nidentity as Americans and our American Constitution. We owe it to the \npeople of America to get this right, and that is why I support an \nextension.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  That is why I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of Senator Sununu's bill, S. \n2082, extending the PATRIOT Act for 3 months; that the Senate proceed \nto its immediate consideration; that the bill be read a third time and \nbe passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I move to amend the unanimous consent request as follows: \nThat we call up the PATRIOT Act which is pending at the desk, have 2 \nhours of debate, and go to final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Michigan consent?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I would object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to the modification.\n  Is there objection to the consent request?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I notice \nthat in the middle of the debate on the deficit reduction bill we are \nhearing a number of people debating what has been debated to \na considerable degree, which is the issue of the fact that the PATRIOT \nAct, which is pending at the desk, will not be allowed to go to a final \nvote by the Democratic membership of the Senate. I would simply say \nthis, that I guess it brings to mind the Shakespearean line, I think it \nwas from ``Julius Caesar''--it might have been one of his other \nwonderful plays--methinks he doth protest too much.\n\n  The corpse lies on their side of the aisle. They are the ones who \nhave killed the PATRIOT Act, if they do not agree to vote it, which is \nsitting at the desk, which has gone through the committee process, \nwhich has been amended, which has been brought forward, and which has a \nmajority of the Senate in favor of it. So I suppose it is a diversion \nfrom the deficit bill, which we should be debating, to bring these \nitems up, but I think it is more simply an attempt to try to move the \nblame for the responsibility for what looks like is going to be the \nending of the PATRIOT Act at the end of this year. I think that is \nunfortunate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, in response to my colleague, I simply \nsay we have unanimous support on this side of the aisle to extend the \nPATRIOT Act for 3 months while working out the areas of concern to \nmillions of Americans. I also find it rather curious, in watching this \ndebate with the distinguished Senator, one distinguished Senator from \nNew Hampshire speaking to another distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire, who is in the chair, who is a Republican author, with \nanother also distinguished colleague from Idaho who is another author \nof the extension. This is clearly a bipartisan effort on our part to do \nthe right thing, to create the right balance to extend, not end, the \nPATRIOT Act at the end of the year. The choice is in the majority as to \nwhether to join us to extend the PATRIOT Act, not end it.\n  I would object to bringing up the bill one more time that, in fact, \nhas been voted on at this point. Procedurally, we have said no to this \nconference report. We want to extend the PATRIOT Act for 3 months, not \nend it, so that we\n\n[[Page S14089]]\n\ncan go back to the great work done unanimously by the Senate, \nunanimously by this body.\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A consent request has been made. Is there \nobjection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, which is my right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. I am reserving my right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the rules, there is no formal right to \nobject. The Senator from New Hampshire has been heard. Does he wish to \nbe heard further on the point?\n  Mr. GREGG. The Chair has an obligation, I believe, to allow me to \nspeak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized to speak further on \nthe point, without objection.\n  Mr. GREGG. I will object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Michigan has the floor. Has she concluded her \nremarks? Has she yielded the floor?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, in conclusion, we have an opportunity to \nreinforce the great work done back in July by the unanimous Senate. We \nhave bipartisan agreement that this conference report does not include \nthe balance necessary and we have come together in a bipartisan way, \nwith every single person on our side of the aisle and great leadership \non the other side of the aisle, to say: Extend the PATRIOT Act, don't \nend it. We know we can work together to get this right on behalf of the \nAmerican people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the PATRIOT Act has been inserted into this \ndebate, which is unfortunate, but I do think it is important to make a \ncouple of points in response to the Senator from Michigan because there \nis misrepresentation here, in my opinion, as to the characterization of \nthe activity.\n  The majority of the Senate has said it wants to pass the PATRIOT Act \nwhich is at the desk. The Senator from Michigan has refused to allow us \nto take up that act, as has the vast majority of her party--although \nthere were a couple of folks on our side who I believe voted that way. \nSo the issue is not that the majority of the Senate is opposed to the \nPATRIOT Act at the desk; the issue is the minority of the Senate is not \ngoing to allow the PATRIOT Act to come to a vote in the Senate and thus \nthe PATRIOT Act will expire. The only reasonable analysis of that \nsituation is the expiration is a result of the minority of the Senate, \nled by a fairly large number of the Democratic membership of the \nSenate, desiring to put form over substance and not allow the PATRIOT \nAct to a final vote and, as a result, forcing the expiration of the \nPATRIOT Act.\n  They cannot now come to the floor and say, Oh, but we didn't mean it. \nWe killed the PATRIOT Act, but we didn't mean it.\n  The fact is, this bill which is at the desk has bipartisan support, \nhas gone through the committee process, and is the proper way to deal \nwith the PATRIOT Act.\n  I suppose we can stay here all day and debate the PATRIOT Act, but \nactually this is a deficit reduction act and I hope we will get back to \nit.\n  At this point, do you have any speakers?\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I have not yielded the floor yet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire retains the \nfloor.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask if we are going to return to speakers?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I was going to take some time at this moment on the same \nsubject. I, too, regret we have gotten onto the PATRIOT Act, but since \nwe have, I feel a need to take on a couple of these points.\n  Mr. GREGG. Senator Stevens is here to speak. How much time do you \nrequire?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will not take long.\n  Mr. GREGG. So we can get it fixed up so we can get a time agreement?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No, no, I will be very brief and then we will go to \nSenator Stevens.\n  Mr. GREGG. All right.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we are on the budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We are on the Budget Reconciliation Act. But people have \ncome to the floor, as is their right, to discuss other issues. Now we \nhave gotten into a discussion of the PATRIOT Act.\n  I have great respect for the chairman of the Budget Committee, but I \nmust say on this issue I profoundly disagree. The Senator from New \nHampshire says there is a majority in the Senate who support the \nPATRIOT Act provisions that have come back from conference committee. \nThat is true.\n  It is also true that earlier this year on a unanimous vote the Senate \nversion of the PATRIOT Act was approved. The House had very different \nprovisions, and when the conference between the House and the Senate \nwas concluded, they came back with PATRIOT Act provisions that could \nnot command the votes necessary to pass the PATRIOT Act. That is a \nfact. There are not sufficient votes to pass the version of the PATRIOT \nAct that came back from the conference between the House and the \nSenate, and on a bipartisan basis--there were those who supported that \nversion of the PATRIOT Act and on a bipartisan basis there were votes \nagainst that version of the PATRIOT Act. So let's be very clear.\n  Now we may face a circumstance in which the PATRIOT Act would fail, \nwould not be extended. It is still alive today. It is alive until the \n31st of this month, so all the talk that we killed the PATRIOT Act--no, \nthe PATRIOT Act has not been killed. The PATRIOT Act is still in force. \nIf we cannot reach agreement on something to make permanent, for \ngoodness sake, in the Nation's security interest we should be able to \nagree on a time of extension.\n  The Senator from Michigan has offered 3 months. The Senator from New \nYork, Senator Schumer, earlier offered 3 months. The Senator from New \nHampshire has talked about a year. I don't know which is exactly right. \nI frankly think 3 months may be too little; I think a year may be too \nlong because we do want to keep pressuring our colleagues to actually \nreach agreement on something that might be more long lasting. But the \none thing on which we should all agree, since every single one of us \nvoted on the PATRIOT Act provisions that passed the Senate back in \nJuly--the one thing on which we should absolutely be able to agree is \nwe do not allow the PATRIOT Act to lapse. That is one thing in this \nChamber, deeply divided, that we certainly should be able to agree on. \nI hope before this week is ended we have found a way to extend the \nPATRIOT Act for some amount of time.\n  Let's be clear. There are not the votes sufficient to pass the \nversion of the PATRIOT Act that came back from the House. That is \nclear. It is also clear that earlier this year this body, on a \nunanimous vote, approved the Senate version of the PATRIOT Act and that \nevery single Member of this body now wants some version of the PATRIOT \nAct to go forward. The details have not yet been agreed to. So there is \nan opportunity in these final hours to either get the PATRIOT Act in a \nfashion that can command sufficient votes to pass or that we extend the \nPATRIOT Act for some period of time so this Nation remains protected.\n\n  I hope very much the cooler heads are going to prevail here and that \nwe are going to find a way to keep the PATRIOT Act in force--modified, \nto be certain; that is what happens in the legislative process. None of \nus quite gets all he wants. But we should not be in a circumstance in \nwhich it is allowed to lapse completely.\n  With that, Senator Stevens is waiting to speak. We are ready to turn \nto the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am sure it will come to no one's \nsurprise that I desire to use this time to discuss the appropriations \nbill, the Defense appropriations bill that is before the Senate in the \nform of a conference report.\n  Over the night I have been thinking--as a matter of fact, too many \nnights I have been thinking about this conference report. As I thought \nabout it, I thought about some of the comments that have been made that \nthis is something new; that people should not put--\n\n[[Page S14090]]\n\nI should not put a nongermane portion into this conference report \nbecause it is a violation of the rules.\n  I remember the times we discussed Senator Byrd's steel loan \nguarantees or the mountaintop mining problem. I remember Senator Conrad \ncoming to me in a conference report dealing with the great problems of \ndisaster funding in South Dakota and the Devils Lake issue. I remember \nSenator Dorgan on that one, too. I remember Senator Harkin coming to me \nand asking me to deal with the multibillion-dollar environmental \nprogram and agriculture authorization program in an appropriations \nbill. I remember Senators Jeffords, Kohl, and Leahy asking me to deal \nwith the Northeast dairy compact. I remember Senator Bill Nelson \ntelling me about the terrible problems of the shuttle disaster and \nensuring key operations at the Kennedy Space Center.\n  For Northeast Senators on LIHEAP, in this bill, at my urging, there \nis a provision for $2 billion as emergency funds for LIHEAP. The House \nwas further reluctant to agree to that until we worked out the funding \nmechanisms for repayment of that money on an emergency basis when the \nfunds come in from the sale of spectrum.\n  Similarly, it went to the Budget Committee. They agreed that the \nestimate in the bill for ANWR of $2.5 billion for revenues from bidding \nwas low and they, in fact, have agreed that there will be approximately \n$5 billion coming in.\n  But they can't, under the procedures, change the estimate under the \nBudget Act.\n  In this bill, we have allocated that money to repay emergency funding \nfor other programs, emergency funding that the House would not agree to \nbefore including the $1.1 billion for homeland security.\n  Some people say to me: What you are doing is dragging this in front \nof people. You want them to vote with you. I haven't talked to anyone \nin connection with what I have done in this bill and said I will do \nthis if you will vote for this bill. I have done it because I believe \nthose things are right to do. If the Senate believes they are right to \ndo, they are going to vote for cloture on the conference report. If \nthey want to send it back to the House, they will vote against the \ncloture on the conference report or they will vote in favor of a point \nof order against the conference report. And then it goes back to the \nHouse, the House has to reconstitute itself, and we have to appoint new \nconferees.\n  The House has sent word this morning to forget about that. They heard \nwhat I said, and they said we will ask for a continuing resolution for \nthe Defense Department appropriations until we all come back. Our \npeople have gone home for Christmas, they say. I don't know whether \nthey will.\n  But all I know is we are at a crucial juncture of a series of things, \nand one of them is, in fact, the subject I have dealt with now for 25 \nyears since Senator Jackson and Senator Tsongas came to me and said \nstop the filibuster against the bill called ANILCA in 1980. President \nClinton wanted it very much. And they said we will set aside 1.5 \nmillion acres of the Arctic as you have requested, and it will be open \nto oil and gas development until that process is finished. It will not \nbecame part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge until that is over.\n  For 25 years now, I have tried to get that commitment fulfilled. We \npassed a bill and Clinton vetoed it. We have had it before several \nSenate sessions, and it has always been filibustered on the other side. \nThis year, we are successful in getting it in the reconciliation bill, \nwhich is the bill before the Senate right now, at urging of a \nbipartisan group in the House. They urged me to allow them to defeat \nthat so there would be easy passage for this bill over there. It was \npassed very quickly, and it is before us now. They said put the \namendment on the Defense appropriations bill and we will help you get \nit passed in the House. They did that. An overwhelming majority voted \nfor it.\n  Now we hear all sorts of things--I am getting tired of being accused \nof so many things--outrageous, cantankerous Senator who is responsible \nfor the bridges. I wasn't responsible for the bridges. They arose in \nthe House. But I did defend them here in the Senate.\n  As a practical matter, history is behind us now, and we have before \nus a bill which is the Defense bill.\n  I have managed this bill, or the Senator from Hawaii has managed this \nbill, since 1981. I don't think there are any two Senators who know any \nmore about funding for the Department of Defense than the two of us. We \npride ourselves in doing a good job, and we have done the best possible \njob we can now. We have I think two of the best staff directors in the \nSenate. Sid Ashworth sits beside me now and Charles Houy is always \nbeside Senator Inouye.\n  We have a bill before the Senate now and a conference report that \nprovides $446.7 billion to the Department of Defense. It has a $50 \nbillion contingency for Defense. It is a conference report which should \nbe voted on.\n  I hear some people say they are going to oppose cloture on the \nconference report. I can't imagine anyone voting against cloture on a \nconference report for Defense. You can argue about some of the \namendments that were attached to it. That is fine. They can be voted on \nindividually by points of order. But the conference report on Defense \nis for the troops. The conference report on Defense really goes far \nbeyond the amendments that are on this bill.\n  Those who vote against this conference report must know that what \nthey are doing is they are setting up a delay in the process of getting \nmoney to the troops.\n  I have argued since July that this bill should not be delayed. I am \nnot responsible for the delay. What I am responsible for now, since \nthis the last bill, is attaching three important amendments to it.\n  One deals with Avian flu. That issue was raised by Senator Harkin. \nWhen I managed the bill on the floor, I first said that is extraneous, \nand we shouldn't put it in the bill. The more I thought about it, I \nwent to him and said: You are right. Let us take this to conference and \nsee what we can do.\n  We took it to conference and what resulted was not only money for \navian flu, but the money for avian flu was approximately the same as \nSenator Harkin sought.\n  But we have added liability compensation provisions to it. This is a \nstronger amendment now than Senator Harkin asked me to add to the bill.\n  I ask: Are we going to vote against getting ready for the pandemic? \nIf this bill falls, we will go back into conference. But a point of \norder against this bill under rule XXVIII, as I understand it--I will \nexplain that in a minute--will take all of those, and it is a matter \nfor the Senate to decide.\n  If a rule XXVIII point of order is raised against the conference \nreport, the conference report in its entirety collapses. Rule XXVIII \ndoes not act similar to the Byrd rule and the offending provisions are \ntaken out of the bill. A brandnew conference will have to be convened \nand new conferees will have to be appointed by each House. When the \nconference convenes, the conferees have to be circumspect about \nincluding any matter not committed to the bill by each bill from the \nHouse.\n  In other words, we will go back and be in conference, and we will \ncome back and still be right where we are now. The items for the avian \nflu would be added. It may be that ANWR would be deleted.\n  I have to tell you, if we are going to a new conference, I am going \nto argue to put it back in. It should be there, and the votes in the \nconference are there to put it back in.\n  We are going to face up to ANWR either now, or Christmas Day, or New \nYear's Eve, or sometime--however long we stay in. We are going to face \nthe question of should we keep the commitment made by Senator Jackson \nand Senator Tsongas.\n  This bill goes beyond, though, in terms of the subject matter that \nshould be discussed.\n  We have to realize that ANWR is germane to the bill. Nothing is more \ngermane and essential to national defense than energy. Our Department \nof Defense consumes 110 to 112 million barrels of oil. I have a chart \nconcerning that. That is the consumption of Department of Defense.\n  The consumption during this global war on terror has risen to 133 \nmillion barrels of oil. This is a 20-percent increase in demand due to \nthe general war on terror.\n  ANWR supports national security because it unquestionably will \nincrease the national supply.\n\n[[Page S14091]]\n\n  So when you vote on the question of whether this is beyond the scope, \nsure it was not in either bill, but is it germane?\n  Is it part of national defense? Listen to what Senator Jackson said \nat the time we debated the oil pipeline amendment, which Senators will \nremember was passed by one vote when the Vice President of the United \nStates broke the tie.\n  In almost every issue I have been involved in since I have been here \nabout Alaska, it has been a narrow vote. Why? Because extreme \nenvironmentalists think it is their playground, that they should set \nthe policies for Alaska.\n  Here is what Senator Jackson said as chairman of the Energy \nCommittee. This involves national security. It is a national security \nissue. He said this:\n  It involves national security. There is no serious question today \nthat it is urgently in the national interest to start North Slope oil \nflowing to markets. Today we have a pipeline. I ask unanimous consent \nthis report be printed in the Record following my remarks. It is titled \n``Prudhoe Decline Highlights U.S. Oil Dependence.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1)\n  Mr. STEVENS. It shows Alaska's oil has decreased. Here are the \nfigures. At one time we went up to 1.885 million. We actually have an \nultimate capacity of 2.1 million. There were some surges where we \ntransported more than 2 million barrels a day. Its design capacity is \nmore than 2 million barrels a day. Now, throughput is 935,000. I was \ninformed recently that the amount going through at this time, the \naverage production, is down to 381,000. We have a pipeline designed to \ncarry 2 million barrels of oil and it is running at a little over 30 \npercent throughput.\n  Where is the oil to come from? ANWR. It should have come from ANWR. \nIf President Clinton had not vetoed our bill in 1995, it would be \ncoming through now.\n  I urge my colleagues to think about what ANWR means and why we are \nhere. We are here because every time we have been here, we have been \nfrustrated by filibuster. Is it unethical to try to find a way around a \nfilibuster, to try and find a way so we can fulfill our constitutional \nright--that is, to have an issue decided by a majority vote? All I am \nasking is to have an issue decided by majority vote.\n  Cloture is a creature of the Senate. The concept of unlimited debate \nis a creature of the Senate. I abide by it. I believe in it. However, \nwe also have the process to curb that; that is, to have cloture on a \nbill. Now it is cloture on a Defense bill. I don't ever recall having \nto get cloture on a Defense appropriations bill.\n  As I said, in the 1973 timeframe when we had the Alaska oil pipeline \nbuilt, a most controversial bill at that time, there was not one \nSenator who suggested a filibuster. We all knew oil was a matter of \nnational security. It was agreed it would be an up-or-down vote. As a \nmatter of fact, we had two votes. We had the first vote, and because \none person was off the floor, we then had a second vote. That person \ncame back to the Senate. He was standing right outside the door. When \nhe voted, it created a tie. The Vice President then broke the tie.\n  We are at the point now where we should recognize what we have done \nis to finally have found a way to get a vote on the basic issue in the \nSenate in a way that will take the bill to the President. It is a DOD \nbill. It is a bill the President will sign, I am certain. But keep in \nmind what else is in this bill.\n  Before I get to that, I have to remember my good friend Judge James \nBuckley. I said before in the Senate, he was one of the first ones to \noppose drilling in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge. In January of this year \nhe sent me a letter, unsolicited. He says this in the final paragraph:\n\n       Having visited the Arctic on nine occasions over the past \n     13 years (including a recent camping trip to Alaska's North \n     Slope), I don't think I can be accused of being insensitive \n     to the charms of the Arctic qua Arctic. I just don't see any \n     threat to the values I cherish.\n\n  He changed his mind. He said, do your best to get it drilled.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have his letter printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2)\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, beyond that, we have a series of problems \nI would like to mention in closing. Then I will be back. That is the \nquestion of the point of order.\n  In 1996, we overturned a point of order on the aviation bill. It was \na question of the FAA conference report, conference on the FAA. Senator \nHollings, my great friend, Fritz Hollings, offered an amendment to that \nbill. The Chair ruled that Senator Hollings' amendment exceeded the \nscope of the conference. The Senate voted 56 to 39 to overturn the \nruling of the Chair. I was part of that debate and in support of \nSenator Hollings. There are still in the Senate a series of people who \nvoted to overturn that Chair. Senator Chafee's father, the former \nSenator Chafee did, Senator Conrad did, Senator DeWine did, Senator \nDomenici did, Senator Feinstein did. We have a whole series of people. \nMy great friend, brother, Senator Inouye did, Senator Jeffords did. We \nhave a series of Members who did. Senator McConnell did. Senator \nPryor's father did. Senator Reid did. So did several other Members here \ntoday.\n  I am making the point it is not something new to ask the ruling of \nthe Chair be disagreed with. We seek to settle the disagreement over \nwhether the amendments are within the scope--they technically are \nbeyond the scope--but should the scope be adhered to in the \ncircumstances today? Should they be adhered to for avian flu? Is there \nany Senator who wants to protest against that? Should they be adhered \nto on Katrina? Sure, if there is advance appropriations on Katrina, I \nfound ways to advance moneys to the people in those disaster areas and \nrepay them with future income.\n\n  The House of Representatives has approved that. The Committee on the \nBudget says if you make the assumptions I make, it is a fair way to do \nthings. No, they did not say ``fair way'' but a way to do things.\n  When you look at it right now, the issue comes down to my amendment \nand that is ANWR. ANWR, to me, is the most significant thing we can do \ntoday because we are down now to importing almost 60 percent of our \noil. No matter what anyone says, that is an enormous burden on our \neconomy. It is such a great burden that the scope of it has to be \ndetailed in order to find the solutions for the problems we face.\n  Remember, in defense now, 7 of the 10 suppliers of this country for \npetroleum for defense are not U.S. suppliers. Did you know that? Of the \n10 suppliers of petroleum to defense, 7 are foreign countries. Twenty \npercent of the petroleum the DOD purchases comes from Middle East \ncountries that embargoed our oil in the past.\n  We are dealing with a matter of security to increase our domestic \nsupply. Our State not only produces oil, we refine in Alaska a \nconsiderable amount of the jet fuel used by our military. A \nconsiderable portion of our military comes to Alaska each year: 52 \nmillion gallons in Elmendorf, 21 million gallons in Eielson, 3.5 \nmillion gallons for Coast Guard, 76.5 million gallons in terms of our \ntotal purchases from our refined oil.\n  I do believe we have more than doubled our energy imports since 1969 \nand we are exporting now approximately half a billion a day for foreign \noil. If that money were spent in the United States--we only spent $1 \nbillion of it in the United States--it would produce 12,500 jobs. In \n2003, we outsourced 1.3 million jobs by importing oil rather than \nproducing it in the United States.\n  In the area where the distinguished occupant of the Chair comes from, \nLouisiana produces a substantial portion of this oil, but many of the \nfacilities down there have been damaged or are in need of repair.\n  We should be doing everything we can to diversify the sources of our \nenergy supplies. By developing the coastal plain, we will create \nbetween 700,000 and 1 million jobs. We will put $60 million back into \nthe economy each day, money that will be paid to U.S. employees and \npaid to the United States, which will increase the flow of taxes into \nour Treasury.\n  I apologize for being slightly tired and sort of disconnected in \nterms of how I deal with this process, but I summarize by this: We have \ndisaster assistance, we have home energy assistance, LIHEAP, we have \ninteroperable equipment for the first responders, we have\n\n[[Page S14092]]\n\nemergency preparedness for the cities and the States, we have border \nsecurity, 1.1 billion of real money, 1996 money. There is no other \nmoney available for 2006. It includes money for infrastructure and \nborder assistance. And we also have money for agricultural assistance.\n\n  The amendment of the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Cochran, really does a tremendous job in meeting some of the \ndisaster needs beyond those which will be met by my amendment.\n  I will have more to say later. But, Mr. President, I urge the Senate \nto think. We can either pass this bill soon and do our job and fulfill \nthe demands and desires of millions of people, or we can pull this bill \ndown, the conference report down, and ask the House to reconstitute \nanother committee, a conference committee, and go back into the \nconference committee with approximately the same conferees and try to \nreach a different result.\n  I, frankly, do not see there would be much difference. As a matter of \nfact, if I am a member of that conference committee, it will produce \nthe same result. So face up to the issue now and decide whether you \nwant to provide for energy independence in the future, whether you want \nto provide for LIHEAP, for disaster, for first responders, for border \nsecurity, or whether you just want to continue debating ANWR.\n  Thank you very much.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             Prudhoe Decline Highlights U.S. Oil Dependence\n\n                         (By Tarek El-Tablawy)\n\n       New York.--Alaska North Slope crude oil production, once \n     heralded as a domestic mother lode, has hit a new output \n     low--embodying the precarious balance confronting the United \n     States as it struggles for energy security in an era of \n     volatility in the international oil market.\n       The decline in Alaska is led by a slump in output from the \n     once-mammoth Prudhoe Bay field, which has been producing \n     since 1969. At its height in fiscal 1988, the field produced \n     an average of 1.6 million barrels per day. In fiscal 2005, it \n     was down to 381,000 barrels per day. Overall production in \n     the North Slope has dropped to an average of 916,000 barrels \n     per day from 2.01 million barrels in the same period.\n       In Alaska, re-boosting output is as much dictated by \n     politics as it is by geology.\n       While the Bush administration has pushed for opening a \n     pristine Alaskan refuge believed to hold about 10 billion \n     barrels of recoverable crude oil, environmentalists argue \n     such a move would only temporarily delay the inevitable while \n     ruining the delicate arctic habitat.\n       For Alaskans, Prudhoe's decline in particular, and the \n     North Slope's in general, transcends politics and raises \n     fiscal and emotional issues. Each year, state residents \n     receive a substantial dividend from an investment account \n     built over the year by a portion of oil tax revenues.\n       Those dividends, based on market investment performance, \n     have ranged from a record $1,964 per resident in 2000 to $845 \n     in 2005. But dividends are estimated to rise over the next \n     decade, as returns on investments take the place of declining \n     oil royalties and taxes that go into the fund.\n       ``The word I would use is concern,'' said Michael Williams, \n     the Alaska Department of Revenue's chief economist. North \n     Slope crude ``represents a substantial portion of income for \n     the state. The issue is: What's going to happen when it goes \n     very low, or runs out?''\n       State officials are negotiating with three major oil \n     producers to build a North Slope natural gas pipeline to \n     markets in the Midwest they hope will compensate for losses \n     from the decline in oil. State officials say oil is expected \n     to account for at least 74 percent of Alaska's unrestricted \n     general purpose revenue through 2013.\n       The history of Prudhoe, and the several fields discovered \n     later that once helped buoy the state's oil daily production \n     to over 2 million barrels, offers a window into the dichotomy \n     of the energy security debate in the United States as oil \n     prices hover tenaciously around $60 per barrel.\n       The fall in the North Slope comes even with the startup of \n     the Northstar and Alpine fields which, with a combined \n     projected output of over 200,000 barrels per day, many hoped \n     would partially offset the decline in Prudhoe Bay.\n       Prudhoe ``was one of the last great fields in America,'' \n     said Bill Samuelson, an analyst with the Houston-based \n     consultancy, Purvin & Gertz.\n       ``When you have such a large field that is declining so \n     steeply, it's hard to offset that decline,'' he said. ``It's \n     inevitable.''\n       Projections for new fields slated to come on-stream over \n     the next 10 years are expected to do little but temporarily \n     offset the steady decline. North Slope output, according to \n     the state, is projected to drop to about 833,000 barrels per \n     day by 2015, with 50 percent of that production coming from \n     new fields.\n       Inevitability is an immediate issue across the country. \n     U.S. domestic crude production, currently estimated at 5.4 \n     million barrels per day, is slated to peak at 5.9 million \n     barrels per day in 2014 before starting a steady decline to \n     an estimated 4.99 million barrels in 2025, according to the \n     Annual Energy Outlook, 2006, issued Monday by the Department \n     of Energy's Energy Information Administration.\n       High crude prices have allowed small producers to restart \n     ``stripper wells''--fields that were otherwise economically \n     unfeasible because of recovery costs and minuscule reservoir \n     pools. Such activity has increased in states like Kansas and \n     Kentucky.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     Sharon, CT, January 24, 2005.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ted: Twenty-six years ago, after leaving the Senate, I \n     was a lead signatory in full-page ads opposing oil \n     exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve that \n     appeared in the New York Times and the Washington Post. I \n     opposed it because, based on the information then available, \n     I believed that it would threaten the survival of the \n     Porcupine caribou herd and leave huge, long-lasting scars on \n     fragile Arctic lands. Since then, caribou populations in the \n     areas of Prudhoe Bay and the Alaskan pipeline have increased, \n     which demonstrates that the Porcupine herd would not be \n     threatened, and new regulations limiting activities to the \n     winter months and mandating the use of ice roads and \n     directional drilling have vastly reduced the impact of oil \n     operations on the Arctic landscape.\n       In light of the above, I have revised my views and now urge \n     approval of oil development in the 1002 Study Area for the \n     following reasons:\n       1. With proper management, I don't see that any significant \n     damage to arctic wildlife would result, and none that \n     wouldn't rapidly be repaired once operation ceased.\n       2. While I don't buy the oil companies' claim that only \n     2,000 acres would be affected, even if all of the 1.5 \n     million-acre Study Area were to lose its pristine quality (it \n     wouldn't), that would still leave 18.1 million acres of the \n     ANWR untouched plus another five million acres in two \n     adjoining Canadian wildlife refuges, or an area about equal \n     to that of the States of Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, \n     and New Hampshire combined. In other words, it is simply \n     preposterous to claim that oil development in the Study Area \n     would ``destroy'' the critical values that ANWR is intended \n     to serve.\n       3. In light of the above, it is economic and (to a much \n     lesser degree) strategic masochism to deny ourselves access \n     to what could prove our largest source of a vital resource.\n       Having visited the Arctic on nine occasions over the past \n     13 years (including a recent camping trip on Alaska's North \n     Slope), I don't think I can be accused of being insensitive \n     to the charms of the Arctic qua Arctic. I just don't see the \n     threat to values I cherish.\n       With best regards,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 James L. Buckley.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we do not have a formal agreement but an \ninformal agreement. We would go to Senator Murkowski for her remarks.\n  Can the Senator give us an idea, roughly, how long she might proceed?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, just approximately 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Fifteen minutes. All right. Then on our side, it would be \nSenator Harkin for approximately 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Then we come back to Senator Coburn.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think we have some others in between to fill out the \ntime. I think Senator Coburn is not until 2:15, so we have some others \nto fill in so we use the time as efficiently as we can during the \nperiod.\n  With that, I think, Mr. President, the next person to be recognized \nwould be Senator Murkowski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge the comments of my colleague and \nmy friend, the senior Senator from Alaska, giving us some of the \nhistorical perspective about some of the process we have seen in the \nSenate.\n  As we take up the issue of the Defense appropriations bill and as it \ncontains within it the issue of energy exploration in the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge, it is fair to say there has been a hue and \ncry of ``This can't be done. We can't have this included in it,'' and \nalmost a sense of outrage that such a controversial issue would be \ninserted in a bill that truly our troops, our national security depends \non.\n  We know this is not a new issue in the Senate. This is not a new \nissue in the Congress. The Alaska delegation has been fighting this \nissue for just about three decades now. Senator Stevens has indicated \nthat for 25 years he\n\n[[Page S14093]]\n\nhas been working on this issue. My father, who held this office before \nme, spent the 22 years of his career working to advance ANWR; trying to \nget our colleagues here in the Senate to understand the issue and to \nmove it through the process, to convince the Congress of the merits of \nopening the Coastal Plain to environmentally sensitive energy \ndevelopment. We have debated this issue so many times on this floor, I \nhave some of my colleagues saying: Can't we just pass ANWR so we don't \nhave to keep hearing this debate year after year after year? And we \nhave been successful, twice here on the Senate side and numerous times \non the House side, where the measure has moved through. We were \nsuccessful in moving the ANWR provision through the Congress, both \nHouses, in 1995, only to have President Clinton veto it, and we were \nsuccessful just several months ago in passing the ANWR measure through \non the reconciliation bill. So this is not new debate. This should not \ncome as a surprise that this is a priority, not just for the Alaska \nSenators, but a priority for the Congress, a priority for this country.\n  Senator Stevens spoke to the issue of national security and how ANWR \ncan assist us in that.\n  When we talk about the ``whys,'' why we should open ANWR to limited \nexploration and development, what we are talking about with ANWR is not \nan insignificant quantity of oil. It is not the ``drop in the bucket'' \nthat some people suggest. It is not the ``mere months of supply'' that \nsome people suggest. At predicted prices, at what we are seeing today, \nwe recognize that the expectation out of ANWR is between about 6 \nbillion barrels of oil and 14.65 billion barrels of oil. So the mean \nfigure that we use, a conservative figure, is about 10 billion barrels \nof oil for this country. This is by far the largest known source of \ndomestic onshore oil in this country today. The estimates lead us to \nmake the statement that we believe that the ANWR field, or oil find, \ncould rival that of Prudhoe Bay, which has been supplying this country \nwith about 20 percent of our domestic needs for about the past 25 \nyears.\n  Now, when we recognize what high oil prices are doing to this country \nin terms of the health of our economy, in terms of our ability to \ntravel. Face it, the energy costs this country are facing are a burden \non hard-working Americans. And what is the expectation? Do we expect \nthe price of oil is going to be dropping? Right now, we are looking at \nfuture prices in the area of $60-a-barrel oil. The Energy Information \nAdministration, EIA, 2006 forecast has predicted the price of oil is \ngoing to remain between $50 and $55 a barrel for the next couple \ndecades. We have to recognize that everything we can do to bring down \nthat cost of oil through increased production domestically is going to \nhelp us.\n  We have always talked about the jobs, the jobs aspect that ANWR will \nhelp bring about. It will bring about hundreds of thousands of jobs, \nnot just in my State of Alaska, but all around the country.\n  And as we talk about these issues we must remember the deficit we \nface as a nation and the balance of payments deficit that we face. This \nespecially is where ANWR development can make a dramatic improvement in \nreducing our balance of payments deficit. If we are at peak production \nwith ANWR, anticipating 1 million barrels a day, this will reduce our \ncountry's balance of payment deficit by just about $20 billion \nannually. This is significant, folks. This oil is coming from the \nUnited States. This is domestic production.\n  Now, the big debate today, of course, is the fact that this \nprovision, the ANWR provision, has been included in the Defense \nappropriations bill. Is this the perfect place for this? Well, when we \nstarted several months back, at the beginning of the year, it was not \nin this bill. It was in the reconciliation bill. We took criticism, \ngreat criticism, at the time for inserting it in that legislation as \nwell. But let's talk about why it makes sense, why it is not illogical \nto place the ANWR provision in the Department of Defense appropriations \nbill.\n  My colleague from Alaska made mention that there is a great tie-in \nbetween ANWR and our national security and meeting the needs of our \nmilitary.\n  We have direct benefit through increased domestic oil production \nbecause we help our military to strengthen our national security by \nbecoming less reliant on foreign sources. Sufficient reliable energy \nsupplies are vital to our military. That is absolutely the bottom line. \nConsider that it takes eight times more oil today to meet the needs of \nthe average soldier than it did decades ago during World War II. Our \nmilitary today consumes on average about 4 percent of the oil we as a \nnation consume daily about 800,000 barrels per day. This is a reality. \nThis is what we are dealing with.\n  Right now, the military accounts for about 80 percent of all the oil \nthat our Government consumes daily. So when we look at what we can \nanticipate from ANWR--about a million barrels a day at peak \nproduction--that development will help us to fully meet our military's \ntotal fuel needs. This fact alone makes ANWR a worthy candidate for \ninclusion in the Defense appropriations bill.\n  Really what we need to be focused on is what ANWR does for us, how it \nhelps facilitate our energy security and, in turn, our national \nsecurity. Opening ANWR offers America the best chance for finding a \nsecure supply of oil that helps to reduce our dependence on OPEC, on \nother nations; and it does this for decades.\n  You all heard that we are 58 percent dependent today as a nation on \nforeign sources of oil. We are expected to pass the two-thirds mark \nwithin about 20 years. When you put that into perspective and you \nrecognize that such a quantity of our energy--more than half of our \nenergy comes from elsewhere--particularly from OPEC or unstable Mideast \nregimes, that we have a vulnerability. Think back to some of the \nstatements made earlier this year coming out of Venezuela, one of our \nleading sources of imported oil. Again, this should remind us that we \nneed to do all that we can responsibly do to increase our domestic \nenergy production. Look at the world picture--what is happening with \nChina and India and a host of developing nations and their need for \nsupplies of oil. That makes it all the more important to make sure we \nare doing what we can at home.\n  So we need to increase our energy independence, but we also need to \ndo it in balance with our environment and diversifying energy supplies. \nI wish to talk about the environmental perspective for a minute because \nthis is important. We just cannot develop for development's sake \nwithout a corresponding obligation to balance our environmental needs \nand requirements. But this bill containing the ANWR provision actually \nlets us address the environmental issues that have been raised about \nANWR for years.\n  When the reconciliation bill was going through, because of procedural \nissues--notably the Byrd rule--we were not able to include, for \ninstance, all the environmental safeguards in that that we might have \nliked. It could plain and simply only open ANWR. But contained within \nthis Defense appropriations bill are the environmental safeguards, the \nprovisions that we have been discussing for decades. It also has \nprovisions that will require the best technology. We are talking about \ndirectional drilling to limit the surface disruption. It requires \nindustry to maintain winter exploration drilling schedules, a technique \nof using ice roads so the wildlife isn't disturbed. The tundra remains \nprotected. It includes the provision that we voted on not too terribly \nlong ago that would limit ANWR oil from export, from going outside this \ncountry. There is an export ban that would be in place contained within \nthis legislation.\n  For Alaska Natives, it finally allows them to develop their lands as \nlong as the total disruption doesn't exceed 2,000 acres of the surface \nof the coastal plain. That is another point that needs to be made. We \nare not talking about disturbing the surface of the entire 1.5 million \nacres of Coastal Plain; we are asking for permission to explore and \ndrill in the entire plain, but not to impact more than 2,000 acres in \nthe process. For some in rural areas, that is the size of a small farm. \nFor some in urban centers, this is size of your airports. That is what \nwe are talking about. This bill allows us to place this language in it.\n  There was mention in the Washington Post this morning that somehow or \nother the language contained in the bill allows for an even greater \narea\n\n[[Page S14094]]\n\nto be opened for oil exploration and development. That is not the case. \nThe case is that the 2,000-acre limitation covers both federal and \nNative and state lands. What it does allow for is for Alaskan Natives \nwho live up there to have the ability to gain their final land \nselections, but any development from those lands are subject to the \n2,000-acre limitation. It is a 2,000-acre limitation in total.\n  We also require the Department of the Interior to consult with the \nNatives so that their local knowledge is considered to reduce the \nimpact on the environment and their subsistence lifestyles. We have the \nsupport of those Natives who live there, work there, and send their \nchildren to school there, who want to see good infrastructure in terms \nof health facilities and schools. They support opening ANWR, but they \nwant to do it in a responsible manner and in consultation, so that they \nknow their voices are heard. We have put language in this bill that \nspeaks directly to those wishes.\n  We have also included a provision that provides for local impact aid \nfor any of the communities that may be subject to oil development \nimpacts. These include the Inupiat of the North Slope, the Gwich'in \nsouth of the Brooks Range, and the municipalities and Native \nCorporation lands that border the Trans-Alaska Pipeline corridor.\n  And we included language that encourages project labor agreement \ntalks and local hire provisions.\n  So we have been able in this legislation to take the concerns of some \nof our friends and colleagues who have been working with us--our \nfriends from Hawaii wanted to make sure we had Native consultation \nprovisions included. We have been able to add that in this Defense \nappropriations bill along with the environmental provisions that have \nbeen discussed for decades, ensuring that when we move forward with \nopening ANWR to responsible oil exploration and development, we have \nall of these provisions in place. This is key to us in the Senate, and \nit is certainly key to the Alaskans whom I represent, and most \ncertainly to those who live and work on the Coastal Plain.\n  Now, I have to comment very quickly about a remark that was made \nyesterday by my colleague from Washington. In her argument against \nopening ANWR, she talked about ``toxic'' spills on the North Slope, and \nessentially argued that Alaskans are not being responsible somehow with \nour oil development. That does require a response.\n  Opponents have claimed there have been a high number of spills. But \nthey fail to mention that the companies who operate on Alaska's North \nSlope have to report spills of most any substance that is more than a \ngallon in size, whether it is pure water, salt water, oil, or \nchemicals; whatever it is, it has to be reported if it is over a gallon \nin size.\n  According to the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, \nthere has been an average of 263 spills on the North Slope yearly, \nseven times less than in the rest of the state yearly. The average oil \nspill, however, was just 89 gallons--that is about 2 barrels of oil--\nand 94 percent of that was totally cleaned up. Most spills are of water \nused in making ice roads.\n  According to the National Academy of Sciences's 2003 study, if you \nlook at all the spills from 1977 through 1999, 84 percent of all those \nspills were less than 2 barrels in size. Only 454 barrels of oil per \nyear have been released into the environment, compared to the 378,000 \nbarrels of oil that enter North American waters yearly as a result of \nurban runoff, the drips we see at filling stations and other spills. \nThat may be less oil than enters the Alaska environment naturally \nbecause of the oil seeps that come up from under the ground on the \nNorth Slope.\n  I wanted to take a second to correct the record on other point.\n  Senator Stevens spoke in his comments previously about how including \nANWR in the Defense appropriations bill not only helps Alaskans in \ngetting the pipeline from a status of half full, or less than half \nfull, to full; but it is also important to point out how adding ANWR to \nthe Defense bill is going to help Americans overall.\n  I have mentioned national security. I have mentioned the jobs. I have \nmentioned the economic security and the reduction in the overall trade \ndeficit.\n  What we will also be able to do as a result of the ANWR proceeds and \nthe revenues that will come forth is to aid Americans who have been \nimpacted by the disaster on the Gulf Coast. The bill also allocates 5 \npercent of the revenues to go to fund increases in money for the \nprogram that will also help Americans with their energy costs. This is \nthe LIHEAP program, the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. We \nknow here it is getting cold, and it is going to be a colder winter as \nwe move into January and February. Americans are looking at their home \nheating bills. They are looking at their utility bills, and they are \nseeing increases of 30 to 40 percent. We are going to see natural gas \nincreases in our utility bills in excess of that.\n  This is a huge consideration for us as we try to balance our budgets \nwithin our own homes. So the ability to share with those who have been \nimpacted by Katrina, helping to provide financing, if you will, for \nGulf Coast rebuilding is a key of this bill. Under the Gulf Coast \nRecovery and Disaster Prevention and Assistance Fund about 25 percent \nof the total ANWR revenues will go into the fund--80 percent of the \nbonus and 20 percent of the longer-term royalties from ANWR production \nwill go to the Gulf Coast States to help them recover from the effects \nof Katrina, Rita, and Wilma.\n  Also, we are talking about the reduction of the Nation's budget \ndeficit over the life of the field--tens of billions of dollars to \nreduce the budget deficit will come from the proceeds from ANWR.\n  What is coming from ANWR is not something that only benefits \nAlaskans, and there have been those who have suggested that. It is not \nsomething that benefits only oil companies, and there are some who have \nmentioned that. The proceeds from ANWR and what we will be able to do \nin terms of providing for jobs, for energy security, national security, \nfunding programs such as LIHEAP, funding to the States of Louisiana, \nMississippi, Alabama, Texas, and Florida in the restoration fund, are \nsignificant; it is important, and it is appropriate that all are \nincluded in the legislation before us.\n  I, too, join my colleague, my senior Senator from Alaska, in asking \nour colleagues to end this debate once and for all, after the 25, 30 \nyears we have been debating, arguing, and talking, and allow America to \nfinally use its own resources to help our economy and protect our \nsecurity.\n  Mr. President, I have several letters and resolutions I would like \nprinted in the Record. These are a letter from the mayor and city \ncouncil of the city of Kaktovik, addressed to Members of Congress; a \nboard resolution from the Alaska Federation of Natives in support of \nopening ANWR; letters of support from unions; from the Chamber of \nCommerce; from Americans for Tax Reform; from the American Gas \nAssociation, as well as the Alliance for Energy and Economic Growth. I \nask unanimous consent they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                              City of Kaktovik, AK\n                                                    December 2005.\n       Dear Member of Congress: If ever there was an issue that \n     cried out for a fresh infusion of truth, reason and balance, \n     it is oil and gas leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge. The fact is: a vote to support oil and gas \n     exploration within the 1002 section of ANWR more than meets \n     the criteria for thoughtful, far-reaching policy-making in \n     the national interest.\n       Many of the Republican Main Street members of the House of \n     Representatives have come under intense pressure to remove \n     the provision for oil and gas leasing within ANWR from the \n     budget reconciliation bill. In most cases this pressure comes \n     from people who neither live on the Arctic Coastal Plain nor \n     have ever set foot in our community.\n       We, the people of Kaktovik, Alaska--the only people \n     directly affected by leasing on the coastal plain--\n     understanding the pressure you are under, respectfully \n     request that you consider the following important facts about \n     this issue.\n       The homelands of the Kaktovikmiut Inupiat encompass the \n     coastal plain and much of the refuge to the Continental \n     Divide. These homelands define who we are as a people, they \n     feed us and they are part of the legacy we leave for our \n     children.\n       Despite how things may appear to outsiders, this is not \n     empty country. We have lived here for millennia and will \n     continue to do so. Our collective memory, the spirits of our \n     ancestors, our place names, our dreams for the future, fill \n     this place.\n       Protection and survival of our culture depends on nurturing \n     new economic activity that allows our young people to remain \n     and thrive here in their own country.\n\n[[Page S14095]]\n\n       Although the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was \n     established without our consultation or consent, we have \n     tried hard to adjust to this regime superimposed on our \n     homeland--and not without considerable hardship. But there \n     remains a critical fact: It is a matter of explicit and \n     settled Congressional policy that we retain ownership of \n     lands on the coastal plain and have been granted \n     permission to help build a viable future for our children. \n     There is an issue of fundamental fairness and of Native \n     rights to be considered here.\n       Despite much rhetoric, oil development here offers real \n     benefits to the nation as part of a responsible comprehensive \n     strategy to develop diverse energy sources to help build and \n     sustain a strong and secure economic future.\n       Most importantly to us, and to the majority of Americans, \n     these benefits will NOT sacrifice the values the refuge was \n     created to protect, in particular the wildlife and ecosystem \n     on which they depend. Claims to the contrary are simply not \n     supported by the facts.\n       We not only live in this country, we're intensely \n     protective of it. We would not have agreed to the idea of oil \n     leasing if we did not have assurances of the most rigorous \n     stipulations to protect our lands, the animals on which we \n     depend, the culture and values that guide us to the future.\n       These assurances are contained in a bipartisan bill, S. \n     1891, the Arctic Coastal Plain Domestic Energy Security Act, \n     introduced by Sens. Stevens, Murkowski, Inouye and Akaka. \n     This bill sets very high standards for the leasing process, \n     holding industry and government accountable for doing it \n     right. Key to our concerns, it gives Kaktovik an explicit \n     role in monitoring and helping shape the leasing process so \n     there is no lasting negative effect on the lands, waters and \n     wildlife of this country.\n       We have lived in respectful and intimate association with \n     this land for a very long time. We know with a sensitivity \n     and a depth of practical ecological understanding--an \n     understanding that deserves far greater recognition and \n     respect in this debate--that under our watchful eye leasing \n     on the coastal plain will be a safe, responsible undertaking.\n       You have the power to make a dramatic positive impact on \n     the security of the nation's energy supplies while protecting \n     our wildlife, our people and our cultural heritage. We \n     respectfully ask that you join with your colleagues in the \n     Senate and support the inclusion of language opening the \n     Arctic Coastal Plain as a part of the 2005 Budget \n     Reconciliation.\n           Sincerely,\n         Lon Sonsalla, Mayor; George Tagarook, City Council; Norah \n           Jane Burns, City Council; Ida Angasan, City Council; \n           Sherry Wolf, City Council; Richard Holschen, City \n           Council; Joseph Kaleak, Vice-Mayor; Phillip Tikluk, \n           Jr., President, Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation (Tribe); \n           Annie Tikluk, Board Member, Native Village of Kaktovik; \n           Adam Linn, Administrator, Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation; \n           Isaac Akootchook, President, Native Village of \n           Kaktovik.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Alaska Federation of Natives, Inc., Anchorage, AK, Board of Directors\n\n\n                         BOARD RESOLUTION 05-01\n\n       Title: Alaska Federation of Natives (AFN) Support of \n     Opening of the Alaska National Wildife Refuge (ANWR) to Oil \n     and Gas Development\n       Whereas: The delegates of the Annual Convention of Alaska \n     Federation of Natives of 1995 are on record in supporting the \n     opening of Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) for oil and \n     gas development; and,\n       Whereas: The opening of the Arctic Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) \n     to oil and gas development will bring considerable econoniic \n     benefits to the State of Alaska; and\n       Whereas: The Alaska Natives should be assured of sharing in \n     such economic benefits; and\n       Whereas: The Alaska Native Communities lack many basic \n     infrastructure and economic opportunities and energy costs \n     are extraordinary; and\n       Whereas: The Native Corporations created under the Alaska \n     Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) are charged by Congress \n     with promoting the economic and social welfare of the Alaska \n     Natives; and now therefore be it\n       Resolved by the Board of Directors of the Alaska Federation \n     of Natives, that in the consideration of the economic wealth \n     that will be generated by the development of ANWR that the \n     Alaska Federation of Natives request Alaska's Congressional \n     Delegation to pursue federal legislation that will include:\n       Federal support to fully fund the Power Cost Equalization \n     Endowment Fund;\n       Measures that ensure ANCSA corporations with an opportunity \n     to participate in the ANWR development activities;\n       Measures providing the ANCSA corporations with the \n     opportunity of ownership interests in the development of \n     ANWR; and\n       A 20 percent Alaska Native employment requirement in the \n     authorizing legislation leading to the development of ANWR; \n     and, be it further\n       Resolved that AFN also pursues legislation that will \n     include revenue sharing of two percent (2%) of federal or \n     state royalties from any oil and gas development of ANWR be \n     earmarked for the tribal governments and non-profit \n     organizations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     U.S. Chamber of Commerce,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 16, 2005.\n       To Members of the United States Senate: The U.S. Chamber of \n     Commerce, the world's largest business federation \n     representing more than three million businesses and \n     organizations of every size, sector, and region, strongly \n     supports legislation which may be considered in the coming \n     days that would authorize the much needed energy exploration \n     in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). The Chamber \n     urges you to support passage of this important legislation.\n       As one of America's greatest prospects for domestic oil \n     exploration, ANWR is conservatively estimated to contain 10.4 \n     billion barrels of recoverable crude oil. According to the \n     U.S. Energy Information Administration, ANWR would provide \n     the United States with approximately one million barrels of \n     oil each day for the next 30 years. This additional \n     production would decrease oil imports from the Persian Gulf \n     region by 40%, which would strengthen national security by \n     making the United States less dependent on oil from \n     politically unstable regions.\n       In addition, ANWR exploration makes sense because of its \n     potential to raise substantial revenues. Recently, the \n     Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released a recalculation of \n     the amount of revenue that may be generated through lease \n     sales in ANWR. Using a $50 per barrel long-term price for \n     oil, as opposed to the $25-$35 per barrel used earlier this \n     year, ANWR exploration would generate more than $10 billion \n     in revenue by 2010.\n       Important policy objectives, such as energy security and \n     fiscal responsibility, are placed at risk when substantial \n     domestic energy resources remain off limits. The provisions \n     in H. Res. 315 are an important step toward providing an \n     affordable and reliable supply of domestically-produced \n     energy.\n       The Chamber urges you to support passage of legislation \n     that would authorize much needed energy exploration in ANWR. \n     The Chamber will consider including votes on or in relation \n     to this measure in our annual ``How They Voted'' scorecard.\n           Sincerely,\n     R. Bruce Josten.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n          MEMO: UNIONS SUPPORTING RESPONSIBLE ANWR DEVELOPMENT\n\n                                                December 17, 2005.\n       Within the next few days, you will be asked to vote on \n     legislation making appropriations for the Department of \n     Defense and other vital government programs. One of these \n     important policies is the authority to develop vast oil \n     resources in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, popularly \n     known as ANWR. This is a jobs issue for our unions and our \n     members.\n       On December 7, 2005 the Congressional Budget Office wrote \n     Senator Ted Stevens and responded to the Senator's inquiry \n     that ANWR bonus bid receipts ``might total at least $10 \n     billion--roughly double CBO's official estimate.'' That means \n     it also increases the federal revenue to a total of $5 \n     billion, as the state of Alaska and the federal government \n     will share bonus bid receipts on a 50/50 basis. In the \n     Defense appropriations legislation, the conferees have \n     dedicated a significant portion of those additional revenues \n     for funding future federal disaster relief programs. As we \n     understand it, these sums will also be used as collateral for \n     immediate relief for damage caused in the Katrina, Rita and \n     Wilma disaster areas.\n       We also see all of this as an affirmation of the \n     progressive jobs policies generated by ANWR production.\n       Again, we urge you to support this legislation, because \n     ANWR will create thousands of jobs for our members for many \n     years. The bill assures ANWR work is protected by a project \n     labor agreement. You will hear strident calls from opponents \n     who claim opening ANWR will degrade the environment. We have \n     heard their arguments, discussed them and made reasonable \n     adjustments. They remain unyielding. Their baseless slogans \n     can no longer be used as impediments to creating jobs or \n     frustrating reasonable energy development.\n       When the question is called on the Defense Appropriations \n     bill, it will be framed as one of process--to invoke cloture \n     on the bill.\n       For us, process is policy.\n       The choice is clear. We can either continue to be hamstrung \n     by the exaggerations of obstructionists, or be guided by \n     policies that create jobs and assure a secure energy future.\n       Please support the Conference Report and oppose procedural \n     devices that would delay this important legislation.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n       International Union of Operating Engineers, AFL-CIO.\n       Seafarers International Union, AFL-CIO.\n       International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Change to Win \n     Federation.\n       United Association of Plumbers & Pipefitters, AFL-CIO.\n       Laborers' International Union of North America, AFL-CIO.\n       United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, \n     Change to Win Federation.\n       Building & Construction Trades Department, AFL-CIO.\n\n[[Page S14096]]\n\n                                        Americans for Tax Reforms,\n                                Washington, DC, December 12, 2005.\n     Hon. William Frist, MD,\n     Majority Leader, United States Senate.\n     Hon. J. Dennis Hastert,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives.\n       Dear Majority Leader Frist and Speaker Hastert: On behalf \n     of Americans for Tax Reform (ATR), I am writing to express \n     this organization's strong support for ensuring the Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) provision, included in the \n     Senate version of the budget reconciliation package, is \n     included in the final Senate/House conference agreement.\n       In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, it has became \n     increasingly evident that America must begin to increase its \n     own domestic oil production. Requiring more domestic energy \n     will create new jobs, lower prices, and boost the economy.\n       The ANWR provision in the Senate reconciliation package is \n     expected to raise $2.4 billion by producing more than 10.4 \n     billion barrels of oil in ANWR. Obviously, this is a win-win \n     situation as the provision will increase future energy \n     supplies, reduce American's dependence on foreign oil and \n     help lower oil prices in the future.\n       Once again, I urge you to ensure the ANWR provision is \n     included in the final Senate/House Conference Agreement of \n     the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005.\n           Onward,\n     Grover Norquist.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     American Gas Association,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 16, 2005.\n       Dear Members of Congress: On behalf of the 195 local energy \n     utility members of the American Gas Association, which \n     deliver natural gas to more than 56 million homes, businesses \n     and industries throughout the United States, I urge you to \n     support legislation that would open the Alaska Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to energy production, which \n     will be included in the FY-06 defense appropriations bill \n     scheduled to be voted on by Congress this weekend.\n       Allowing energy production in ANWR is a vital component to \n     addressing one of our nation's more urgent public policy \n     issues, namely the imbalance between energy demand and \n     available supply, and the resulting high and volatile energy \n     prices that America is experiencing. Increasing our access to \n     domestic energy supplies is critical to enhancing America's \n     energy security, sustaining America's economy and providing \n     the American consumer with relief from ever spiraling energy \n     costs.\n       AGA speaks on this matter not only as the representative of \n     natural gas utility companies, but also as a voice for their \n     customers who have been hit so hard financially because of \n     higher natural gas prices. Whether it's a homeowner \n     struggling to pay the heating bill, a small business facing \n     significantly increased energy-related business costs or an \n     industry being forced to move overseas in order to compete in \n     the global marketplace, soaring energy prices have been a \n     severe detriment to America's quality of life.\n       Thanks to new technological developments energy can now be \n     produced without undue harm to the surrounding environment. \n     Hopefully, this vote will be the beginning of a trend that \n     recognizes America's energy needs can be met with adequate \n     environmental protections.\n       Again, we urge you to support passage of legislation \n     containing the provisions to finally open ANWR.\n           Sincerely,\n     David N. Parker.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           Alliance for Energy and\n\n\n                                              Economic Growth,\n\n                                                December 16, 2005.\n       To All Members of the United States Congress: We are \n     writing to you again in strong support for legislation to \n     open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to energy \n     production, which is now being moved in the defense \n     appropriations legislation. This is an issue of both national \n     and economic security for America. Our country depends on \n     foreign sources for almost 60 percent of the oil Americans \n     consume. In a world that continues to be plagued by \n     instability in many of the oil-producing regions, this type \n     of dependency should be of concern to all of us.\n       The Alliance for Energy and Economic Growth (AEEG) is a \n     broad-based coalition whose members develop, deliver, or \n     consume energy from all sources. With more than 1,200 member \n     organizations and businesses, AEEG is seeking to build a \n     national consensus for a comprehensive U.S. energy strategy \n     that balances supply and demand, without compromising \n     environmental safeguards, so that we can fuel America's \n     dynamic economy and support our quality of life.\n       Our members believe that ANWR is one more critical part of \n     securing America's energy future. While ANWR alone can't \n     provide us with all the domestic energy we need, combined \n     with the rapid development of other domestic oil and natural \n     gas supplies ANWR would make a tremendous difference, \n     especially when coupled with greater energy efficiency, \n     conservation and diversification. In addition, we must \n     protect those Americans most at risk by supporting full \n     funding of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program \n     (LIHEAP).\n       ANWR's Coastal Plain holds the nation's greatest potential \n     for another Prudhoe Bay-size discovery. Conservative \n     estimates from both the U.S. Geological Survey and U.S. \n     Energy Information Administration peg technically recoverable \n     crude oil reserves at approximately 10 billion barrels. That \n     is enough to provide the United States with 1 million barrels \n     of oil a day for 30 years.\n       Oil production on the North Slope of Alaska is handled with \n     the greatest care possible for the environment and with the \n     least possible disturbance of wildlife. To ensure continued \n     environmental protection, House and Senate language on ANWR \n     development requires the application of the best commercially \n     available technology for oil and gas exploration, \n     development, and production.\n       Now more than ever, it is time to increase access to areas \n     containing vast domestic reserves of energy-such as ANWR. As \n     we have stated in the past, energy is the lifeblood of our \n     nation's economy. While Congress has taken a number of steps \n     over the past two years to improve the nation's energy \n     policy, we still urgently need to increase domestic supplies \n     of oil and natural gas. Our members, who represent the \n     agricultural community, manufacturers, small and large \n     businesses, labor and the energy industry, all recognize that \n     additional supplies of oil and natural gas are critical to \n     this nation's energy security and more affordable energy is \n     needed to support economic growth.\n       We urge you to support the bill and the rule (in the House) \n     that contains legislation to open ANWR.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         The Management Committee.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee.) Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand the ranking member was going \nto yield me 30 minutes of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, last week this story, ``Prayers Made to \nProtest Budget Cuts,'' appeared in the Quad-City Times in my State of \nIowa. Ollie Finn of Bettendorf said:\n\n       We're concerned about the budget cuts and that's why we're \n     having the prayer vigil. We wanted to bring awareness to the \n     community about how horrible these budget cuts are. . . .\n       The Rev. Roger Butts, pastor of the Unitarian Church of \n     Davenport, asked people to determine whether the Fiscal Year \n     2006 budget serves the common good. ``I've come simply to \n     pray with you and to stand with you for those whose voices \n     are easy to ignore,'' he said.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article from the Quad-City Times be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Prayers Made to Protest Budget Csuts\n\n                         (By Mary Louise Spear)\n\n       People representing faith and social action organizations \n     gathered together Wednesday to protest federal budget cuts \n     that will affect low-income families.\n       The group prayed together at the building that houses the \n     Social Security office in downtown Davenport. They presented \n     petitions with 438 signatures protesting the cuts to \n     representatives from U.S. Sens. Tom Harkin and Charles \n     Grassley of Iowa and U.S. Rep. Jim Nussle's offices. The \n     group also plans to present copies to U.S. Sens. Dick Durbin \n     and Barack Obama and U.S. Rep. Lane Evans, of Illinois.\n       ``We're concerned about the budget cuts and that's why \n     we're having the prayer vigil. We wanted to bring awareness \n     to the community about how horrible these budget cuts are,'' \n     said organizer Ollie Finn of Bettendorf.\n       People at the vigil represented Pax Christi, Progressive \n     Action for the Common Good, Churches United of the Quad-City \n     Area, Sisters of Humility and Carmelite order.\n       The majority in Congress are proposing $60 billion in tax \n     cuts which includes extending the capital gains and dividend \n     tax cuts through 2010 according to information from Harkin's \n     office. He opposes the cuts. Senate Republicans are also \n     looking at taking $35 billion out of entitlement programs \n     which help working Americans, he said.\n       The U.S. House of Representatives has called for $50 \n     billion in cuts to food assistance, support for children in \n     foster care, Medicaid and enforcement of child support \n     payments.\n       The Rev. Roger Butts, pastor of the Unitarian Church of \n     Davenport, asked people to determine whether the Fiscal Year \n     2006 budget serves the common good. ``I've come simply to \n     pray with you and to stand with you for those whose voices \n     are easy to ignore,'' he said.\n       ``The group is hoping legislators respond to their concerns \n     about the proposed cuts.\n       ``We are working to at least restore the additional $15 \n     billion in cuts. We feel this will have a strong effect on \n     the poor,'' said Rick Schloemer of Rapids City, Ill.\n       The Wednesday vigil coincided with members of the U.S. \n     Senate showing their support for a motion from Harkin. He \n     asked members of the joint House-Senate conference committee \n     to reject the House's proposal for food assistance cuts.\n\n[[Page S14097]]\n\n       ``The number of Americans who are food-insecure has been \n     steadily rising over the past few years, and it's critical \n     that conferees reject any attempts to scale back food \n     assistance that will make this problem even worse,'' he said.\n       Single mothers living in Humility of Mary Housing Inc. \n     transitional housing program would certainly feel the impact, \n     said Sr. Pat Miller of Humility of Mary and a board director. \n     They have 57 apartments in Davenport and about half of their \n     budget for programs and housing comes from the federal \n     government, she said. These women also depend on food stamps \n     and assistance to help with heating bills.\n       The budget cuts ``will particularly affect the poor we \n     serve,'' agreed Sr. Michelle Schiffgens of Humility of Mary. \n     ``We have many single moms with kids living in those \n     apartments and they are greatly concerned about what could \n     happen to them.''\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I know that people of faith held many \nevents in Iowa, Washington, and many other places around the country \nlast week on this very topic. Unfortunately, their prayers were not \nenough. Their prayers were not enough because yesterday we awakened to \nthe flurry of late-night activities in the House of Representatives. \nHouse Republicans waited until the middle of the night Sunday, less \nthan a week before Christmas, to order deep cuts to health care \ninitiatives and farm programs and to sneak through blanket protections \nfor the pharmaceutical industry.\n  It is not an accident these House votes occurred in the dead of \nnight. There are now only 5 days until Christmas. Throughout much of \nthe world, it is the season of giving, but here in Congress, it is the \nseason of taking away--taking away education programs, taking away job \ntraining, taking away health care from low-income families, taking away \nmoney for needed medical research, taking away from farmers and rural \ncommunities and, worst of all, taking away hope from so many. This is a \ncruel holiday surprise for many American families.\n  Why are we doing this? Not for deficit reduction, but to provide tens \nof billions of dollars in tax giveaways for the wealthiest in our \nsociety. Forty percent of the benefits in the House tax bill go to \nthose making more than $1 million a year.\n  Seventy-eight percent go to those making over $100,000 a year. Only 8 \npercent go to those making under $50,000 a year. So, again, those in \nthe bottom of the ladder get some crumbs from the table. So while the \nwealthiest in our society unwrap Christmas presents, while the \nwealthiest in our society are hanging their Christmas stockings and \ngetting thousands of dollars of tax giveaways stuffed in their \nstockings, for the poor and low income, Congress has come with a couple \nof lumps of coal for their stockings.\n  Take a look at some of the provisions I am talking about. Take the \nprovision of the child support enforcement. This is essential to \nhelping families achieve self-sufficiency. For families in poverty who \nreceive child support, those payments account for an average of about \n30 percent of their income. Next to a mother's earnings, child support \nis the largest income source for poor families receiving assistance. \nChild support payments are used to pay for food, child care, shelter, \nand the most basic essentials of life. The bill slashes funding for \nthese child support enforcement efforts.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that as a result of the \ncuts, more than $8.4 billion in delinquent payments will go uncollected \nin the coming 10 years. The biggest negative impact will be by children \nliving in poverty and low-income households. One hundred seventy-six \nthousand children benefit from child support payments in my State of \nIowa alone. In the past, President Bush himself praised the program, \ncalling it one of our highest performing social services programs, and \nhe is right. For every dollar in Government spending, $4.38 is \nrecovered for families in child support payments.\n  Since 1996, there has been an 82-percent increase in collections, \nfrom $12 billion to $22 billion. If we were smart, if we were \ncompassionate, if we were looking at ways to get the most bang for the \ntaxpayers' dollar, we would be increasing funding for the child support \nenforcement program. The bill before us cuts this program in order to \nmake way for more tax cuts for the wealthiest. It is simply \nunconscionable.\n  Let us take a look at Medicaid. I am very concerned about the cuts to \nMedicaid in this bill. I have said all along, if one wants to do \nsomething about Medicaid we ought to have a fair, honest, open debate \nabout reforming Medicaid. We should do so in a way that does no harm to \nthe beneficiaries because who are the beneficiaries of Medicaid? The \npoorest among us, poor women and children, the disabled, low-income \nelderly who need access to long-term care.\n  This bill before us today makes two changes that are permanent \nchanges. One, under this bill, States can now alter or eliminate \nservices to individuals. They can do it on their own. Secondly, the \nbill allows States to charge fees--sometimes it could be exorbitant \nfees--on many services where there were no fees before. Again, this \ncould limit access to care for so many.\n  For example, States may provide any child, even those whose families \nhave the lowest incomes, with a smaller benefit package than they have \ntoday. That means that low-income children, no matter how poor, are no \nlonger guaranteed, as they are now, vision screening; no longer \nguaranteed coverage for eyeglasses; no longer guaranteed therapy \nservices, medical equipment or any other benefit.\n  This bill would allow States to charge up to 20 percent of the cost \nof each medication that an individual gets in Medicaid. For individuals \nwho take multiple drugs, this is 20 percent for each medication, so an \nindividual who has multiple drugs or maybe an individual who needs \nexpensive medication, these provisions could, in effect, eliminate \naccess to needed medicines.\n  Keep in mind these are people who qualify for Medicaid. That means \nthey are poor, by definition. They do not have money. So now we are \ngoing to ask them to pay more for services? Now we may ask them to pay \nfor eyeglasses for their kids. Well, their kid needs eyeglasses, they \ndo not have any money, they cannot pay for it, tough. That is the way \nit was 50 years ago in our country.\n\n  I suppose they can go get charity, can they not? I forget about that. \nThat is right. I suppose they could go to their local church or their \nlocal synagogue maybe, local mosque, and maybe they will pay for all \nthe eyeglasses for all the poor kids in our country now.\n  Under the bill, medical care providers can deny medical care if the \npatient has no ability to pay the charges at the time the care is \nneeded. States can terminate coverage if the family cannot pay the \nmonthly premiums. Again, these changes were made despite a large body \nof evidence, research, and studies that determined that such cost-\nsharing increases are likely to lead many low-income Medicaid patients \nto forgo various health care services and medications or not to enroll \nin Medicaid.\n  Guess what. When they do not take their needed medications, when they \nforgo needed health services, when they do not sign up for Medicaid, \nguess where they are seen. They are in the emergency room, and we are \npaying three, four, five times as much to help them. So much for the \nhealth care safety net that we have worked so many years to provide for \nlow-income Americans.\n  Let us look at education, student loans. The reconciliation bill \nincreases the interest rates paid by the parents of students who are \ntaking out loans to help their kids. Merry Christmas; you are going to \nget higher interest payments.\n  It also creates a potential problem for the federally operated direct \nloan program. This is a direct loan program utilized by many schools. \nThe University of Iowa, UNI, Iowa State University in my State all use \nit. This bill before us says the accounting of the administrative costs \nfor the direct loan program now goes to Labor and Health and Human \nServices rather than being automatic. That means it is subject to a \ncut. This year's Labor-HHS-Education bill has been cut this year. And, \nI expect next year could be very difficult.\n  Let's look at agriculture and rural development, so important in my \nState and so many other States. I have long believed that there was \nreally no justification for making budget cuts in the area of \nagriculture and rural development programs. Commodity prices are down. \nPrices for energy and fertilizer and other goods and services\n\n[[Page S14098]]\n\nthat farmers buy are sharply higher. Rural communities are struggling \nto hold onto jobs, to survive.\n  Keep in mind, when we wrote the 2002 farm bill--I happened to be \nchairman at that time--we stayed within the budget allocation we were \ngiven. In fact, the commodity programs in that bill have cost us $14 \nbillion less than what we were allocated. That is $14 billion that we \nsaved the taxpayers of this country.\n  There were commitments made in the farm bill, but this reconciliation \nbill reneges on those commitments. In agriculture and rural programs, \nagain, the sacrifice is being imposed on those least able to bear it. \nIt is hard to understand what they have in mind for our farmers or \nrural communities.\n  Secretary Johanns and the President and others have been going around \nthe country saying the future of farm policy lies in less emphasis on \nthe traditional commodity programs and greater focus on conservation, \nrenewable energy, agricultural development, and agricultural research. \nYou cannot argue with that. It all sounds good. That is what we did in \nthe 2002 farm bill because these types of assistance are all allowed \nunder the WTO trade agreements. We put those in the farm bill. We put a \ntremendous focus on conservation in the farm bill.\n  President Bush, when he signed it, touted it and said oh, this is \nwonderful. There is a lot of good conservation. We put in for the first \ntime ever an energy title in the farm bill. It came out of the Senate, \nnot the House, with an energy title to get farmers--to get us all \nfocused on energy.\n  Rural economic development and new rural investment-type programs for \nrural development, we put in money for broadband extension to small \ncommunities all over America. Guess what they are cutting in the \nreconciliation bill: conservation, renewable energy, rural economic \ndevelopment, agricultural research--all being cut. Conservation suffers \nthe largest funding cuts of all, and the Conservation Security Program \nis hit the worst. The Conservation Security Program is a voluntary \nprogram of incentive payments for farm and ranch conservation \npractices, exactly the kind of program that Secretary Johannes and the \nadministration are talking about as they go around the country. Yet the \nConservation Security Program is virtually demolished in the bill \nbefore us. It is cut back so far that there will probably be few \nenrollments next year. The damage to the CSP is only a part of the \nserious cuts to a number of farm conservation programs in this bill.\n  Some argue that in the Defense appropriations bill there will be some \nmoney to make up for cuts in conservation. Don't be misled. Defense \nappropriations funds are not even available until 2008, and then only \nif Congress doesn't take them out later on, as they have done year \nafter year. What is going on here? Why are drastic cuts conservation \nbeing made in one bill and then we have a restoration a few years later \nin another bill?\n  The DOD bill is going to come before us, and you will hear some talk \nabout: ``There is money in there. We have some money for \nconservation.'' There is money in there for 2008 but, guess what, next \nyear they may come and say we need that money, we will make up for it \nin 2009. They may keep doing this every year to us, the old shell game.\n  The bill takes away rural development funding to expand high-speed \nbroadband access in rural communities. President Bush set a goal. He \nset it in Des Moines, IA. We are going to have broadband in all rural \ncommunities by 2007. Yet they are cutting the funding in the \nreconciliation bill for that very purpose. Do I hear anything from the \nPresident about it? Not a peep.\n  The bill takes away $20 million of $23 million for an innovative \nprogram to help farmers and rural businesses adopt renewable energy \nsystems and energy efficiencies and improvements. When you take $20 \nmillion out of a $23 million fund, that kills it. Let's face it. I \nguess the $3 million they are leaving is for some bureaucrats so they \ncan sit at their desks and twiddle their thumbs because and little \nelse.\n  The bill cuts $760 million, almost three-quarters of a billion \ndollars, out of funding that we had in the farm bill that goes to \nagricultural research.\n  Again, the administration has just been in Hong Kong saying we have \nto push for cuts to farm income and commodity programs to make them \ncombined with WTO. But at the same time they are in Hong Kong, they are \nhere in the House and Senate cutting the very programs to sustain \nfarmers, to sustain rural communities, and provide for rural economic \ndevelopment that will be consistent with WTO provisions.\n  I said all along the reason they are doing this is not to cut the \ndeficit. The deficit actually goes up under this bill. I think of the \nword, ``reconciliation.'' We have before us the reconciliation bill. \n``Reconciliation''--nice word; to reconcile, to make things even. To \nreconcile things. To make them fit.\n  When we passed the Budget Act 30 years ago we put in this \nreconciliation process so that the budget would come out, the \nAppropriations Committee would do their work, and then after they did \nall their work they would reconcile the spending with the budget, so as \nto keep the deficit under control. That is the way it is supposed to \nwork.\n  We had a budget. We did all of our appropriations work. We have the \nreconciliation bills. Does the reconciliation bills make the deficit \ncome down? Not on your life. This reconciliation bill actually is the \nfirst in a pair of reconciliation bills that increases the deficit so \nit has the reverse effect of what reconciliation bills were supposed to \nbe. They may use that word, but this is a deficit-increasing process. \nThis is one of a pair of bills to provide tax giveaways to the wealthy \nand increase the deficit. It sure cannot properly be called a \nreconciliation bill.\n  So they cut child support enforcement, foster care benefits, cut \nMedicaid, make students pay more interest on their loans for going to \ncollege. But we get to ram through $70 billion in more tax giveaways \nmostly for the most privileged. Not only is this fiscally \nirresponsible, it is the wrong priorities. It is the wrong values for \nAmerica.\n  The two main tax provisions we are considering in this process are, \nNo. 1, the extension of the dividends and capital gains cuts and No, 2, \nthe alternative minimum tax. The extension of the dividends and capital \ngains tax cuts for just 2 years will cost the Treasury $50 billion. \nBecause of it, 40 percent of the benefits of the House Reconciliation \nTax bill will go to individuals making over $1 million a year.\n  Back in 2001, when they rammed through the first year's tax giveaway \nbill, they purposely doubled the number of taxpayers who would pay \nhigher taxes because of the alternative minimum tax, but then they \ndelayed the impact for the first few years. Now we have to pay the \nPiper to the tune of $30 billion just to fix it for 2006.\n  This chart is a little hard to read. It is from the official \nCongressional Joint Tax Committee explaining the bill written at the \ntime. Basically, under the old law before the tax cuts of 2001, by 2010 \nthere would be 17.5 million Americans paying the alternative minimum \ntax. When they passed the tax giveaway program of 2001, it doubled it \nto 35.5 million. Many of these are basically middle-income people. Now \nwe all want to fix it. To fix it costs $30 billion for just 2006.\n  Again, the Republicans will argue that everyone benefits from the \n2001 and 2003 tax cuts. I guess that is true. Everyone benefits. Even \nwhen you get crumbs from the table, you get food. Even when some crumbs \nfall off the table, you can say: Well, the people on the floor got some \nfood. The same with tax cuts.\n  Look at the chart. The bottom fifth of taxpayers, individuals and \nfamilies making under $13,500 a year, gain an average of $23 a year. \nThis is the bottom 20 percent. These are the one out of every five \nAmericans.\n  I know it is almost hard to believe that for people around here when \nyou are making $157,000 a year, and out of 100 Senators you have some \nwho are megamillionaires. It is hard to imagine one out of five people \noutside this building, outside of these hallowed halls, one out of five \nmaking less than $13,478 a year. They got 23 bucks. You can say: Well, \nthey got a break--23 bucks. Will that buy 8 gallons of gasoline? Well, \nmaybe--7 or 8 gallons of gasoline. It will not even fill up your tank. \nThat is for 1 year.\n  People in the middle 20 percent who make between $25,847 and $44,451, \nthey\n\n[[Page S14099]]\n\ngot $618 a year. It is not bad. But you spread that over a year's time, \nthat is a tax cut of about $26 a paycheck.\n  That is why, when you ask your typical middle-income American, Did \nyou see any gain from this tax cut, they will say, Are you kidding? \nThey might have gotten $26 a paycheck. Guess what. It went out in \nhigher taxes for their property taxes. Why? Because we have cut back \nfunding for No Child Left Behind and for education and for special \neducation which means that middle-income families have to pay more on \ntheir property taxes for education and that chewed up more than $26 a \npaycheck which they got back. Again, a good old Republican tax shell \ngame.\n  Where did the money go? The top one-tenth of 1 percent of income \nearners, people making over $1,589,000 a year--yes, there are people in \nAmerica who make that kind of money. I don't hold that against them. \nThat is fine. It is part of the American dream--to make money. But it \nis not the whole American dream. Over the last 4 years, $1.7 billion in \ntax cuts, 145,000 people with incomes over $1.59 million a year got \n$195,762 a year. I will bet they noticed that.\n  Again, the old trickle-down capitalism. All you have to do is give \nmore money to the top and it all kind of trickles down. The best way to \nhelp the poor at the bottom is set a lavish table with all the finest \nfoods and let the people at top eat the best, drink the best and the \ncrumbs will fall off and the poor will get help. Trickle-down \neconomics, trickle-down capitalism.\n  There is another form of capitalism. It is called percolate-up \ncapitalism. It is where you invest in education, it is where you get \npeople decent jobs and job training. It is where you provide decent \nhousing and health care so people are able to work and keep their \nfamilies together. It is a kind of a capitalism that understands you \ndon't eat your seed corn. You invest in people, and these people then \nbecame better educated, healthier, more productive citizens, and they \nmake the pot grow.\n  Other examples of the difference between trickle-down capitalism and \npercolate-up capitalism. Sure. Look at the 1981 tax cut when Reagan \ncame in, big, massive tax cuts, again, mostly for the wealthy. We lost \n3.5 million jobs in the 18 months after it passed. Guess what. Later, \nwe saw employment rise. But, that followed several tax increases.\n  The Democratic administration came in, in 1993. Yes. We had a \nresponsible tax increase in large part on the wealthy to help eliminate \nthe huge deficits. Many on the other side predicted economic disaster. \nLook at what happened. We got 4.4 million new jobs in the following 18 \nmonths. That is percolate up. That is giving people hope, giving people \njobs. Guess what. Everybody did better. The rising tide lifted all the \nboats.\n  Then we come back in 2001. Again, similar to 1981, we had not learned \nour lesson, massive tax giveaways for the wealthiest, large increases \nthe deficit, we lost 2.7 million jobs.\n  We keep doing trickle-down economics. We tried it under Reagan. We \ntried it under Bush. The same thing happened: less new jobs. But there \nis something about a belief system and trickle-down economics. I will \ntell you what that belief is. Their wealthy friends made out like \nbandits. That is exactly what happened.\n  Simply put, what we have before us is not a reconciliation bill. What \nwe have before us is a bill that turns topsy-turvy what we are supposed \nto be about, in terms of providing for justice in our society, a fair \nshot at the American dream to ensure that people have a decent safety \nnet when things happen beyond their control; when they become disabled, \nwhen they get sick, when families split up, and the father deserts and \nisn't paying child support any longer.\n  We need to pay attention.\n  In terms of topsy-turvy, what we are supposed to do at this time of \nthe year--we all remember Charles Dickens' classic tale of ``A \nChristmas Carol,'' the story of Ebenezer Scrooge. He learns the true \nmeaning of Christmas at the end and opens his heart to those less \nfortunate than he.\n  Unfortunately, in the Congress, life does not imitate art.\n  Less than a week before Christmas, Congress is poised to deliver a \ncruel blow to the most underprivileged and disadvantaged in our \nsociety. Unlike Dickens' tale, no remorse at the end, no nagging \nconscience, no change of heart at the end of the day. In this Congress, \nin this Senate, Scrooge would feel right at home. This is Scrooge's \ndomicile. Scrooge lives in the Senate and in the House.\n  That is why we need to reject this proposal. We need to reject it. We \nneed to have the spirit of Christmas to understand that there are less \nfortunate in our society. They need hope. They need a hand up. They \nneed the Government to make sure that their kids can get a decent \neducation and housing and health care, that they will get their child \nsupport payment, that they will invest in medical research.\n  That is what we ought to be doing. That is why we have to defeat this \nconference report under the so-called reconciliation process. We do \nneed to extend some tax provisions, but they should be progressively \npaid for.\n  Send this bill back. Let us be similar to Scrooge at the end, when we \nlook upon the poor family and we have a change of heart and we realize \nthat what we have done before we can't keep doing. Let us have the \nchange of heart and defeat this so-called reconciliation bill. Let us \nhave a continuing resolution, let us come back after the first of the \nyear and do the right thing for the American people.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, what is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering the conference \nreport to accompany S. 1932. The majority has 2 hours 24 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would like to speak on the PATRIOT Act \nand on the National Security Agency story in the New York Times for \napproximately 20 minutes. Is there any limitation on my ability to do \nso?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n             PATRIOT Act and National Security Agency Story\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, since the New York Times revealed the \nexistence of a classified program whereby the National Security Agency \nwas conducting intelligence operations on al-Qaida and terrorist-\nrelated operatives here in the United States and overseas, there has \nbeen a lot of reaction to that revelation.\n  First of all, we know the New York Times had been sitting on that \nstory for approximately a year, and then for some unstated reason \ndecided to release the story the day we were supposed to vote on the \nreauthorization of the PATRIOT Act. As a result of a variety of \ncircumstances, but I believe in part that story, we find ourselves in \nthe very strange position of not having reauthorized the PATRIOT Act \nand having the PATRIOT Act expire--16 provisions of it at least--on \nDecember 31, 2005.\n  There are some who said when they heard about the National Security \nAgency's surveillance of foreign terrorist suspects that this was an \nillegal usurpation of congressional authority by the President, or \notherwise improper. Others have asked questions about the propriety of \nthe program.\n  Frankly, I do think there has been more heat than light generated on \nthis subject, and what I would like to do is spend a few minutes \nsharing with my colleagues some of the research I have been able to do \nover the past few days to try to understand exactly what the \nPresident's authority is and what procedures apply to the collection of \nsignals intelligence, telephone communications between terrorist \nsuspects in America and abroad.\n  The fact is that previous Presidents have also argued that they had \nauthority that the President of the United States claims to have under \nthe provisions of the Constitution. In fact, in 1981, President Ronald \nReagan signed Executive order 12333, which provided for warrantless \nsearches directed against a foreign power or agent of a foreign power. \nThat was in 1981.\n  So it perhaps should be no surprise the President who immediately \npreceded the current President, President\n\n[[Page S14100]]\n\nBill Clinton, his administration, also argued specifically in testimony \nprovided by Jamie Gorelick, Deputy Attorney General, on July 14, 1994, \nbefore the Intelligence Committees, that the Clinton administration \nbelieves and the case law supports that the President has inherent \nauthority to conduct warrantless searches for foreign intelligence \npurposes and that the President may, as has been done, delegate this \nauthority to the Attorney General.\n  So we see there is historical precedent for the argument made by \nPresident Bush, our current President, that Presidents have some \nauthority to act even without employing the use of the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act to protect American lives and to save us \nagainst the designs of terrorists who would kill innocent American \ncitizens.\n  It also appears that the U.S. Supreme Court has spoken on a related \nissue that could be interpreted to confer authority on the President of \nthe United States. My colleagues recall that in 2001, after the \nterrorist attacks that occurred in Washington and in New York City and \nwhich was thwarted in the fields of Pennsylvania, this body passed a \nuse-of-force resolution authorizing approval of the President and the \nexecutive branch's use of force to combat and win the global war on \nterrorism.\n  We recall that not too long ago, when trying to determine the extent \nto which the President's powers extended, the United States Supreme \nCourt decided a case called Hamdi v. Rumsfeld. This involved Yaser \nHamdi, who was being held as an enemy combatant, and claimed that his \ndetention violated 18 U.S.C. 4001. Section 4001(a) states that ``[n}o \ncitizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States \nexcept pursuant to an Act of Congress.''\n  This is analogous to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which \nclaims that it is the exclusive method by which foreign intelligence \nmay be obtained by use of signals intelligence.\n  Justice O'Connor's plurality opinion, joined by Chief Justice \nRehnquist, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Breyer, concluded that the use-\nof-force resolution was ``an act of Congress'' that authorized Hamdi's \ndetention, notwithstanding the argument that it violated 18 U.S.C. \n4001.\n  Her rationale, as I understand the opinion, was that because the \ndetention was meant to prevent a combatant's return to the battlefield, \nit was a fundamental incident of waging war in permitting the use of \nnecessary and appropriate force.\n  Justice O'Connor, in the plurality opinion, concluded that Congress \nhad clearly and unmistakably authorized detention in the narrow \ncircumstances considered here. Thus, the question seems to me to be, by \nanalogy, whether this use-of-force resolution, which authorizes \nAmerican troops and our military to search out and to detain and, if \nnecessary, to kill terrorists before they come to our shores and kill \nus--the question is, is the intelligence gathered by the use of this \nsurveillance a fundamental incident of waging the war on terror? And it \nstrikes me that it is.\n  Inherent in waging war is obtaining actionable intelligence from our \nenemy or on our enemy. Certainly, I would believe, under the rationale \nin the Hamdi v. Rumsfeld case, that this would be a fundamental \nincident in waging the war on terror and one authorized by the use-of-\nforce resolution in 2001.\n  So we see that President Clinton believed, as did President Reagan, \nthat the President had authority, even outside of the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act, but another arguable basis of that \nauthority is the resolution that Congress itself passed in 2001.\n  Now, there is one other authority that I think bears on this issue \nthat is important. When the Congress created the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act in 1978, it created a special court to consider ex \nparte--that is, ``without the benefit of the other side being there''--\napplications for orders to get electronic surveillance.\n  Now, people have thought: Well, this must be similar to other courts. \nBut the truth is, it is not an adversarial process because we do not \nlet our enemies know we are going to the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court to get an order so we can find out what they are \ndoing. But, nevertheless, Congress did create this, what we call a \ncourt, for the purpose of considering those applications.\n  But more to the point, the Congress also created an appeals court \ncalled the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review. Now, \ngranted, most of the time the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \noperates in secret and does so for the obvious reasons that these are \nclassified operations. We cannot let our enemies know what we know, so \nwe can discover their attempts to hurt innocent American civilians.\n  The Congress understands, and certainly the Intelligence Committees \nand all the Members of Congress understand, that most, if not all, of \nthis has to operate in confidential or classified circumstances.\n  But in November of 2002, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \nof Review--this appellate court created by Congress under the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act--actually issued a public opinion, which \nwas extraordinary. It is the first time since the creation of FISA, the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act, that an appeal was actually \nbrought and that the court actually issued a written opinion.\n  Now, notwithstanding the fact that there is not an adversarial \nprocess--again, it is a one-sided process by the Government seeking \npermission from the judges to conduct this important surveillance \nagainst foreign agents and international terrorists--notwithstanding \nthat fact, the court invited the American Civil Liberties Union and the \nNational Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers to submit briefs so \nthey might consider their decision with the additional input of these \norganizations that, by their nature, would argue perhaps a more limited \napproach to Government power.\n  Well, all of that I say to point out that in the absence of a \ncontrolling U.S. Supreme Court decision--and I mentioned the Hamdi case \nwhich is applicable by analogy to this situation when it comes to the \nauthorization of the use of force--in the absence of a controlling \ndecision on the President's inherent power to conduct these operations \nthrough a warrantless surveillance, the court created by Congress to be \nthe authoritative decisionmaker of these matters, in 2002, said, on \npage 48 of this opinion:\n\n       We take for granted that the President does have that \n     Authority [that is, to conduct warrantless searches to obtain \n     foreign intelligence information] and, assuming that is so, \n     FISA could not encroach on the President's constitutional \n     power.\n\n  Now, concededly, that is what lawyers like to call ``dicta.'' It is \nperhaps not essential to the decision of the specific issues that came \nbefore the FISA Court of Review, but it does recognize that the case \nlaw and precedent supports the President's authority to conduct \nwarrantless surveillance in foreign intelligence and international \nconspiracies against the United States because of the power conferred \non him under article II of the Constitution.\n  So in summary, we see that not only did the Clinton administration \nbelieve the President had that authority, the Reagan administration \nbelieved the President had that constitutional authority under article \nII and, by analogy, that the U.S. Supreme Court has suggested that the \nuse-of-force resolution would authorize surveillance as a fundamental \nincident of waging the war on terror.\n  So these are helpful in shedding some light on exactly what authority \nthe President had during the course of this surveillance, which he says \nwas essential to protecting American lives against foreign agents bent \non doing Americans harm.\n  It seems reasonable to me that the President ought to be able to rely \non the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review's opinion that \nhas stated that every court that has reviewed this or similar questions \nhas found inherent authority to conduct this type of intelligence.\n  Certainly, I agree that it is appropriate for Congress and this \nSenate to have oversight hearings. I know Senator Specter has indicated \nhis interest in doing so; Senator Roberts, chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee, likewise. But we have to understand, as I know my colleagues \ndo, that this is a classified program. There are limits to what we can \ntalk about in public without putting in jeopardy our methods and \nsources of obtaining information\n\n[[Page S14101]]\n\nagainst those people who are bent on our destruction and certainly the \ndestruction of innocent American lives.\n  So it is appropriate to have a hearing. But it is not appropriate for \nanyone, including a Member of the Congress, to leak classified \ninformation about the existence of this program.\n  Now, some have said: Well, it is not illegal nor unconstitutional for \nthe New York Times to write about it. And I will leave that for some \ncourt sometime, someplace. But we know for a fact it is a violation of \nthe criminal law of the United States to leak classified information. \nMy hope is that the Justice Department and the appropriate authorities \nwill conduct a prompt and thorough investigation into how this \ninformation was leaked because, as a result, our enemies now know what \nwe are doing and, to some extent, how we are doing it, in a way that \nundermines our ability to fight and win the global war on terror.\n  It strikes me, when you are trying to be analytical about this, \ntrying to figure out why is it important that the President have this \nauthority--that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review \nhas assumed the President has and that President Reagan and President \nClinton claimed to have--why is it important that authority exists \noutside of a typical law enforcement or criminal prosecution context?\n  Well, of course, in an intelligence-gathering mode, we may not have a \ntarget per se of that intelligence-gathering activity. There may not \nreally be knowledge that a crime has actually yet been committed but, \nrather, a reasonable belief that there are individuals who are \nplotting, conspiring to do innocent American civilians harm. So it is \nimpossible to do in that context what we would ordinarily do in a \ncriminal prosecution context, which would be to have an affidavit filed \nby an FBI agent in support of a petition for an issuance of a warrant, \nwhich would then be filed as a public record for everybody to see.\n  If we have learned anything as a result of 9/11, it is that we must \nbreak out of this pre-9/11 mindset, which says that terrorism must be \ncombated as a criminal law violation alone. It is true that terrorist \nactivity could be a crime, but our main goal is to detect and disrupt \nterrorist activity before people in this country or our friends and \nallies across the globe are injured or killed. So the fundamental goals \nof our national policy have to be to disrupt the information, discover \nit, disrupt these cells, and protect Americans in the process.\n  So I wanted to come to the Chamber and say a few words about this \nissue because there have been some who have, in breathless tones, said \nthat this is a great travesty, they cannot believe it has happened, and \nsome have even gone so far as to suggest the President has acted \nillegally. I would say that, on balance, my conclusion is, based on \nhistorical precedent and based on the authorities that are invested \nwith the power to render legal decisions on such matters, the President \nprobably did act within his authority, but we should proceed to have \nhearings to further flesh that out so Congress can understand exactly \nwhat is going on.\n  Finally, I wish to say a couple of words about the Senate's failure \nto reauthorize the PATRIOT Act. I believe the PATRIOT Act has been one \nof those things that have made America safer and prevented terrorists \nfrom executing another attack on our own soil. If you look from \nSeptember 11 up until this date, thank goodness, the United States of \nAmerica has not suffered another attack on our own soil. We do know \nthere have been terrorist attacks that have been disrupted but were \nplanned in the style of 9/11 against American civilians by terrorists \nwho care nothing about our laws or our way of life but care only for \ntheir misguided ideology and are willing to do anything, including kill \ninnocent people, in order to accomplish their goals.\n  It is only reasonable to assume that the PATRIOT Act has played an \nimportant part in our safety in the United States. The reason I say \nthat is if you look out across the world, we have seen terrorist \nattacks in London, Madrid, Bali, and in other places around the world. \nI can only conclude that the PATRIOT Act has played an important role--\nperhaps not the exclusive role but an important role in combating \nglobal terrorism and making sure they are not successful in attacking \nor killing or injuring Americans on our own soil.\n  It is with that in mind that I am at a loss to explain how some of \nour colleagues could prevent a bipartisan majority in the Senate from \nvoting on the reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act. The fact is that some \nof them have said we didn't get everything we wanted in the \nnegotiations. Well, the news is that nobody does. But the fact is the \nPATRIOT Act passed 98 to 1 roughly 6 weeks after the attacks of \nSeptember 11. It was a bipartisan bill, obviously, because it enjoyed \noverwhelming support on both sides of the aisle. There is literally \nnothing that has changed other than additional concessions being made \nto address the concerns of those who claim there are civil liberty \nconcerns in the PATRIOT Act.\n  Rather than allow us to have that vote, unfortunately, there is a \nminority in the Senate that is filibustering and preventing us from \nhaving an up-or-down vote. Ultimately, in the interest of the safety of \nthe country, I ask my colleagues to reconsider their obstruction and \ndenial of our ability to have that vote. We know that 16 provisions are \ngoing to expire December 31 unless we do.\n  There are those who say that what we need is a 3-month extension. \nWell, that is a phony deal, Mr. President, I suggest. We have been \ndebating this PATRIOT Act since it was originally passed in October \n2001. I think everybody has a pretty good idea where they stand. I \nbelieve every issue that could be debated has been debated, and every \nissue that could be negotiated has been negotiated. There has been an \nattempt to reach out and define common ground. Indeed, I believe the \nconference between the House and Senate did exactly that. It would be a \nterrible shame under the guise of, Well, we just need 3 more months to \nfurther dilute the provisions of the PATRIOT Act that have made America \nsafer. Unfortunately, that is what I see happening with the \nunwillingness of the minority Senators to have that up-or-down vote and \nreauthorize the PATRIOT Act.\n  So I implore them not to make these offers of just 3 more months \nbecause we know all they are trying to do is use that for additional \nleverage to water down the strong protections of the PATRIOT Act. What \nthey ought to do is reconcile themselves to the fact that they are not \ngoing to get everything they want, just as I didn't get everything I \nwanted. I would like to strike all sunsets in the PATRIOT Act and make \nit permanent. I advocated for provisions for administrative subpoenas, \nand that didn't make it into the bill. There are other things I would \nhave liked to see in the bill that are not in the bill, but in the \ninterest of trying to find common ground and in the interest of trying \nto pass a bill that will keep America safe, I have been willing to make \nthose concessions.\n  I ask all of our colleagues, when it comes to passing this \nlegislation, to try to find a way to allow us to have that up- or-down \nvote so we can reauthorize the PATRIOT Act and the American people will \nknow we have done everything within our power to try to keep them safe, \nwhich is, in fact, the No. 1 obligation of the Federal Government--our \nnational security.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from North Dakota \nis recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent under our \nallocation of time to speak until 2:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Please repeat the request.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that under our allocation of time \nI be allowed to speak until 2:15 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there is a lot happening in the final days \nof this Congress. One might ask, What on Earth are we doing here days \nbefore Christmas? We are doing the work that should have been done in \nMarch, April, May, June, July, and August, work that wasn't done then \nfor a number of reasons. But now we come to a number of important \nissues and this is reconciliation, budget cuts, and we have a tax cut \nbill ricocheting around. We have the PATRIOT Act that my colleague just \ndescribed. We have the Defense appropriations bill. That has now\n\n[[Page S14102]]\n\nbeen burdened with an amendment that calls for drilling in ANWR.\n  It is an interesting time, but one that is frustrating for some of us \nin the Senate. I will give you a description of that frustration.\n  On Sunday, we met at 12 o'clock--this past Sunday--on a conference, a \nvery large conference dealing with the Defense appropriations bill. I \nwas a conferee. We started at 12, and I left at 5 or 5:30 in the \nafternoon. We finished the work on that conference report. I opposed a \nnumber of things that happened on Sunday. The Defense appropriations \nbill was before us. They added drilling for oil in Alaska, the ANWR \nprovision, having nothing to do with the bill. They added it because \nthey thought they had the votes to add it.\n  Well, we finished the conference, and I left here at 5:30 on Sunday, \nand I discovered they added another provision. There wasn't a \nconference still going on at that point. A bunch of folks got in a room \nand decided what they were going to stick in the conference report.\n  I told my colleagues I grew up in a small town of about 350 people. \nWhen I was a kid, I used to go and watch the blacksmith. We had a \nblacksmith in my hometown. It was kind of fun to go and watch the \nblacksmith work. He would take a piece of metal, put it in a tong, \nstick it in heat, in hot coals until it turned white hot, and then he \nwould put it on an anvil, take a big old hammer and beat it. That is \nhow he shaped metal. Heat it and beat it with an old hammer. I watched \nthat guy with dirty clothes, sweating all day long. He would heat that \nmetal and beat that metal. Some people think apparently that is the way \nthe Senate should work--heat it and beat it. Get hold of a big old \nhammer and pound ANWR through here. It doesn't matter the rules don't \npermit it; pound it through here. In fact, change the rules if they get \nin your way. It doesn't matter. Don't like the rules? Change them.\n  I am usually an optimist. They say a pessimist is someone who smells \nflowers and looks around for a casket and a body, and an optimist is \nsomeone who sees a manure pile and looks for a pony. I am an optimist, \nusually, looking for good things in what we are doing and where we are \nheading. But this notion that we live in a special place on this Earth \nand somehow we don't have to care about nurturing it to make sure it \nremains special, that it will all work out is a notion devoid of \nleadership.\n  The fact is, we are off track in this country. We are No. 1 in \nexports in waste paper. Did my colleagues know that? The largest volume \nof export in America is waste paper to China. Unbelievable. Yes, we are \nNo. 1 in exporting waste paper.\n  And, oh, by the way, in the last 4 years, we also sent about 3 to 4 \nmillion jobs to Asia, mostly to China. We have the largest trade \ndeficit in the history of humankind. This past year on the budget \ndeficit, we will borrow $550-plus billion, nearly $570 billion. So we \nhave a budget deficit that is way out of control, a trade deficit that \nis way off the charts, and we are shipping jobs overseas. Our No. 1 \nexport now is waste paper, and you think things are going great. Suck \nit up, they say, it is a great place, things are going fine.\n  I don't think things are going fine. The question is where is the \nleadership here? David McCullough wrote a book about Adams. It is a \nwonderful book. He is a great historian. He wrote this book about \nAdams. I have told this story before. In this book, he described John \nAdams as representing this country's interests in Europe. Adams would \nwrite back to his wife Abigail as they were trying to put this new \ncountry together, and he would say: Where will the leadership emerge to \nhelp frame and start this new country of ours? Then he would say: There \nis really only us. There is me and there is Thomas Jefferson and there \nis George Washington and there is Ben Franklin and there is Madison and \nthere is Mason. There is only us.\n  Now, of course, we know in the rearview mirror of history that the \n``only us'' is some of the greatest human talent ever assembled, and \nthey built a very extraordinary place, a very special country, with a \nConstitution that says ``We the People.'' The first 3 words, we the \npeople.\n  But the current leadership in the White House and Congress says we \ndon't have to worry too much about deficits. We are going to cut some \nspending but, oh, by the way, even though we are up to our neck in \ndeficits, we want to cut taxes, and, oh, by the way, we still want to \ncut taxes mostly for upper income people. The second part of this \nreconciliation document is still in the House of Representatives, the \ntax side. It is very important to say that capital gains and dividends, \nnormally called unearned income, capital and dividends--be given \npreferential tax rates. That is the most important thing. Warren \nBuffett, the world's second richest man, said when all this is phased \nin, he will pay a lower tax rate than his receptionist in his office. \nTax work, they say, tax work but exempt investment. That is the mantra \naround here.\n  What is the most important thing? Drive down the taxes on dividends \nand capital gains; drive them down. It doesn't matter, we don't need \nthe revenue. Deficits don't matter, Vice President Cheney said. \nDeficits don't matter.\n  They now come to the floor of the Senate with a proposal that says, \nby the way, let's cut some spending. Guess whose spending is going to \nget cut. Is it a surprise that the most vulnerable among us get cut? Is \nit a surprise the proposal is to decide there should not be enough \nmoney in Medicaid, that which delivers health care to America's poor, \nto provide the kind of funding that is necessary in Medicaid?\n  It is said by some, and I believe it, that budgets are moral \ndocuments as well. Someone once asked the question: If you were \nrequired to write an obituary for someone you had never met and the \nonly information you had was that person's check register, what would \nit tell you about the obituary you would write?\n  What if all you knew about this country was its Federal budget and \nthat is all the information you had as a moral document, but what was \nimportant? What mattered to this country? What did this country believe \nrepresented the most important areas of investment, expenditure to \nbuild on the successes of this country? Would it be, for example, that \nyou decided tax cuts for wealthy Americans are the most important?\n  Let me show you a picture. I showed it yesterday, but I think it is \nimportant. This is a picture of a five-story building on Church Street \nin the Cayman Islands. Some people would just as soon you didn't this \npicture. But On Church Street in the Cayman Islands, there is a five-\nstory building called the Ugland House. Do you know what is inside this \nbuilding? This building is the official address for 12,748 \ncorporations. Impossible, you say? No, it is not impossible. It is not \nimpossible. We are running an economy now and, by the way, with the \nadvice and consent of those in the Congress and in the Senate who voted \nfor it--we are running one that says to businesses: Go ahead, get rid \nof your American jobs, move them to China, ship the products back to \nthis country to sell them, and run your business through a mailbox in \nthe Grand Cayman Islands so you don't have to pay taxes. That is what \nthis building is about. And, oh, by the way, many of the companies that \nhave this building as their address in the Cayman Islands to avoid \npaying U.S. taxes got a gift from this Congress--not with my vote--that \nis the equivalent of a $60 billion tax break--a $60 billion tax break.\n  In the past year and a half, a bill was passed called the JOBS Act to \ncreate new jobs. Of course, it didn't. It cost jobs. It gave a very fat \ntax break to the largest corporations in our country that do business \nhere and overseas. It said, if you repatriate your income from \noverseas, because some day you are going to and when you do, you have \nto pay the 35-percent corporate rate, if you do it now, we will give \nyou a special deal that we won't give to any other Americans: You pay a \n5.25-percent tax rate. There is not one American living in Ohio, North \nDakota, Oklahoma, or any other State represented in this Chamber who is \ntold in law that they get to pay an income tax of 5.25 percent.\n  This Congress told the largest companies in this country, we will \ngive you a 5.25-percent tax rate. That was a priority. My colleague who \nsat in this desk behind me, Senator Fritz Hollings, offered the \namendment to strip it. I voted for it. I spoke for it. But, no, we \ncould not strip that out because too\n\n[[Page S14103]]\n\nmany Members of this Congress believed it was important, a priority, to \nprovide a big fat $60 billion tax break to the largest corporations in \nthis country, with a 5.25-percent tax rate.\n  Compare that to the proposition we are offered today by people who \ncome to the floor breathlessly saying we have to cut spending to reduce \nthe deficit. Did they care about reducing the deficit when they gift-\nwrapped a $60 billion tax cut package for the biggest companies by \ngiving them a 5.25-percent tax rate? No. It did not matter. It did not \nmatter then. They just promised that it would create new jobs.\n  Interestingly enough, the very companies repatriating income to take \nadvantage of this bargain basement tax rate are cutting jobs. This is \nnot just me saying it. This is from the Wall Street Journal and other \nnewspapers that describe exactly what is happening.\n  So today we have the breathless chant about let us cut funds for the \nChild Support Enforcement Program, which, it is estimated by the \nCongressional Budget Office, will result in $2.9 billion in child \nsupport going uncollected. Let us cut funding $12.7 billion for the \nstudent loan programs. Let us cut funding from family farmers--by the \nway, many of whom faced some disaster this year; the worst drought \nsince 1895 in Illinois, Missouri, Iowa. One million acres could not be \nplanted in North Dakota.\n  Those farmers are not going to get disaster help, but the leadership \nhad no reservations about allowing a situation where 12,748 \ncorporations establish their address in one five-story building in the \nCayman Islands, for the purpose of not paying taxes in this country. It \nis all perfectly legal because this Congress believes it ought to \ncontinue to happen.\n  We have had vote after vote on my amendment to try to shut this down. \nCannot do it. So in terms of priorities I think it is important to ask \nthe question, on whose behalf are we legislating? I happen to believe \nwe ought to cut the deficit. In fact, in January and February I am \ngoing to be offering a very specific set of plans on how you cut \nspending in a real way. We have very large agencies in our Government, \nand unlike businesses that have overhead expenditures and then direct \nexpenditures there is no distinction between our overhead expenditures. \nIn fact, they cannot even separate out overhead expenditures.\n  The first thing one should cut back on is overhead and travel and \nthose kinds of things, but it cannot even be separated out in these \nagencies. We ought to take a whack at that. I am going to propose that.\n  I support some of these issues, but let me mention a number of issues \nthat are attendant to this as well. There is a provision buried in this \nhuge reconciliation bill, as is always the case in these things that \ncome to our desk--my colleagues can see the size of this legislation. \nThere is a provision repealing something called the Byrd law that I \nwant to talk about just for a moment.\n  When American enterprises, American companies, are the victims of \nunfair trade--and there is a lot of it--our government sometimes \nimposes antidumping and countervailing duties. The Byrd amendment, \nwhich I supported, says that U.S. producers who have been injured by \nunfair trade should receive those duty revenues.\n  But the WTO stepped in and said: Well, it is not right that you would \nrecompense your victims of trade who have been injured by unfair trade. \nSo the WTO ruled against us, and we have our colleagues in the Senate \nand in the House who have been very anxious to overturn the Byrd rule. \nSure enough, they do it in this bill.\n  They cannot run to the bank fast enough, in my judgment. Those who \nwant to do this sort of damage to us cannot run to the bank fast enough \nto deal with all of these issues. We have the biggest trade deficit in \nhistory. We have jobs flowing out of this country. We have a country \nthat does not have the spine, the backbone, the will to stand up for \nour producers on unfair trade. Those who have been victimized, those \nwho have been hurt by unfair trade, ought to receive the benefits of \nthe tariffs. Now the majority says that is not true; we are going to \ntake it away.\n  I do not understand that. I do not have the foggiest idea where the \nSenate's priorities are.\n  We are right at the end of the session, a couple of days left, and \nthe Defense appropriations bill was not passed this year. Now it is \nabout to be passed, except they load on one of the most controversial \nissues called drilling for oil in ANWR. Under any other circumstance, \none would be laughed out of the Chamber for that. Yet we have people \ncome here--I heard a colleague of mine yesterday say: Well, let us all \nbe bipartisan.\n  I am all for being bipartisan. Let us also be fair and let us \nlegislate the right way. Let us not stick these unrelated issues on \nthis legislation and then say: By the way, it does violate the rules, \nbut we will change the rules and we will change it only for this \npurpose and change it right back, and never mind.\n  Do they think that we cannot see, hear, or think? Is that what this \narrogance is born of? I do not understand it. We are close enough to \nthe end of this session, and this country is in deep enough trouble \nwith trade and budget deficits and a range of other issues that we \nought to find a way to work together.\n  This is not about bending steel. This is about compromise, working \ntogether to do the right thing for this country. There is no Republican \nor Democrat way to go off track on trade or on the budget. It just \nhurts our country. Together, we ought to be able to do better for \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from North Dakota has risen and spoken, \nobviously, with enthusiasm and energy about his position. But I think \nthat there are a couple of points which need to be made.\n  First of all, on this Byrd issue, the Byrd trade rule issue, let us \ntalk about what that really is. Where did it come from to begin with? \nIt came in the middle of the night. It was put in an appropriations \nbill a few years ago. Who does it benefit? It benefits a very few \nspecific industries in this country that get the windfall from an \nunfair trade practice. In other words, what happens under this rule is \nthat $3.2 billion is paid to a few specific industries. In fact, one \nspecific company got 39 percent of the funds up until this year. Who \nwould get it if it were not in place? The American taxpayer would get \nthat money. That money would go to the Treasury.\n  It is not about cutting that money out of the budget; it is about \nhaving that money flow to the Treasury so the American taxpayer has the \nright to that money so it can be used either to reduce the debt or it \ncan be used for programmatic activity that is necessary, such as \nnational defense, instead of having it be a special interest event \nwhich goes to benefit very few industries in this country and a very \nspecific number of companies within those industries. Quite honestly, I \nwould not be surprised if some of those companies did not have some \nsort of headquarters in this building right here that get that $3 \nbillion.\n  In addition to that, this $3.2 billion, because of the insistence of \na couple of Members in this Senate, has been kept in, so it is still \nflowing to those specific companies. So the taxpayer is still not \ngetting the benefit of that money that the taxpayer should get.\n  Prospectively, the rule has been changed, as it should be changed. \nWhy should it be changed? Well, the Senator from North Dakota sort of \npassed over this a little quickly. The WTO ruled against us. It said: \nYou cannot give that money to specific industries and specific \ncompanies. It said: You cannot do that.\n  Maybe the Senator from North Dakota does not want us to be a member \nof the WTO, but we are a member of the WTO. We use the WTO aggressively \nto try to defend our trade interests around the globe. They are the \narbiter. They are the ones we go to when something goes wrong and our \ncompanies get maltreated. So it is a little hard to say to the WTO: We \nwant to use you to enforce a dumping procedure against Japan, China or \nSingapore, but when you find that we have violated the World Trade \nOrganization's laws because we are giving money specifically to one or \ntwo companies in this country in violation of those laws, well, you\n\n[[Page S14104]]\n\ncannot do that. You cannot tell us how to do things.\n  So what does the WTO do? The WTO now assesses fines against other \nAmerican companies--I think it totals to something over $100 million \nannually--which American products, produced in this country, are now \nhaving to pay, which make those products less competitive, because we \ncontinue to violate the WTO and give this money, instead of to the \ntaxpayers of America, instead of putting it in the Treasury where it \nshould be, thus reducing the debt, to a couple of companies that have \nthe influence to get it across this floor.\n  I do not find a whole lot of persuasiveness in the argument of the \nSenator from North Dakota on this point, but he won. The $3.2 billion \nis going to flow out of the door to specific companies, in violation of \nWTO rules, will stay in place, and other American manufacturers will be \nprejudiced because they will be hit with a fine by the WTO, which is a \nlegitimate fine.\n  The second point the Senator makes is, he says, Oh, we are cutting \nthe subsidies to students. I think he said $12 billion. That also is \ninaccurate. There is no reduction of subsidies to students. In fact, we \nexpand the programs, the Pell grant program, and we create a new \nprogram for math and science. What we do is what we should do, and we \nneed to do it before the end of the year, and that is we reduce the \nwindfall that is coming to lenders because of the way the rules are \npresently set up. That is $12 billion.\n  Again, I wouldn't be at all surprised if some of those lender \ncompanies had clearinghouses down in the Cayman Islands that he is \ncomplaining about. But he is defending them now because he is saying we \nshould not make that change.\n  If, by the end of this year, we do not change the rules as to how we \ncalculate the lender activity to students in this country, lenders will \nget I think it is a $7 billion windfall. It might be more, actually. It \ndoes not go to the students. It will not help the students. All it does \nis help a group of lenders because the law is structured in a way which \nbasically benefits them. We tried to change it. We were not able to \npermanently change it last year, but we now do have the permanent \nchange in this bill. And, by the way, it was bipartisan. That proposal, \nbecause it is so obviously fair and the right thing to do, was reported \nout of the HELP Committee unanimously. This alleged $12 billion event \nthat the Senator from North Dakota has decided to highlight as a \ncorporate subsidy to the disadvantage of students is just the opposite. \nWe are cutting a corporate subsidy to advantage students. The only \ndebate between myself and Senator Kennedy, who was actually supportive \nto the policy relative to the reduction of the subsidy to the lenders, \nis how the money that is raised from that subsidy should be spent. We \nbelieve it should go to debt reduction, and we believe it should go to \nthe expansion of student loans. He wants more money to student loans. \nWe want to have a balance and we have a balance.\n  On both those policy points, the Senator from North Dakota, in my \nhumble opinion, has misrepresented the character of the bill--$3.2 \nbillion is flowing to special corporations for a special interest \nbenefit under this bill. It should be going to the taxpayers. But the \npolicy which energized that is at least being changed so at least \nprospectively that is not going to happen, and other companies in this \ncountry that are being fined by the WTO because of violations of the \nWTO standard will actually have that relief in the outyears. And the \nsubsidies which, if we do not act before the end of this year, are \nflowing to corporate lenders are going to be moved over to students, to \nbenefit students, or to deficit reduction.\n  I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Oklahoma if he \nwould mind if I take a minute and half off our side to respond, at \nwhich point the Senator from Oklahoma will be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me say my colleague from New \nHampshire, while interesting and articulate, stops a couple of pages \nshort of good research. First, my colleague talks at length about the \nWTO. I am not sure which direction we would be required to bow to the \nWTO. Is it the east or the west? The WTO, of course, does not run or \nmanage American public policy and trade.\n  But I do want to say this with respect to the Byrd law. My colleague \nsaid ``just a few companies'' benefit from it. The fact is, well over \n700 companies benefit from it. So, when one talks about \nmisrepresentation, I will ascribe that, I guess, to a mistake.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. No, I only have a minute and a half. Several hundred \ncompanies have benefited, not just a few.\n  If one wants to run America's trade policy exclusively through the \nsieve of the World Trade Organization, I will say get a big armchair, \nsit back, have a good time, and say: Whatever you want, WTO.\n  That is not my belief. My belief is we ought to invest in this \ncountry's strength. When American companies are victimized by unfair \ntrade, we ought to in my judgment have the good sense, as we have in \nthis legislation we call the Byrd law, to use the tariff to recompense \nthem.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, 39 percent of this benefit went to 1 \ncompany, 39 percent; and $2 billion of the $3 billion that is going to \ngo out of this is going to go to a small group of companies that deal \nin lumber. Those dollars belong to the American taxpayer. They should \nbe in the Federal Government's Treasury. They should be used for \ndeficit reduction. They should be used for initiatives here at the \nFederal level that are important.\n  The WTO ruled against us, and if the Senator doesn't like the WTO and \ndoesn't want to be part of the World Trade Organization--we are. It is \ncalled a treaty. We have to live by treaties. It is called the rule of \nlaw.\n  Mr. DORGAN. It is not a treaty.\n  Mr. GREGG. And the treaty says we submit issues to the WTO, we debate \nthem. We win sometimes; we lose sometimes. On this issue, the WTO ruled \nthat because we specifically send this money out to specific \ncorporations--and there is only one that got 39 percent. I don't care \nif there are 700 that maybe got a dollar, there is one that got 39 \npercent of the benefit--then you are violating the rules of the WTO, \nand then they assessed us with a fine and our companies now pay that \nfine and make our goods less competitive.\n  So not only are our taxpayers losing out because of this language, \nbut the companies that have to compete in the world are losing out. The \nattack of the Senator from North Dakota on the bill on that point \ndoesn't hold water.\n  I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma such time as he needs.\n  Mr. COBURN. It is my understanding I am allotted 30 minutes. I would \nappreciate it if the Chair will let me know when I have 10 minutes \nleft.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will notify the Senator.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I come to the floor first to meet those \ntwo who were just debating to wish them a Merry Christmas and a happy \nholiday season. This is a season, a time about giving. When you give \nsomething, most often it costs you. It is called sacrifice. It is what \nour Nation was built on. It is the very heritage that we have as a \nnation, that we sacrifice to do what is in the best long-term interests \nof our country.\n  The chairman outlined the unfunded liability that is facing this \nNation between now and 2070. He gave a figure of $51 trillion. That is \nan underestimate of what the true unfunded liability is for our \ncountry. We just added $8.7 trillion with the Medicare Part D Program. \nBut it is such a large number we have a hard time getting our hands on \nit.\n  One of the ways to get our hands on it is to think about what it \nmeans per individual, and $51 trillion in unfunded liabilities means \nevery man, woman, and child in this country today is responsible for \n$171,000. Think about that. That is more than the net worth of the \ncountry.\n  Why do I raise that? Because the debate we are having about this bill \nand movement forward and the comments about how you judge whether \nsomebody is compassionate is based on how you treat those less than you \nand those who are going to follow you. I believe everybody in the \nSenate would agree\n\n[[Page S14105]]\n\nthat leaving $171,000 worth of obligation for every man, woman, and \nchild in this country is inappropriate. It belies the heritage of this \ncountry.\n  If you think about the great generations that have come before us--\nthe greatest generation, the World War II generation--those who have \nsacrificed in this country and those who are sacrificing today in the \nwar on terrorism, it is inconceivable to me that we will not start \ndoing some of the small things we can do, with the bills that are going \nto be before us today and tomorrow, to assure a Christmas gift to every \nAmerican.\n  Some say, How can you do that and still be compassionate? My argument \nis, if we don't start doing it, we are not going to be able to be \ncompassionate at all.\n  I would like to put up a couple of charts.\n  The first is from the Government Accountability Office. It shows \nwhere we are going if we freeze discretionary spending in this country. \nIf we absolutely freeze discretionary spending, what will happen is \nbetween now and 2040, there is no increase in any discretionary \nspending whatsoever. You did see how our growth and expenditures take \nplace. You can see that the vast majority of that is Medicare, \nMedicaid, Social Security, and all other spending, of which the largest \nproportion in 2040 won't be on any program but will be interest on the \nnational debt.\n  I am also struck by the inconsistency that I hear in this body when \none group of Senators has offered over $400 billion in new spending \nthis year--$400 billion in new spending proposals this year.\n  If you think about why this is important, this line is represented as \na percentage of our gross domestic product. All we have to do is look \nat the country of Germany today to see where we are going and what is \ngoing to happen to us. They have unemployment of 13 percent. Their \ngrowth is minimal in terms of their gross domestic product. Why? \nBecause 40 percent of their gross domestic product is taken up by the \nGovernment. This only goes to 2040.\n  At 2050 and 2075, we are at 40 percent of our gross domestic product. \nThat means money that could be invested in new jobs, in capital, in \nfuture opportunities for our children, won't be there because we will \nbe consuming.\n  Now let's look at if we just have the Government grow at the rate of \ninflation. What do we see? By 2040, we are above 40 percent.\n  So the questions before this body and the criticisms of the bills on \nthe floor don't make any sense if we are going to give a Christmas gift \nof a future to our children. This is unsustainable. The Government \nAccountability Office has said we are on an unsustainable course. It is \nimpossible.\n  The Senator from North Dakota earlier said he is going to bring a \nspending reduction bill to the floor. I embrace that. There is no \nquestion that I am known in this body to try to restrain our spending. \nBut if we don't, we belie the very heritage this country has stood for \nsince its inception; that is, one generation sacrificing for the next \nso opportunities and a bright future will be there.\n  How have we done that? Because we are more interested in the next \nelection than the next generation. We are more interested in making the \neasy choice, the expedient choice, rather than the difficult choice.\n  The choice is this. The way things are set up now, there is no way we \ncan keep our obligations to you if you are dependent on the Federal \nGovernment. What is compassionate about that? What message do we send \nto those who truly are dependent upon us if we will not make the hard \nchoices to make sure anybody is in a position to help them in the \nfuture?\n  I will talk about some specific things.\n  This reconciliation bill didn't go nearly far enough in terms of \nreducing spending. Let me give you a couple of examples.\n  The Federal Financial Oversight Subcommittee which I chair had a \nhearing on inappropriate payments. There is an Improper Payment Act \nwhich is law that the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services has \nfailed to enforce on Medicaid alone. But let us talk about Medicare, \nand then we will talk about Medicaid.\n  In Medicare alone, it is estimated that over 10 percent of the \npayments that are made by Medicare are inappropriate. Of that, 90 \npercent are overpayments. What do I mean, overpayments? I mean fraud, I \nmean abuse, I mean cheating the Federal Government. And as a physician, \nI am talking about some of my peers and others in the health care \nindustry, whether they are in durable medical equipment, in the \npharmaceutical industry, or others who are taking advantage of the \nbureaucracy of the program. But this bill saves a small amount of money \nover the next 5 years. The total is under 8-point-some billion dollars. \nLess than half of that comes from Medicare and Medicaid. Think about 90 \npercent of $21.7 billion. That is $19 billion a year in Medicare fraud, \nand $19 billion a year times 5 years comes up to $95 billion. This bill \ndoesn't even save $40 billion over the next 5 years.\n  If we want to be serious about giving a Christmas gift of opportunity \nand future and making the sacrifices, it starts in this Chamber. That \nsacrifice is, there is no excuse for us not to rid Medicare of the \nfraud that is in it today, an estimated $19 billion a year. If, in \nfact, we rid Medicare of the $19 billion and we rid Medicaid, which is \n$18 billion worth of fraud--that is estimated because they have not \nfollowed the law and reported improper payments.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from \nNew York Times that outlines some of the Medicare fraud issues in New \nYork State.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 19, 2005]\n\n              As Medicaid Balloons, Watchdog Force Shrinks\n\n                 (By Michael Luo and Clifford J. Levy)\n\n       New York's Medicaid program pays more than a million claims \n     a day, feeding a $44.5 billion river of checks to \n     radiologists and ambulance drivers, brain surgeons and \n     orderlies, medical centers and corner pharmacies. Many who \n     get those checks pocket more money than they deserve, and \n     millions of taxpayer dollars are believed to be lost every \n     day to theft and waste.\n       Yet the state, charged with protecting those dollars, has \n     done little to stop them from draining away.\n       A yearlong New York Times investigation found only a thin, \n     overburdened security force standing between this enormous \n     program and the unending attempts to steal from it. Even as \n     spending by New York Medicaid has more than tripled since the \n     late 1980's, the number of fraud investigators who guard its \n     cash register has fallen by half, and several of their \n     leaders have quit or retired in disillusionment.\n       Of the 400 million claims that Medicaid paid last year, \n     Health Department regulators uncovered just 37 cases of \n     suspected fraud, far fewer than their counterparts in any \n     other large state, even though New York's Medicaid budget is \n     by far the largest in the nation. Many experts say that it is \n     likely that at least 10 percent and probably more of New York \n     Medicaid dollars are stolen or wasted.\n       In dozens of interviews, prosecutors, lawmakers and former \n     regulators said the program paid for almost everything and \n     scrutinized almost nothing, in large part because its primary \n     mission has been to ensure that there are enough health care \n     providers in the system to address the needs of the poor. It \n     often appears that the Health Department is barely even \n     looking: There are more than 140,000 hospitals, nursing \n     homes, doctors and other health care providers in the system, \n     but the department visited just 95 in the 2004 fiscal year to \n     audit their billings.\n       Analyzing Medicaid data obtained under the state's Freedom \n     of Information Law, The New York Times identified scores of \n     instances in which the claims of health care providers jumped \n     markedly in a single year. These spikes are a classic \n     indication of possible improper billing, yet few of those \n     providers had even part of their billings audited by the \n     department, state records show. New York's Medicaid program, \n     once the pride of the Great Society era, has become a \n     system ``that almost begs people to steal,'' said Michael \n     A. Zegarelli, a senior New York Medicaid regulator until \n     2003 and a past president of the national association of \n     Medicaid oversight officials.\n       Meanwhile, other states, including California and Texas, \n     have increased their antifraud efforts and discovered what \n     seems a simple truth: The effort to seek out theft and \n     unnecessary spending can more than pay for itself, just as a \n     parking violations bureau brings in revenue. Workers assigned \n     to Medicaid fraud prosecution units around the nation help \n     bring in an average of $200,000 each in recoveries, according \n     to federal statistics.\n       Twenty-five years ago, New York was in the vanguard of \n     fraud prevention. But over the decades it has failed to \n     maintain the investment in employees necessary to close the \n     door on thievery and abuse. Repeated delays stretched the \n     replacement of a 1970's-era computer system that could barely \n     detect fraud into a seven-year ordeal, allowing billions to \n     slip by with little scrutiny.\n\n[[Page S14106]]\n\n       As dozens of former employees describe it, the state's \n     antifraud effort has been plagued by the same gridlock that \n     has stifled innovation in Albany for years: bureaucratic \n     infighting, allegiance to campaign contributors from the \n     health care field, reliance on public indifference.\n       In an interview, Dennis P. Whalen, executive deputy \n     commissioner of the Health Department, said combating fraud \n     remained a major goal. He denied that the department had been \n     lax in policing Medicaid and excluding providers who had \n     cheated the program, saying that new computer systems have \n     improved the state's detection efforts.\n       But State Senator Kemp Hannon, a Nassau County Republican \n     who is chairman of the Senate Health Committee, called The \n     Times's findings deeply troubling, and said they showed that \n     the Medicaid fraud detection system was broken. Mr. Hannon \n     said the Health Department, run by a fellow Republican, Gov. \n     George E. Pataki, was failing to oversee the system.\n       ``This is a red flag for them,'' Mr. Hannon said. ``I have \n     not seen anything that would indicate that there has been any \n     sort of focus at all from the department.''\n       New York's failures have come at a high price, according to \n     advocates for the program's recipients.\n       ``There is all this money that is being drained away and \n     not being spent on care for the poor people who need it,'' \n     said Elisabeth Benjamin, who spent eight years as a lawyer at \n     the Legal Aid Society specializing in Medicaid. ``It's \n     analogous to the $5,000 toilet seat in the military.''\n\n                       Investigation Staff Is Cut\n\n       More than a dozen years ago, in the heyday of the unit \n     charged with fighting Medicaid fraud and abuse in New York \n     City, dozens of state employees would troop out to locations \n     throughout the city for a regular ritual. With reporters in \n     tow, they would serve papers on scores of shady doctors \n     operating low-quality, high-volume clinics known as \n     ``Medicaid mills,'' said James Mehmet, who retired from the \n     State Health Department in 2001. Mr. Mehmet was the unit's \n     chief of investigators in New York City.\n       Most days, more than a dozen investigators went undercover \n     as patients to see how they were treated by a doctor or a \n     pharmacist, and then how their visit was billed. In the \n     office, they worked alongside auditors and lawyers, as well \n     as nurses, dentists and doctors--a full medical review staff.\n       But the energy and ambition of the office have dissipated \n     along with the staff, Mr. Mehmet said. By the time he \n     retired, he said, the 15 lawyers in the office had been \n     reduced to one. The medical review staff was gone. And with \n     the Medicaid budget growing rapidly, it was not the fraud \n     that had diminished, he said, but the will to pursue it.\n       ``The volume of work was so much different,'' Mr. Mehmet \n     said, recalling earlier days. ``The caliber of work was so \n     much different. There was much more emphasis on going after \n     people that were committing fraud and abuse.''\n       Mr. Mehmet and other frustrated former regulators say the \n     drop in the New York City office mirrors the statewide \n     decline in staffing over the last decade, at a time when \n     thieves have become more sophisticated.\n       In the late 1980's, more than 200 people in the New York \n     Medicaid bureaucracy were devoted to fighting fraud and \n     abuse, said Philip J. Natcharian, who directed those efforts \n     until 1990. Now only 50 people, including clerical staff, \n     have that job, along with a few dozen outside contractors, \n     said Mr. Zegarelli, who worked at the Health Department's \n     headquarters in Albany until his retirement. He said that was \n     far too few to be effective, an assessment echoed by four \n     other former senior department officials.\n       The former officials said reducing the fraud force made \n     little sense to them, given the huge increase in Medicaid \n     spending in recent years, which has brought the program to \n     more than 40 percent of the state budget.\n       ``How do you not increase the staff to monitor the largest \n     expenditure in New York State?'' said Mark J. Ives, who \n     directed the state's fraud and abuse efforts until he retired \n     in 1998.\n       One likely result of the staffing decline is that since \n     2000, the amount of money the Health Department has recovered \n     from fraud investigations has fallen by 70 percent, according \n     to data compiled by federal regulators.\n       At the same time, the state has virtually stopped excluding \n     doctors from Medicaid for violating its rules, excluding only \n     eight out of the 43,000 doctors enrolled in the program last \n     year, a Times analysis shows.\n       ``I think the department's reached the point of Smokey the \n     Bear with a shovel,'' Mr. Zegarelli said. ``They're just \n     running around putting out fires.''\n       The former regulators said they did not believe there had \n     been a deliberate decision in Albany to loosen enforcement. \n     Instead, they described a gradual move away from regulation \n     as Albany focused on expanding and plugging holes in the \n     program.\n       ``They want recipients to get medical care,'' said Michael \n     P. Sofarelli, who retired as a Medicaid prosecutor in the \n     attorney general's office in 2003 after handling some of the \n     state's biggest Medicaid fraud cases. ``Investigating is a \n     small part of the job.''\n       The Health Department reports to Governor Pataki, and in \n     recent years, his budget aides have actually reduced goals \n     for recouping money from Medicaid providers for improper \n     billing.\n       The decline of fraud control in New York contrasts sharply \n     with the situation in other states. In 1998, California, \n     which had several high-profile Medicaid fraud cases in the \n     1990's, added about 400 employees to an existing staff of \n     about 40 charged with rooting out abuse. The number of fraud \n     cases referred to prosecutors has since doubled.\n       Officials in Illinois and Ohio, where the Medicaid budgets \n     are roughly a quarter the size of New York's, visited more \n     than three times as many health care providers in the 2004 \n     fiscal year to audit their billings.\n       Mr. Whalen, the executive deputy commissioner of the Health \n     Department, said it frequently stopped Medicaid payments it \n     considered questionable. He acknowledged that the staffing \n     for fraud prevention had dropped, but described the change as \n     insignificant, saying the state employed roughly 400 workers \n     whose jobs involve fighting Medicaid fraud and abuse, \n     supplemented by 200 outside contractors.\n       ``The number, in terms of a pure number, has declined, but \n     I would say that it has not been a huge decline,'' he said.\n       ``Every agency, I am sure, would love to have more staff, \n     and we are no different,'' he said. ``But we are also \n     realistic about the state's fiscal situation.''\n       But former senior department officials said most of the \n     workers cited by Mr. Whalen are not actually investigating \n     fraud. They are accountants, nurses, computer analysts, \n     clerks and others doing administrative jobs, making sure \n     basic regulations are followed, leaving only about 50 state \n     employees dedicated to fraud work.\n       Mr. Whalen and his aides said new computers and software \n     were helping the department shift its focus from reviewing \n     Medicaid claims already paid to preventing questionable \n     claims from being paid in the first place.\n       But state statistics show that the department rejected a \n     much smaller percentage of claims in the 2004 fiscal year \n     than its counterparts in California, Florida or Pennsylvania.\n       Asked to list cases that they developed that led to arrests \n     and prosecutions, Health Department officials could point to \n     only a handful in the last two years.\n       The result of the cuts is evident in case after case that \n     the state simply missed. The billings of a Queens pharmacist, \n     Newton Igbinaduwa, rose to more than $1.4 million in 2002 \n     from $78,000 in 1998, according to billing records analyzed \n     by The Times. But the department never referred the case to \n     the state attorney general's office.\n       It was only when prosecutors in the attorney general's \n     office got a tip through another case that they found out \n     about Mr. Igbinaduwa, who pleaded guilty last year to grand \n     larceny after billing for drugs he never dispensed.\n\n                        Prosecution Unit Shrinks\n\n       The Health Department is only half of the dwindling \n     security force posted outside Medicaid's gate. The \n     responsibility for prosecuting Medicaid fraud lies with the \n     state attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, who runs the Medicaid \n     Fraud Control Unit. And in the attorney general's office, \n     too, Medicaid abuse has had a reduced priority for more than \n     15 years, with far fewer prosecutors than it had in the days \n     when Medicaid was a much leaner program.\n       Though New York has the largest Medicaid fraud prosecution \n     staff in the country, several other states have fraud offices \n     that are larger in proportion to the size of their Medicaid \n     budgets, and they recover a larger percentage from fraud \n     prosecutions. As a percentage of the overall Medicaid budget, \n     New York's 301 employees won less than half as much as those \n     in Texas, Florida and New Jersey, according to statistics \n     compiled by the federal government for its 2003 fiscal year.\n       Mr. Spitzer's office said New York used a more conservative \n     method of calculating recoveries than other states, but even \n     using that method, New York still fails to make the nation's \n     top 15 states in the amount recovered as a percentage of the \n     overall Medicaid budget, going back as far as 1999.\n       Mr. Spitzer's zeal in fighting corporate abuses has not \n     been matched by his efforts in fighting Medicaid fraud, \n     former employees say.\n       ``I didn't think there was that much focus at the main \n     office,'' said John M. Meekins, who retired in 2003 as the \n     director of the Albany regional office of the Medicaid Fraud \n     Control Unit. Referring to Mr. Spitzer, he added: ``I'm not \n     faulting the man. His focus was on Wall Street.''\n       Mr. Spitzer said his office had made strides, especially in \n     investigating the abuse of nursing home residents. The fraud \n     unit's prosecutors have made a philosophical shift, he said, \n     cutting back on the number of inquiries to concentrate on \n     what they consider cases with bigger impact, which could lead \n     to industrywide changes.\n       ``The strategies that we have pursued have made sense and \n     have been successful,'' Mr. Spitzer said.\n       However, the attorney general's office has had few such \n     breakthroughs. None have shaken the health care industry in \n     the manner of his successes on Wall Street and in the \n     insurance industry, or the inquiries into nursing homes \n     conducted by his predecessors in the 1970's.\n       The relatively low profile given to antifraud efforts dates \n     to before Mr. Spitzer's term in office. The size of the fraud \n     control unit dropped by more than 40 percent between 1979 and \n     the early 1990's. Even after\n\n[[Page S14107]]\n\n     Mr. Spitzer became attorney general in 1999, the size of the \n     fraud unit remained about 300 workers, the same as in the \n     early 1990's. Back then, though, Medicaid cost about $14 \n     billion a year, and its cost has since more than tripled.\n       The state could have a much larger prosecution force with a \n     relatively small investment, because the federal government \n     has made a standing offer to pay three-fourths of the cost, \n     and New York's current allotment is well under the maximum. \n     If the state spent an additional $24 million on its fraud \n     prosecution unit, the unit's current budget of $45.7 million \n     would more than triple to $148 million, mostly from the \n     federal match.\n       Mr. Spitzer said state budget officials had repeatedly \n     demanded hiring freezes for his office.\n       ``The possibility of increasing simply has not been \n     presented by the Department of Budget,'' he said, emphasizing \n     that he believed that hiring more staff members made sense.\n       Last year, Mr. Spitzer said, the fraud unit recovered a \n     record amount in overpayments: $62.5 million, up from $40 \n     million in 2003. But the higher figure includes $30.8 million \n     that was New York's share of a major nationwide settlement \n     with two pharmaceutical companies over drug pricing. That \n     case was spearheaded by federal prosecutors, not New York \n     officials.\n\n                    Behind the Scenes, Turf Battles\n\n       The Health Department and the attorney general's office \n     must contend not only with growing fraud and depleted \n     resources but also with another opposing force: each other. \n     Over the years, they have accused each other of foot-\n     dragging, incompetence, or resistance to change. Their mutual \n     animosity and suspicion have come at the expense of the \n     battle against fraud.\n       By law, it is the Health Department, not the attorney \n     general's office, that is primarily responsible for \n     identifying fraud. But the department's principal task is to \n     keep the huge flow of payments moving swiftly, and at this \n     point, with its shrunken enforcement bureau, the department \n     sends very few cases to prosecutors.\n       Former officials of both departments say their different \n     missions have left them clashing instead of cooperating.\n       Former prosecutors complained that Medicaid regulators \n     often crippled their criminal cases by suing those they \n     suspected of overbilling in civil court, hoping to get some \n     money back to the system before the attorney general filed \n     criminal charges. In those cases, prosecutors said, the state \n     would often settle a case quickly for only a fraction of the \n     amount overbilled.\n       Mr. Spitzer, a Democratic candidate for governor, said his \n     prosecutors could not depend on the Health Department.\n       ``They are just not a useful resource for us in the sense \n     of providing us with ideas, places to look, referrals,'' he \n     said.\n       Asked about Mr. Spitzer's criticism, a department \n     spokesman, William C. Van Slyke, said, ``We believe that his \n     political ambitions are the motivation for his comments, as \n     opposed to the facts.''\n       Former Health Department officials said that when they \n     turned over evidence of fraud to the attorney general's \n     office, the prosecutors often took months or even years to \n     piece together a case, all while the fraudulent activity \n     continued to siphon money from the system. Medicaid officials \n     said they preferred a civil case to stop the fraud \n     immediately.\n       ``They were malingerers,'' said Mr. Ives, former director \n     of the department's fraud section. ``They would take forever \n     and ever to process a case.''\n       Mr. Van Slyke said 70 percent of the cases the department \n     referred to the attorney general's office since 2000 were \n     still open. The office responded that many of those cases \n     were fully investigated but just not technically closed.\n       Whatever the cause of the tensions, the department refers \n     far fewer cases to prosecutors than its counterparts in other \n     large states. Texas referred nearly seven times as many cases \n     to its Medicaid prosecutors as New York did in the last \n     fiscal year. California referred nearly four times as many, \n     and Ohio more than three times as many.\n\n                            Resisting Reform\n\n       In the fight against fraud, New York's inadequate arsenal \n     is not an accident. In Albany, reformers have repeatedly been \n     outspent and outmaneuvered by the health care industry.\n       Several large states, including California, Florida and \n     Illinois, have laws that encourage whistleblowers to come \n     forward with information about fraud schemes, offering them a \n     portion of any money recovered. There is a similar federal \n     law to fight fraud in Medicare, the program for the elderly \n     and disabled.\n       But when Mr. Spitzer has had this type of bill, called a \n     false claims act, introduced in New York, it has died. The \n     bill was denounced by the Healthcare Association of New York \n     State, which represents hospitals, nursing homes and other \n     providers, as well as the State Medical Society, which \n     represents doctors. The groups, which spend millions annually \n     on lobbying and campaign contributions, predicted that the \n     bill would lead to an epidemic of frivolous allegations.\n       ``New York State's health care provider community has faced \n     unprecedented, overzealous investigations by regulators and \n     law enforcement officials,'' the association said in a memo.\n       Daniel Sisto, president of the association, said that its \n     members believed that federal officials had used \n     inappropriate tactics to crack down on fraud, and that they \n     had fought the whistleblower law out of fear that the state \n     would follow suit. He said the group's members faced a raft \n     of different requirements from Medicaid, Medicare and \n     numerous private insurance companies, and as a result made \n     billing mistakes that were wrongly criminalized.\n       ``What concerns me from our past experiences is that there \n     is overzealousness in the interpretations of any overpayments \n     as fraud and abuse,'' Mr. Sisto said.\n       In May, the Republican-controlled State Senate approved \n     legislation, sponsored by Senator Dean G. Skelos of Nassau \n     County, that would create an independent Medicaid inspector \n     general. The measure would take away some of the \n     responsibility for combating fraud from the Health Department \n     and the attorney general's office and give it to the new \n     agency and to local prosecutors.\n       Mr. Pataki and Mr. Spitzer opposed the measure, as did the \n     Democratic majority in the State Assembly, which has long \n     allied itself with large health care lobbies and unions. \n     Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried, a Manhattan Democrat who is \n     chairman of the Health Committee, said he did not believe \n     that the system needed to be changed.\n       Asked whether the Democrats would take any action on the \n     issue, Mr. Gottfried said, ``Maybe that would be a good one \n     for us to hold hearings on in the fall.''\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, it is estimated that the fraud in New York \nState is $14 billion a year in Medicaid alone, of which the Federal \nGovernment pays two-thirds. In 5 years, solving the Medicaid fraud in \nNew York would pay for every savings we have claimed in this whole bill \nfor the next 5 years.\n  Examples: St. Barnabas Health Care System agreed to settle $3.9 \nmillion in claims it overcharged Medicare; the Premium Health Care \nGroup, $1.6 million for fraudulent wound-care claims; Michael Clemens, \nFBI special agent--$1 billion in Medicare fraud in south Florida alone.\n  If you add up what is going on in Medicare and Medicaid, $37.5 \nbillion a year at a minimum is fraud and yet we are trying to save a \nmeasly two-tenths of 1 percent in terms of slowing the growth.\n  We haven't gone far enough. For somebody to reject this bill on the \nfact that we might not meet our obligations on Medicare and Medicaid--\nthe obligation isn't being met in terms of the oversight of these \nprograms.\n  I wish to spend a few moments talking about Medicaid fraud because it \nis important for people to know what a poor job we are doing in terms \nof oversight.\n  Investigators estimate that as much as $18 billion worth of fraud \noccurs every year in New York alone on Medicaid. That is 5 percent of \nthe total national spending on Medicaid in one State. One New York \ndentist, Dr. Dolly Rosen, claimed to have performed 991 procedures a \nday in 2003--991 procedures a day. The New York Medicaid Program \nconsumes $44.5 billion. It is the most costly and generous in the \nNation. In the article that I mentioned, James Mehmet, the retired \nchief investigator of Medicaid fraud in New York City, says that at \nleast 10 percent of that was spent on fraudulent claims.\n  We can, if we will do the oversight, accomplish what we need to in \nterms of doing the hard work, and the reductions in the expenditures \nwon't have any impact on those who are truly needy for Medicare and \nMedicaid. What they will have an impact on is the criminals who are \ndefrauding the American taxpayers by billing for services they have not \nperformed.\n  Other examples: Schering-Plough agreed to pay $335.5 million back to \nMedicaid this last year on the basis of fraud and an elevated billing \nprocess.\n  The other thing estimated in New York, to build the case a little \nfurther, this same James Mehmet estimates as much as 30 percent of the \nbudget--10 percent of it is fraud; 30 percent of it is abuse. If only \nhalf of that is inappropriate payments, we are up to 25 percent or up \nto $12 billion a year. Again, that is in one State. If we did the \noversight, changed the rules, increased the punishment, held people \naccountable, every bit of savings in this bill could be paid for by \nMedicaid fraud in New York State alone.\n  The question is, are we going to do what we need to do as a Senate, \nin the future? This bill is a first good step. It does a lot of things \nin terms of Medicaid, of creating a new Medicaid task force to go after \nfraud.\n\n[[Page S14108]]\n\n  We can do much more. To do less says we do not have the Christmas \nspirit, the spirit of giving, the spirit of sacrifice.\n  I close on this one note. Most everyone listening out there has \nchildren and grandchildren. When you think about your grandchildren, \nwhat do you think? What is it you desire for them? What is it you want \nfor them? When we hear the rhetoric--whether it is from the AARP or \nother groups--discounting the fact that we are going to slow down the \ngrowth in Medicare and Medicaid, and doing it not by taking away \nbenefits for those who are truly needy but by doing the job we should \nbe doing, when we do that, we give a gift to our children and to our \ngrandchildren.\n  I want opportunity for my grandchildren. I don't want them to be \ngiven anything. I want them to be given the gift of having an \nopportunity to attain it. I want to create an economic environment in \nthe future that is sustainable. We are not sustainable today. I want \nevery grandparent out there to think, do they want something for \nthemselves today that is going to be paid for by their grandchildren 20 \nyears from now?\n  That is the real issue. That is the whole center of the entire debate \nin Congress today as we debate these contentious issues on how we spend \nor do not spend money. It is a simple question. Take now and charge it \nto your grandchildren. Take now and take away their opportunity for \nhomeownership. Don't do anything now because it might not be \npolitically popular, but undermine any future your children and \ngrandchildren have. That is described as selfishness. That is the exact \nopposite of the spirit of giving.\n  America is better than that. America's heritage is better than that. \nThe American people are better than that. The problem is, we do not \nunderstand what is before the Senate, the obligations and the great \nresponsibilities before us. We were sent here to make the hard choices. \nIf you are listening today, listen to the rumble, the rumble that is \nout there in the American public. They want us to do the hard work of \ntrimming the waste, of trimming the fraud, of trimming the abuse. They \nwant us to eliminate our political earmarks to pay for the things that \nare necessary for this country--not pay for the things that get us \nreelected. There is a rumble. The rumble is real. The American people \nare paying attention that we should be doing the hard and heavy lifting \nof making the tough choices.\n  This bill is a start. It should go much further. It should be $100 to \n$200 billion of reduced spending through fraud. If there is truly $35 \nbillion a year in wasteful, fraudulent, improper payments for Medicare \nand Medicaid, that is $18 billion for Medicaid, $19 billion for \nMedicare. That is $37 billion a year. In 10 years we can save $370 \nbillion. This chart I had up will show a better future for our children \nand our grandchildren.\n  I ask the Members of the Senate to make sure we pass this bill. This \nis a start. It does not have anything to do with the tax cut. There is \nnot going to be any tax cut unless we get spending under control. To \nnot want to get spending under control means Members do not want to \ngive an opportunity for advancement in the future for our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  Grandparents, this is about our grandkids. I have four grandchildren. \nI wish I had 20. But more than that, I wish for them the same \nopportunities that have been there for us, the same opportunities that \nthe great generation fought for and gave us such wonderful blessings. \nThe same opportunities for every veteran we have had who has fought and \ndied and been injured and the sacrifices they have made--are they in \nvain if we do not have the same type of courage, the same type of \ncommitment that those who serve our country in our armed services have?\n  We can do no less than to start down the hard road of making \ndifficult choices. This is the first one. They are going to get harder \nas we face the economic perils in front of us and the commitments we \nhave made that right now we cannot keep. We either change them or the \nAmerican people are going to change us.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COBURN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I applaud the Senator from Oklahoma for not only his \nstatement but also for his continued commitment to fiscal discipline \nhere and in trying to identify much of the wasteful and unnecessary \nspending.\n  I wonder if the Senator from Oklahoma has had a chance to look at the \nDefense appropriations bill we are going to consider tomorrow and see \nsome examples of the interesting earmarks out of a conference report. \nIs the Senator aware of $500,000 to teach science to grade school \nstudents in Pennsylvania or $3.85 million for the Intrepid Sea-Air-\nSpace Foundation or $4.4 million for a Technology Center in Missouri or \n$1 million to a Civil War Center in Richmond, VA, or $850,000 for an \neducation center and public park in Des Moines, Iowa, or $2 million for \na public park in San Francisco or $500,000 for the Arctic Winter Games, \nan international athletic competition held this year in Alaska?\n  Museums are popular this year, including $1.5 million for an aviation \nmuseum in Seattle, $1.35 million for an aviation museum in Hawaii, $1 \nmillion for a museum in Pennsylvania, $3 million for a museum in Fort \nBelvoir.\n  There are more, I say to my friend from Oklahoma, and we are at war. \nI wonder how many MREs, flak vests, or bullets we could buy with all \nthis money.\n  I appreciate the Senator's support for this budgetary measure, but \nhow do we tell people we are going to cut food stamps and reduce \neligibility for welfare while we are taking the money that is for \ndefense, in the tens of millions of dollars on this Defense \nappropriations bill, put in a conference report that none of us ever \nsaw or read until right now, I ask the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I am happy to respond. As the Senator knows, on the \nconference report I am unable to offer amendments to eliminate those \nthings. As the Senator well knows, also, I have started down a track \nwhere I am going to confront earmarks in the Senate or we are going to \nchange that.\n  With that, I offered on almost every appropriations bill what was \ncalled a sunshine amendment. That will be offered again in the House \nnext year, and when we come to conferences, the ability to put in \nextraneous earmarks has got to be limited.\n  I would, however, answer the Senator. Having had an oversight hearing \non food stamps, we spend $1.6 billion in giving food stamps to people \nwho do not qualify, who have more than the capability to take care of \nthemselves. That is at a rate of 6.9 percent of every person who comes \nto attest for food stamps.\n  So I believe the same thing can be said for the Food Stamp Program \nthat we can say about Medicare and Medicaid, that we need to run a \nbill. We need to have better oversight. We need to check it so the \nfraud and abuse is out of it.\n  As the Senator knows, I do not like earmarks because I believe they \ncompromise the operation of good government. I think they buy votes \nwhen votes would not be there. I think the Government has grown because \nof the force of earmarks.\n  So I am not aware of those specific things. I have not looked at it, \nto answer the Senator's question. But I am not happy they are there.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for one more question?\n  Mr. COBURN. I will.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Not only do we have the earmarks in outrageous and \ndisgraceful pork-barreling on this bill--again, that none of us ever \nsaw until my staff went through this bill--but there is also a great \ndeal of legislation. Remember, this is the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill. So it is not just the money, it is also policies \nand major policy decisions.\n  There are avian flu vaccine limitation of liability provisions. I \ntell the Senator from Oklahoma, I do not know if that is worthwhile or \nnot, but it has been jammed into a Department of Defense appropriations \nbill.\n  There is funding for farm conservation. There is a provision \nprotecting jobs in--guess where--Hawaii and Alaska. And there is a \nprovision that transfers, as a direct lump-sum payment to the \nUniversity of Alaska, the unobligated and unexpended balances \nappropriated to the United States-Canada Railroad Commission.\n  Does the Senator from Oklahoma have a clue what that is all about?\n  Mr. COBURN. No, I do not.\n\n[[Page S14109]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Here we are again, I say to my colleague from Oklahoma, \nwhen everybody wants to get out of town examining bils that have all \nkinds of things in them that we never saw or heard of.\n  In the Statement of Managers, there is $1.6 million for the Lewis and \nClark bicentennial activities. The list goes on. There is $7 million \nfor the Alaska Land Mobile Radio.\n  I ask my friend from Oklahoma, don't you think the American people \nare fed up with this kind of stuff? And don't you think it is time a \ngroup of us, who have been meeting and talking about eliminating some \nof these practices, get together and make things tough on the floor of \nthis Senate next year to reign in this out-of-control, disgraceful, \nobscene conduct that goes on on these appropriation bills?\n  Mr. COBURN. As the Senator knows, I believe we do a disservice to our \ncountry in the way we manipulate appropriations. I have been very vocal \non that. But I also know it requires courage to stand up. And the \nAmerican people are expecting that. They are going to see that this \nnext year on the floor of the Senate. They are going to see a process \nby which every earmark is challenged in the bills that come before us \nand in the bills that come out of conference.\n  What I do know--and I will finish my statement with this--is every \neconomist and every elected official in this country, in this body, \nknows we are on an unsustainable course. Everybody knows that. \nEverybody is aware of that. Slowing the rate of growth of programs is \ncompassionate. It is not lacking in compassion. If you do not slow the \nrate of growth, the very people you want to help will not be helped in \nthe future. It is compassionate to keep your obligations. The way to \nkeep your obligations is to change the programs so we pay for them out \nof the waste, fraud, and abuse that is involved.\n  Most people who oppose this bill do not have a good alternative. They \ndo not have a good alternative. The plan of never-ending expansion, \nunsustainable commitments, is the surest way to deny benefits and \ncoverage to the very people we want to help in the long run. It is the \nonly way we are going to be able to do it. We cannot continue to avoid \nthe tough choices, and we cannot continue to avoid prioritizing and to \ngrow government as we like. We cannot do what we have done in the past. \nThe economic conditions will not allow it. The American people are not \ngoing to allow it.\n  It is time, and it starts January first--it starts here with this \nbill, but it starts in the next session of Congress. It is going to be \ndifferent. It is going to be difficult. But we are going to make the \ntough choices.\n  With that, I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I just want to note that the exchange, \nwhich was very informative, between the Senator from Arizona and the \nSenator from Oklahoma was in relationship to the Defense bill, and we \nare on the deficit reduction bill. Those items which the Senator from \nArizona raised--he certainly has a legitimate right to raise them--are \nnot applicable to this bill but applicable to the Defense \nappropriations conference report. This bill actually reduces the \ndeficit by $40 billion, which is a very positive event.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If I may continue, Mr. President, America is at war. We \nall know that, and that is why the measure we are debating today, the \nconference report to H.R. 2863, the 2006 Defense appropriations bill, \nis so very important. This conference report provides critical \nfinancing for our fighting men and women, the brave individuals we sent \nto fight in our name. We must support them, and, for that reason, I \nwill vote in favor of its passage. But I do so under protest.\n  The conference report appropriates nearly $408 billion, plus an \nadditional $50 billion in emergency funding for operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. The non-emergency portion is approximately $4.5 billion \nunder the administration's request, but is several billions higher than \nthe Senate bill. As is the case with so many of the appropriations \nbills that come to the floor, this conference report and the joint \nexplanatory statement contain earmarks and pork projects that were \nneither requested nor authorized.\n  War means sacrifice--any student of history knows that--and Americans \nhave sacrificed throughout our efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Our \nsoldiers and their families have sacrificed, and this year other costs \nhave spread throughout the Nation. Whether it is the victims of \nHurricane Katrina, or those that have come to their aid or simply all \nthose Americans who are paying higher gasoline prices, we see \nsacrifices of many kinds. And so in these difficult times, the American \npeople are right to expect their elected leaders to sacrifice as well.\n  But then we see a bill like the one on the floor today, and I am sure \nmany Americans wonder if the spirit of sacrifice stops on the steps of \nthe U.S. Capitol. During a war, in a measure designed to give our \nfighting men and women the funds they need, the Congress has given in \nto its worst pork-barrel instincts.\n  Let's take a look at some of the earmarks that are in this Defense \nappropriations conference report: $500,000 to teach science to grade \nschool students in Pennsylvania; $3.85 million for the Intrepid Sea-\nAir-Space Foundation; $4.4 million for a technology center in Missouri; \n$1 million to an Civil War center in Richmond, VA; $850,000 for an \neducation center and public park in Des Moines, IA; $2 million for a \npublic park in San Francisco; and $500,000 for the Arctic Winter Games, \nan international athletic competition held this year in Alaska. And \nmuseums are popular this year. There is $1.5 million for an aviation \nmuseum in Seattle, $1.35 million for an aviation museum in Hawaii, $1 \nmillion for a museum in Pennsylvania, and $3 million for the museum at \nFort Belvoir. There is also $1.5 million for restoring the battleship \nTexas.\n\n  We are at war. How many MREs, flak-vests, or bullets could we buy \nwith all this money? How many dollars could we return to the taxpayers? \nI would note that these are just a small sampling of the many, many \nunrequested earmarks that fill this bill.\n  But perhaps we are being too hard on ourselves. After all, the \nconference report includes a number of provisions that will rescind \nunobligated balances in Federal accounts, so we are offsetting a small \nportion of some of these needless costs. But wait a minute. There is \nalways a catch. While the conference report rescinds $10 million from \nthe Natural Resources Conservation Service Operations account, it also \nincludes language to prevent any cuts to the projects and activities \nidentified on pages 84 to 87 of the House report that accompanies the \nAgriculture appropriations bill. And if you review that report, you \nwill find 108 earmarked projects totaling more than $103 million. A few \nexamples of the projects that the appropriators are committed to \nprotecting from any reductions, even for the sake of fiscal \nresponsibility, include:\n  $242,000 for a wildlife habitat education program in conjunction with \nthe National Wild Turkey Federation in Illinois, which is dedicated to \nconserving wild turkeys and preserving our Nation's hunting heritage.\n  $100,000 for the Trees Forever Program in Iowa--an organization with \na laudable mission statement--it claims to be an organization that not \nonly plants and cares for trees, but also addresses the challenges \nfacing our communities and the environment--but hardly one that should \nbe funded in a Defense appropriations bill.\n  $400,000 for dairy waste remediation in Louisiana.\n  $600,000 for conservation related to cranberry production in \nMassachusetts and Wisconsin. Conservation related to cranberry \nproduction. Remarkable.\n  $200,000 for Weed It Now--Taconic Mountains--MA/NY/CT. Weed It Now, I \nam told, is an effort to remove invasive plants from the forest habitat \nof the Berkshire Taconic plateau. I am a strong supporter of the global \nwar on weeds, Mr. President, but this earmark does not belong in this \nbill.\n\n  Clearly, such projects should not be asked to spare a dime.\n  Beyond the earmarks, Mr. President, it is a violation of Senate rules \nto legislate on an appropriation bill, unless, as is the case with \nseveral sections of the detainee provisions in title 10, they are added \npursuant to a rule 16 defense of germaneness. And yet this rule is \nflouted far too often. This bill not only\n\n[[Page S14110]]\n\ncontains numerous authorizing provisions, but it also features dozens \nof provisions, both authorizing and appropriating, that are wholly \noutside of the scope of defense policy. Some of these are included to \npursue laudable policy objectives; some are not. A sampling of the non-\ngermane provisions includes: the hurricane supplemental: $29 billion \nfor hurricane victims; the Gulf Coast Recovery Fund; avian flu vaccine \nlimitation of liability provisions; a provision that directs funds from \nthe Digital Transition and Public Safety Fund that are in excess of $12 \nbillion to be spent on, among other things, the Tucson, Arizona Border \nPatrol sector, $30 million, the San Diego sector fence, $20 million, \nand to carry out the North American Wetlands Conservation Act, $50 \nmillion; 1.5 billion for home heating energy assistance; funding for \nfarm conservation; a provision protecting jobs in Hawaii and Alaska; a \nprovision transferring as a direct lump sum payment to the University \nof Alaska the unobligated and unexpended balances appropriated to the \nUnited States-Canada Railroad Commission; and, of course, the ANWR \nprovisions, which I will discuss in a moment.\n  Mr. President, some of these provisions are very important. Others \nclearly are not. But whether or not they are important, we should \nfollow the standing rules of the Senate. We should debate these \nprovisions and have the opportunity to offer amendments.\n  Division C of this conference report authorizes the exploration, \nleasing, development, production, and transportation of oil and gas in \nand from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, ANWR. This provision does \nnot belong in an appropriations bill to fund our troops who are \nfighting the war on terror.\n  Drilling in ANWR is, of course, the reason we are here today. When \nconferees tried to add these provisions to the reconciliation measure, \nthey could not get the votes to include it in the final agreement \nwithout putting passage of the whole package in jeopardy. So instead \nthe conference managers have circumvented Senate rules and added this \nunrelated and controversial measure to the Defense conference report.\n  Thanks to this additional language, enactment of the Defense funding \nbill has been needlessly delayed and continues at this moment to be the \ntarget of a filibuster. I strongly oppose this inclusion of this \nlanguage in the DOD appropriations conference report, and I am appalled \nby the tactics that have been used to arm-twist and pressure Senators \nto choose between a drilling provision that they know is wrong and \nproviding desperately needed funding for our Nation's troops.\n  And the ANWR provisions didn't come free, of course. The proponents \nhad to come up with a slew of sweeteners in an effort to win support \nfor drilling in the Arctic. Let's look at a few of these.\n  Division D directs an additional $1.5 billion, designated as \nemergency spending, for Low-Income Home Energy Assistance. The same \ndivision establishes a Gulf Coast Recovery and Disaster Prevention and \nAssistance Fund, which would be funded largely through ANWR oil and gas \nrevenues. Another set of provisions addresses the Digital Transition \nand Public Safety Fund, established by the budget reconciliation \nconference report. The CBO estimates that this ``spectrum fund'' will \ngenerate $10 billion, but the conference report we are debating today \nfigures out how to spend revenues in excess of $10 billion. After $10 \nbillion, the next $2 billion will be directed to the Gulf Coast Fund. \nAlready planning how to spend money that exceeds the level the CBO \nprojects we will have. Sound familiar, Mr. President?\n  So CBO says we can plan on $10 billion from the spectrum fund. If we \nsomehow get to $12 billion in revenue, the excess goes to the Gulf \nCoast. So you think we would stop there. But, no, we go further, \nplanning how to spend the next $4 billion on the chance that the \nspectrum fund generates still more money. The conference report directs \nthat distributions over $12 billion be earmarked as: $900 million for \nconservation programs through the Department of Agriculture; $50 \nmillion to carry out the North American Wetlands Conservation Act; $50 \nmillion to protect grassland and wetland habitats; $1 billion for \nInteroperable Communications Equipment to assist State and local \ngovernment preparation for a natural disaster or terrorist attack; $1 \nbillion to assist State and local government preparation for a natural \ndisaster or terrorist attack; $80 million to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to replace and upgrade law enforcement communications; $30 \nmillion to replace Border Patrol vehicles; $490 million for Air and \nMarine Interdiction, Operations, Maintenance and Procurement to replace \nair assets, including $40 million for helicopter replacement; $372 \nmillion for Air and Marine Interdiction, Operations, Maintenance and \nProcurement to construct and renovate air facilities; $30 million for \nTucson, AZ Border Patrol sector for tactical infrastructure; $20 \nmillion for San Diego, CA Border Patrol sector for the sector \nconference; $30 million for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to \nreplace detention and removal vehicles; and $17.9 million for Federal \nLaw Enforcement Training Center for construction of a language training \nfacility.\n\n  While the border security projects I have just mentioned are \nimportant, will they come to fruition? Not until the spectrum revenues \nexceed the CBO's estimate--first by $2 billion, and then by $4 billion \non top of that. So only when the fund hits $16 billion would all these \nfunds actually be distributed. This entire scheme reminds me of the \nsaying by Wimpy, the hamburger-obsessed character from the Popeye \ncomic, ``I'll gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.''\n  In addition to everything I have described in the conference report, \nthe statement of managers that accompanies it also includes hundreds of \nearmarks and questionable projects. Here are just a few examples: $1.6 \nmillion for Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Activities; $30 million for \ncontinued development of the Joint Common Missile--a program that DOD \ncancelled this year; $10 million to restructure the Advanced SEAL \nDelivery System--over half a billion dollars has been spent over the \nlast 9 years, with no deployable vehicles yet fielded, U.S. Special \nOperations Command has cancelled plans for future boats; $3.2 million \nfor Handheld High Intensity Searchlights; and $7 million for the Alaska \nLand Mobile Radio.\n  Mr. President, despite high gas prices, despite a swelling budget \ndeficit, despite our military operations overseas, and despite our \ndomestic emergencies, pork continues to thrive in good times and bad. \nThe cumulative effect of these earmarks is the erosion of the integrity \nof the appropriations process, and by extension, our responsibility to \nthe taxpayer. We must do better, for our soldiers and for the American \npeople.\n  We have to fix this system, Mr. President. Our system is broken if we \ncannot pass a Defense bill in wartime without billions of dollars in \npork. Our system is broken if we cannot fund our troops without tacking \non legislation that opens ANWR to drilling. Our system is broken if our \nnational security is at stake and we carry on spending for the special \ninterests as if nothing were wrong. But there is something wrong, \nsomething very wrong. We want to have it all without making any \nsacrifices, so we simply borrow the money, pushing off the obligations \nto our children and our grandchildren. ANWR is a perfect example of \nthat. We drill today in the false hope that doing so will solve our \nenergy problems, but in doing so we leave future generations with a \ndegraded environment and the same dependence on oil that we have today.\n  In his farewell address, President Dwight D. Eisenhower reflected on \nthe spending he believed to be excessive. His words then are all the \nmore powerful in today's out of control environment: ``As we peer into \nsociety's future,'' he said, ``we--you and I, and our government--must \navoid the impulse to live only for today, plundering, for our own ease \nand convenience, the precious resources of tomorrow. We cannot mortgage \nthe material assets of our grandchildren without risking the loss also \nof their political and spiritual heritage. We want democracy to survive \nfor all generations to come, not to become the insolvent phantom of \ntomorrow.''\n  And yet, I say to my colleagues, if we cannot change, if we will not \nchange, we risk precisely that--becoming the insolvent phantom of \ntomorrow. I wonder what President Eisenhower would think of this mess. \nBut, then, perhaps\n\n[[Page S14111]]\n\nothers have contemplated the same question. After all, this bill \nincludes a $1.7 million earmark for a memorial on the National Mall \nthat would honor none other than Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we are going back and forth. And I think \nthere was a tacit understanding Senator Salazar would be next.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Colorado yield me 30 \nseconds after he is recognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I yield 30 seconds to my friend from \nArizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for the Senator \nfrom Colorado to yield me 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He has yielded you 30 seconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have brought it up, I say to my friend \nfrom New Hampshire, because you cannot take away with one hand and give \nwith the other. What we are doing in this very vital Defense \nappropriations bill, again, is larded down with unnecessary, unwanted, \nunessential, disgraceful spending that I find unacceptable. As the \nSenator from Oklahoma said, we are going to start doing something about \nit, and the sooner the better.\n  I thank my friend from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, let me at the outset say to my friend \nfrom Arizona and my friend from Oklahoma that I think in the years \nahead, hopefully, we can embark on programs such as pay-go to make sure \nthat both on the revenue side and the expenditure side of the program \nwe are able to bring our budget into balance. I look forward to working \nwith them on those issues in the future.\n  Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak briefly, first, about \nthe spending reconciliation conference report. The spending \nreconciliation conference report, from my point of view, falls short of \nmaking sure we are funding the most significant priorities of the \nAmerican people.\n  Now, today, there will be debate about many of the points over which \nthere is disagreement. I wish to focus, very briefly, on two things \nthat, to me, are very essential in terms of what we prioritize and fund \nin this Government for the American people.\n  First, with respect to the forgotten America--with respect to \nagriculture, with respect to those counties and communities that are \nout there in every one of our States all across this great land of \nAmerica, those communities that are mostly dependent on agriculture, \nwhere rural economic development means one job at a time and sometimes \nlosing one or two jobs at a time, those communities that are withering \non the vine--when I look at this reconciliation measure, what we have \nhere is a $934 million cut for Conservation Programs. I do not think \nthat is standing up for the farmers who are so dependent on these very \nimportant programs across America.\n  Secondly, we have a cut of roughly $400 million for rural \ndevelopment. We think about counties such as some counties in my State. \nIn fact, my native county has an unemployment rate of close to 12 \npercent. We look at creating economic opportunities for those \ncommunities. It is, from my point of view, a step in the wrong \ndirection to be taking money from rural development.\n  I think we, as a Senate, as a Congress, and the President of the \nUnited States, should be putting more of a focus on these communities \nthat have been forgotten decade after decade. My hope is we are able to \nchange course on the future agenda for rural America.\n  Secondly, I wish to briefly comment on student programs. Student \nprograms in this budget we have before us are going to be cut $12 \nbillion. Some of us understand the importance of what student programs \nhave done for all of us. I come from a family where we have eight \nfirst-generation college graduates. Born, like some other Members of \nthis Chamber, into humble circumstances, we did not have electricity \nand we did not have telephones when we were growing up. But we had \nparents who strongly believed in education, and we had an America that \nsaid: There is an America of opportunity for everyone regardless of \nyour background. The result of that was that all eight of us became \nfirst-generation college graduates.\n  Yet when you look at this budget that is before us today, it will cut \n$12 billion from student programs. To me, that is a disinvestment in \nAmerica's future. It is something that causes me to say I will vote \nagainst this reconciliation measure that is before us today.\n  Mr. President, in the time remaining, many comments have been made on \nthe PATRIOT Act. I will make a few brief comments on that this \nafternoon. I see my great friend from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, \nwho has labored on this matter for a long time.\n  I step aside to no one in my own desire to fight the terrorist threat \nthat we face in America and in my support for giving my brothers and \nsisters in law enforcement and our Federal agencies, including the FBI, \nall the authority they must have in order to keep America safe. We need \nto reauthorize the PATRIOT Act. That is my goal. I believe that is our \nresponsibility as a Congress.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the political games surrounding the \ndebate over the last several weeks are not worthy of this body, not \nworthy of America. Instead of a reasonable debate between patriots on \nhow best to reauthorize the PATRIOT Act, we get political threats and \nour patriotism is questioned. The President of the United States says \nthat Senators wanting to protect the Constitution are acting \nirresponsibly. These assertions, in my view, are wrong. The \nConstitution still matters today. Our liberties still matter. If \nsomeone does not believe these things, I believe they are wrong. There \ncan be no greater patriot than the Republicans and Democrats who come \ntogether to fight for upholding principles of our Constitution and \ngiving law enforcement the tools they need to protect our homeland.\n  Senator Gregg, one of the fiercest defenders of the second amendment \nin this Senate is a true patriot. Senator Hagel, one of this body's \ndistinguished military veterans, is a true patriot and I am proud of \nhim. Senators Murkowski, Sununu, Feingold, and Durbin are all good \npatriots. All of my colleagues who have been working to try to come to \nsome resolution, I believe, are doing the right thing because they are \nstanding up to protect America's freedoms as enshrined in our \nConstitution.\n  Mr. President, I believe we can do what is the responsible thing, and \nwith the potential expiration of the PATRIOT Act at the end of 2005 \nunder current law, the responsibility lays with the White House and \nwith this body to make sure we extend the PATRIOT Act so we can \ncontinue to come to a conclusion with respect to a PATRIOT Act that \nboth protects the civil liberties of Americans and at the same time \ngives law enforcement the tools they need.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has spoken for 7 minutes. The \nSenator has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Let me point to two provisions that have been debated \nwidely in this body on the PATRIOT Act. The first is section 215 of the \nPATRIOT Act, which deals with firearms, business records, and medical \nrecords. The conference report that came out basically set a standard \nthat says it is the relevance. My view and legal reading of that \nprovision of the statute is that it would allow for fishing expeditions \ninto your private records, into your business records, into the records \nof gun owners and gunshops.\n  For example, in my State, I think about a business named The Rocky \nMountain Gun and Ammo Shop. Well, if you have a business record by \nhaving conducted some transaction with that particular shop, then those \nbusiness records become available to the Federal Government without you \never having any knowledge that in fact the Federal Government has gone \nafter those records. In addition to that, besides having the \nopportunity to access those records----\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator from Colorado yield for a question?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I only have 2 minutes left. Through the Chair, I will \nmake my 2 remaining points and I will yield for a question.\n  That Rocky Mountain gun shop business would also be subjected to a \npermanent gag order, and there is jurisprudence in our case law that \nsays that\n\n[[Page S14112]]\n\nthose permanent gag orders in fact are violative of the first \namendment.\n  I believe in the Senate legislation that we approved unanimously with \n100 Senators, Republicans and Democrats, that moved those issues \nforward in a manner that would have protected the civil liberties of \nAmericans under the section 215 provisions of the PATRIOT Act.\n  With respect to national security letters, I have the same concerns, \nand that is with respect to the 30,000 national security letters that \ngo out--the question and the reality that there is currently no court \nreview of those national security letters. Second of all, there is no \navenue for relief with a permanent gag order that applies to the \nrecipients of the permanent gag order.\n  With that, I yield to my friend from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I might be \npermitted to speak for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me say, reserving the right to object, \nwe had made a commitment to other Senators in terms of an order here. \nThe next Senator to be recognized is Senator Byrd on our side. I am \ninformed that he is on his way here. I would be constrained to object. \nI would be happy to work with the leader on that side to work out an \norder.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak until \nSenator Byrd arrives.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I had sought to discuss with the Senator \nfrom Colorado some of the provisions of the PATRIOT Act. In view of the \nlimited time, I will make a few comments.\n  It is my hope that we can yet pass the conference report and the \nPATRIOT Act. When cloture was turned down on Friday, I reached out on \nSaturday to see if we could find some way to come to some \nagreements while the House was in town where we could have gotten some \nmodifications on the conference report. That is not possible now; the \nHouse is out of session. There was no one in the House to have an \nextension of time. Senator Frist has said publicly, again, within the \nhour, that he is not going to agree to an extension of time. The \nPresident said he is not going to sign an extension of time. So I think \nwhat we are faced with at the moment is that we can either sign the \nconference report, pass the conference report or the act is going to \nexpire.\n\n  That is not my wish. I have made every effort to turn, twist, and go \nsideways and backward and forward to get it worked out. I think where \nwe are now is that it is going to take this conference report or it is \ngoing to expire.\n  I talked to the majority leader about having another cloture vote. If \nthere would be 7 more Senators who would join the 53 who voted for \ncloture, we could get it done. I don't disagree with the Senator from \nColorado who says that what has gone on here is, in some respect, \nunworthy of the Senate. The matter has spiraled out of control to where \nwe are.\n  I came to the Chamber to quote from Benjamin Franklin when he \naddressed the Constitutional Convention in 1787. We are about to have \nthe 300th anniversary of his birth. America is very proud of Ben \nFranklin--Philadelphia especially. He came from Boston to Philadelphia. \nI came from Russell, Kansas, to Philadelphia. That is where the \nsimilarities end. We are both carpetbaggers who came to Philadelphia. \nFranklin had a message for the delegates to the Constitutional \nConvention, and I am going to read only part of it because I know \nSenator Byrd is on his way, and I am constrained to stop when he \narrives.\n  This is what Benjamin Franklin said to the delegates at the \nConstitutional Convention, and it applies to the PATRIOT Act. His \nmessage is that it is not perfect, it hasn't satisfied everybody, but \nit is the best we can do, so let's do it. This is what he said:\n\n       Mr. President, I confess that there are several parts of \n     this Constitution which I do not at present approve. But I am \n     not sure I shall never approve them; for having lived long, I \n     have experienced many instances of being obliged by better \n     information, or fuller consideration, to change opinions even \n     on important subjects, which I once thought right, but found \n     to be otherwise. It is therefore that the older I grow, the \n     more apt I am to doubt my own judgment, and to pay more \n     respect to the judgment of others.\n\n  Franklin goes on to say:\n\n       I doubt too whether any other Convention we can obtain, may \n     be able to make a better Constitution. For when you assemble \n     the number of men to have the advantage of their joint \n     wisdom, you inevitably assemble with those men, all their \n     prejudices, their passions, their errors of opinion, their \n     local interests, their selfish views. From such an assembly \n     can a perfect production be expected? It therefore astonishes \n     me, Sir, to find this system approaching so near to \n     perfection as it does;\n\n  Then he concludes with this paragraph:\n\n       On the whole, Sir, I can not help expressing a wish that \n     every member of the Convention who may still have objections \n     to it, would with me, on this occasion doubt a little of his \n     own infallibility, and to make manifest our unanimity, put \n     his name to this instrument.\n\n  It is not exactly the same. The Senator from Minnesota, who is \npresiding, is not George Washington, and I am not Benjamin Franklin. \nBut these are very wise words. I would ask if there are any of our \ncolleagues who are listening or any of our staff members of our \ncolleagues who are listening who would be willing to take up the \nquestion of changing a vote. They might have to eat a little crow. They \nmight have to lose a little face. Maybe it is worth it for the welfare \nof the country.\n  There can always be amendments to the act. I am not making any \ncommitments to any changes, but the Judiciary Committee will consider \nthem. This act will not be engraved in granite. There will be an \nopportunity for changes to be made--again, no commitments--but when we \nare faced with the alternative of either having the conference report \nor no act, I think it is pretty clear what the conclusion ought to be. \nI have talked to some of my colleagues earlier today who don't like \nwhere we stand now, who don't want the responsibility for not having an \nact. So it takes seven. I will be around all day, all day tomorrow. We \ncould vote, as the majority leader has said, on a motion for \nreconsideration if the body is inclined to do so, if there is some \nopportunity to adopt the conference report.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of \nFranklin's statement be printed in the Record.\n\n             Benjamin Franklin: On the Constitution (1787)\n\n       Mr. President: I confess that there are several parts of \n     this constitution which I do not at present approve, but I am \n     not sure I shall never approve them; for having lived long, I \n     have experienced many instances of being obliged by better \n     information, or fuller consideration, to change opinions even \n     on important subjects, which I once thought right, but found \n     to be otherwise. It is therefore that the older I grow, the \n     more apt I am to doubt my own judgment, and to pay more \n     respect to the judgment of others.\n       Most men indeed as well as most sects in Religion, think \n     themselves in possession of all truth, and that wherever \n     others differ from them it is so far error. Steele a \n     Protestant in a Dedication tells the Pope, that the only \n     difference between our Churches in their opinions of the \n     certainty of their doctrines is, the Church of Rome is \n     infallible and the Church of England is never in the wrong. \n     But though many private persons think almost as highly of \n     their own infallibility as of that of their sect, few express \n     it so naturally as a certain French lady, who in a dispute \n     with her sister, said \"I don't know how it happens, Sister \n     but I meet with no body but myself, that's always in the \n     right. ``Je ne trouve que moi qui aie toujours raison.''\n       In these sentiments, Sir, I agree to this Constitution with \n     all its faults, if they are such; because I think a general \n     Government necessary for us, and there is no form of \n     Government but what may be a blessing to the people if well \n     administered, and believe farther that this is likely to be \n     well administered for a course of years, and can only end in \n     Despotism, as other forms have done before it, when the \n     people shall become so corrupted as to need despotic \n     Government, being incapable of any other.\n       (I doubt too whether any other Convention we can obtain, \n     may be able to make a better Constitution. For when you \n     assemble a number of men to have the advantage of their joint \n     wisdom, you inevitably assemble with those men, all their \n     prejudices, their passions, their errors of opinion, their \n     local interests, and their selfish views. From such an \n     assembly can a perfect production be expected? It therefore \n     astonishes me, Sir, to find this system approaching so near \n     to perfection as it does;) and I think it will astonish our \n     enemies, who are waiting with confidence to hear that our \n     councils are confounded like those of the Builders of Babel; \n     and that our States are on the point of separation, only to \n     meet hereafter for the purpose of cutting one another's \n     throats.\n\n[[Page S14113]]\n\n       Thus I consent, Sir, to this Constitution because I expect \n     no better, and because I am not sure, that it is not the \n     best. The opinions I have had of its errors, I sacrifice to \n     the public good. I have never whispered a syllable of them \n     abroad. Within these walls they were born, and here they \n     shall die. If every one of us in returning to our \n     Constituents were to report the objections he has had to it, \n     and endeavor to gain partisans in support of them, we might \n     prevent its being generally received, and thereby lose all \n     the salutary effects and great advantages resulting naturally \n     in our favor among foreign Nations as well as among \n     ourselves, from our real or apparent unanimity.\n       Much of the strength and efficiency of any Government in \n     procuring and securing happiness to the people, depends, on \n     opinion, on the general opinion of the goodness of the \n     Government, as well as of the wisdom and integrity of its \n     Governors. I hope therefore that for our own sakes as a part \n     of the people, and for the sake of posterity, we shall act \n     heartily and unanimously in recommending this Constitution \n     (if approved by Congress and confirmed by the Conventions) \n     wherever our influence may extend, and turn our future \n     thoughts and endeavors to the means of having it well \n     administered.\n       On the whole, Sir, I can not help expressing a wish that \n     every member of the Convention who may still have objections \n     to it, would with me, on this occasion doubt a little of his \n     own infallibility, and to make manifest our unanimity, put \n     his name to this instrument.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I see Senator Byrd entering the Chamber, \nso I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask for regular order, that we return to \nthe bill. As I understand it, Senator Specter was speaking in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time was charged from the majority's time on \nthe bill. There was no consent request to do otherwise.\n  Mr. GREGG. My understanding is that Senator Specter asked to speak as \nin morning business; am I incorrect in that?\n  Mr. SPECTER. That was my intention, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator asked to speak until Senator Byrd \narrived.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I did ask to speak, and it was my intention to have it \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, the \ntime is charged in morning business.\n  Mr. GREGG. It is my understanding that we are now going to Senator \nByrd, then Senator Ensign, and then going back to the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, for the interest of colleagues, Senator \nByrd will be speaking for 15 minutes. Then we will go back to the \nmajority side. Then we will come back to this side with Senator \nLautenberg for 10 minutes, and then Senator Clinton for 10 minutes, and \nthen Senator Talent. This is not, I want to make clear, a unanimous \nconsent request. This is an advisory to our colleagues so that we can \nmanage this time efficiently.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what is the time, if the Chair will advise \nthe majority and the minority?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 1 hour 21 minutes remaining. \nThe minority has 1 hour 33 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, last week, I was pleased to join a strong \nbipartisan majority of the Senate in support of a motion that \ninstructed budget conferees to strike an ill-conceived House provision \nfrom the budget reconciliation bill. That provision sought to repeal \nthe Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act, also known as CDSOA. Last \nThursday, the Senate voted overwhelmingly--overwhelmingly--by a vote of \n71 to 20 to strike any repeal of CDSOA from the budget reconciliation \nbill.\n  The Senate supported CDSOA. Why? Because the Senate recognized that \nany repeal or attempt to abandon this trade law would be a travesty--a \ntravesty--on justice. The House agreed, and last Friday the House \npassed a similar motion to instruct which contained, among other \nthings, language to strike repeal of CDSOA from the House-passed bill.\n  The vote on that successful House motion to instruct was 246 to 175. \nWhat could be clearer than that? The House vote on that motion was 246 \nto 175. And yet--get this, hear me now--over the weekend--yes, over the \nweekend literally in the dead of night when all was still, nothing was \nstirring, in the dead of night--a small number of misguided House and \nSenate conferees decided to turn their backs--turn their backs, on the \nAmerican worker.\n  Hear me out there, the American workers all over this country. Hear \nme, hear me out there on the Great Plains. Hear me out there in the \nriver valleys. Hear me out there in the mountains of West Virginia. \nHear me out there in the great Rocky Mountains. Hear me out there on \nthe west coast, the American workers, the American workers.\n  So this small group decided to ignore the will--hear me--ignore the \nwill of both Houses of Congress. That was blatant, was it not? They \ndecided to repeal CDSOA after 2 years. What arrogance, what sheer, \nunmitigated, raw arrogance. Fie on you. Shame, shame, shame. CDSOA was \nenacted to save American manufacturing and our agricultural producers \nfrom wave after wave after wave of unfairly traded foreign imports. Let \nme say that again. Hear it again. Hear me again. CDSOA was enacted. \nWhy? To save American manufacturing and American agricultural producers \nfrom wave after wave after wave of unfairly traded foreign imports. It \nis one of the most successful trade programs ever enacted. Alleluia. It \nenables small and medium-sized businesses and family-owned businesses \nto invest in their futures.\n  This law preserves an increasingly rare commodity in these United \nStates, a vanishing breed, the American worker. Five years ago, a \nbipartisan majority of the Senate approved this provision to reimburse \nU.S. companies injured by unfair foreign trade. Let me say that again. \nFive years ago, a bipartisan majority, Republican and Democrat, of the \nSenate approved this provision to reimburse U.S. companies injured by \nunfair foreign trade.\n  Under the law, each year Customs distributes duties collected from \nunfair imports to American companies, to American workers, who can \nprove they have been materially injured by unfair trade. What could be \nbetter than that? What could be more fair? What could be more just than \nthat? Under the law, each year Customs distributes duties collected \nfrom unfair imports to American companies and workers who can prove \nthat they--these American companies and workers--have been materially \ninjured by unfair trade.\n  CDSOA was enacted to restore conditions of fair trade so that jobs \nthat should stay in the United States are not destroyed by unfair \nforeign competition. What is wrong with that? What is wrong with that? \nHear me.\n  While the amounts distributed under the program are not large, from a \nbudget perspective, approximately $226 million for fiscal year 2005, \nthe law has been critically important--hear me--the law has been \ncritically important to American companies and American workers hurt by \ndumped and unfairly subsidized imports. I am speaking on behalf of \nAmerican companies and American workers who have been injured by these \nunfair imports, these subsidized imports.\n  To receive reimbursement under the law, companies certify in writing \nthat they have made qualifying expenditures in support of their workers \nand their facilities. The law reimburses them only for those \nexpenditures. I will say that again. The law reimburses them only for \nthose expenditures in support of their workers and facilities. The \nCustoms Service verifies any claims submitted to make certain that \nrequests for reimbursement are valid. Consequently, there are stringent \nsafeguards in place under the law to make certain that funds are \ndistributed under the law legally, honestly, and fairly.\n  Critics of the law--yes, listen to them, critics of the law--argue \nthat the WTO has ruled against it so we should abandon it. Shame. But \nthe WTO had no legal authority to rule against this law.\n  This means that the WTO's ruling was beyond the scope of its legal \nmandate, and to this day, Tuesday, the 20th day of December in the year \nof our Lord 2005, the WTO has never articulated a legitimate argument \njustifying any need for the United States to repeal this law. They have \nnot done it. They cannot do it. They cannot do it. They have not done \nit.\n\n[[Page S14114]]\n\n  Nearly 800 American companies and workers in nearly every State of \nthe Nation--not just in West Virginia, not just in the steel trade in \nWest Virginia or Pennsylvania or Kentucky or Ohio, workers in nearly \nevery State of the Nation receive distributions under this law's \nprovisions. It is critical to family-owned businesses such as Warwood \nTools in Wheeling, WV, and to Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel and to Weirton, \nWV. It is equally important to the thousands of steelworkers in \nAlabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, \nMichigan, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South \nCarolina, Texas, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin, and elsewhere across the \nNation. They, and all hard-working Americans, deserve to continue to \nreceive these funds so long as foreign traders keep on dumping \nillegally. Illegally. If our trading partners do not like this trade \nlaw, the solution is easy. The solution is not to repeal the law. If \nour trading partners are offended by the law, I have only two words for \nthem. Hear me, only two words for them: Stop dumping. It is that \nsimple: two little words: Stop dumping. If you, our trading partners, \nare offended by the law, bless your hearts, I have two words for you, \nour trading partners that are dumping: Stop dumping.\n\n  The United States is working to complete negotiations in the Doha \nRound of trade talks. What kind of leverage can we maintain over other \ncountries in those talks if we meekly agree unilaterally to disarm, to \nrepeal one of the strongest and most successful trade remedy laws ever \nenacted in the United States? What a foolhardy, what a simple-minded \nstunt.\n  Why don't we hand them a sharp stick to poke our eyes out?\n  That would make about as much sense as repealing our trade laws. Now \nis the time to hold foreign unfair traders more accountable, not less--\nmore accountable, not less.\n  I urge my fellow Senators, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join \nme in voting against this budget bill which contains language that \nwould repeal this critical trade law.\n  While the drafters of the repeal of this law argue that it will \npermit certain duty distributions to continue--at least for the next 2 \nyears--the text is not exactly clear on this point. So I ask my \ncolleagues: Why tamper with a law that works? There is no reason to \nundermine the statute as it is now written. There is no need to repeal \nthe law today. There is no need to repeal the law 2 years from now, or \never.\n  Therefore, with all my heart, I urge my colleagues to join me in \nvoting against the budget reconciliation bill, to make certain that one \nof America's most successful trade laws stays on the books as it is \ncurrently written.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the deficit \nreduction bill that we have before us after many hours of people \nworking together, compromising. You could go through the bill and pick \nout parts that you like and you don't like, so I want to put this in a \nbigger picture. I want to step back and look at what we are dealing \nwith as a country.\n  Over the next 5 years, we were slated to spend, before this bill, and \nif this bill does not go into effect, we will spend $13.8 trillion. If \nwe pass this bill, this deficit reduction bill, we will still spend \n$13.76 trillion. Those numbers are impossible to understand. \nImpossible. They are too big. Let's try to get our arms around a little \nbit of a number.\n  I always like to talk about $1 trillion with high school kids so they \ncan understand it. I always ask them: Do you think a million dollars is \na lot of money? And of course a lot of us think a million dollars is a \nlot of money. I ask them: If you spent a million dollars a day, do you \nthink you would be spending a lot of money? And the unanimous answer of \nhigh school kids is: Of course that is a lot of money. I tell them that \nto get to $1 trillion, not $13.76 trillion but just $1 trillion, you \nwould have to start spending a million dollars a day, start at the time \nJesus was born, go until today and you still would not be at $1 \ntrillion.\n  What we are trying to do is to shave and slow the rate of growth of \nspending a tiny bit. It is almost insignificant.\n  But what is significant in the bill is that we are starting to take \non entitlement spending. Entitlement spending now is two-thirds of the \nFederal budget, and it is slated to grow into an ever-increasing share \nof the Federal budget in the future. We all know that. Republicans, \nDemocrats, it doesn't matter who looks at the numbers, entitlements \nwill gobble up the entire Federal budget.\n  If you study democratic forms of government--and I know Senator Byrd, \nwho has spoken, has done a lot of this--if you study democratic forms \nof government, they always collapse due to two reasons, and they happen \nin a particular order. The first thing that happens is there is a moral \ncollapse in the country, and it is always followed by an economic \ncollapse.\n  If you think about it, it makes sense that it happens in that order. \nYou see, if you have people who are not moral enough to think about the \nnext generation, what they do is they elect people to office who will \ngive them what they want by borrowing from the Treasury; in other \nwords, borrowing from the next generations. When the debt gets too \nlarge, this debt gets so large the economy cannot handle it and you end \nup with all kinds of economic problems and finally an economic \ncollapse.\n  We are headed for that if we do not get entitlements under control. \nThat is why this bill, even though it is a small amount of money--if \nyou listen to the other side, you would think the sky is falling, as \nfar as spending is concerned.\n  This is a tiny, insignificant almost, amount of money. But it is \nsignificant in that we are finally starting to tackle entitlement \nspending. That is why this bill is so important.\n  So when we hear the debate on both sides, boil it down to this very \nsimple thing. Are we going to care enough about the next generation to \nfinally start saying no to some of this big Federal Government \nspending? I believe it is time this body stands up. Instead of being \nselfish, instead of giving our voters what they want so they keep \nsending us back here, let's stand up and do what is right and think \nabout future generations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, for the information of my colleagues, \nSenator Wyden is next. We have been told he is on his way. We hope he \nwill appear shortly. Then we will have Senator Grassley at \napproximately 4 o'clock. He will go for 20 or 30 minutes, or something \nlike that.\n  At this point, maybe it is an appropriate time to try to sum up some \nof the arguments we have tried to make with respect to this budget.\n  The matter before us reduces spending by $40 billion over a 5-year \nperiod. During that period, we will be spending $14.3 trillion.\n  In the first year, this package saves $5 billion. The tax cuts the \nHouse wants to apply in that same period are $21 billion. That doesn't \nreduce the deficit. It increases the deficit.\n  The thing that is I think most disturbing about this budget plan is, \naccording to its advocates, the debt of the country increases by $600 \nbillion or $700 billion a year, each and every year of the 5 years of \nthis budget. That is unsustainable. We are not making any serious \nprogress. In fact, this package makes things worse.\n  I see Senator Wyden is here.\n  I yield up to 15 minutes to Senator Wyden.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  I have come to the floor this afternoon to bring to the Senate's \nattention a new development with respect to the Arctic Refuge--a \ndevelopment that has taken place in the last 24 hours that I think has \ngreat implications for the budget work the Senate is doing here this \nweek. It also speaks volumes about the lack of consumer protection we \nare seeing in our country generally.\n  We have heard a lot in the past few days----\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question? I \nwant the body to know, to the extent people are listening outside, the \nANWR language is not in this bill. The Senator is speaking to another \nbill which will follow. Is that correct?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire is correct in a technical sense.\n\n[[Page S14115]]\n\nBut I am going to discuss something that will have, in my view, great \nramifications for the Federal budget generally, and I am going to \noutline that briefly this afternoon.\n  We have heard a lot during the past few days about the rights of \nAlaskans as an argument to justify drilling for oil in the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge. But yesterday, the Alaska Gasline Port \nAuthority, an Alaska state-chartered agency, charged two of the \ncompanies that have drilling rights in the Arctic Refuge with \nconspiring to manipulate the State of Alaska's energy market. The \nAlaska Gasline lawsuit charges that ExxonMobil and BP withheld supplies \nof natural gas to gain market power over supply. This is a very \nsignificant development with, in my view, great implications for Arctic \noil drilling.\n  If these allegations are correct--that ExxonMobil and BP withheld \nAlaskan gas supplies from the market--what would stop these companies \nfrom withholding oil from Arctic drilling from the market? If Alaskan \noil supplies are withheld from the market, that does nothing to reduce \nour Nation's dependence on foreign oil. It also produces no revenue to \nthe Federal Treasury that supporters of Arctic oil drilling claim fund \nhurricane relief and other programs.\n  These serious charges about oil company manipulation of Alaska's \nenergy supplies are not made by some leftwing group but by an agency \nchartered by the State of Alaska.\n  An article in today's Wall Street Journal quotes Walter Hickel, a \nformer Republican Governor of Alaska, as saying the lawsuit against \nthese major oil companies ``reveals a story of extreme corporate greed \nthat has abused Alaska and punished the American consumer.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       An Alaska state authority charged that BP PLC and Exxon \n     Mobil Corp., the world's largest publicly traded oil \n     companies, are conspiring to withhold natural gas from U.S. \n     markets and reinforce their market power over North Slope \n     supplies.\n       In an antitrust suit filed late yesterday in federal court \n     in Fairbanks, the Alaska Gasline Port Authority alleged that \n     a series of illegal agreements and acquisitions by the \n     companies has choked the flow of the state's vast gas \n     reserves. It seeks to stop the companies' alleged collusion \n     through a court injunction and unspecified damages.\n       Exxon and BP spokesman both denied the accusations that the \n     companies were trying to delay exports of gas from Alaska. \n     ``This is another sobering reminder of our litigation-crazed \n     society. This suit is frivolous and it's totally without \n     merit,'' says Exxon spokesman Russ Roberts.\n       The lawsuit is the latest twist in a 30-year effort to move \n     the estimated 37 trillion cubic feet of natural gas within \n     Alaska's sprawling oil field, enough to satisfy two year's \n     worth of U.S. demand. There is currently no significant \n     natural-gas production in the North Slope; gas now produced \n     by oil wells is injected into underground reservoirs. The \n     dispute comes at a time when U.S. natural-gas prices are \n     soaring.\n       The port authority, created in 1999 to build a gas \n     pipeline, says it has $18 billion in federal guarantees and \n     the permits to build a pipeline from the North Slope to \n     Valdez in the southern part of the state, where gas would be \n     liquefied and loaded onto tankers. But BP and Exxon favor an \n     alternative, longer pipeline through Canada, a pipeline over \n     which they would have more control, the authority charges.\n       Talks between the state and producers on building the \n     longer pipeline have stalled. BP and Exxon Mobil, which \n     produced a combined 1.7 trillion cubic feet of gas last year \n     in the U.S., about 9% of the domestic total, have balked at \n     the state's terms; a third producer ConocoPhillips, agreed to \n     the state's basic terms in October. The natural-gas pipeline \n     disputes aren't related to the battle in Congress over \n     opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas \n     exploration.\n       The Alaska Gasline Port Authority said that BP's refusal to \n     agree to ship its natural gas and Exxon Mobil's failure to \n     develop its huge fields amounts to ``warehousing'' a \n     desperately needed resource in an effort to drive up prices. \n     ``Gas prices are at record highs, and big oil companies still \n     won't move the gas to market,'' authority Chairman Jim \n     Whitaker said in a statement.\n       BP and Exxon Mobil argue a pipeline through Canada to the \n     Midwest would increase the value of the gas by delivering it \n     directly to gas-hungry markets. They say that the \n     alternative, shorter route to Valdez--which allows for a spur \n     to send gas through Canada--would generate less revenue and \n     expose the $20 billion project to greater risk. BP and Exxon \n     also expect to have a bigger financial stake in the longer \n     pipeline than the one favored by the Alaska Gasline Port \n     Authority.\n       BP spokesman David MacDowell said, ``We are working as fast \n     as we can to get a clear and durable fiscal contract with the \n     state of Alaska so that this natural-gas project can move \n     forward to the next stage.'' As for the Valdez option, he \n     said, ``we've spent millions of dollars over the years trying \n     to make an Alaskan LNG [liquefied natural gas] project work, \n     but it doesn't work.''\n       He defended producers' ownership of pipelines, saying that \n     ``no one else is as motivated as the resource owners to build \n     the lowest cost, most efficient transportation system \n     possible.''\n       Exxon says negotiations have been continuing for months and \n     are in an advanced stage. ``This is one of the largest, most \n     complex industrial projects ever considered by any \n     industry,'' says Mr. Roberts, the Exxon spokesman, and \n     negotiations over the voluminous details should run their \n     course, rather than be litigated in the courts.\n       The delays in exploiting Alaska's natural gas have become a \n     political issue from Alaska to Washington. Walter Hickel, a \n     former Republican governor of Alaska and former U.S. \n     Secretary of the Interior, said the authority's suit \n     ``reveals a story of extreme corporate greed that has abused \n     Alaska and punished the American consumer.''\n       Mr. Hickel, a longtime supporter of Alaska gas development, \n     said that ``the producers have conspired for years to delay \n     the export of Alaska liquefied natural gas.''\n       House Speaker Dennis Hastert has said he expected energy \n     companies to ``do their part to help ease the pain'' of high \n     oil and gas prices, and specifically cited BP and Exxon \n     Mobil's failure to come to terms with Alaska over the \n     proposed pipeline.\n       The authority's legal team includes David Boies, of Boies \n     Schiller & Flexner in New York, and Charles Cole of \n     Fairbanks, the former Alaska attorney general.\n       In a news conference last night, Mr. Boies said the two \n     companies had illegally conspired to refuse to deal with the \n     authority, as part of a broad effort ``to preserve the \n     scarcity that has driven natural-gas prices to historic \n     highs.''\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the legislative rider attached to the \nDefense appropriations conference report that would open the Arctic \nWildlife Refuge to drilling gives the same two companies the Alaska \nGasline Port Authority charges with colluding to withhold Alaskan gas \nsupplies a tremendous sweetheart economic deal.\n  In addition to being an abuse of the legislative process, attaching \nthis rider to the Defense appropriations bill, in my view, is bad \nenvironmental policy, bad budget policy, and most particularly bad \nenergy policy. As a result of this rider, the Defense spending bill, \nwhich contains money critical for our troops, is getting held hostage \nfor special interest legislation for the oil industry. The rider that \nwas grafted onto the Defense bill provides unprecedented waivers for \nFederal environmental and other laws, including the National Wildlife \nRefuge Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, and the Federal \nMineral Leasing Act.\n  The Arctic drilling legislation also overrides current law to reduce \nthe State of Alaska's share of the revenue produced by Arctic oil \ndrilling.\n  Under current law, 90 percent of those receipts would be paid to the \nState of Alaska and the remaining 10 percent to the U.S. Treasury.\n  The rider that was plucked from the budget reconciliation spending \nbill and grafted onto the Defense appropriations conference report \nchanges the allocation in current law to permit the Federal Government \nto retain 50 percent of the receipts. The State of Alaska has \nthreatened to sue to get the full 90 percent of the revenues. If that \nlawsuit succeeds, then 40 percent of the revenues that the Defense \nspending bill assumes will be available for hurricane recovery, LIHEAP, \nand other purposes will not be there at all. If the State loses, then \nits rights will have successfully been overridden. One way or another, \neither the State of Alaska or the Federal taxpayer is going to end up \ngetting shortchanged.\n\n  Most importantly, if the charges we have heard in the last 24 hours \nof withholding gas supply are true, there would be nothing to stop the \nsame oil companies the Alaska Gasline Port Authority is charging with \ngas market manipulation from manipulating Alaskan oil markets. Nothing \nin the rider on the Defense bill would in any way prevent the companies \nfrom engaging in the same conduct they have been charged with by an \nAlaska-chartered agency with respect to oil drilling in the Arctic.\n  The actions of the Alaska Gasline Port Authority this week against \nExxonMobil and BP, in my view, raise a host of fundamental questions. \nFirst, whose rights is the Arctic drilling rider\n\n[[Page S14116]]\n\nsupposed to uphold? The State of Alaska? Or the major oil companies? \nHow will drilling in the Arctic truly affect our Nation's energy \nsecurity? What are the real budget revenues that Arctic drilling will \nproduce?\n  The Congressional Budget Office's revenue estimates for Arctic oil \ndrilling assume that the oil companies will move quickly to develop \noilfields in the Arctic Refuge. These assumptions do not factor in the \nprospect of oil companies choking off the flow of oil, as the Alaska \nGasline Port Authority alleged is being done by ExxonMobil and BP now \nwith Alaskan gas supplies.\n  The other question that begs to be asked about the Alaska Gasline \nlawsuit is where in the world was the Federal Government, particularly \nthe consumer protection regulators, who are supposed to be policing the \nkind of collusion that is alleged in the lawsuit of the Alaska Gasline \nPort Authority this week? What has the Federal Trade Commission, the \nso-called consumer watchdog agency, done to stop what former Alaska \nGovernor Hickel has called ``extreme corporate greed that has abused \nAlaska and punished the American consumer.''\n  The response is, unfortunately, the same as what we have seen from \nthe Federal Trade Commission over the last few years when it comes to \noil company mega mergers, price gouging at the gas pump and other \nanticompetitive practices. The consumer watchdog seems to be taking a \nlong winter nap when it comes to energy. This is yet another example of \nthe Federal Trade Commission's perpetual hibernation when it comes to \nprotecting the consumer who is getting clobbered by escalating energy \ncosts.\n  If an agency of the State of Alaska, with no more than a handful of \nlawyers, is able to take action against collusion by the world's \nlargest oil companies, why isn't the Federal Government's premier \nconsumer protection agency, with scores of lawyers, able to protect \nconsumers?\n  Last week I spoke at length on this issue. In fact, the distinguished \nPresiding Officer of the Senate was in the chair at that time. He is \nvery much aware I intend to continue to raise my concerns about why the \nFederal Trade Commission keeps ducking this critical consumer \nprotection issue.\n  This latest news about the Alaska Gasline Port Authority bringing an \nantitrust action against major oil company collusion in energy markets, \nin my view, is especially troubling. It calls out for further \ninvestigation by both the Congress and the Federal Trade Commission. In \nmy view, it is the Congress's job to investigate whether the claims \nmade by the advocates of Arctic oil drilling hold up, given what the \nAlaska Gasline Port Authority is alleging this week about two of the \noil companies that hold Arctic drilling rights.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume but not more than 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before I comment on the Senate Committee \non Finance portion of the Deficit Reduction Act, I will go over some \nground that has been covered by other Members on our side of the aisle \nthrough this chart or similar charts, to point out how three \nentitlement programs--Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--as a \npercentage of the gross domestic product are going to continue to grow \nand grow and grow until reaching a point where it squeezes out almost \neverything else in the Federal budget.\n  This is already legislated. The red on the chart, if we do nothing, \nis where we end up.\n  This bill is doing something about that problem. But we ought to be \ndoing a lot more.\n  I start out by saying what we are doing in this entire deficit \nreduction package is reducing expenditures of the Federal Government \nover the next 5 years. Five years is the length of the budget \nreconciliation changes that we are making. During that 5-year period of \ntime, the Federal Government will spend about $12.5 trillion. We are \ncutting out of that $12.5 trillion, a 5-year figure, about $10 billion \nas shown in the red part of the chart.\n  The reason I try to put that in perspective, one-quarter of 1 percent \nis at $40 billion, compared to the $12.5 trillion. That is a spit in \nthe ocean compared to what the problem is.\n  I point out two things. We will hear from Members of this Senate, \nmostly from the other side of the aisle, that it is catastrophic we are \nmaking changes to one-quarter of 1 percent in all the money the Federal \nGovernment is going to spend over the next 5 years. It is catastrophic. \nThe world is coming to an end, we will hear.\n  Then, from the other point of view, considering what these problems \nare that we know we face today--and no Republican or Democrat disagrees \nwith that--for what we are doing we ought to be somewhat ashamed we \ncannot do more than one-quarter of 1 percent of all the money the \nFederal Government is going to spend in the next 5 years.\n  For the average American who votes and thinks that Washington, DC, is \non some other land from the standpoint of what we do in the Congress, \nthey would say to both sides of the argument that the world is coming \nto an end, that we are going to eliminate or reduce one-quarter of 1 \npercent or to those that are bragging--I will be in that category of \nbragging--about doing something about one-quarter of 1 percent, they \nare going to say, you guys have to be crazy if you cannot find in all \nthe money that the Federal Government spends, some way of saving more \nthan one-quarter of 1 percent of the $12.5 trillion that will be spent \nover the next 5 years. They would probably say you ought to go out and \nfind some other work where you can accomplish something.\n  Those are the extreme points of view. That is what I think the public \nis probably going to say to us at our town meetings when we go back \nhome if we are going to brag about this, or maybe to the people that \nare going to complain about it, asking if we are really doing much. It \nis similar to all the labor that an elephant will go through to give \nbirth and then give birth to a mouse. That is what we have here, a \nmouse compared to the elephant of a problem.\n  I take an opportunity to explain what is in the Senate Committee on \nFinance portion of this bill. Senator Gregg needs to be complimented \nfor getting us where we are today on this conference agreement. What I \ndescribed, one-quarter of 1 percent of all money over the next 5 years, \n$12.5 trillion worth, this is the first time we have gone through this \nprocess in almost 10 years.\n  So we do not do this every year. And the public watching would say: \nWhy don't you do it every year? I wish I had a responsible answer for \nthat. But I think we ought to recognize Senator Gregg's involvement and \nthe involvement of all the chairmen of the committees in putting \ntogether, over several months, this budget reconciliation package for \nspending to achieve this goal, and achieving this goal regardless of \nhow small it might be.\n  It is important for the reason I have given you, that by all \naccounts, the growth in entitlement spending has monumental \nimplications for our Nation's economic and financial strength.\n  The chart I just spoke about shows the Congressional Budget Office's \nprojections for mandatory spending, including Social Security, \nMedicare, and Medicaid. According to this chart, by 2050 mandatory \nspending will approach 30 percent of the Nation's gross domestic \nproduct. That is 30 percent by 2050. This would push Federal spending \nwell above the levels that it has been throughout much of the post-\nWorld War II period, as evidenced by that straight line that goes \nacross that chart.\n  This might be, hopefully, a worst case scenario, but it is a \nplausible scenario. The agreement that we are going to be voting on, \ncalled the budget reconciliation package, begins to get at this \nsituation--the red on this chart--by achieving nearly $40 billion in \nsavings over the next 5 years. That includes $6.4 billion in net \nMedicare savings and $4.7 billion in net Medicaid savings.\n  I actually hesitate to mention those amounts because for many of our \nconstituents it is hard to get past the numbers. To them, any \nreduction--any reduction--even if it is only one-fourth of 1 percent, \nis a bad reduction. But the policy--and we ought to be making decisions \nin this body based upon sound\n\n[[Page S14117]]\n\npolicy--the policy behind these reductions is sound, just as the policy \nbehind the numerous spending provisions in this entire package is \nsound.\n  Throughout this process I have sought to reduce wasteful spending, \neliminate loopholes, and pay providers more accurately. I have sought \nto advance policies that will ensure the availability of important \nhealth care and social services, to update these programs to reflect \nour Nation's changing needs, and also to promote the delivery of high-\nquality health care services.\n  The agreement makes some important improvements in the Medicare \nProgram, not the least of which is addressing a scheduled reduction in \npayments to physicians, which could have led to access problems for \nbeneficiaries. The agreement builds on progress made 3 years ago that \nlinked increases in Medicare payments to hospitals to the reporting of \nquality data.\n  I actually would have preferred to do more in the area of pay for \nperformance, and I will continue to push further for changes because we \njust cannot sit back on this issue, as the private sector is moving \nmuch faster than Government, particularly the major corporations of \nAmerica, in making sure they do their health care business with people \nin the health care profession and institutions in the health care \nprofession that are going to deliver quality care. We have to be more \nconcerned about this than we have in the past in the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Medicare is the single largest payer of health care in the Nation. \nTaxpayers and beneficiaries deserve to get the highest value for every \nMedicare dollar spent. Unfortunately, there is no question that today \nwe are not getting the most value for the taxpayer dollar.\n  The bill also takes steps to ensure access to quality care in rural \ncommunities. It does this by reinstating special payment programs, such \nas a 5-percent add-on for rural home health providers, the Medicare \ndependent hospital program, and the hold-harmless payments for small \nrural hospitals.\n  The conference agreement also includes coverage of valuable \npreventive benefits not covered by Medicare. These preventive benefits \nare important to prevent illnesses and to keep beneficiaries healthy.\n  This bill also saves beneficiaries and Medicare money by changing the \npayment structure for durable medical equipment.\n  Now Medicare will only pay for DME services that are needed; that is, \nafter we get this passed.\n  I would like to look at Medicaid changes.\n  In our efforts to reform the Medicaid Program, we take some very \nimportant steps, many of them recommended by a bipartisan group of our \nNation's Governors. Eventually, all 50 Governors made suggestions to us \nin a unanimous agreement.\n  Let's just look at long-term care. In the very near future, a lot of \nolder people are going to need long-term care. Right now, Medicaid is a \nprimary payer for long-term care services. The Deficit Reduction Act \nexpands the Long-Term Care Partnership Program and will promote \nawareness about long-term care insurance.\n  We combine that with a policy to tighten restrictions on seniors' \nability to transfer or hide assets with the intention of qualifying for \nMedicaid. These policies protect the integrity of Medicaid and create \nan incentive for seniors to explore new long-term care options.\n  The agreement will ensure accurate payments to pharmacies for the \ncost of drugs, and it has little effect on the market.\n  We give States the ability to offer Medicaid beneficiaries coverage \nmore consistent with coverage typically offered by employers, while at \nthe same time guaranteeing that children do not lose any benefits \ncurrently provided under Medicaid.\n  We include protections for preventive services and treatment for \nchildren. This bill continues to require States which cover early, \nperiodic, screening, diagnosis, and treatment services to continue to \ndo that. The language of the bill is very clear.\n  Mr. President, on that very point, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a statement by Dr. McClellan, Administrator of \nCMS, supporting our interpretation of the provisions.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nStatement by Mark B. McClellan, M.D., Ph.D, Administrator, Centers for \n                      Medicare & Medicaid Services\n\n       Questions have been raised about the new section 1937 of \n     the Social Security Act (SSA) (as added by the Deficit \n     Reduction Act of 2005) that permits states to provide \n     Medicaid benefits to children through benchmark coverage or \n     benchmark equivalent coverage. If a state chooses to exercise \n     this option, the specific issue has been raised as to whether \n     children under 19 will still be entitled to receive EPSDT \n     benefits in addition to the benefits provided by the \n     benchmark coverage or benchmark equivalent coverage. The \n     short answer is; children under 19 will receive EPSDT \n     benefits.\n       After a careful review, including consultation with the \n     Office of General Counsel, CMS has determined that children \n     under 19 will still be entitled to receive EPSDT benefits if \n     enrolled in benchmark coverage or benchmark equivalent \n     coverage under the new section 1937. CMS will review each \n     State plan amendment (SPA) submitted under the new section \n     1937 and will not approve any SPA that does not include the \n     provision of EPSDT services for children under 19 as defined \n     in section 1905(r) of the SSA.\n       In the case of children under the age of 19, new section \n     1937 (a)(1) is clear that a state may exercise the option to \n     provide Medicaid benefits through enrollment in coverage that \n     at a minimum has two parts. The first part of the coverage \n     will be benchmark coverage or benchmark equivalent coverage, \n     as required by subsection (a)(1)(A)(i), and the second part \n     of the coverage will be wrap-around coverage of EPDST \n     services as defined in section 1905(r) of the SSA, as \n     required by subsection (a)(1)(A)(ii). A State cannot exercise \n     the option under section 1937 with respect to children under \n     19 if EPSDT services are not included in the total coverage \n     provided to such children.\n       Subparagraph (C) of section 1937 (a)(1) permits states to \n     also add wrap-around or additional benefits. In the case of \n     children under 19, wrap-around or additional benefits that a \n     state could choose to provide under subparagraph (C) must be \n     a benefit in addition to the benchmark coverage or benchmark \n     equivalent coverage and the EPSDT services that the state is \n     already required to provide under subparagraph (A) of that \n     section. Subparagraph (C) does not in any way give a state \n     the flexibility to fail to provide the EPSDT services \n     required by subparagraph (A)(ii) of section I 937(a)(1).\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We also include policies that give States the option of \nasking for a limited set of Medicaid beneficiaries to share in the cost \nof their care.\n  The cost-sharing policy excludes anyone under the Federal poverty \nlevel, mandatory children, adoption or foster care children, \npreventative care and immunizations for all children, pregnancy-related \nservices, hospice residents, and women who qualify for Medicaid under \nthe breast and cervical cancer eligibility group.\n  It is a reasonable, responsible policy that I encourage my colleagues \nto support. These are all modifications of what the House of \nRepresentatives did in their provisions in this area.\n  These are important, measured first steps that our Governors, in this \ncommunication to the Congress to which I previously referred, have \nasked for, on a bipartisan basis, to reform the Medicaid Program.\n  Now, the Medicaid Program is a Federal-State program. It is a big \ncost to the Governors. If we have Governors, 50 of them, of both \npolitical parties, coming to us and saying: We can tell you how to \nspend your taxpayers' dollars more wisely, and we will save some money \nat the State level, and we will be able to serve more people--they came \nto us and said that to us. And this document responds to that.\n  I don't know how 100 Senators can put their judgment--just in case \nthey disagree with what we are trying to do. I suppose if they agree, \nthis doesn't apply to them. I don't know how those Senators who \ndisagree with what we are doing on a Federal-State program can put \ntheir judgment above that of 50 Governors who are almost equally \ndivided between Republicans and Democrats.\n  This bill also dramatically increases funding to protect Medicaid \nfrom fraud and abuse. It does so by creating a Medicaid integrity \nprogram that mirrors a similar program already in place in the sister \nprogram of Medicare.\n  The agreement incorporates the Family Opportunity Act. This is a \nmajor improvement in Medicaid. This is a program that Senator Kennedy \nand I have been working on for 7 years. These provisions will help \nfamilies meet the needs of their children with disabilities. Right now, \nthese parents,\n\n[[Page S14118]]\n\nif they have a child with disabilities, face difficult decisions. I can \ndocument this among my own constituents in Iowa, that time and time \nagain, many parents of disabled children tell me of their struggles \ngetting health care for their children with costly special needs.\n  Many parents have been effectively forced to quit their jobs, to take \nlow-paying jobs so this child with costly medical care can qualify for \nMedicaid. Why? Because the services their child needs are not available \nwith private health insurance. So they need the assistance of Medicaid.\n  This policy we presently have in place and in the Family Opportunity \nAct turns by 180 degrees; it is totally backward.\n  This agreement allows States to give these parents in this situation \nthe option to buy into Medicaid while continuing to work and probably \nin most cases continuing to pay taxes. These are folks who want to work \nand can work, and we should not have a disincentive to productive \nemployment in America just because some family has a child with special \nvery expensive health needs.\n  Moving on, the agreement also fills shortfalls in funding of their \nState children's health insurance programs that States would have \nexperienced just next year.\n  We also include $2 billion to assist Louisiana, Alabama, and \nMississippi, as well as other States to meet health care needs of \npeople whose lives were devastated by Katrina. It extends TANF Programs \nwith a few minor improvements. It closes several loopholes in TANF and \nin child support, while providing funding for childcare, child welfare, \nand allowing more child support to go directly to families.\n  For nearly 4 years, I have tried to reauthorize TANF in the regular \norder. Without any help from Democrats, I reported a bill out of the \nlast Congress on a partisan basis. That year, Senator Frist devoted a \nweek for the consideration of welfare. The first floor amendment \noffered on behalf of Senator Snowe would have increased childcare \nspending by $6 billion--I voted for it--bringing the total childcare \nmoney to $7 billion. That passed with 78 votes. Unfortunately, even \nwith that victory which they won, Democrats blocked it.\n  I kept trying, and this year I worked out a bipartisan bill with \nSenator Baucus that the committee reported out on a voice vote. But \nagain, efforts to reauthorize welfare in regular order have stalled. If \nwe don't pass the Deficit Reduction Act, we will have to extend TANF \nfor a 12th time. That is an unconscionable way to legislate. States \ncannot continue operating their welfare programs unsure of what the \nnext reauthorization will bring.\n\n  Advocates complain that the $1 billion is not enough childcare money. \nBut I say to them, where were you over the past year when there was $6 \nbillion on the table and I was committed to bringing that $6 billion \nout of conference or we would not have had a conference report on TANF?\n  There has never been enough childcare money to satisfy those on the \nfar left--$5.5 billion wasn't enough; $7 billion wasn't enough. I don't \neven know if $20 billion would have been enough. The fact remains that \nthere hasn't been an increase in childcare for 4 years, and if we \npersist in passing extension after extension, there won't be any new \nchildcare money at all.\n  As I said in the beginning, it is difficult for many folks to get \nbeyond the numbers. But as I laid out here, this agreement includes \nmany provisions to provide services that better meet people's needs, \nand it does so by getting rid of waste and abuse in the programs.\n  These are dollars that right now we are simply throwing away. They \nget taxpayers and beneficiaries nothing. Without some changes, these \nimportant programs of Medicare, Medicaid, and TANF will be driven into \nthe ground. That some folks don't support these changes--well, to me, I \nbelieve they cannot see the forest for the trees.\n  The agreement before us includes sound policies. It achieves savings \nby reducing wasteful spending, closing loopholes, and taking steps to \npay providers more accurately. It improves oversight of Medicaid to \ncrack down on fraud and wasteful spending. It establishes policies to \nhelp families and beneficiaries and to ensure long-term viability of \nthese programs. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time for Senator \nGregg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, last week, I came to the floor to speak \nagainst the proposed reconciliation bill, and I used the analogy of the \nGrinch who stole Christmas. At that time, we did not have a conference \nreport yet before us, and I hoped that we might make some significant \nchanges in what would be sent to us after the House acted.\n  Unfortunately, although there were some changes, the overall impact \nof what has been sent to the Senate for action is disappointing and \ndeeply disturbing. While the Grinch stole the gifts, the decorations, \nand even the Christmas tree, this budget slashes hope. It slashes \nopportunity. It slashes support that the least among us need in order \nto be as productive and healthy as possible. This Republican budget \nslashes child support enforcement, Medicaid benefits, student loans, \nand so much else.\n  Now, the story of the Grinch who stole Christmas actually has a happy \nending, because the Grinch, seeing the error of his ways, returned what \nhe had taken. Unfortunately, I fear the budget before the Senate today \ndoes not have a happy ending. It represents a monumental failure by the \nRepublicans in Congress to recognize the real priorities that the \npeople of America--working families, students, seniors, and \nparticularly children--need.\n  The Republican priorities are crystal clear in this bill. The \nRepublican majority chose $2.6 billion in new tax breaks for oil \ncompanies. I don't know how that is a priority. I don't even know how \nthat is understandable. The oil companies could not be doing any better \nthan they are doing, and we are still giving them more tax breaks from \nhard-working American taxes. We still prohibit the Government from \nnegotiating for prescription drugs to lower the cost to Medicare \nbeneficiaries, which could save $100 billion for taxpayers. The \nRepublicans decided not to eliminate the $5.4 billion Medicare \ninsurance company slush fund and, instead, chose to cut home health \ncare, hospital quality improvements, imaging services, medical \nequipment, and hospital payments. And as usual, with the Republican \nmajority, they decided against cracking down on abusive corporate tax \nshelters such as mailbox headquarters and other loopholes.\n  We have heard a lot of this from the eloquent, persuasive \nargumentation by the Democratic ranking member on the Budget Committee, \nthe Senator from North Dakota. We have heard from others of our \ncolleagues raising the alarm about this ill-conceived budget. But one \nissue that has not yet been raised that I would like to highlight is \nthat I think this bill may very well increase the number of unintended \npregnancies and abortions in our country.\n  Why, you might ask? Today contraception and other family planning \nservices are provided as a matter of course under Medicaid. We do this \nbecause it is good for women to have access to such treatments and \nmedications. It also prevents unintended pregnancies and, therefore, \nprevents abortions and, therefore, saves money. For every dollar \nMedicaid spends on family planning, the Government saves $3. But this \nbill eliminates the guarantee.\n  I don't understand this. We obviously have very strong opinions and \ndeeply held convictions about abortion, but are we also divided about \ncontraception and family planning? Are we not in this body committed to \nreducing the number of abortions?\n  Apparently, we are not because the provision in this reconciliation \nbudget that eliminates family planning for Medicaid recipients makes it \nvery clear that the majority opposes contraception and family planning, \nwhich reduces unwanted pregnancies and abortions.\n  It makes no sense to me. I thought we were working toward a \nbipartisan agreement that we would try to prevent unwanted pregnancies \nand, therefore, reduce the need for abortion. I sadly predict that if \nthis measure stays in the bill, which apparently it is going to because \nwe expect to vote on it in the next several hours, the number of \nabortions will go up, the human and financial costs will go up, and \nmany women will really be out of luck.\n\n[[Page S14119]]\n\n  The other piece that is so troubling to me is young people aging out \nof foster care. These are young people for whom we try to provide some \nsupport services by continuing their access to Medicaid. They, too, \nwill not have access to family planning.\n  This is all about misplaced priorities, choices that do not serve our \nNation's future and puts the burden of balancing the budget on the \nbacks of working families, college students, seniors, single moms, and \nthe middle class.\n  Consider who is bearing the costs because we know there are winners \nand there are losers. Certainly, the winners will be oil companies, \ndrug companies, corporate freeloaders, and deadbeat parents. That is a \nwonderful list of whom we are helping in this Christmas season.\n  Despite rising medical expenses that burden middle-class and low-\nincome Americans, this bill cuts $6.9 billion from Medicaid by slashing \nbenefits and increasing costs to beneficiaries. We know there is a \nconsiderable body of research from RAND to the Urban Institute and many \nothers that have found if you increase copays and premium costs, \nbeneficiaries will skip needed care and may lose coverage entirely.\n  This bill also, for some reason, has it out for college students, the \nvery people we should encourage to get their education, to become \nproductive citizens, to have competitive jobs in a global economy. The \nbill cuts over $12.7 billion from student loan programs, resulting in \nhigher payments for 472,000 New Yorkers today and millions more in the \nyears to come.\n  The bill also undermines the Direct Loan Program which has been shown \nby every independent analysis to cost as much as 12 times less than the \nprivate loan program. So I guess we should put the banks on the list of \nwinners along with the corporate freeloaders and the deadbeat parents \nand the oil companies.\n  As millions of seniors struggle with medical bills, this bill slashes \n$6.4 billion from Medicare over the next 5 years, including a $1.6 \nbillion increase in Medicare Part B premiums, making it more expensive \nfor their seniors to visit their doctor this year instead of last.\n  The thing I am still totally amazed by is cutting $4.9 billion in \nchild enforcement, eliminating $343 million from foster care programs, \nundermining childcare for working families and TANF that rewards and \nenables work.\n  I don't know, Mr. President, I guess there are different priorities \nbetween us in this Chamber, and I am disappointed in that. Given that \n1.1 million more Americans fell into poverty last year, and over 37 \nmillion Americans, including 13 million children, live in poverty \ntoday, we are headed in the wrong direction.\n  I guess the Republican majority can brag about $2.6 billion in new \ntax cuts for oil companies, $6.9 billion in Medicaid cuts, and cuts to \nfoster children, the most vulnerable of all of our citizens. Corporate \nwelfare was saved. Student loans were cut. I don't know how you can, \nwith a straight face, say that is the kind of priorities we should be \nhaving at any time but particularly in the Christmas season. But I \nsuppose the folks who find these great big tax breaks under their tree \nare going to be grateful.\n\n  The ultimate irony is that this bill is being called deficit \nreduction. We know how to do deficit reduction. We did it in the 1990s. \nWe did it by making hard choices. We did it by making it clear that \nnobody was going to get off scot-free, that everybody would have to pay \ntheir fair share. Tough decisions would be made on both the revenue and \nthe spending side.\n  This bill doesn't reduce the deficit at all. In fact, it worsens the \ndeficit outlook by at least $30 billion. That is going to become even \nmore clear when we come back after the first of the year and the \nRepublicans give us $70 billion in additional tax cuts. Let's tell \neverybody those tax cuts are, once again, going to help people who have \nbeen helped already, quite substantially, over the last 5 years.\n  It is not doing much for the average American, it is not doing \nanything for some of the poorest of Americans, other than telling them \nthey are on their own.\n  In a time of war, with the third largest budget shortfall in our \nNation's history, when we have rising poverty again, the call for \nfinancial sacrifice by the White House and the Republican Congress \nfalls only on families struggling to make ends meet. It falls on our \nchildren particularly, the poorest of our children, foster care \nchildren, children whose parents are not providing support for them. It \ndoesn't fall on oil companies reaping record profits, not on the drug \ncompanies, not on the corporate freeloaders, not on the deadbeat \nparents.\n  This bill is not in keeping with the spirit of this season or the \npriorities of the American people. I hope that we will do better next \nyear. I hope that people will realize, as the Grinch did, that we don't \nneed to act in a way that is playing to the lowest common denominator, \nthat takes care of the privileged at the expense of everybody else. I \ndo think it is fair to say that this bill is unprecedented. Never has \nso much been done for so few who need it so little.\n  This is a very sad day in the Senate. I hope we can do better in the \nfuture on a bipartisan basis, and I hope that the real values of \nAmerica once again are put into action in the Congress.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I understand that we would go to Senator Rockefeller next, \nbut in an aside, I simply want to address one or two of the points made \nby the Senator from New York, who always makes excellent points and is \na very constructive member of the HELP Committee. When I was chairman, \nI enjoyed working with her and I have enjoyed working with her ever \nsince. In fact, as I recall, she actually voted for the language which \nwas reported from the HELP Committee which essentially accomplished \nwhat it appears she is concerned about now, which was to take the \ncorporate subsidy that lenders get today under the student loan program \nand reduce it.\n  As I have discussed before and discussed with Senator Kennedy, and I \nthink he appreciates this issue, and some of the other folks who \nbrought this issue up, there is no student loan reduction in this bill. \nStudent loans are expanded. We create a whole new program for low-\nincome students who are interested in math and science and we expand \nthe money going into Pell grants. Where there is a reduction in this \nbill is in the corporate subsidy area for lenders. If we do not pass \nthis bill, as I said earlier, there would be a windfall to corporate \nlenders of about $7 billion. That is why I said my staff corrected me. \nThey estimate the windfall to lenders would be closer to $18 billion if \nwe do not pass this bill this year and that is a function of the fact \nthat the lenders are getting an artificially high interest rate. We are \ntaking that down. With the money we receive from that--and it comes out \nof the corporate lenders, not out of the students--we are taking part \nof this and we are putting it into helping more students, especially \nlow-income students, be able to go to college.\n  If a teacher teaches special needs kids under IDEA, they can have \n$17,500 of their loans forgiven under this bill--$17,500 will be \nforgiven if they go into teaching special needs students because we \nthink that is important. If one is a low-income individual who has done \nwell in high school in math and science and they decide when they go to \ncollege that they want to pursue math and science on top of their Pell \ngrant, on top of their student loans, they are going to get a $4,000-a-\nyear grant for the last 2 years they are in college, a big boost for \nlow-income students who pursue math and science. That is where the \nmoney has been directed. I think it is the right priority. I suspect \nthat is why the Senator from New York voted for the bill when it passed \nout of the committee.\n  What is the order now? Do we go to Senator Talent and then Senator \nRockefeller, or Senator Rockefeller and then Senator Talent?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Senator Talent is up.\n  Mr. GREGG. If Senator Rockefeller is ready, why not have the Senator \nproceed and then we will go to the Senator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized on Democratic \ntime.\n\n[[Page S14120]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota will yield time \non his side to the Senator from West Virginia when he is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If we could have Mr. Talent go first, we have a bit of a \nlogjam we need to work out on this side. I ask Senator Rockefeller to \nwithhold for one moment. The problem is there are multiple Members who \nwish to speak on a matter unrelated to the budget at this moment on \nthis side. We have to work that out, so it will take a moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield to the Senator from Missouri 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, as we debate the very important issue of \ndeficit reduction, I want to take a few minutes to discuss a provision \nincluded in the Deficit Reduction Act. It is an issue of great \nimportance and one that many Senators have been working on for more \nthan 3 years, the reauthorization of TANF, the Temporary Assistance for \nNeedy Families Program.\n  As a freshman Member of the House, I introduced the welfare reform \nlegislation that subsequently became the basis for the historic \nbipartisan welfare reform bill, the Personal Responsibility Act of \n1996. Since that time I have viewed welfare reform as a priority issue, \nan issue of great significance to millions of Americans.\n  Welfare reform has been one of the most successful social policy \nreforms in U.S. history. The 1996 welfare reform legislation made \nremarkable headway in helping welfare dependents move toward self-\nsufficiency. It dramatically reduced State welfare case1oads and child \npoverty, and it increased welfare recipient employment.\n  Welfare reform is based on the understanding that the two best anti-\npoverty programs are work and marriage. The old welfare system seduced \nmillions of people into poverty by offering assistance on the condition \nthat they not get a job, not get married, and have children anyway. It \nmeasured success by how many people it was able to get on welfare. The \nnew system measures success by how many people get off welfare, or \nnever have to go on welfare.\n  The welfare reform bill has been an astounding success. Since 1996, \ncash welfare caseloads have fallen by more than 50 percent nationwide. \nThe caseload in the former Aid to Families with Dependent Children \nprogram, AFDC, now TANF, has fallen from 4.3 million families in August \n1996 to fewer than 2 million in March 2005.\n  States have overhauled their welfare programs to stress work, as \nrequired by the reform, and as a result the percentage of working \nwelfare recipients has more than doubled since 1996. The poorest 20 \npercent of single mother families reported a 67 percent increase in \ntheir earnings between 1995 and 2002, after adjusting for inflation, \nand the next quintile of single mothers saw their average earnings grow \nby more than $4,000 between 1995 and 2002. The Urban Institute reported \nearlier this year that single mothers' real wages continued to increase \nduring the 2000-2004 period despite the 2001 recession and terrorist \nattacks. It is better from every perspective for able bodied people to \nbring home a paycheck rather than a welfare check.\n  If we fail to pass welfare reauthorization and are forced to extend \nthe 1996 law for the 12th time, millions of families will remain on the \nwelfare rolls rather than engaged in productive and self-sufficient \njobs. Because most States have met the targets of the 1996 law, they \nnow have no incentive to extend the benefits of work to able bodied \npeople still on the rolls. This reauthorization increases the effective \nwelfare work rate target from zero percent to 50 percent in fiscal year \n2007 through fiscal year 2010. It achieves this by rebasing the \ncaseload reduction credit to provide credit only for future caseload \ndeclines.\n  The reauthorization also contains important provisions encouraging \nhealth marriages. Marriage is the cornerstone of the family. The \ndecline of marriage since the 1960's has been accompanied by a rise in \na number of serious social problems. Children born out-of-wedlock are \nmore likely to experience poverty, abuse, and behavioral and emotional \nproblems, to have lower academic achievement, and to use drugs more \noften. Single mother are much more likely to be victims of domestic \nviolence. On the other hand, children whose parents choose marriage, \nand learn how to form and sustain healthy marriages, are less likely to \nbe depressed, repeat a grade in school, and have fewer developmental \nproblems. Not only are healthy marriages good for the family, they are \ngood for society and our economy.\n  Supporting healthy marriage is essential to continuing the success of \nthe original welfare reform. This reauthorization provides $500 million \nfor healthy marriage promotion over the next 5 years. These dollars \nwill be used to fund community-based programs to counsel young women \nabout the benefits of healthy marriage and help them and their \nchildren's father build relationship, parenting and communications \nskills. This program will not just seek to increase marriage rates \namong target couples, but also will provide ongoing support to help at-\nrisk couples maintain healthy marriages over time and reduce the \nlikelihood of divorce.\n  Although the welfare reauthorization included in the Deficit \nReduction Act does not include every provision I had hoped would be \nincluded in the reauthorization of the 1996 law, it has a number of \nimportant provisions. Welfare reauthorization has been a long time \ncoming. We are rapidly approaching the end of the eleventh extension to \nthe welfare bill on December 31, 2005, and will need to pass a twelfth \nextension before we leave for the year if we fail to pass the Deficit \nReduction Act. This reauthorization contains many of the provisions I \nincluded in S. 105, the sonal Responsibility, Work, and Family \nPromotion Act of 2005. Most importantly it strengthens the work and \nmarriage provisions, the two best anti-poverty programs. I hope my \ncolleagues will support this measure which will provide many Americans \nwith the resources they need to go from welfare dependency to self-\nsufficiency.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, is the time running against both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If time is not yielded, it will be charged \nequally against both sides.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, are we in a quorum call?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Not at the moment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I make a point of order a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Chair inform us, before we go into the quorum \ncall, how much time is left on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority controls 46 minutes and the \nminority 49 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask during the quorum call the time be \nequally charged.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we permit the \nSenator from West Virginia to speak as if in morning business for a \nperiod not to exceed 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. At the end of that time, I further ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senator from West Virginia offer a quorum call to be equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, time \nwill be equally divided.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the distinguished \nSenator from North Dakota.\n\n\n          Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I have asked to address the Senate on \na national security matter of great concern to me. I call my \ncolleagues' attention to the Senate's inexplicable failure to pass the \nfiscal year 2006 Intelligence authorization bill.\n\n[[Page S14121]]\n\n  The bill was approved and reported by the Intelligence Committee on \nSeptember 29, and it has been available for Senate action since \nNovember 16. This legislation is too important to be allowed to \nlanguish in legislative limbo. That is where it is. I am at a loss to \nunderstand why the Senate cannot complete action before we adjourn on a \nmatter of national security that is this important.\n  As I understand the current parliamentary situation, the Intelligence \nauthorization bill cannot be brought up or be passed under unanimous \nconsent because of Republican objection, and the majority leader has \ndecided that it does not merit the minimal amount of floor time needed \nto approve the bill, which would pass quickly.\n\n  I am informed that one or more Republican Senators object to the \ninclusion of amendments offered by Democratic Senators even though \nChairman Roberts has accepted those amendments--and those amendments \nwere agreed to by the full committee. If there is opposition to these \nprovisions, I urge the majority leader to allow us to bring up the \nbill, debate, and vote on the amendments. Our side is willing to agree \nto very short time agreements to each of the three amendments.\n  The unwillingness to consider this bill is more puzzling because of \nthe bipartisan effort that has gone into the development of this bill.\n  The Republican objection is preventing us from considering this \ncritical national security legislation. The Intelligence Committee is, \nafter all, an exceedingly important committee which is burdened with \nheavy responsibilities and which needs to have an authorizing piece of \nlegislation underneath it. I hope, whatever the objection is, the \nmajority leader and Senator Roberts can find a way to overcome it \nbefore we finish our business for this session.\n  The recent revelations related to surveillance and intelligence \ncollection within the United States and the lack of effective \ncongressional oversight of that program make passage of this \nlegislation even more critical. One of the important themes of the bill \nis the improvement of oversight, both within the intelligence community \nand by Congress itself. That would include the Intelligence Committee, \nwhich needs to be having intelligence oversight hearings on a number of \nmatters, which it is not now doing. This theme is embodied in several \nsections of the legislation--in the classified annex and specifically \namendments offered specifically by Senators Kennedy and Kerry.\n  In both the public text of our bill and the associated classified \nannex, the committee also has included language requiring the provision \nof information to the Intelligence Committees, specifically about \nsomething called detention and interrogation, which has a fair share of \npublic attention. Additionally, the amendments offered by Senators \nKennedy and Kerry, each of which has been agreed to, as I have \nindicated, by Chairman Roberts and the full committee, also will \nrequire additional information Congress needs in order to oversee \ndetention and interrogation programs, something the Intelligence \nCommittee should be doing.\n  The Kerry amendment, my colleagues will recall, was added to the \nDefense authorization bill without objection, only to be dropped in \nconference.\n  Finally, an amendment offered by Senator Kennedy and accepted by \nChairman Roberts will require the Director of National Intelligence to \nprovide the congressional Intelligence Committee all Presidential daily \nbriefs, or portions of them, from the beginning of President Clinton's \nsecond term in January of 1997 until March 19, 2003, when our troops \nactually crossed into Iraq on that day, which refer to Iraq or \notherwise address Iraq in any way, shape, or form. This information \nwill fill an important gap in the Intelligence Committee's access to \nall intelligence available prior to the war in Iraq.\n  If we do not act on this legislation, it will be an unprecedented \nfailure.\n  Since the Intelligence Committee was created, we have had an \nunblemished record of 27 years of completing work with this critical \nauthorizing legislation. Never once have we failed. The annual \nIntelligence authorization bill has rightly been considered ``must \npass'' legislation. That is exactly how we should view it.\n  I call upon the President to weigh in and break this impasse. The \nPresident has been critical of bipartisan concerns voiced about the \nPATRIOT Act conference report but has been curiously silent about the \nRepublican roadblocks preventing passage of this critical piece of \nnational security legislation.\n  If the Republican objection to the unanimous consent agreement cannot \nbe overcome, I hope the majority leader will change his mind and allow \nthe Senate to consider the bill under a short time agreement with votes \non any issues in contention.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, many of us had hoped the Senate would \ntake up the Intelligence authorization bill and allow us to offer an \namendment to require the Director of National Intelligence to make the \npresidential daily briefs on Iraq available to the Intelligence \nCommittees of the Senate and House, beginning with the last term of the \nClinton administration and ending on the first day of the war in Iraq \nin 2003.\n  Unfortunately, an unidentified Republican has a hold on the bill to \nprevent Senate action unless the amendment is withdrawn along with two \nother amendments on secret detention facilities.\n  It is obvious that some of our Republican colleagues are bent on \navoiding the truth about the war. To prevent debate on this all-\nimportant issue, the Republican majority is apparently willing to let \nthe whole intelligence bill fail. I don't agree with that tactic. It is \na blatant coverup.\n  President Bush has repeatedly claimed in recent weeks that Congress \nhad access to the same intelligence he did in deciding to go to war in \nIraq. As President Bush specifically stated in his Veterans Day address \nin Pennsylvania last month, ``. . . more than a hundred Democrats in \nthe House and Senate--who had access to the same intelligence--voted to \nsupport removing Saddam Hussein from power.''\n  He repeated the claim on November 14, November 17, and again in his \nDecember 14 address to the Nation on the war in Iraq. In fact, he had \nmade the same statement 98 times between March and October 2004, when \nhis decision to go to war was under serious challenge in the \npresidential election that year. It is hardly surprising, therefore, \nthat the President is now dusting off the same talking points today, \nwhen his decision to go to war is again under serious challenge.\n  Vice President Cheney and National Security Advisor Hadley have made \nsimilar claims.\n  How they could all make such an obvious false claim is beyond belief. \nIt is bad enough that they distorted the intelligence on the need for \nthe war. Now they are blatantly distorting the facts about how much \naccess Congress had to the intelligence.\n  Someone on the White House staff obviously needs to correct the \nPresident's talking points before he parrots them in another speech.\n  President Bush should have taken a close and comprehensive look at \nthe intelligence, rather than building a case for war based on cherry-\npicked intelligence It is not enough to recognize now that the \nintelligence was not accurate. Whatever flaws existed in the \nintelligence were far outweighed by the devious way the administration \nmanipulated the intelligence to support its preconceived desire for war \nand ignored the serious doubts that we now know undermined the \nintelligence.\n  The administration claims the intelligence wasn't deliberately \ndistorted to justify the war. But how can they possibly pretend that \nCongress had access to that intelligence?\n  The White House has access to thousands of intelligence documents \nthat Congress never sees. According to a December 14 report by the \nCongressional Research Service, ``The President, and a small number of \npresidentially-designated Cabinet-level officials, including the Vice \nPresident--in contrast to Members of Congress--have access to a far \ngreater overall volume of intelligence and to more sensitive \nintelligence information, including information regarding intelligence \nsources and methods. They, unlike Members of Congress, also have the \nauthority to more extensively task the intelligence community, and its \nextensive cadre of analysts for follow-up information.''\n\n[[Page S14122]]\n\n  But, the principal document that Congress doesn't see is the \npresidential daily brief, the so-called PDB, which is prepared \nspecifically for the President. It contains very important classified \nintelligence, and equally important information about the credibility \nof the intelligence. It is therefore an extremely valuable document.\n  President Bush receives the PDB every morning and is given an oral \nbriefing on it by top intelligence officials. The practice began in the \nJohnson administration and is intended to give each President a \ndetailed overall view of national security concerns, including \nterrorist threats against the United States.\n  As the administration well knows, Members of Congress certainly do \nnot receive this daily briefing document. In fact, when Congress has \nsought copies of PDBs, the requests have been denied.\n  In the case of Iraq, as part of its investigation of the pre-war \nintelligence, the Senate Intelligence Committee specifically asked to \nreview the PDBs relevant to the key issues of Iraq's weapons of mass \ndestruction and Saddam Hussein's links to terrorists. The White House \nflatly denied the request.\n  The committee is now working on the second phase of its \ninvestigation, which is whether the administration distorted the \nintelligence on Iraq in order to strengthen the case for war.\n  So far, however, instead of providing the PDBs as part of an effort \nto find the truth, the White House continues to hide behind a veil of \nsecrecy by refusing to disclose these briefs. It is difficult to \nbelieve that there is any sound national security reason for the \nadministration to continue stonewalling Congress by denying access to \nthese PDBs. The obvious explanation is coverup.\n  Members of the Silberman-Robb Commission appointed by the President \nto examine pre-war intelligence were given access to articles within \nPDBs on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs. Four of the 10 \nmembers of the 9-11 Commission were given PDB articles they requested. \nIf these commissioners were given access, Congress should have been \ngiven access as well for its own investigation of the all-important \nquestions about why we went to war and the way we went to war.\n  The administration's drumbeat for war in Iraq began at the end of the \nsummer in 2002. It was carefully staged. As White House Chief of Staff \nAndrew Card said on September that year about the plan for war, ``From \na marketing point of view, you don't introduce new products in \nAugust.''\n  Hardly by coincidence, the timing of the war also coincided with the \nfinal phase of the congressional election campaigns that year.\n  One further point deserves mention. Initially, in the run-up to the \nwar in 2002, the Administration did not produce and give Congress a \nNational Intelligence Estimate--a document summarizing the collective \nexpert wisdom of the intelligence community--to support its claims \nabout Iraq's involvement with al-Qaida and its development of nuclear, \nchemical, and biological weapons of mass destruction. When Democrats on \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee insisted that an estimate be \nproduced, it was finally provided on October 1, 2002, 2 days before the \ncongressional resolution authorizing the war was brought before the \nSenate for debate. The estimate itself buried important dissenting \nviews in the footnotes.\n  The Senate adopted the war resolution on October 11, the day after it \npassed the House of Representatives--and after 6 weeks of an aggressive \nWhite House campaign replete with images of mushroom clouds over \nAmerica, in a brazen attempt to pressure Congress to give the President \nthe blank check he wanted for the war, and to do so before adjourning \nfor the November elections.\n  As we now know all too well, Saddam had no weapons of mass \ndestruction and no ties to al-Qaida; 150,000 American troops are bogged \ndown in a quagmire in Iraq in a war that America never should have \nfought, that has seriously undermined our respect in the world, and \nthat has made the real war on terrorism far harder to win.\n  It is time for the administration to come clean and provide the PDBs \nto the Congress.\n  This is not a meaningless debate about documents. The issue is the \nquality and quantity of intelligence the President was looking at when \nhe made the decision to go to war.\n  It's essential to get to the bottom of the rush to war--not only to \nget the truth, but also because there are other threats on the horizon \nas well--in Iran, North Korea and elsewhere. America must get it right \nnext time, and access to the PDBs is an essential part of doing so.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate go into a quorum and that the time be equally divided between \nboth sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator from \nMassachusetts be recognized as in morning business for up to 15 \nminutes. I ask at the end of the Senator's remarks, a quorum call be \nput in, and the quorum call be charged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The quorum call will be charged equally.\n  Mr. CONRAD. What would occur if there was an objection to the quorum \ncall?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask to amend the unanimous consent \nrequest that Senator Stevens be allowed to proceed, as Senator Kerry, \nin morning business, and not charged to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object, with the understanding \nthen a quorum call be put in, and the quorum be charged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If a quorum call is entered, at that point it \nwill be charged equally, without objection.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. We will proceed with Senator Kerry for \nup to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair, and I thank the managers.\n\n\n                     Clandestine Prison Facilities\n\n  Mr. President, more than a month ago we learned of the possible \nexistence of clandestine prison facilities operated around the world by \nthe Central Intelligence Agency. This revelation caused serious \nproblems with some of our most important allies in the war on terror, \nand it raised important questions about the Congress's ability and \nwillingness to perform oversight.\n  Before the Thanksgiving break, the Senate came together in a \nbipartisan fashion to pass an amendment to the Defense Authorization \nAct which would have required a report on alleged clandestine detention \nfacilities operated by our own Government. I was glad to be able to \nwork with Senator Roberts and Senator Rockefeller to craft language \nthat would make it possible for Congress to do this job. It was a \nsuccessful effort. It was a remarkably bipartisan effort.\n  On November 10, 2005, the Senate voted 82 to 9 for the amendment we \nworked out. That amendment required the Director of National \nIntelligence to provide a classified report to the members of the \nIntelligence Committees of both the House and the Senate which would \nset forth basic information, including the location and size of such \nfacilities, the number of detainees held, and the explanation of what \nwe intend to do with those detainees. For example, will they face \nmilitary tribunals? What will be the consequences and manner of their \ndetention?\n  Finally, consistent with the McCain antitorture amendment, my \namendment would require a description of the interrogation procedures \nused on detainees in such facilities and a determination of whether \nthose procedures were in compliance with America's obligations under \nthe Geneva Conventions and the Convention Against Torture. The House \nendorsed that amendment with a bipartisan vote just last week.\n  Now, not surprisingly, given that this was an intelligence provision \non a DOD bill, the amendment to the Defense authorization bill fell out \nin the conference--not on the merits, on procedure. We anticipated \nthat, and we\n\n[[Page S14123]]\n\nworked with the Intelligence Committee in order to attach it to the \nintelligence authorization bill.\n  Here we are, and the intelligence authorization bill is stalled in \nthe Senate. This important amendment is in limbo because an extreme \nminority objects to an amendment with strong bipartisan support from \nMembers in both Chambers of the Congress. More than 80 Senators voted \nfor this amendment about a month ago. The chairman of the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence supports it. The vice chairman supports it. \nBut the bill and this amendment will not move.\n  All here believe in what we are trying to do to win the war on \nterror. Everyone here accepts this is a war we need to win. We do not \nunderestimate, any of us, the depravity and viciousness of our enemies \nor of what is at stake. We have absolute confidence in the desire and \nthe determination of the American people to join in doing anything \nnecessary in order to win. But we also believe the informed consent of \nthe American public is crucial to that success.\n  As I said more than a month ago when we first debated this issue, in \nan issue as sensitive as this, one which challenges the basic value \nsystems by which we operate, the informed consent that allows you to do \nwhat you need to do will only come through the Congress itself, through \nour active understanding and involvement in these issues. That requires \ninformation. It requires cooperation from the administration so we in \nCongress can provide effective and informed oversight.\n\n  I find it very difficult to understand why anyone would hold up \nlegislation as important as the Intelligence Authorization Act, to \nobject to an amendment that has such strong bipartisan support in the \nSenate, to delay an amendment that does not pass any judgment on the \nmerits or the value of those facilities but simply informs the Senate \nabout where, what, and how those facilities may or may not be operated.\n  To frustrate an effort that seeks only to help Congress have \ninformation with which to do its job seems to be an extreme position, \nindeed. In this case, our job is oversight. Our job is to make sure we \nare not violating laws. Our job is to make sure we are living up to our \nstandards and our values.\n  I thank Senator Roberts, and I thank Senator Rockefeller for their \nhard work and their diligence on this issue. I hope we can find a \nresolution and pass the Intelligence Authorization Act this week. This \nis an important bill. At a time when a lot of the debate in the Senate \nis involved with matters of urgency for troops and urgency for national \nsecurity, and where the President is holding press conferences and \nattacking individual Senators for their interference in the war on \nterror, and so on and so forth, it seems to me to not move forward on \nthe intelligence authorization bill is to, in a concrete way, be \nstanding in the way of doing the very things the President is talking \nabout. I hope we can find a way to move that.\n  Under the rule, I see the Senator from Kansas wants to speak. But if \nI recall, there is an understanding that Senator Stevens was going to \nspeak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KERRY. I don't yield the floor yet. I am happy to yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If I could ask the Senator from Massachusetts a \nquestion, as I understand, under the previous agreement, Senator \nStevens was to go next and is not ready. I ask if I could get the floor \nto ask unanimous consent to proceed ahead of Senator Stevens.\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving the right to object, I will not object, \nproviding that the same agreement stands with respect to the quorum \ncall that the Senator from North Dakota put into place with respect to \nmy agreement and the agreement for Senator Stevens.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, all we are trying to do is get people to \nhave time to speak. Senator Brownback was to go next, and Senator \nStevens, and when we go into a quorum call the time comes off the bill \nin an equal way, equal time. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object, could I be advised of what \nthe unanimous consent request was?\n  Mr. GREGG. That Senator Brownback be allowed to speak.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I was requesting unanimous consent to be able to speak \nat this point in time on the discussion. As I understood, it was locked \nin for Senator Stevens to speak at this point. I was asking for that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How long will the Senator seek to speak?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I anticipate under 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. And Senator Stevens would like to go after that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thought I had time, but I am happy to yield to anyone.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We are happy to have you go, Senator. We are just trying \nto make certain we know the times.\n  Could we modify the unanimous consent request in this respect: the \nSenator from Kansas be recognized for up to 15 minutes off the bill?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. On the bill.\n  Mr. CONRAD. On the bill on the majority side.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator is going to speak as if in morning business, I \nbelieve, but on the bill.\n  Mr. CONRAD. You would like him to speak in morning business rather \nthan--all right. So the Senator will speak as in morning business for \nup to 15 minutes, and then the Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, will \nbe recognized for up to 15 minutes, again as in morning business, and \nthen at that time a quorum call will be put in that is equally charged.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator cannot enter a quorum call at this \ntime by unanimous consent. If a quorum call is later entered, it will \nbe charged equally.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to further modify my request \nbecause I understand there are other Senators who also would like to \nspeak as in morning business.\n  I ask Senator Durbin, how much time would you like?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Fifteen minutes. I ask that Senator Durbin be recognized \nfor 15 minutes as in morning business. And for Senator Boxer, how much \ntime? She would like up to 30 minutes as in morning business. Could we \nget those agreed to as well, with the additional understanding that we \ngo into a quorum call at that point and that it be equally charged.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would \npresume they would be speaking after Senator Stevens.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank very much the Chair. I thank also the chairman of \nthe committee for continuing to work in this cooperative way to use the \ntime efficiently. And we thank all of our colleagues for their \npatience.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I thank my \ncolleagues for allowing me this opportunity to speak as if in morning \nbusiness on the bill. I think it is important in morning business to be \nable to talk about the bill. This is an important bill, and it is a key \npiece of legislation. I think it is an important thing for us to move \nforward.\n  On the basic facts on the federal budget, which have been covered a \nlot, we are hearing a lot about this across the country. We are \nspending too much money, and we are driving the deficit up too big. It \nis just the basic facts.\n  We have a $319 billion budget deficit for fiscal year 2005. It is \ntime--past time--that we start addressing this issue. I came to the \nHouse of Representatives with the class of 1994. The lead issue we were \ntalking about at that point in time was balancing the budget. We had \nnot had a balanced budget since Dwight Eisenhower was President of the \nUnited States in the 1950s. It was past time. We were in trillions of \ndollars of debt. Now we are at over $8 trillion of debt.\n  So we pushed and we pushed and we pushed, and we, in that class, with \nmany others working with us, got together to balance the budget. We did \nit with a simple formula. You have to get the economy growing rapidly. \nIt has to be moving forward, churning out for the economy and churning \nout a number of tax receipts. Then you have to restrain your growth of \nFederal spending so your growth in the country and\n\n[[Page S14124]]\n\nits economy exceeds the growth rate of your Federal spending. That is \nhow we got to a balanced budget for 3 years, for the first time since \nEisenhower. It was a big push by that class, by many people at that \npoint in time, to get us to a balanced budget. And we did it.\n  And while the President--at that time President Clinton--may have \ntaken a lot of credit for it, the credit belongs to the Congress. The \nCongress is the one that spends the money, the one that authorizes the \nspending of money. We are the ones who restrained that growth of \nFederal spending, where it was slower than the overall growth rate of \nthe economy. That got us to a balance. We have to do the same now.\n  The economy is growing. Last quarter, it grew at about a 4.4-percent \nannual growth rate. It was good, solid growth taking place. Now we have \nto restrain the growth of Federal spending so we can get to a balance. \nThis effort, this reconciliation package, starts us down that road. We \nneed to get to balance, I think, in 5 years. We need to have a balance \nin the budget in a 5-year time frame. This starts with us. It certainly \ndoes not get us there, but it does start us in the process of \nrestraining that growth of Federal spending. It is absolutely essential \nthat we do this.\n  We have to reach across the board at all places of Federal spending \nto be able to get that sort of reduction to take place.\n  I want to put forward, too, in front of my colleagues, a chart. I \ndon't know if people follow these charts very well. The Government \nactually scores the effectiveness of Government spending. We look to \nsee whether a program is meeting its targeted goals. These are scored \nby the Office of Management and Budget. It is a set review. It is an \nobjective set of standards. Then the Department, the agency, the \nentity, or the particular program is actually given a letter grade \nscore on its effectiveness for doing what it was targeted to do.\n  I want to show my colleagues some of these program reviews that have \ntaken place. Under the heading ``Department/Agency,'' Transportation \ngets the highest score for effectiveness in hitting the target of the \nprogram. I don't think anyone wants wasteful spending. They want the \nspending to be something that is going to real programs and helping \nreal people. The Department of Transportation had 10 programs reviewed, \nhad a median score of 78.1, and got a C+ grade average. Now, if my kids \ncame home from school with a C+, I would say: Well, OK, you tried hard, \nbut we need to get that up. We need to work harder to have a higher \nlevel of effectiveness score for you.\n\n  The problem is, the Department of Transportation had the high score. \nThat was the high score in the class. It was at a C+ level. You can \nlook down here: The State Department had a C; a C- for Energy, \nTreasury; D+ for NASA, Commerce, Defense, USAID; D for the Small \nBusiness Administration. Then you go on down to a number of programs \nthat actually received a failing score for effectiveness in hitting \nthis objective set target.\n  The reason I point this out is to say that we have to do more to \nreview our agencies to make sure hard-earned taxpayer dollars are being \nwell spent.\n  One of the things we put forward that I think is needed is a systems \nchange on how we spend money. We are making a cut here, a reduction in \nthe growth rate, that is taking place overall. We are making that cut \nhere. But what we need to do is go through the full set of Federal \nprograms and ask: Which ones are effective and which ones are not? \nWhich ones maybe have been effective in the past, but the programs have \nactually accomplished their mission? Which ones duplicate other \nprograms that already exist in the Federal Government? Frankly, there \nare many. But we have not found ways or systems to change this, so we \nkeep on spending. The spending continues to grow.\n  So we put forward a bill called the Commission on the Accountability \nand Review of Federal Agencies, CARFA, on the process of a system-wide \nreview of effectiveness and eliminating those programs that are not \neffective.\n  We have 25 Senate cosponsors. The program roughly works similar to \nthe BRAC commission, the Base Realignment and Closure Commission. It \nworks along the lines of saying: OK, let's look at all of Government, \nevery bit of Government. If a program is duplicative, if a program has \naccomplished its purpose, if a program is scoring very low on its \neffectiveness, then it is put into a group of programs by the \nCommission. There could be 50--it might be 500--submitted to the \nPresident. He or she then either approves, disapproves, and sends it to \nthe Congress. Then the Congress has to vote on whether to keep the \nwhole package of programs or to eliminate the whole package of \nprograms. It is a systems review, a process of pulling out programs, \nwhich we have not been able to find a way to do.\n  This model is along what we do with base closings because we, prior \nto the base-closing commission process, did not have an effective base \nclosing process and were not able to close a military base. Any time \none would get challenged, Senators, Congressmen, Congresswomen in that \nparticular State would defend that base, no matter how irrelevant it \nmay have grown to the current mission of the military. They were \ndefending it for their home team and home turf, and we could not \neliminate a single program.\n  Through BRAC we closed or realigned nearly 100 military bases. The \nrest of Government needs a ``BRAC.'' We need it desperately. I think we \nneed it not only to control the spending but also to be able to put \nspending in higher priority areas: to reduce the deficit and to regain \nthe credibility of the American people, showing that we are actually \nmonitoring and working to make sure Federal spending is in priority \nareas and is not wasted.\n  It drives people crazy that money is wasted in Federal programs. It \ndrives me crazy. People tell me time and again: I am willing to spend \nthe money, but don't waste it. Don't shoot it somewhere.\n  That irritates people and it irritates me. Yet, we have not found an \neffective way to get at Government spending. Here is the process. It \nhas been approved by Congress, used by Congress, and it has been \neffective in eliminating the marginal military bases. It needs to be \nemployed for the rest of Government now.\n  I put this forward here because we are talking now about trying to \nget Federal spending under control, to get back to a balanced budget, \nwhich we need to do. Let's change the system. At the end of the process \nhere or next year, let's start changing the system so we can \neffectively get at this. We have to do this. It is inappropriate for us \nto leave these kinds of deficits for our children. It is wrong. I \ncampaigned on this when I first came into the Congress, and I have \nconsistently said we need to balance the budget. It is wrong to leave a \nbigger mortgage on the farm for your children than the one you had. \nThat is philosophically wrong. That is putting your burden on future \ngenerations when you should have taken care of it yourself. We can do \nbetter, but the system has to change in the process.\n  I am pleased we are moving forward on this particular bill. I \nstrongly support it. I think it is important for the country, and I \nthink it is an important statement. Having said that, I think this is a \nstep in a process that we have got to use to get this spending under \ncontrol. We can do better and we can have more effective Federal \nspending, and that will build support among people, not diminish it. \nWhen people see us actually prioritizing spending and eliminating \nwasteful spending taking place, it will build more confidence in the \ngovernmental system and the way things should be and the way things \nneed to move on forward. I think that is important.\n  On a separate issue that will come up shortly, I think it is very \nimportant for us to get our energy security needs addressed. We are not \nin an energy-secure position now. We are very dependent upon a number \nof places overseas that are volatile. We are dependent, as we have seen \nourselves in places in our country where severe weather patterns could \nbe harmful, such as the oil production shutdown during Katrina. A \nnumber of us are working on a bipartisan bill to get more and more of \nour fleet of cars off of gasoline, by using hybrids and plug-in \ntechnology to move our car fleet into electric. A fact a lot of people \ndon't know about is that half of Americans actually drive about 20 \nmiles a day. If we can get those 20 miles from electric instead of \ngasoline, our demand and dependency on foreign oil plummets.\n\n[[Page S14125]]\n\n  This is a bipartisan bill. Senator Lieberman and I are leading on \nthis. I hope we can move forward on this next year. In the meantime, we \nhave to get more oil domestically, and the place for us to do that is \nANWR. We can do it effectively and in an environmentally sound way. It \nis important that we do it for our own people and our own security. We \ncannot afford to continue this energy vulnerability that we have. I \nthink our conscience and soul were shaken when we saw the prices get to \nwhere they did, at $3 a gallon and above--saying this situation is not \nsustainable. We need to address this. I know it is a difficult topic \nfor a number of people, but we need to do this for our own energy \nsecurity and for the security of this Nation. It is an important thing \nfor us to do. That is why I strongly support the ANWR provision. Doing \nthis in an environmentally sound fashion, yet reducing our dependency \nlevel and increasing our energy security in a minor way, but doing it \nand moving forward with that. I think it is important to do that.\n  We are here late in the year and I think everybody would much rather \nbe at home with family or doing things in other places than here. But \nthese are important pieces of legislation. Balancing the budget is very \nimportant for our future and our children, and a good Christmas \npresent. Energy security is important for our Nation and for our \nchildren, an important Christmas present we can give them as well--to \nbuild a more secure future for this Nation.\n  I thank the Chair. With that, I yield the remainder of my time and \nyield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous \nconsent that it be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have asked for this time to share with \nthe Senate the letters of support I have received as chairman of the \nDefense Subcommittee in support of the Department of Defense \nappropriations conference report. These groups include public safety \ngroups, including: Association of Public Safety Communications \nOfficials International, called APCO; Congressional Fire Services \nInstitute; International Association of Chiefs of Police; International \nAssociation of Fire Chiefs; Major Cities Chiefs Association; Major \nCounties Sheriffs' Association; National League of Cities; and National \nAssociation of Counties.\n  In addition to that list, there are letters from labor: Veterans of \nForeign War; Naval Reserve Association; American Legion; American \nPetroleum Institute; Competitive Enterprise Institute; Ducks Unlimited; \nNational Association of Manufacturers; Campaign for Home Energy \nAssistance; National Defense Council; Edison Electric Institute; \nReserve Officers Association; and Chamber of Commerce.\n  Also in support are the Air Transport Association and the American \nGas Association.\n  Having read that list, I want to read from some of those letters, \nwhich I consider to be very significant. Before getting to that, \nhowever, I have just received an announcement from the chairman of the \nHouse Appropriations Committee that if this conference report is not \napproved, the House believes that a continuing resolution should fund \nthe Government. I do believe we ought to listen to the voices from the \nHouse concerning what is going to happen if this conference report is \nnot approved.\n  The Association of Public Safety Communications Officials \nInternational, which includes all of these people I have talked about \nnow, in terms of all of the associations with regard to public safety, \nhas said they support this measure, that it can provide $1 billion for \nthe Department of Homeland Security. There is $1 billion in State and \nlocal governments preparedness grants.\n  I have the letter from American Legion which specifically points out \nthat they have reviewed the conference report and support its \nenactment. It states specifically:\n\n       The American Legion continues to support the further \n     development of domestic sources of energy to include \n     increasing petroleum exploration and production in an \n     environmentally sensible manner so as to reduce America's \n     reliance on foreign petroleum.\n\n  That is a very positive statement concerning the ANWR provisions.\n  Veterans of Foreign War have written to me saying they believe this \nconference report should be approved as quickly as possible. I will ask \nto have their letter printed in the Record.\n  The Competitive Enterprise Institute says that, yes, there should be \na vote now on this conference report. They specifically applaud the \nprovision that will provide for initiating exploration and development \nof the Arctic plain and states that environmental groups have spread \nmisinformation about ANWR for years. I will ask for that to be printed \nin the Record. It points out the legislation passed by the House will \nlimit oil and gas drilling only to involve 2,000 acres of the 1.5 \nmillion acres of the Coastal Plain and states there is strong support \nfor this provision.\n\n  I have a memo from Unions Responsible for ANWR Development. It \nspecifically urges support of this legislation because ANWR will create \nthousands of jobs to the members of America's union organizations. It \nis signed by the International Union of Operating Engineers, AFL-CIO; \nthe Seafarers International Union, AFL-CIO; the International \nBrotherhood of Teamsters, Change to Win Federation; the United \nAssociation of Plumbers & Pipefitters, AFL-CIO; Laborers' International \nUnion of North America, AFL-CIO; United Brotherhood of Carpenters and \nJoiners of America, Change to Win Federation; and the Building & \nConstruction Trades Department, AFL-CIO.\n  It specifically includes a letter from John Engler, who is the head \nof the Nation's largest industrial trade association representing large \nand small manufacturers in every industrial sector. It specifically \nsays:\n\n       We simply cannot afford to pass up this opportunity. The \n     NAM will consider as possible Key Manufacturing Votes in the \n     109th Congress NAM voting record all votes--including points \n     of order, cloture and/or other procedure votes--\n\non this bill.\n  The Naval Reserve Association has written to me indicating that they, \ntoo, would like to have this spending bill to provide assistance for \nGuard and Reserve members passed as soon as possible.\n  The American Legion, as I said, has indicated their support for this \nbill.\n  Ducks Unlimited has sent out a release that indicates that $1 billion \nfor conservation funding will be dedicated to voluntary, private, \nlandowner-friendly programs administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService, and they ask for the immediate approval of this bill. They \nsent a similar release to the House of Representatives expressing their \noverwhelming support for this bill. I think this is one of the great \norganizations of the United States with over a million supporters that \nought to be listened to.\n  The Edison Electronic Institute also supports this bill. They state:\n\n       [This] conference report that was approved in the House \n     earlier this week provides a total of $2.5 billion in base \n     funding and $1.7 billion in emergency assistance funding for \n     a total of $4.2 billion for the LIHEAP . . . double the \n     highest funding level ever achieved--\n\nfor this program, and it is due to the ever-increasing cost of energy. \nThis assistance is necessary. Particularly, this assistance is \nnecessary for the States and local governments affected by Hurricanes \nKatrina, Rita, and Wilma.\n  There is also a letter from the Campaign for Home Energy Assistance. \nThis is really a copy of their release. It says:\n\n       The Defense appropriations bill appears to be our best and \n     possibly last opportunity for an increase for this vital \n     program.\n\n  They have issued a call to action.\n\n       The Campaign for Home Energy Assistance urges you to call \n     your Senators today and ask them to vote for this Defense \n     appropriations bill. . . .\n\n  The National Defense Council likewise has written to us urging that \nafter decades of debate concerning energy resource issues, this bill be \npassed. They have a fairly long statement on their position. \nUnquestionably, this is very important support for the bill from the \nNational Defense Council Foundation.\n\n[[Page S14126]]\n\n  The Reserve Officers Association of America issued a call to action \nasking for support for this bill, for passage of this conference \nreport. I urge Members to consider their support.\n  I have a letter from the American Gas Association written to us, sent \nout as a release urging support of this legislation to finally approve \nthe provisions that have been passed not only by the House but by the \nSenate in this calendar year.\n  There is almost an unlimited number of letters that have been coming \ninto our office urging support. As I indicated in my opening comments, \nthe Air Transport Association sent a letter also. They sent a copy of \nthat letter to me urging that the enactment of this bill be swift. I \nthink it is very interesting that the Air Transport Association, \nrepresenting the U.S. airline industry which has taken such a hard hit \non the increase in gas prices, should show overwhelming support for \nthis bill.\n  I have sent every Member a letter outlining what is coming with \nregard to the rule XXVIII point of order. I wish to put that letter in \nthe Record so there is no mistake about what I have told the Members \nconcerning our position on this potential rule XXVIII point of order.\n  My chief of staff points out to me the items in Congressman Jerry \nLewis's release. As I understand, it is not proper under the rules to \nannounce the vote in the House; therefore, I will not disclose it. I am \nsure it is proper to say the House overwhelmingly passed this bill. It \nurges a vote now on the conference report and wants this conference \nreport to be passed. It does not want to be forced to rely on a \ncontinuing resolution to support the Department of Defense.\n  Mr. President, I have tried to outline some of these items. I will be \nbringing more before the Senate as they are received.\n  I again repeat my request that the letters I read be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Veterans of Foreign Wars\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                                December 20, 2005.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Defense,\n     Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stevens: On behalf of the men and women of the \n     Veterans of Foreign Wars of the U.S., I would like to offer \n     our strong support for the Conference Agreement for the \n     Defense Appropriations Bill. The bill honors this Nation's \n     commitment to taking care of those in uniform, and greatly \n     improves the quality of life for our Nation's fighting \n     forces. We urge passage of this bill, and the pay and \n     benefits it bestows on our service members.\n       The bill includes a 3.1% across-the-board pay increase and \n     helps to eliminate the out-of-pocket housing expense for \n     military personnel. It also provides increased funding for \n     body armor, personal protection equipment, as well as \n     increased armor for vehicles--all which greatly improve the \n     personal safety of those fighting in this Nation's vital yet \n     dangerous war on terrorism.\n       This important legislation lets our brave men and women \n     know that this Nation will be there for them, giving them \n     every advantage they need to win the war and suffer as few \n     casualties as possible. These brave men and women have our \n     strong, undivided and unwavering support. It is for this \n     reason that we thank you for your efforts in shepherding the \n     legislation to this point, and we urge the entire Senate to \n     quickly approve this bill for the good of all who serve.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Robert E. Wallace,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    Competitive Enterprise Institute\n\n\n                          vote yes on anwr now\n\n       As gas prices remain above two dollars a gallon and most \n     Americans are looking at sky-high heating bills this winter, \n     the Competitive Enterprise Institute urges the U.S. Senate to \n     pass legislation that would open a small portion of the \n     Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska to oil and \n     gas exploration.\n       ``The ANWR provision in the defense appropriations bill is \n     the only legislation currently before the Senate that would \n     address America's long-term energy needs. Authorization for \n     opening ANWR has already passed both the House and the Senate \n     this year,'' said Myron Ebell, Director of Global Warming & \n     International Environmental Policy at CEI.\n       ``Senate Majority Leader Frist should keep the Senate in \n     session as long as it takes to gain cloture on the defense \n     appropriations bill and enact the ANWR provision,'' Ebell \n     continued. ``If Senator Frist is unwilling to disrupt \n     Senators'' holiday plans, then President Bush should use his \n     constitutional authority to call them back into session.''\n       ``The American people are looking for long-term policies \n     that will increase our energy supplies and make energy more \n     affordable,'' said Ebell. ``The Senate should stop listening \n     to an obstructionist minority who think that energy prices \n     are not high enough and vote to open ANWR now.''\n       ``Environmental groups have spread misinformation about \n     ANWR for years. Their latest soundbite is to claim that this \n     is a payoff to big oil companies. That is the exact opposite \n     of the truth. Any oil produced will be subject to a 12\\1/2\\% \n     royalty paid to the federal Treasury and the State of \n     Alaska,'' Ebell continued. ``Compare those royalty payments \n     to the vast array of federal subsidies paid by tax dollars \n     for alternative energy sources favored by the environmental \n     movement.''\n       The legislation already passed by the House will limit oil \n     and gas drilling to disturbing 2000 acres in the 1.5 million \n     acre Coastal Plain, which is not a Wilderness Area. No \n     drilling will be permitted in the vast areas of the 19 \n     million acre refuge that have been designated as Wilderness \n     Areas. According to estimates by the U.S. Geological Survey, \n     the amount of economically recoverable oil in ANWR will \n     increase America's proven reserves by approximately fifty \n     percent, which is equivalent to thirty years of current \n     imports from Saudi Arabia, one of the nation's biggest \n     foreign suppliers.\n       There is strong support among Alaskans for opening ANWR. \n     Polls consistently show three quarters of Alaskans in \n     support. The Inuit village of Kaktovik, in Alaska's Coastal \n     Plain, also officially supports oil and gas exploration. \n     ``Alaskans put a high value on protecting the natural \n     splendors of their State, and they support opening the \n     Coastal Plain because they know that the advanced technology \n     now being used to produce oil will not harm the caribou herds \n     or damage the environment. Oil has been pumped at Prudhoe Bay \n     west of ANWR for three decades using 1970s technology and the \n     caribou herd there has increased from 6,000 to 32,000,'' said \n     CEI Adjunct Scholar R.J.

Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       We applaud you for including a measure in the Department of \n     Defense Appropriations Act of 2006 to fund state and local \n     government efforts to prepare for natural disaster and/or \n     terrorist attacks. The measure provides $1 billion to the \n     Department of Homeland Security's Office for Domestic \n     Preparedness to make grants to state and local governments \n     for interoperable communications equipment. The measure also \n     provides an additional $1 billion for state and local \n     government preparedness grants that can be used for training, \n     evacuation plans, and the acquisition of equipment and \n     medical supplies.\n       State and local governments desperately need additional \n     funding to improve their radio communications equipment and \n     to plan, train and prepare for natural disasters and \n     terrorist attacks. Public safety fully supports these \n     measures.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n          memo: unions supporting responsible anwr development\n\n                                                December 17, 2005.\n       Within the next few days, you will be asked to vote on \n     legislation making appropriations for the Department of \n     Defense and other vital government programs. One of these \n     important policies is the authority to develop vast oil \n     resources in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, popularly \n     known as ANWR. This is a jobs issue for our unions and our \n     members.\n       On December 7, 2005 the Congressional Budget Office wrote \n     Senator Ted Stevens and responded to the Senator's inquiry \n     that ANWR bonus bid receipts ``might total at least $10 \n     billion--roughly double CBO's official estimate.'' That means \n     it also increases the Federal revenue to a total of $5 \n     billion, as the state of Alaska and the Federal Government \n     will share bonus bid receipts on a 50/50 basis. In the \n     Defense appropriations legislation, the conferees have \n     dedicated a significant portion of those additional revenues \n     for funding future Federal disaster relief programs. As we \n     understand it, these sums will also be used as collateral for \n     immediate relief for damage caused in the Katrina, Rita and \n     Wilma disaster areas.\n       We also see all of this as an affirmation of the \n     progressive jobs policies generated by ANWR production.\n       Again, we urge you to support this legislation, because \n     ANWR will create thousands of jobs for our members for many \n     years. The bill assures ANWR work is protected by a project \n     labor agreement. You will hear strident calls from opponents \n     who claim opening\n\n[[Page S14127]]\n\n     ANWR will degrade the environment. We have heard their \n     arguments, discussed them and made reasonable adjustments. \n     They remain unyielding. Their baseless slogans can no longer \n     be used as impediments to creating jobs or frustrating \n     reasonable energy development.\n       When the question is called on the Defense Appropriations \n     bill, it will be framed as one of process--to invoke cloture \n     on the bill.\n       For us, process is policy.\n       The choice is clear. We can either continue to be hamstrung \n     by the exaggerations of obstructionists, or be guided by \n     policies that create jobs and assure a secure energy future.\n       Please support the Conference Report and oppose procedural \n     devices that would delay this important legislation.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n       International Union of Operating Engineers, AFL-CIO.\n       Seafarers International Union, AFL-CIO.\n       International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Change to Win \n     Federation.\n       United Association of Plumbers & Pipefitters, AFL-CIO.\n       Laborers' International Union of North America, AFL-CIO.\n       United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, \n     Change to Win Federation.\n       Building & Construction Trades Department, AFL-CIO.\n\n             Keep ANWR Provisions in Defense Spending Bill\n\n                                                December 19, 2005.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the National Association of \n     Manufacturers (NAM), I urge you to support final passage of \n     the conference report to H.R. 2963, the Defense \n     appropriations bill, and oppose all efforts to remove \n     provisions related to oil and natural gas development in \n     ANWR. Our Nation's economic and national security depend, in \n     part, on adequate, affordable, and reliable energy supplies. \n     U.S. manufacturing--which uses one-third of our nation's \n     energy--is facing the most severe energy price spikes in \n     history due in large part to government policy decisions and \n     a fundamental imbalance in our domestic energy supply. This \n     is serious enough to have the potential to cause an economic \n     downturn and the loss of thousands of high-paying \n     manufacturing jobs.\n       Opening such a small portion of ANWR would have a powerful \n     effect on our economy, creating thousands of new high-paying \n     jobs, preserving thousands of U.S. manufacturing jobs and \n     reducing our dependence on foreign energy sources. Estimates \n     from both the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Energy \n     Information Administration state that ANWR development would \n     generate 70 trillion cubic feet (TCF) of natural gas and \n     roughly 10 billion barrels of oil or 1 million barrels of oil \n     per day for 30 years.\n       We simply cannot afford to pass up this opportunity. The \n     NAM will consider as possible Key Manufacturing Votes in the \n     109th Congress NAM voting record all votes including points \n     of order, cloture and/or other procedural votes--that attempt \n     to weaken or delete provisions related to ANWR in the \n     conference report to H.R. 2863.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John Engler,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     Naval Reserve Association\n\n                                Alexandria, VA, December 20, 2005.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Defense Appropriations Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Daniel Inouye,\n     Defense Appropriations Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Stevens and Senator Inouye: I am writing you \n     on behalf of the members of the Naval Reserve Association, \n     members of the Navy Reserve, their families, and survivors. \n     I'm writing to express our strongest support for passage of \n     the FY 2006 Defense Appropriations Bill as soon as possible.\n       Members of the Guard and Reserve comprise over 45 percent \n     of all U.S. personnel in Afghanistan and Iraq. Since \n     September 11, 2001, our nation has deployed over 500,000 \n     Guard and Reserve members for operational missions all over \n     the world. Additionally, during any month, approximately 25 \n     percent of the Navy Reserve force is doing some type of \n     operational support to the fleet for operational mission \n     requirements. Our nation is using our Guard and Reserve Force \n     at increasing rates.\n       Unfortunately many of the Navy Reserve members have endured \n     a shrinking Naval Reserve Force over the last few years. \n     Nevertheless, our country owes it to those that serve to \n     provide them with the operational, training funds, and \n     benefits required to maintain them fully ready for our \n     national needs, including Guard and Reserve Equipment. We \n     urge you to fund Navy Reserve equipment in the same manner \n     that you fund other Reserve Components. This bill contains \n     critical funding for important issues for the Global War on \n     Terror, and our Naval Reserve members are fully engaged in \n     providing the support our nation needs at this time.\n       Today's guardsmen and reservists are professionals. They \n     are the best that we have had and they are answering the call \n     on a routine basis not envisioned during the Cold War. We \n     need to ensure that political rhetoric does not get in their \n     way in fighting the war on terrorism and providing homeland \n     security. Passing the FY 2006 Defense Spending Bill will \n     provide Guard and Reserve members an important tool to \n     bolster recruitment, retention, family morale and overall \n     readiness. We urge you to pass this bill as soon as possible. \n     I look forward to working together in support of a strong and \n     viable Navy Reserve, Naval Reserve equipment, and all reserve \n     components. Thank you for all your hard work on their behalf.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                   Casey W.

Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Defense, Committee on \n         Appropriations, U.S. Senate, 119 Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As you and your colleagues debate final \n     passage of the Department of Defense (DoD) appropriations \n     bill for FY 2006, The American Legion continues its steadfast \n     commitment to assure a strong national defense as well as the \n     fulfillment of promises made to America's veterans on behalf \n     of a grateful Nation.\n       The American Legion has reviewed the Conference Report and \n     supports its enactment. As a nation at war, it is imperative \n     that the men and women of the armed forces know defense \n     spending is indeed a national priority. This funding measure \n     provides $453.3 billion to meet the fundamental needs of DoD \n     its military components and several domestic needs outside \n     the scope of national defense, such as disaster recovery \n     efforts and avian flu protection.\n       The American Legion continues to support the further \n     development of domestic sources of energy to include \n     increasing petroleum exploration and production in an \n     environmentally sensible manner so as to reduce America's \n     reliance on foreign petroleum. The nation's continued \n     reliance on foreign sources of energy places its national \n     security and economic well-being at risk during times of \n     crisis. The War on Terrorism and the continuing conflict in \n     the volatile Middle East has brought into sharp focus the \n     nation's heavy reliance on imported foreign oil that \n     necessitates a re-evaluation of current and long-range energy \n     policies.\n       Thank you for your continued leadership and support of \n     America' s service members, veterans, and their families.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        Steve Robertson, Director,\n     National Legislative Commission.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              Ducks Unlimited,\n\n                                                      Memphis, TN.\n\n     $1 Billion in Conservation Funding Approved by U.S. House of \n     Representatives Funding Bill Awaits a Vote in the U.S. Senate\n\n       Washington, DC, Dec. 19, 2005.--The U.S. House of \n     Representatives overwhelmingly approved $1 billion for \n     conservation programs in the Defense Appropriations bill \n     today. A number of conservation provisions were added to the \n     bill. Ducks Unlimited (DU) worked with Congressional leaders \n     to include funding for several critical programs that benefit \n     waterfowl, other wildlife and people. A vote on the bill by \n     the U.S. Senate is expected soon.\n       The $1 billion in conservation funding would be dedicated \n     to voluntary, private landowner friendly programs \n     administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the \n     U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The increased funding \n     for these programs is important for America's farmers, \n     ranchers, sportsmen and for waterfowl, wetlands and the \n     environment.\n       ``Congress is right to recognize the value and importance \n     of results-oriented and cost effective conservation \n     programs,'' said DU's Director of Governmental Affairs Scott \n     Sutherland. ``This funding will help farmers and other \n     private landowners conserve wildlife habitat and improve \n     water quality and quantity while providing aesthetic, \n     recreational and other economic benefits to their local \n     communities.''\n       Key agricultural conservation programs such as the \n     Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and Wetlands Reserve \n     Program (WRP) will share $900 million. CRP is credited with \n     increasing waterfowl populations by 46 percent. It plays a \n     critical role in landscape level conservation of soil, water \n     and wildlife on marginal farmland while offering producers a \n     significant and stable source of income.\n       WRP is the most successful USDA program for wetlands \n     conservation, providing a way for farmers and ranchers to \n     transition marginally productive or flood-prone lands into \n     more appropriate uses. WRP lands provide wintering habitat in \n     the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley for more than 5 million \n     ducks and geese annually.\n       The Grassland Reserve Program, Environmental Quality \n     Incentives Program and Conservation Security Program will \n     also receive a share of the $900 million.\n       The bill includes $50 million for the North American \n     Wetlands Conservation Act (NAWCA). NAWCA fosters public-\n     private partnerships to restore, conserve and protect \n     wetlands associated habitats for waterfowl and other \n     migratory birds. Another $50 million would go toward wetland \n     and grassland protection programs administered by the U.S. \n     Fish and Wildlife Service.\n       Among many other provisions included in the legislation are \n     separate requirements that would provide heating assistance \n     to low income Americans and allow exploratory oil drilling in \n     a portion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n\n[[Page S14128]]\n\n       With more than a million supporters, Ducks Unlimited is the \n     world's largest and most effective wetland and waterfowl \n     conservation organization. The United States alone has lost \n     more than half of its original wetlands--nature's most \n     productive ecosystem--and continues to lose more than 100,000 \n     wetland acres each year.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Edison Electric Institute,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 20, 2005.\n       To Members of the United States Senate: On behalf of the \n     Edison Electric Institute (EEI), the association of United \n     States sbareholder-owned electric companies, international \n     affiliates, and industry associates worldwide, I urge you to \n     support the FY06 Defense Appropriations bill, which includes \n     several provisions that are of critical importance to our \n     members and their customers.\n       Our U.S. members serve 97 percent of the ultimate customers \n     in the shareholder owned segment of the industry, and 71 \n     percent of all electric utility ultimate customers in the \n     nation. They generate almost 60 percent of the electricity \n     produced by U.S. electric generators. Our member companies \n     are working closely with the states to help those who need \n     assistance with their energy bills this winter; however, even \n     with unprecedented private/public partnerships around the \n     country, the federally funded LIHEAP Program has been \n     inundated with requests for assistance. State energy \n     assistance directors are reporting that their funds for this \n     vital but under-funded program are likely to run out in \n     February. At a time when applications for assistance have \n     increased up to 40 percent in many states, thousands of \n     elderly, fixed income and working-poor families with small \n     children will be turned away, receiving no assistance at all.\n       The FY06 Defense Appropriations Conference report that was \n     approved in the House earlier this week provides a total of \n     $2.5 billion in base funding, and $ 1.7 billion in emergency \n     assistance funding for a total $4.2 billion for LIHEAP in \n     FY06--double the highest funding level ever achieved. \n     Importantly, base funding for the program is above the $1.975 \n     billion trigger for the first time since 1986 (at $2.5 \n     billion), which provides funding for both heating and cooling \n     assistance in the months ahead. Furthermore, the ANWR \n     provision provides a mechanism for LIHEAP funding in the \n     future.\n       In addition, the FY06 Defense Appropriations bill creates a \n     Gulf Coast Recovery Fund which dedicates 80% of initial bonus \n     bids (lease sales) and rentals to the Fund for states and \n     local governments affected by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and \n     Wilma. The bill also dedicates 20% royalties to the Fund \n     states and local governments affected by Hurricanes Katrina, \n     Rita and Wilma beginning in FY15. This funding will be \n     critical to the rebuilding and future prosperity of the \n     cities and states that were decimated by these storms last \n     summer.\n       Given the critical need for LIHEAP funding and hurricane \n     recovery assistance in the months ahead, the Edison Electric \n     Institute considers this to be a key vote in the United \n     States Senate. We urge you to support all efforts to pass \n     legislation that will provide an unprecedented level of aid \n     and support to those most in need in our country.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Thomas R. Kuhn,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n       To Members and Supporters of the Campaign for Home Energy \n     Assistance: The Senate is expected to vote early tomorrow \n     (Wednesday) morning on the Defense appropriations bill, which \n     includes a provision that would increase funding for the Low \n     Income Home Energy Assistance Program by $2 billion for \n     Fiscal Year 2006.\n       The most recent short-term forecast from the Energy \n     Information Administration states that heating costs are \n     likely to be 7 to 38 percent higher this winter: a 38 percent \n     increase for natural gas, 21 percent for heating oil, 15 \n     percent for propane and 7 percent for electricity. It is \n     urgent, therefore, for Congress to provide additional funding \n     for LIHEAP.\n       The Defense appropriations bill appears to be our best and \n     possibly last opportunity to provide an increase for this \n     vital program. The measure would add $500 million to the \n     LIHEAP state block grant program and provide $1.5 billion in \n     contingency funds. When combined with the LIHEAP allocations \n     provided in the Labor/Health & Human Services/Education \n     appropriations bill ($2 billion for the block grant program \n     and $183 million in contingency funds), the program would be \n     funded at its highest total ever: $4.141 billion.\n       URGENT! Call to Action: The Campaign for Home Energy \n     Assistance urges you to call your senators today and ask them \n     to vote for the Defense appropriations bill when it is \n     considered tomorrow morning.\n\n                                                    David Fox,\n\n                                               Executive Director,\n     Campaign for Home Energy Assistance.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                December 20, 2005.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stevens: I am writing you concerning the \n     importance of developing the oil resources of Alaska's Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge for national defense.\n       As you may be aware, our organization has been actively \n     involved in issues related to energy security and national \n     defense for more than two decades. We have conducted more \n     than 120 studies on this subject, including a substantial \n     number specifically concerned with Alaskan natural resources. \n     I should also note that our work has enjoyed broad bi-\n     partisan support, and has been cited by private groups as \n     diverse as the Energy and Environmental Study Institute, the \n     Clean Fuels Vehicles Coalition and the Institute for the \n     Analysis of Global Security; and by government institutions \n     including the United States Department of Energy and House \n     Resources Committee.\n       After more than three decades of considering energy \n     security issues and almost a quarter century of studying the \n     role of Alaskan oil, we find that we can come to only one \n     conclusion:\n       The development of ANWR is a vital national defense \n     priority. There are a number of reasons why this is the case.\n       First, energy, and specifically energy from petroleum is \n     among the most critical defense commodities.\n       At the time of Operation Desert Storm, the first Persian \n     Gulf War, a U.S. Army Heavy Division, comprised of 17,500 \n     soldiers, used as much oil as four World War II Field Armies \n     which would have comprised over 400,000 troops. To illustrate \n     this point further, the 528,000 U.S. troops that participated \n     in Operation Desert Storm used more than four times as much \n     oil on a daily basis as the entire 2-million man Allied \n     Expeditionary Force that liberated Europe during World War \n     II.\n       But even these stunning comparisons do not tell the full \n     story.\n       The petroleum requirement per deployed soldier has \n     increased by roughly 20% between Operation Desert Storm, the \n     first Persian Gulf War and Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n       Moreover, as the process of ``Defense Transformation'' \n     proceeds and a greater emphasis is placed on fuel-intensive \n     units such as the Stryker Brigade Combat Teams, the fuel per \n     deployed soldier required for military operations will \n     increase even more.\n       Second, our access to petroleum on the world market will \n     become increasingly constrained. The competition for oil on \n     the world market has greatly intensified over the past decade \n     and in the future will become even more intense.\n       According to the IMF the Chinese economy has been growing \n     at an average of 9% since 1978, and has exceeded 13% in some \n     years. Most recently China's economic growth has averaged \n     between 9% and 10%, fueled in large part by a massive program \n     of industrial modernization. Included among its stated \n     economic goals is the addition of some 120 million \n     automobiles to its domestic fleet over the next decade. This \n     change alone will increase China's oil import requirements by \n     more than 9 million barrels per day. India, too, has \n     experienced extremely high growth rates, as have some of the \n     newly independent states that formerly comprised the Soviet \n     Union. What all of this means is that global demand for oil \n     is going to rise sharply at a time when the addition of new \n     global supplies simply cannot keep pace.\n       We cannot, therefore, be sure that we will enjoy access to \n     foreign oil supplies to provide essential petroleum in time \n     of conflict.\n       A third factor is the insecurity of foreign sources of oil.\n       Even if the amount of oil available on the world market \n     were sufficient to meet our needs, there is no guarantee that \n     it would be available for our use. Of the top ten sources of \n     U.S. oil imports, at least four are of questionable security. \n     Venezuela, our third ranking supplier, provides 11.1% of U.S. \n     oil imports, constituting 6.7% of total supply. It is ruled \n     by an individual who is openly hostile to the United States \n     and who has threatened to cut off oil exports to the U.S. \n     Saudi Arabia, our second largest source of imports, \n     contributing 6.8% of total supplies and a little more than \n     11.1% of imports, has had its oil infrastructure targeted in \n     a recent fatwa from al-Qaeda. Nigeria, which provides 8.6% of \n     imports and accounts for 5.2% of domestic oil supplies, is \n     fraught with civil unrest and banditry. It loses 135,000 b/d \n     of crude oil to theft. Iraq, which accounts for 3.7% of our \n     imports and 2.3% of domestic supplies, has an ongoing \n     insurgency that has attacked oil pipelines more than 100 \n     times in the past year and is also targeted in the al-Qaeda \n     fatwa.\n       Moreover. even relatively secure suppliers such as Canada \n     and Mexico are being approached by China with investment \n     proposals that might earmark segments of their production for \n     exclusive Chinese use.\n       Fourth, even domestic sources may be vulnerable to \n     disruption.\n       The recent experience with hurricanes Katrina and Rita \n     underscored the vulnerability of domestic production in the \n     Gulf of Mexico. We are entering a long-term weather pattern \n     that will be characterized by increased hurricane activity. \n     Therefore, the potential for disruption of Gulf of Mexico \n     production, as occurred this fall, is substantial.\n       When all of the factors are taken into account, it becomes \n     evident that the development of ANWR's oil and gas resources \n     is an urgent defense priority. Failure to do so can only \n     serve to undermine the ability of America's armed forces to \n     operate.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Milton R.

Increasing our access to \n     domestic energy supplies is critical to enhancing America's \n     energy security, sustaining America's economy and providing \n     the American consumer with relief from ever spiraling energy \n     costs.\n       AGA speaks on this matter not only as the representative of \n     natural gas utility companies, but also as a voice for their \n     customers who have been hit so hard financially because of \n     higher natural gas prices. Whether it's a homeowner \n     struggling to pay the heating bill, a small business facing \n     significantly increased energy-related business costs or an \n     industry being forced to move overseas in order to compete in \n     the global marketplace, soaring energy prices have been a \n     severe detriment to America's quality of life.\n       Thanks to new technological developments energy can now be \n     produced without undue harm to the surrounding environment. \n     Hopefully, this vote will be the beginning of a trend that \n     recognizes America's energy needs can be met with adequate \n     environmental protections.\n       Again, we urge you to support passage of legislation \n     containing the provisions to finally open ANWR.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   David N. Parker\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Air Transport Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 9, 2005.\n       Dear: Airlines are one of the primary and most significant \n     purchasers of refined crude oil. We anticipate that U.S. \n     airlines alone will consume approximately 19 billion gallons \n     of fuel in their worldwide operations this year. Maintaining \n     existing oil production and developing new resources to \n     supply our nation's increasing need for refined product is \n     indispensable to the economic health of the U.S. airline \n     industry and our ability to provide the frequency and \n     reliability of air service that passengers and shippers \n     demand.\n       The airline industry has taken extraordinary conservation \n     measures since the early 1970s and has improved fuel \n     efficiency three-fold. In addition to the introduction of \n     more fuel-efficient aircraft, the industry has initiated a \n     number of new operational practices to conserve fuel and has \n     gone as far as considering how much additional weight \n     magazines and silverware add to an aircraft.\n       The intensity and pace of these measures have further \n     accelerated during the recent run-up in oil prices. \n     Nevertheless, conservation and efficiency efforts in such a \n     fuel-intensive industry as ours have their limitations. New \n     sources of petroleum must be found.\n       The Air Transport Association of America, Inc., strongly \n     supports the enactment of a federal energy policy that allows \n     for greater access to domestic sources of oil for \n     environmentally responsible production, particularly within \n     ``Area 1002'' of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). \n     Area 1002 was recognized in 1980 by Congress and President \n     Carter as a potentially significant oil and natural gas \n     reserve, and was distinguished by law from the rest of the \n     refuge as a site for possible future energy production.\n       The Air Transport Association believes that the time has \n     come to open Area 1002 to environmentally responsible energy \n     production, and we ask for your full support of legislation \n     to accomplish this goal. While not a magic fix to the problem \n     of high oil prices that have added billions of dollars of \n     unbearable costs to an already ailing airline industry, \n     opening Area 1002 is an important component in a \n     comprehensive national energy policy that utilizes not only \n     efficiency and conservation, but also the strength of our \n     precious domestic resources.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this important matter \n     and please feel free to call on me with any questions or \n     concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     James C. May,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 19, 2005.\n       Dear Member: A Rule 28 point of order against the Defense \n     Appropriations Conference Report may be raised. I ask you to \n     think very carefully about your position on this issue \n     because vital funding and programs are at stake in this \n     decision.\n       A Rule 28 point of order will apply to all provisions in \n     the bill that are beyond the authority of the conferees. \n     These provisions include:\n       The Hurricane Supplemental, which contains $29 billion for \n     hurricane victims. Included in this supplemental is funding \n     for education expenses, housing, and reconstruction efforts \n     in the disaster areas.\n       The Gulf Coast Recovery Fund provides short and long-term \n     disaster relief funding for Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, \n     Texas, and Florida.\n       Avian Flu Liability language included with funding that \n     will encourage the vaccine industry to return to the United \n     States, so that we may be able to create Avian Flu vaccines \n     here at home.\n       The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is \n     funded on an emergency basis in FY06 with $2 billion for home \n     heating assistance.\n       $3.1 billion is included in the bill for homeland security. \n     Included is funding for Interoperable Communications \n     Equipment Grants to state and local governments, which will \n     help first responders communicate in the event of a natural \n     disaster or terrorist attack.\n       Emergency Preparedness Grants to state and local \n     governments. All states are assured a certain level of \n     funding. Funds will be allocated based on threat and risk \n     levels.\n       Funds for increased border security, helicopter \n     replacement, and security infrastructure, which is funded on \n     an emergency basis.\n\n[[Page S14130]]\n\n       An additional $1 billion for farm bill conservation \n     programs, which will help farmers and ranchers meet current \n     challenges and ensure the productivity of their land for \n     future generations.\n       If a Rule 28 point of order is sustained, the entire \n     Defense Appropriations Conference Report will fall. Rule 28 \n     does not allow us to strike specific provisions from a \n     conference report; it kills the conference report altogether. \n     Since the House has voted, it will be necessary to appoint \n     new conferees in the House and the Senate, and we will have \n     to start over.\n       Some Members have suggested that we could simply return to \n     conference with the House, strip the provision regarding \n     development on the Arctic Coastal Plain, and pass the bill \n     with the provisions listed above. This is simply not \n     possible. A portion of the funding for these initiatives and \n     programs comes from the revenue ANWR will provide.\n       We tried to pass bills that funded these priorities, but we \n     could not find an agreement to do so on an emergency basis. \n     These provisions were included in this bill because we were \n     able to generate additional federal revenues, including \n     revenue generated by development on the Arctic Coastal Plain, \n     which will provide the funds we need and repay emergency \n     spending. If a Rule 28 point of order is sustained, forcing \n     us to begin a new conference, many of the items listed above \n     will need to be stripped from the bill as well. We cannot pay \n     for them without the additional revenue ANWR will provide.\n       With best wishes,\n           Cordially,\n     Ted Stevens.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Appropriations Chairman Jerry Lewis Urges Senate passage of Defense \n                             Spending Bill\n\n       Washington.--The Hurricane Katrina recovery, increased \n     funding for low-income heating needs, protection against \n     avian flu and many other programs that were added to the \n     Defense Appropriations Bill are at risk if the Senate does \n     not approve the package this week, House Appropriations \n     Chairman Jerry Lewis said Tuesday.\n       ``If the Senate will not approve this bill, we will be \n     forced to rely on a continuing resolution to fund the \n     Department of Defense, which will mean all of the additional \n     spending the House approved last week will be lost,'' Lewis \n     said. ``Continuing resolutions will fund the government, but \n     only at last year's level and with none of these programs \n     that are so urgently needed.''\n       ``Clearly, the Senate does not want to do that, and I'm \n     sure they don't want to jeopardize the funding for our troops \n     during time of war,'' Lewis said. ``It is time to stop the \n     partisan debates and approve the final two appropriations \n     bills.''\n       The House last week passed the Defense Appropriations bill \n     for Fiscal Year 2006 by a resounding 308-106 vote, with 106 \n     Democrats supporting the bill and only 89 opposed, Lewis \n     noted. It is strongly supported by President Bush, and \n     contains many new Pentagon spending levels that would not be \n     funded under a continuing resolution.\n       ``This was not even close to being a party-line vote in the \n     House, which should be a message to the Senate that it is \n     time to finish our work and put funding in place for the new \n     fiscal year,'' Lewis said. ``It is irresponsible for a \n     minority of Senators to impede the will of the President, the \n     House and the American people and put all of these urgently \n     needed programs at risk.''\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I don't know how many more times I will \nbe before the Senate before this matter comes up tomorrow. I do hope it \nwill come to the floor early tomorrow because we need time to consider \nthe points of order that will lie against the conference report.\n  To me, approval of the conference report really means we are putting \naside the debate that might take place on the individual items that may \nbe raised here. The conference report is not subject to amendment, but \nit is possible to have almost unending delay on the points of order. \nThey are debatable and, therefore, the reason for the cloture motion is \nprimarily to reduce debate on these various points of order we will \nhave and find some way to assure there will be an early passage of the \nconference report.\n  This is a conference report providing enormous assistance to the \nDepartment of Defense, particularly the $50 billion in emergency \nfunding that is primarily required to support those who are in our \nuniform defending the Nation in terms of their activities in the war on \nterror. I urge the Senate to vote cloture to limit that debate. We will \nhave the points of order. We will have the points of order under the \nBudget Act under rule XXVIII, but there is no reason to have unlimited \ndebate on those points or order.\n  The cloture motion is for the best interest of the Department of \nDefense to get this bill to the Department of Defense as quickly as \npossible. If those points of order are sustained, obviously, we will \nhave to go back to conference, have a new conference, and we will have \nto appoint new conferees. The House is spread all over the country. How \nquickly we can do that, I don't know.\n  I do believe that it is in the best interest of the Nation to adopt \nthis conference report. It does not contain items, as far as this \nsubject, ANWR, is concerned, that have not passed before. We have \napproved ANWR before in this Reconciliation Act, and the House has \npassed the act before. We have added provisions I described dealing \nwith the funding that will come in from ANWR. But otherwise it was \nconsidered before and passed by the House of Representatives \npreviously.\n  I don't know how much more time I have. Has my time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I don't know who is to \ncome next. I don't want to charge any time to the pending measure. That \nwas the understanding. So I will just let the time run for a minute.\n  I will again remind the Senate that the money that is in the bill \nthat is before us, the conference report that is before us, that its \nemergency funding will not survive another conference. It will only \nsurvive this conference because the money that was predicted to be \navailable from income from the sale of oil and gas leases in ANWR--and \nthe OMB did increase its estimate from $2.5 billion to $5 billion. \nHowever, they did not increase that for budget purposes. They confirmed \nthe fact that it would come in. So we have allocated that money under \nthis bill, particularly to LIHEAP, to low-income housing assistance. \nThat cannot survive another conference if ANWR is deleted.\n  So for those people who want that money, and it has been pointed out \nthat is an enormous increase due to the situation that exists because \nof the fantastic increase in home heating costs, it does not have to be \nspent. It is there in reserve to be spent. We do not mandate that they \nspend that money. We make it available to them on an emergency basis if \nit is necessary, and it may well be necessary through the balance of \nthis winter.\n  So I do urge the Members of the Senate to vote for the conference \nreport, vote for cloture on the conference report, and help us prepare \nfor the points of order that may be raised after the cloture motion has \nbeen approved. I am getting tired, and I apologize.\n  Now is my time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Defense Appropriations\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, tomorrow we are going to have some \nsignificant votes in the Senate on issues of great importance, not the \nleast of which is the Defense appropriations bill, one of the most \nimportant bills we consider in the course of our calendar year. This is \nthe bill to provide the resources for our troops--literally, their pay, \nthe equipment they need, the training they need, new weapons they need, \nthe fundamentals we need to keep our Nation safe.\n  This has usually been a very bipartisan bill. Having served on the \nAppropriations Committee, I have seen it in the past with strong \nsupport from both sides of the aisle and rarely a real partisan issue. \nThis time, however, this bill has been modified and changed. Added to \nthis bill are provisions which have nothing to do with our Nation's \ndefense. They are provisions that have been debated at length for many \nyears in the Senate relative to controversial issues on many fronts. \nThe most controversial, the lead issue, the one that has been spoken to \ntime and again on the Senate floor over the last several days, is the \nauthorization for drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge. Some may remember that at the time of the invasion of Iraq, \nthen Republican House whip Tom DeLay gave a speech in which he said, \n``Nothing is more important in the face of a war than cutting taxes.'' \nThat is what\n\n[[Page S14131]]\n\nhe said. Tens of thousands of American troops were gathered in the \nKuwait desert waiting for the command to go to war, being warned they \nmight face weapons of mass destruction, and the then majority leader of \nthe House of Representatives Tom DeLay said, ``Nothing is more \nimportant in the face of a war than cutting taxes.''\n  Here we are a thousand days later still at war. We have lost over \n2,150 American soldiers, over 15,000 have been seriously wounded, and \n150,000-plus soldiers now risk their lives in Iraq today as we stand in \nthe safety of this Chamber and in this country.\n  As we consider this important bill to fund this war and to stand \nbehind our troops, it turns out we learned nothing is more important to \nsome Members of the Senate than to make sure that we take care of the \noil and gas companies before we take care of the troops. How else can \none explain it? How else can we have reached the point where the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge oil drilling is so critically important to \nAmerica that we would jeopardize the passage of the Department of \nDefense appropriations bill in order to pass it? This is the kind of \nthing that gives the Senate a bad name.\n  How many times have we heard people ask--I have heard it many times--\nwhy do you let this happen? Why would you let a bill be amended at the \nend to contain things which have nothing to do with it?\n  We have some 4,000 pages of bills before us today, almost 1,000 pages \nin this Defense appropriations bill. In it are critically important \nitems for our troops, but also in it is this permission to go into an \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge to drill for oil. Who wants this? Well, \nthere are two groups that certainly want it. First, the oil companies. \nThey are going to make money on this, as if they had not made enough. \nThis year, with their kiting of gasoline and energy prices across \nAmerica they have already had $100 billion in new profits. Well, here \nthey come again. They want more and more. Some believe their profit \nmargin is at least as important as providing the basic funds for our \ntroops. That is why they would put that amendment in this bill.\n\n  How can it have reached this point, where the Senate will have walked \naway from its basic obligation to our men and women in uniform and said \nwe are going to allow the use of an appropriations bill for this \ndrilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge? Well, the \npeople who crafted this brought in a number of Senators and Congressmen \nto support them by promising that some of the revenue from the drilling \nin Alaska would go to fund other programs and purposes. Relief for \nvictims of Hurricane Katrina was one of the things that was also being \npromised. There are many other elements that are being talked about--\nLIHEAP, the low-income home energy assistance program. It is promised \nthat they will have some money as a result of this. So many people have \ndecided they can look at this positively because there is something in \nit for them.\n  How important is this bill and this vote to the Bush administration? \nSo important that Vice President Cheney cut short his trip overseas to \nmake sure that he is here tomorrow, if necessary, to cast the deciding \nvote for the drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \nand the passage of this bill.\n  I think it tells us why it is important. Threatening to withhold \nfunding for American troops during wartime and for Katrina victims in \norder to push through ANWR drilling has to rank as one of the lowest \nmoments in the history of the Senate.\n  Let us put aside for a minute whether the ANWR language ought to be \nin this bill. Let us look at the language itself. This language has \nnever been examined or closely debated by any committee, neither the \nHouse nor the Senate. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the \nspecific ANWR language in this bill is different in several critical \nways from any other ANWR drilling proposal considered by Congress, and \none of the most important elements is the inclusion of a provision \nknown as severability. One would have to go searching long and hard, \nbut they will find on page 406 of the electronic version of this \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill this severability provision. \nHere is what it means: If the State of Alaska decides to sue to have \nthe 50/50 split of ANWR revenues called for in this bill declared \nillegal, then money this bill seems to promise for Katrina relief and \nlow-income heating energy assistance and many other worthy causes could \nsimply disappear.\n  It is a bait and switch. The proponents of this amendment lured \nsupporters by saying, come on along for the ride. We are going to drill \nin ANWR and we are going to give you some money. We will give it to the \nKatrina victims and we will also give it to the poor people in America \ntrying to heat their homes. So stick with us. Then they put in this \nprovision. The money that would have gone primarily for those purposes \ncould be removed almost entirely. How could it happen? It could happen \nby the State of Alaska asserting that instead of 50 percent, they want \n90 percent of the revenues that come out of this bill.\n  Think about that for a moment. The big oil companies make their \nprofits, the State of Alaska takes away virtually all the money, and \nall these other good causes find themselves with little or nothing to \nshow for it.\n  You see, the Alaska Statehood Act already provides that any revenue \nfrom Alaska oil sales must be split 90-10, 90 percent to Alaska and 10 \npercent to the Federal Government. And what did the lone Congressman \nfrom Alaska, Don Young, say today in the Anchorage Daily News?\n\n       As for the revenue split, Young said he thinks the Governor \n     (of Alaska) would sue to get the 90/10 split promised by the \n     Alaska Statehood Act.\n\n  So in order to get extra votes for this provision, the sponsors \noffered to others in Congress this lure of money from the drilling that \nthey can use for their purposes. It turns out, as soon as it is passed, \nwe have the State's Alaskan Congressman saying the Governor is going to \ntake away the money, virtually all of it.\n  In addition, Alaska State officials have made it clear that they \nintend to fight for 90 percent of the ANWR revenues. They passed a \nresolution signed by their Governor that said just that, they are not \ngoing to take anything less than 90 percent.\n  So the big winners from this ANWR provision in the bill will be the \noil companies and the State of Alaska. They are prepared to jeopardize \nthe passage of the Department of Defense appropriations bill because \nthere is so much money on the table, so much to be made from the \nrevenues from the drilling for this oil. Whoever drafted this language \nknew what they were doing by putting in this severability clause, which \nbasically says we can switch after we baited you into this trap, and \nyou can't do a darned thing about it. This could end up being one of \nthe biggest bait-and-switch deals in the history of the Senate.\n  There is another reason to be skeptical about Katrina relief in this \nbill and other promises that are being made around the Capitol. \nAccording to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, the \nrevenues this bill assumes from ANWR drilling are wildly inflated. For \nexample, this bill assumes lease bonus revenue from ANWR will total $10 \nbillion. For that amount of money to be raised, every single one of \nANWR's 1.5 million acres would have to produce an average of $6,666 in \nlease income. Since 1980, the average that has been produced is $60 an \nacre, less than one-hundredth of what has been promised.\n  Moreover, between 2001 and 2005, that average dropped to $45 per \nleased acre, despite record increases during that time in the price of \noil.\n  Now look at the estimated royalties. The bill says 20 percent of \nthese estimated royalties will be used to help Hurricane Katrina \nvictims. To generate the $40 billion ANWR supporters are promising for \nthe Katrina relief fund, oil prices would have to average $89 a barrel \nbetween 2015 and 2044. The U.S. Energy Information Administration's \nannual energy outlook projects a 1.3-percent annual increase in the \nprice of oil between now and 2025. They can never reach the numbers \nthat they are projecting to come up with this money.\n  The revenues in this bill supposedly promised for LIHEAP will also \nfall short for the same reasons.\n  The conclusion is this: For reasons I cannot explain, the Republican \nleadership in the Senate today has departed from the accepted practice \nof the Senate. There was a time when this bill\n\n[[Page S14132]]\n\nwas considered something special, a bill to appropriate money for our \nmen and women in uniform and for our Department of Defense. It was the \nfirst priority in appropriations, the first passed, and the first to be \nsigned by the President year after year after year. But this year, in \norder to accommodate the political agenda of some Members of the \nSenate, it is the last bill--second to the last bill that we will \nconsider. Why did we wait so long? So that this bill could be a vehicle \nfor a political agenda for the drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge.\n  To think that we would in any way jeopardize this bill for our men \nand women in uniform for this political deal at the close of the \nsession is just something that the Senate cannot be proud of.\n  I urge my colleagues, stand up for the men and women in uniform. But \nstand up for the integrity of the Senate. It is about time that we made \nit clear that this kind of political horse trading that goes on at the \nclose of the session, for an issue that has been debated for years on \nCapitol Hill, has to come to an end. This bill, the Department of \nDefense bill, should be a bill that is not the proving grounds or \ntesting grounds for great political ideas. Let's focus on the men and \nwomen in uniform.\n  I urge my colleagues to do two things. First, defeat cloture. Let the \nSenator from Alaska know that this is not appropriate on this bill.\n  Second, hold him to his word that once we defeat cloture, he will \nmove to strike this provision from the bill on ANWR, and we can move \nforward to funding our troops. The senior Senator from Alaska has said, \nboth in his State and on the Senate floor, that if he can't clear \nthis procedurally, that will be the end of the debate. We will then go \nto the Defense appropriations bill, as we should. Then let's pass this \nwith a strong bipartisan rollcall, having taken out this politically \nunacceptable provision on ANWR.\n\n  This is one of the biggest bait-and-switch deals we have seen on the \nfloor of the Senate. Back-room promises have brought this today to the \nSenate for a vote which we will face in the morning. Enough is enough. \nThe Senate should reject this. The Senate should demand that ANWR be \nvoted on the merits, and we should immediately pass a bill that does \nthe right thing not only for our troops but for the Katrina victims and \nalso to protect Americans from the threat of avian flu.\n  This Defense appropriations bill is a test. It is a test of whether \nthis Senate has lost its way entirely; whether one Senator from one \nState can dominate a major piece of legislation, can put in a provision \ntotally unrelated to our troops and their welfare, and can push a \nprovision which provides greater profits for oil companies and great \nrevenues for his home State of Alaska at the expense of taxpayers in \nthe United States and at the expense of a wildlife refuge created over \n50 years ago by President Eisenhower.\n  I urge my colleagues tomorrow, when we vote, vote against the motion \nfor cloture. Let this Senator know, and others who are pushing this \nproposal, that we have reached the end of our rope in terms of allowing \nthis kind of political back-room deal to come forward. It is \nunacceptable, and it should be rejected by the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, my understanding is I am now recognized \nfor 30 minutes; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks, \nSenator Kyl be recognized for up to 15 minutes, to be followed by \nSenator Bond for up to 15 minutes, Senator Feinstein for up to 20 \nminutes as in morning business, and that the time not be charged \nagainst the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. At that point, that a quorum call be entered and that the \nquorum call be evenly charged.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would add that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A quorum call cannot be requested now. It has \nto be requested at that time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. It is very important that we go back to this formulation, \nI say to the Chair. That when all of these speeches have been given, \nthere will be a request for a quorum call, and that quorum call will be \nequally charged.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator cannot lock in at this time a \nunanimous consent for a quorum call at a future time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is not what I am seeking to do. I am seeking to do \nwhat we have done repeatedly here. I don't understand why all of sudden \nthis is a difficult thing. We have done this repeatedly.\n  When the last speaker is concluded, that if they ask to go into a \nquorum call, the quorum call be equally charged. We have done this \nrepeatedly, and this is important to our understanding, so we have to \nget this right. We have done this repeatedly throughout the afternoon.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I believe my unanimous consent is pending, \nand it does include the request of the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is provided that any quorum call will be \ndivided equally.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to go back to the order, if \nwe can. I was about to speak for 30 minutes as was already agreed to by \nthe Senate. I would like to proceed.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I understand the Senator is recognized?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Does the Senator want me to yield for purposes of a \nparliamentary inquiry? I yield, without losing my right to the floor, \nfor a parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I was just curious about what the unanimous consent \nagreement was that was just entered. I was not on the floor at that \ntime and would be interested in having an opportunity to speak later. \nWas there unanimous consent on procedure?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am happy to tell the Senator. I asked \nfor time, on the completion of my 30 minutes, for Senator Kyl to speak \nfor up to 15 minutes, followed by Senator Bond for up to 15 minutes, \nfollowed by Senator Feinstein for up to 20 minutes as in morning \nbusiness, and that the time not be charged against the bill, and at \nthat time the time would be charged equally.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I have no objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I have no objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                              PATRIOT Act\n\n  Mr. President, folks are watching us so close to Christmas, so close \nto Hanukkah time and wondering why we are here so late in the year. It \nis very unusual for this to happen. I would like to say that we are \nhere, in my view, because there is a disinclination on the part of the \nRepublican leadership to sit down with the Democrats on the PATRIOT \nAct, fix two provisions of that act, fix it so our constituents don't \nhave to worry that their library records will be sought, if there is no \nreason to do that, or their bookstore records or their health records \nor their financial records without a check and balance on that power; \nand that if their home is searched they would be so advised within a 7-\nday period.\n  But Senator Frist, at this point, seems to keep this issue alive. I \nhope we can resolve that by a short-term extension of the act.\n  Every single Member who voted to stop the final vote voted with the \nunderstanding that we would, in fact, extend the PATRIOT Act for 3 \nmonths. I am hoping that will happen so we can get done with that \nwithout a vote, as far as I understand it. Everyone wants to continue \nthe PATRIOT Act, but there is a majority, I believe, who wants to fix \nthese two provisions out of the many provisions.\n  We are also here because one Senator has gotten drilling in the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge in the conference report on the \nmilitary bill, on the Defense appropriations bill. That bill funds our \ntroops. It is very important. Instead of allowing that to just go \nforward--and again that would go\n\n[[Page S14133]]\n\nforward probably without even a minute's debate, and we could finish \nthat up quickly--instead, this Senator wants to give a very special \ngift this Christmas season to the oil companies. We know, if anything, \nthey don't deserve a gift. They are laughing all the way to the bank. \nBut this one Senator wants to give them another gift, a really special \none with an enormous bow on top.\n  I hope that will happen. But that is another reason we are here.\n  We are here because this is a budget-cutting bill that is so \nonerous--it is on the floor right now--that the Republicans aren't even \nsure they have the votes to pass it because of what it does to student \nloans, to Medicare, to things that our people need. They have to fly \nthe Vice President back in order to have him in the Chair because it \nmight be that close. And he may have to cast the deciding vote to cut \nstudent loans, to cut Medicare, to cut Medicaid, to cut health to our \nmiddle-class families, as well as our working poor families. If that \nhappens, that will be an image all American families will see, the Vice \nPresident in the Chair. They couldn't even get their own party to vote \nfor this bill, and it will say more than I ever could on the subject.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I had hoped to be in California \nworking in the State. I had a very important speech to give on Iraq to \na very important group in Los Angeles. Instead I am going to give that \ntalk here for the next few minutes so that my constituents will get the \nviews that I have at this moment in time on that war.\n  In 1968, Martin Luther King told us:\n\n       If we do not act, we shall surely be dragged down the long, \n     dark and shameful corridors of time reserved for those who \n     possess . . . strength without sight.\n\n  Dr. King was talking about ending the Vietnam war. But 40 years later \nhis warning is increasingly relevant to the Iraq war.\n  Strength without sight has now led us into a war based on mistaken \nintelligence, and down a thorny path of pain for far too long. None of \nus can afford to be silent.\n  Again, I want to quote Martin Luther King who said:\n\n       Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about \n     things that matter.\n\n  Martin Luther King said:\n\n       Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about \n     things that matter.\n\n  We must have the courage to speak out about things that matter, and, \nif we disagree about things that matter, that is part of the process. \nBut let us heed Dr. King's words. It matters that 2,158 service men and \nwomen have given their lives in Iraq, leaving their families grieving. \nIt matters that 16,155 have been wounded, many with scars that will \nlast a lifetime.\n  It matters that the majority of the American people are demanding a \nnew strategy so that we do not have a war without an end.\n  We saw 79 Senators from both political parties recently back an \namendment saying that it is the Iraqis who should take the lead in \nproviding their own security next year. Next year is a few days away.\n  I think it matters if 79 Senators vote for that amendment.\n  I see Senator Levin on the Senate floor. I thank him for that work he \nput into that amendment because it says very clearly that next year the \nIraqis have to take charge of their own destiny.\n  We heard Congressman Jack Murtha's brave statement against this war, \ncalling it a ``flawed policy wrapped in illusion.''\n  Jack Murtha is a decorated marine, a war hero who bled on the \nbattlefield, the military's best friend.\n  Now he advocates redeploying U.S. forces at the earliest possible \ndate--not tomorrow, not in 2 weeks. Estimates are that it will take 6 \nmonths to a year--while maintaining a quick-reaction force in the \nregion to be called upon when necessary.\n  How did the administration and its supporters respond to this hero, \nJack Murtha's thoughtful proposal? Congressman Murtha, with his two \nPurple Hearts and his Bronze Star, was insulted by the White House \nPress Secretary and branded a coward by the newest Republican Member of \nthe House; branded a coward by the newest Republican Member of the \nHouse, a shameful display of partisanship.\n  People who never bled on the battlefield tried to demean a war hero. \nThat is what we see again and again in this debate.\n  Instead of thoughtful dialogue about the life-and-death issues in \nIraq, the administration lashes out at those who dare disagree with \nthem.\n  Recently, the Republican National Committee issued a video news \nrelease attacking Democrats, including me. I want to thank Senators on \nthe other side of the aisle who said that was wrong. I am used to being \nattacked, and I normally just ignore these attacks. As a matter of \nfact, I wear them as badge of honor. But this one was so incendiary \nthat I have to respond.\n  The ad said Democrats were waving a white flag of surrender in Iraq. \nAnd their evidence? One of their pieces of evidence was my statement \nthat we should start reducing our troop strength in Iraq after the \nIraqi election.\n  Guess who else said that very same thing this last weekend: the U.S. \nAmbassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad, appointed by President Bush. \nListen to what he said. President Bush's Ambassador in Iraq said:\n\n       We can begin to draw down our forces in the aftermath of \n     the elections.\n\n  That is exactly what I said. Are they going to run an ad against \nGeorge Bush's hand-picked Ambassador to Iraq who said the same thing \nthat Senator Boxer said?\n  Democrats aren't waving any white flags, and neither is the \nAmbassador waving a white flag. We are doing the job that we were \nelected to do. We have a right and a responsibility to tell the truth, \nwhether the topic is Iraq or any other policy. We have a right--and a \nresponsibility--to wave a warning flag about a war that is making our \nNation less secure.\n  Regardless of how many times I am attacked, I will continue to speak \nout just as I am doing today.\n  I have four points to make: First, we must restore our credibility. \nOur credibility is at almost an all-time low in the world.\n  If we want the American people to be optimistic, and if we want the \nnations of the world to consider us a leader to be trusted, our motives \nmust be clear, always; our justifications must be sound; and our \npolicies must reflect our ideals. Our policies must reflect our ideals.\n\n  During the Cuban missile crisis, Secretary of State Dean Acheson \noffered to show Charles de Gaulle of France satellite images of Soviet \nmissiles in Cuba as proof of their existence. President de Gaulle \nresponded by saying:\n\n       The word of the President of the United States is good \n     enough to me.\n\n  Today, the word of this President and his administration has been \ncalled into question. Frankly, it is hard to believe those words myself \nwhen the President or the Secretary of State or the Vice President \nstart to tell their expectations about Iraq. It is very hard for me to \nbelieve them. Why is that? I want to believe them. I have served with \nfour Presidents, three of them Republican Presidents. I have never felt \nlike this. I never felt I had to doubt what they were saying when it \ncame to foreign policy.\n  Here is the reason. Remember all the false expectations the Bush \nadministration pedals? Remember when Secretary Rumsfeld said that the \nwar ``could last six days, six weeks, I doubt six months''? . . . Or \nthat we knew exactly where to find the weapons of mass destruction.\n  I was sitting 10 feet from the Secretary of Defense when he said: I \nknow exactly where those weapons are. I know the streets they are on. \nThey are right there in Baghdad.\n  Remember when Vice President Cheney predicted:\n\n       . . . my belief is we will, in fact, be greeted as \n     liberators.\n\n  Remember when White House Budget Director Mitch Daniels said Iraq \nwill be ``an affordable endeavor'' and it ``will not require sustained \naid''?\n  Remember when the case for weapons of mass destruction was called a \n``slam dunk''? Remember Vice President Cheney's now famous assessment \nthat the insurgency was in its ``last throes''? Remember when the \nPresident told us about the yellow cake from Niger in a State of the \nUnion Address? Remember when we were told ``mission accomplished''? We \nweren't told it; it was scrawled on a banner behind the President of \nthe United States as he stood in\n\n[[Page S14134]]\n\nhis Air Force gear. Who can ever forget that moment?\n  Remember when we were told that Iraqi oil would pay for the war? And \nwhen Secretary Rice said she didn't want the smoking gun to be a \nmushroom cloud? And when Colin Powell made his forceful presentation \nbefore the U.N. Security Council proving the case to the world, proving \nthe case that Saddam Hussein had chemical weapons? He now calls that \nmoment a blot on his record.\n  I gave you what the members of this administration have told the \nAmerican people to expect in Iraq. They are zero for 10. I have not \neven gone through the entire list.\n  Yet even today, in the light of all this history, the Bush \nadministration refuses to do more than a perfunctory mea culpa. In his \nlast speech, the President took responsibility for going into the war \non false intelligence. It took him 2 years to say that. He is 2 years \nbehind the American people who figured that out a long time ago. But I \nwill take it. I will take it.\n  The President keeps repeating the false statement that Congress saw \nthe same intelligence that he did, even though the CRS, the \nCongressional Research Service, did a very important study on this \nmatter. They said that is not true. It is a false statement to say that \nCongress saw the same intelligence he did. The report found that the \nadministration had access to more information than was shared by us.\n  And the President still does not answer the central question, was the \nintelligence cherry-picked? In other words, did he pick out the parts \nof the intelligence that made the case for war? And he hasn't answered \nwhether any of that intelligence was manipulated.\n  Democrats are insisting we complete the Senate investigation into \nthis matter. Senator Reid actually put the Senate into closed session \nto insist the Senate Intelligence Committee complete the investigation \ninto whether the President actually misused intelligence or cherry-\npicked intelligence.\n  It is important we complete this investigation. It is not about \npolitics. If the intelligence was cherry-picked by this President or \nmanipulated, the American people deserve to know. The Congress will \nneed to act. Why? Because the next time we need to convince the world \nof an imminent threat, it will be far more difficult unless we clear \nthe air and restore our credibility.\n  America is more than an economic and a military power. Our ideals \nhave made us a shining light throughout the world for all of those \nseeking freedom, democracy, and human rights. I believe that moral \nstanding is at risk today. We all saw the horrific photos of Abu \nGhraib, which were at odds with everything for which this country \nstands. I went up to that room to look at those pictures to bear \nwitness. It was one of the most painful experiences I have never had.\n  We all know what we saw there--and the American people haven't seen \nhalf of what we saw; they have only seen a fraction of what we saw. The \nabuse was disgusting and was at odds with everything for which this \ncountry stands. We all know that torture does not produce accurate \nintelligence or make us more safe. Listen to Senator McCain, who is an \nexpert on this issue. He says torture ``is killing us.'' Amazingly, \nbanning torture was extremely controversial for this administration. \nDick Cheney even worked nonstop to exempt the CIA from the torture ban \npassed by the Congress. Fortunately, we won this one. Again, I say to \nmy Senate colleagues, thank you for standing up, for standing behind \nSenator McCain on this.\n  However, we still do not know everything about the secret prisons or \nsecret spying on Americans, all of which chips away at our reputation \nas a great beacon of freedom and gives us an eerie sense of a secret \ngovernment. We must not have a secret government. We must not walk away \nfrom checks and balances. We now face this issue of our Government \nspying on Americans without a warrant. This is serious. It must be \ninvestigated to restore our credibility.\n  The other day I was at a forum with John Dean, the former White House \ncounsel to President Nixon during Watergate. When we were asked a \nquestion as to whether we believe this President investigating and \nwiretapping American citizens without a warrant was legal, my remark \nwas: I'm not sure about that. I'm very worried about that. I don't \nthink it is. But I want a hearing. I applauded Arlen Specter, chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee, for saying we would have it.\n  This is what John Dean said on videotape and he has since confirmed \nit: This was the first time he ever heard a President admit to an \nimpeachable offense. That comment by John Dean, who knows more than any \nother lawyer in this country about an excessive abuse of power by the \nExecutive is very serious. I sent a letter to four scholars, asking \nthem to please tell me if they think John Dean is on the right track or \non the wrong track.\n  Clearly, we must restore our credibility. Second and third, we must \nreverse the strain on our military and get our budget priorities \nstraight.\n  This administration says dissent hurts our military. Let me tell you \nwhat hurts our military. Our military is fighting so that the Iraqi \npeople have the right to dissent. So to say that our military gets hurt \nwhen we dissent makes no sense at all. How proud they must be that they \ncome from a country where people who love the troops on both sides of \nthe aisle are in a rigorous debate. That is what our military wants. \nThey do not want to see a country where we all dance to the same tune.\n  And they must think it is interesting that even within the parties \nthere are disagreements, that a Joe Lieberman disagrees with a Barbara \nBoxer, or a Chuck Hagel disagrees with an Orrin Hatch. That is what \nlife in America is about. So when the President or his allies right \nhere say, How dare people dissent, I say, How dare we not, if we \nbelieve the path we are on is wrong.\n  Let me tell you what hurts our military: sending men and women to war \nwithout a plan for victory and without the necessary armor and \nequipment. What hurts our military is stretching it to the breaking \npoint and deploying our soldiers for third and fourth tours of duty. \nWhat hurts our military is a lack of candor.\n  Our men and women in the military serve bravely and skillfully in \nIraq. They have sacrificed so much since this war began. We need to \nhonor their sacrifices, not with words but with actions. That means \ntreating their caskets and their families with the respect they \ndeserve.\n  I want to publicly thank my staff in San Diego who stopped a horrible \nsituation from happening, when a military man in a coffin, slain in \nIraq, arrived in San Diego aboard a civilian aircraft, a commercial \naircraft. When the plane landed, he was not going to be greeted by his \nunit. No one was going to be there. And the airline was going to keep \nhim with the cargo, off-loaded with no ceremony, no greeting.\n  Thank God, his parents--military people--saw this and called us. We \nstopped it from happening, and we made sure that casket was greeted by \nhis unit.\n  That is what we need to do. We need to honor our military. It means \nopening up our eyes to their injuries and getting them the help they \nneed. Medical studies reveal that 17 percent of soldiers returning from \nIraq are suffering from mental health problems, including depression, \nanxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The VA says that 17,000 \nIraq and Afghanistan vets have been diagnosed with mental disorders \nthrough February.\n  I have heard from military people who tell me their loved ones were \nsent back on to the field of battle when they were diagnosed with post-\ntraumatic stress, and the doctor said: Don't send them back.\n  Now, 17,000 Iraq and Afghanistan vets have been diagnosed with mental \ndisorders, just through last February. But despite this huge problem, \nthe American Legion--the American Legion--says that mental health \nprograms are being underfunded by $500 million a year.\n  I offered an amendment to provide these critical resources by \ncanceling future tax cuts for millionaires who have already gotten back \ntens of thousands of dollars in tax cuts. It sounds reasonable that we \nwould ask a millionaire to help give a veteran the assistance that he \nor she needs because of mental problems.\n  Well, my amendment failed. The President says he loves our military,\n\n[[Page S14135]]\n\nbut he loves tax cuts for millionaires as much or more. They did not \nweigh in. They did not help us. We could not get it passed.\n  Let's be clear. To finance a war that has already cost $251 billion, \nthis administration did not ask the wealthiest to do one thing to \nsacrifice. Under the Bush tax cuts, millionaires got--and listen to \nthis number--$242 billion back. They have gotten it back over the past \n5 years.\n  In the first 2 years of the Iraq war, the average millionaire \nreceived $112,000 in tax cuts. And we cannot afford to give a soldier \ntreatment when he comes home, and he is so sick that he might even turn \non his own family and hurt them?\n  This makes me sick, Mr. President. This makes me sick.\n  The President did not secure enough real financial commitments from \nother countries. Instead, our needs are being sacrificed and our \nchildren and seniors are paying the price.\n  Talk about waving the white flag of surrender. I want to talk about \nit. The Republican Congress and this administration are waving a white \nflag over our children, cutting their afterschool programs, No Child \nLeft Behind. They have underfunded their own program by $13 billion.\n  They are waving a white flag of surrender over our seniors, causing \nthem anxiety and threatening their Social Security.\n  They are waving a white flag over fiscal responsibility, by creating \na debt that is more than $8 trillion. That means that approximately $92 \nbillion is leaving this country every year to pay off the interest on \nthe debt that foreign countries own.\n  And they are waving a white flag over our homeland security. The \nadministration says all the right things about the terror threat. But \nthey shortchange homeland defense.\n  It has been 4 years since 9/11. We are getting failing grades. We \nneed $555 million this year to better secure our ports, $14 billion so \nthat our first responders can communicate with one another. It is a \ndisgrace that firefighters cannot talk to police officers and health \ncare providers in our communities. Oh, no, oh, we couldn't ask the \npeople who make over $1 million a year to help us.\n  And we are waving the white flag--we are--this Congress and this \nadministration.\n  Fourth, and finally, we need to change course in Iraq. The President \npresents a false choice between leaving immediately and staying \nindefinitely. He says: Stay the course, stay the course. The course has \nto be changed. Frankly, the President, in every speech, connects this \nwar in Iraq to 9/11, even though the 9/11 Commission said there was \nno connection and the President's own documents show there is no \nconnection. As a matter of fact, it was a diversion from our fight \nagainst al-Qaida and bin Laden.\n\n  Do you know what? We are not any safer. Worldwide terrorism is up and \nincreased by more than 1,200 terror attacks last year.\n  Even the President's own Director of Central Intelligence, Porter \nGoss, says:\n\n       Those jihadists who survive will leave Iraq experienced in \n     and focused on acts of urban terrorism.\n\n  Now, I agree with the President about importing democracy. But as \nRobert Pape of the University of Chicago has written:\n\n     . . . spreading democracy at the barrel of a gun in the \n     Persian Gulf is not likely to lead to a lasting solution \n     against suicide terrorism.\n\n  Last week's election in Iraq was an important step forward. And I \npray that country will put together the kind of coalition that is \nnecessary. But either way, it is time for the Iraqis to control their \nown destiny. Each election they have had, it seems to me, should be a \nstep in our recognizing their right to run their own country. Their \nrunning their own country is a sign of success, not failure. Our long-\nterm presence is viewed as open-ended, and it is fueling the \ninsurgency.\n  Too many Iraqis believe that the United States has no intention to \nleave Iraq and with good reason. Every time the President is asked for \nbenchmarks, he says we will be there as long as it takes, even though \ngeneral Casey made it clear to me, when I was in Iraq, again, that our \nlong-term presence is counterproductive.\n  And two-thirds of Iraqis oppose the presence of U.S. troops, at least \ntwo-thirds. In some polls, it is 80 percent. They do not want us there. \nThey want to run their own country. That is not failure. That is not a \nwhite flag. That is not defeat. That is success, when we can redeploy \nour troops, so if the government there needs us, we are nearby.\n  We must accelerate the training of the Iraqi troops. I am glad the \nPresident admitted it has gone far too slowly. But enough with the \nexcuses. They have to get out there and defend themselves. And we need \nto take the help that is being offered from around the world, around \nthe region. The Egyptian Ambassador lamented the fact that so few \ntroops have been trained in his country. He has offered to help, and we \nhave not taken it.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, it does not matter if you voted for the \nwar or against the war at this point. We need now to take action. None \nof us can remain silent.\n\n  As a Senator, I feel obligated to tell the people of my State how I \nfeel. It is time for a new policy. It is time for a new strategy that \nmakes us safer and more secure. It is time to put to rest the notion \nthat to speak out for a new strategy in Iraq is unpatriotic. It is time \nto realize that turning Iraq over to the Iraqis is what they expect and \nwhat we should do. That is what success is. It is time for a real \nstrategy to stop the spread of terrorism and prevent the proliferation \nof WMDs, not go forward with preemptive wars that isolate America.\n  It is time for a real strategy to stop the spread of terrorism. It is \ntime to remember that a strong America begins at home and that we can't \nhave real security if we abandon our children and our families, our \nfiscal responsibility, or if we cannot prepare for a terrorist strike \nor an emergency such as Katrina. It is time for America to once again \nbe a shining example for the rest of the world. We can do it.\n  Again, let's be honest about the past and restore our credibility. \nLet's honor our military with a clear plan. Let's get our priorities \nstraight. Let's get Iraq right by working in a bipartisan way, not \nrunning ugly 30-second commercials while our soldiers die and get \nwounded. We can do better. We must do better. With the wisdom of the \nAmerican people, we will do better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Under the previous agreement, \nthe Senator from Arizona is recognized for 15 minutes.\n\n\n                      Patriot Act Reauthorization\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, one of the key items of business that we have \nto do before Christmas is to reauthorize the PATRIOT Act. I know there \nis some confusion about exactly where we stand on that. Let me clarify \nthat right now.\n  First, where are we with respect to the reauthorization of the \nPATRIOT Act? Why? And what can we do to move forward? I think most \nfolks by now appreciate the fact that after September 11, we understood \nthere were significant problems with our law and we needed to make some \nchanges to fill in some loopholes and to make changes that would give \nour law enforcement and intelligence agencies the tools they needed to \nfight this new enemy, the terrorists. As a result, we passed the \nPATRIOT Act. But we said we wanted to sunset provisions of the PATRIOT \nAct so that we would have to revisit them before they would become \npermanent law. We are now at that point. The law will expire on \nDecember 31 unless we reauthorize it.\n  So the Senate worked on it for about 8 months. We passed a version of \nthe PATRIOT Act to be reauthorized. The House of Representatives did \nthe same thing. There were some modest differences between the two \nbodies. We created a conference committee to iron out the differences, \nand I served on that committee. The Senate got most of its way in the \nconference committee. Most people have said about 80 percent of the \ncompromising was done by the House. Nonetheless, the version we have \nbefore us is a version that I support. It is a good version, as the \nHouse of Representatives found when it passed overwhelmingly before the \nHouse recessed and left Washington, DC. In fact, I believe 44 Democrats \nsupported the reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act in the House. Now it \nis up to us to approve it as well and then\n\n[[Page S14136]]\n\nsend it on to the President for signature.\n  Once a conference report is completed, it is no longer amendable. We \nall understand that. But some Members of the Senate decided they wanted \nto amend it, even though there is no procedure for amending it. So they \ndecided to filibuster the bill. When we took a vote on it, it had \nmajority support. There were over 50 Senators who wanted to reauthorize \nthe PATRIOT Act, but the minority of Senators wouldn't let us vote on \nit. They successfully filibustered it. They said: We are not going to \nlet you vote on reauthorizing the PATRIOT Act because we would like to \nmake some more changes.\n  The time for making changes is up. You can't make any more changes \nonce a conference report has been filed. They know that. So it is a \nlittle curious to me why they keep saying, we want to extend it so we \ncan make some more changes. That is not the procedure of the Senate, \nand it can't be done. The conference has been discharged. The House of \nRepresentatives has gone home. Even if we wanted to go back into the \nconference and make changes, we couldn't do it.\n  There is a way we can accommodate those who wish to make further \nchanges to the PATRIOT Act, but it is not by filibustering. It is by \nallowing us to have the vote, pass the PATRIOT Act reauthorization, and \nthen introduce those changes you would like to make in it, and we will \ndeal with those in the regular process of hearings and presenting the \nmatter to the floor. As a matter of fact, I would like to do that \nmyself. There are some things I would like to add to the PATRIOT Act, \nand I fully intend, after we reauthorize it, to introduce that either \nas an amendment to a bill next year or as a separate bill, and to seek \nhearings in the Judiciary Committee so we can try to move the \nadditional things I would like to see in the act.\n\n  My colleagues are certainly welcome to do the exact same thing. We \nmight even get together and try to have one hearing at which that is \ndone. That is the regular order. That is the way we could make the \nchanges they are talking about, if a majority of Senators agree. But I \nthink that is the rub. I suspect they can't get a majority of the \nSenators to agree to the changes they would like to make. They couldn't \nget a majority of the conference committee in the House or the Senate \nto agree. So they would now like to try to use pure force rather than \nlogic to get their changes.\n  If they have the confidence that their changes make sense, then why \nwouldn't they want to simply offer them next year and let's vote on \nthem? If they have 51 votes, they become law. Instead, they want to \nsomehow pressure us at this point into letting the PATRIOT Act expire, \nand then everyone feels we have to do something so we accept their \nunreasonable demands.\n  That is not the way to legislate, and it is not a responsible action. \nWe should defeat the filibuster, not allow the PATRIOT Act to expire \nbut to extend it for the period of time that the conference agreed, \nwhich is a period of 4 years. And if additional changes are to be made, \nthey can be made starting as soon as we come back here next January. \nThat is the way to do business.\n  There are those who have said: Let's extend it for a few months. As I \nsaid, you can't extend it for a few months. There is no legislative way \nto do that. It expires December 31. The conference committee is closed \ndown. The House has gone home. We are going to finish up in another day \nor two here. So you simply can't snap your fingers and extend a law. \nYou have to pass it. It has to be signed into law by the President. He \nsaid, no, we are not going to have any short-term extension. We have a \nlong-term extension right in front of us. It is called reauthorization. \nAllow the Senate to vote. If you do, they will vote with a majority \nvote to reauthorize the act. Then it is done. If you then want to make \nchanges, you are welcome to do that.\n  What are these big changes that have been talked about? The only ones \nI have heard about are two that were mentioned by the Senator from \nCalifornia who spoke before I did. I don't understand either one of \nthem. She said we have to make changes, some checks and balances, with \nregard to these library records or bookstore records. Secondly, if you \nhave your house searched, you need notice within 30 days.\n  That is what the compromise provides. The conference committee \nprovided a 30-day notice if your house is searched, so that instead of \nthe reasonable standard, which is what exists today, you would have to \nbe notified in 30 days. By the way, why aren't you notified \nimmediately? In most cases, you are. But there are some cases where you \nare not notified of a warrant that has been issued. Why is that so? \nSuppose you are a couple of gangsters and the prosecutor wants to tap \nyour telephone to find out if you are making illegal deals about drug \nrunning. He goes to the court and gets a warrant to tap your phone. Are \nyou told about that? No, of course not. Sometimes a warrant is obtained \nand you are not told about it. You are not told if your house is \nsearched or if your telephone is tapped because to do so would allow a \nwitness to be compromised or a party of interest to escape the country \nor the information not to be obtained because you know that you are \nunder the watchful eye of the prosecutor at the time. So sometimes you \nare not told about a warrant. But there is always a limit on that \ntimewise.\n  In the PATRIOT Act, the House had something like, I believe, 150 days \nor 180 days. The compromise was 30 days, which is exactly what the \nSenator from California said we needed. I don't understand what the \nproblem is there.\n  With respect to libraries, this is the section 215 we have talked \nabout forever and ever. This is simply the business records \nadministrative subpoena for which 335 examples exist in our books on \nthe law today. If you are investigating somebody for Medicare fraud, \nyou can get one of these subpoenas. A subpoena is not a warrant. A \nsubpoena is a request for information. If you suspect somebody of fraud \non the IRS, the IRS can get one of these administrative subpoenas. It \nis a request for information. Do you have to have a judge authorize \nthat request? Not for 335 of these. There is only one that you have to \nhave a judge for, and that is if you are investigating terrorism. The \none that ought to be the easiest is the hardest because we are so \nconcerned about protecting civil liberties that we say under the \nPATRIOT Act, you have to go to a judge first, even for a subpoena--not \njust a warrant, for a subpoena.\n  So it has all the protection I think one would want. But we say we \nneed a standard. So what is the standard the courts have applied? A \nrelevancy standard. We will put that in, too. That is still not enough. \nWe want a three-part test that ties it into international terrorism. \nFine, we put that in. And one more thing; we want to make sure any \nrecords are destroyed within a reasonable time and that people are not \ntold of this information. We said the Justice Department has to set \nthat up. That is still not good enough. We want to make sure it is not \nabused. Fine. We will have a report from the executive branch every 6 \nmonths to Congress explaining in great detail how many subpoenas were \nissued, what the problems were with them, if any, and anything else \nthat Congress wants to know about the use of these so we can have \noversight.\n  There is not much more you could do and still have an effective \nsection 215. Why is section 215 used? As we know, two of the hijackers, \nal-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi, the two who were on the plane that came into \nthe Pentagon and killed 125 people there, as well as the people on that \nflight from Dulles Airport, their airline reservations for September 11 \nwere checked on August 31 on a computer at a library, and had we had \nthe PATRIOT Act library record ability to check that out, and had we \nknown of those two people who I am talking about here, we could \npossibly have known they were checking reservations for September 11 \nand intercepted them and prevented them from getting on that airplane.\n  The bottom line is there are circumstances in which you want business \nrecords. Libraries have business records the same as any other kinds of \nentities. There is nothing wrong.\n  This has been the law forever. We have built in a lot of protections. \nI don't know what more anybody would want with respect to protections \nfor these particular records.\n  So even if you assume that there is more to be done, my question is, \nhow\n\n[[Page S14137]]\n\nmuch more? The differences have been characterized from the other side \nas minuscule. They have said let's extend this and a couple of other \nchanges we want to make. If that is the case, then why is the other \nside willing to let the entire act expire? We don't have the \nprotections of the PATRIOT Act over provisions that are not that \nimportant, especially since they could be offered next year in an \namendment to any bill. We could have hearings for them in the Judiciary \nCommittee. There would be no problem considering these kinds of \nrequests.\n  If it expires, the PATRIOT Act's provisions no longer protect us. One \nof those is to allow the FBI and the CIA to talk to each other. Let me \nexplain why this is important. This wall that used to exist was torn \ndown by the PATRIOT Act. Patrick Fitzgerald, who is the U.S. attorney \nwho is currently a special prosecutor, as we know, looking into another \nmatter, testified how the wall worked in practice.\n  He said:\n\n       I was on a prosecution team in New York that began a \n     criminal investigation of Osama bin Laden in early 1996. The \n     team . . . had access to a number of sources. We can talk to \n     citizens. We could talk to local police officers. We could \n     talk to other U.S. Government agencies. We could talk to \n     foreign police officers. Even foreign intelligence personnel. \n     And foreign citizens. . . . We could even talk to al-Qaida \n     members--and we did. But there was one group of people we \n     were not permitted to talk to. Who? The FBI agents across the \n     street from us in lower Manhattan assigned to a parallel \n     intelligence investigation of Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida. \n     We could not learn what information they had fathered. That \n     was ``the wall.''\n\n  The ``wall'' had deadly consequences. The 9/11 Commission report \ncontained detailed examples of how the wall prevented them from \ncooperating, the FBI and CIA, prior to 9/11--and perhaps the biggest \nexample is the one I cited in which Khalid al-Midhdar and Nawaf al-\nHazmi, two of the hijackers, were known to the CIA and that they were \nconnected to terrorism. They had been connected to the Cole bombing and \nthey were in the United States. The CIA refused to give the FBI the \ninformation because of this wall.\n  I mentioned the fact that we later learned they had actually checked \ntheir September 11 airline reservations on a library computer. The FBI \nagent working on the case in Washington, DC, after being unable to \ncommunicate with the CIA, said this:\n\n       Whatever has happened to this--some day someone will die--\n     and wall or not--the public will not understand why we were \n     not more effective in throwing every resource we had at \n     certain ``problems.''\n\n  That agent was right, and thousands did die. That wall is going to go \nback up if the PATRIOT Act is not reauthorized. So those people who \nhave filibustered the PATRIOT Act and prevented us from voting on it, \nprevented the will of the majority from prevailing in this body. Since \na majority of both House of Representatives and the Senate favors \nreauthorization of the PATRIOT Act, those people will have prevented us \nfrom having in place the PATRIOT Act to protect us from the terrorists. \nThey will have allowed this wall to be resurrected to prevent the FBI \nand the CIA from talking to each other and we are going to be right \nback where we were before September 11.\n  Again, I say, as the FBI agent did, what happens if some terrorists \nshould strike us and we could have prevented that had the PATRIOT Act \nbeen in effect? Those who filibuster this act had better ask themselves \nthat question. They have a very simple way to get around the answer; \nthat is, allow us to have our vote. It will take 20 minutes. We can \nreauthorize the PATRIOT Act and it is back in force and then any other \nlittle changes you want to make to it, we will consider them next \nJanuary, next February. What is wrong with that offer, considering what \nis at stake.\n  I urge my colleagues again that the PATRIOT Act needs to be \nreauthorized. All it takes is for the other side to stop its \nfilibuster, allow us to take the vote and, by a majority vote, we will \nreauthorize it, thus giving the American people the protection we \ndeserve from the law enforcement and intelligence agencies who need \nthis vital tool.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n\n\n                       Measures Before The Senate\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, there are a number of subjects I want to \naddress tonight. I appreciate the time. First, the Defense \nappropriations bill that is before us that is going to have to be \nclotured is very important. I want to make sure everybody understands \nwhat we are talking about. There are some very important things in \nthere, including relief for the Katrina victims, and all of the victims \nof the hurricanes in the gulf coast over to Florida. These are \nimportant funds that need to be provided.\n  It also includes the opening up of ANWR, which will provide revenues \nthat will help us meet the needs of LIHEAP and also of the hurricane \nvictims. Beyond that, it is going to help us meet needs that all \nAmericans have for an adequate energy supply. Nine hundred thousand \nbarrels of oil would have been coming out of the coastal regions of \nnorthern Alaska above the Arctic Circle had the previous approval of \nthis bill by the Congress in 1995 not been vetoed. So ANWR is necessary \nif we are going to bring supply up to help meet the demand for energy.\n  But most important, this provides $50 billion to support our troops \nin the war on terror. We have heard remarks recently on the floor about \nwhat our troops want. I can tell you one thing our troops want is to \nhave the bullets, the supplies, the reinforcements, and the assistance \nthey need to conduct the war. Our troops, by and large, are very \nenthusiastic about continuing to finish the job. What bothers them is \nto hear people in this body and in the media say that the President has \nfailed and we ought to impeach him. Their Commander in Chief, they \nbelieve, has done the right thing in helping us clean out the murderous \ntyrant Saddam Hussein and carry the war on terror to the hotbed of \nterrorism that was and would be Iraq if we left. They are concerned \nthat if we try to pull out the troops before they finish the job, it is \ngoing to be a disaster. I am going to talk more about that later on, \nbut the people who claim to be supporting the troops should not be \nfilibustering the Defense appropriations bill.\n  Speaking of the related subject, let me turn now to electronic \nsurveillance of suspected terrorists' conversations with al-Qaida \nabroad. That is a vitally important area that has been substantially \nmischaracterized by recent remarks on the floor. The National Security \nAct of 1947 requires the President to keep Congress fully and currently \ninformed on U.S. intelligence activities to the extent consistent with \ndue regard for the protection from unauthorized disclosure of \nclassified information relating to sensitive intelligence sources and \nmethods.\n  This statutory requirement recognizes that some of the programs or \nactivities may be so sensitive that the information is provided only to \na few Members of Congress.\n  Regrettably, a very effective program that the President authorized \nhas now been fully exposed. I hope there will be a full investigation \nby the Department of Justice and appropriate prosecutions of those \nfound to have leaked that information.\n  Recognizing the need to protect sensitive programs and activities, \nCongress created the Intelligence Committee and worked with the \nPresident to balance the Congress's constitutional need for information \nand the President's constitutional responsibility to protect national \nsecurity.\n  Before we start calling the President's efforts illegal or \nunconstitutional, maybe people ought to take a look at the law and the \nConstitution. The President has the constitutional authority to conduct \nwarrantless electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes. \nThis is what the President stated he has done. It was for foreign \nintelligence purposes.\n  In the most recent definitive case addressing this issue, the 1980 \nTruong case from the Fourth Circuit, the Court upheld the Executive's \nwarrantless electronic surveillance of U.S. persons for foreign \nintelligence purposes. The Court explicitly recognized a foreign \nintelligence exception to the warrant requirement based on the \nPresident's constitutional authority and responsibility to protect \nnational security.\n  Incidentally, the President, under whose authority that warrantless \nsearch--eavesdropping--was conducted was Jimmy Carter.\n\n[[Page S14138]]\n\n  The FISA statute that has been passed works with the President's \nconstitutional authorities. It is one way to conduct foreign \nintelligence surveillance, but it is not the only way. You see, \nCongress cannot get rid of a President's constitutional authority by \npassing a law. The President can conduct warrantless foreign \nintelligence surveillance because he is charged under the Constitution \nwith protecting our Nation and conducting foreign relations.\n  Under the fourth amendment, the surveillance still has to be \nreasonable; it just doesn't require a warrant. In the context of the \nwar against al-Qaida and worldwide terrorism, the constitutional \nresolution authorizing the use of all necessary and appropriate force \nto prevent future attacks makes it clear that the President's \ndetermination of what is and isn't reasonable is entitled to some \ndeference. When you are fighting a war, you have to be able to move \nquickly to respond to threats. The President has said he exercised the \nauthority to maintain speed and flexibility to target terrorists when \nthey are about to harm our country. If the Constitution provides for \nthat agility, the President should use it.\n  As the 9/11 Commission has pointed out, it was clear that enemy \ncommunications were made from the United States prior to the September \n11 attacks. The Commission criticized our inability to link things \nhappening in the United States with things that were happening \nelsewhere. We know, for example, that Nawaf al Hazmi and Khalid al \nMidhar, two terrorists who flew a jet into the Pentagon, communicated \noverseas to other members of al-Qaida while they were in the United \nStates. We knew they were terrorists, but we did not know they were \nhere until it was too late. Reflecting his constitutional \nresponsibilities and authorities, the activities authorized by the \nPresident make it far more likely that such killers can be identified \nand located in time in the future to prevent that tragic occurrence \nfrom recurring.\n  The lawful activity conducted under this authorization has given the \nUnited States a proven ability to detect and prevent terrorist attacks. \nIt enables us to learn more about those who have a link to al-Qaida in \na way that is agile and timely enough to prevent and detect further \nattacks.\n  The program has been successful, but continuing public discussion of \nthe nature and use of the capability simply will arm our enemies with \nthe knowledge they need to prevent detection and will increase the \ndanger to our country, our citizens, and our values.\n  Speaking of giving the necessary tools to our law enforcement and \nintelligence agencies, there is the PATRIOT Act, which, again, is being \nfilibustered by those on the other side. Over the past few days, \nopponents have raised a number of arguments and charges against two \ncontroversial provisions from the original PATRIOT Act--FISA business \nrecords and national security letters. Unfortunately, many of the \narguments have been inaccurate and misleading, particularly the \nallegations that the conference report does not fix alleged problems \nwith these investigative tools.\n  Let me be clear, as my colleague from Arizona just pointed out, if \nthe USA PATRIOT Act is not reauthorized, we will have done a grave \ndisservice to our Nation's security. That is your and my safety, Mr. \nPresident, and the safety of our families, of our communities, of our \ncountry. We will be sending the wrong message to terrorists and spies \nwho threaten our national security that we will not use every \nconstitutional tool available. I don't want to send that message.\n  It is far too easy 4 years after September 11 to put restrictions on \nthe intelligence community that are not necessary or appropriate. When \nwe needlessly restrict intelligence investigations, we increase the \npossibility that the next attack will succeed.\n  The arguments of those who seek further to restrict the PATRIOT Act \ntools are not based on any factual allegations of abuse but, rather, on \nunsubstantiated allegations, inaccurate and misleading press accounts, \nand hypotheticals. To adopt their position and to reject the conference \nreport is to legislate to the possible rogue FBI agent, the one-tenth \nof 1 percent who might go beyond the law and should be prosecuted if he \nor she does. If we take that step, we will deprive the other 99.9 \npercent of FBI agents of lawful investigative tools.\n  Rather than basing their votes on inaccurate media reports or \nhypotheticals, I urge my colleagues to base their position on this \nimportant legislation on facts: the fact that terrorists continue to \nseek to kill Americans; the fact they continue to plot attacks; the \nfact they are determined to continue the war against us; the fact that \nthis conference report provides significant increased protections for \nprivacy and civil liberties; and the fact that our national security \ninvestigations have not abused the authorities provided under the \noriginal act.\n  This bill is a compromise. Over the past days, many who have opposed \nthe conference report have suggested we can quickly solve the matter by \nsimply adopting the original Senate bill. They pointed to the Senate \npassage of this bill by unanimous consent. We did not object to the \nbill because it needed to proceed to conference quickly. If the Senate \nbill had been submitted to the conferees for signature, there are some \nwho would not have signed it. That bill went too far, in my view. This \nconference report strikes the appropriate balance, and just barely.\n  That said, the conferees considered the bill adopted by the Senate \nand the Senate position on NSLs and FISA business records. All of that \nhas been debated and negotiated. In short, the legislative process \nresulted in the conference report presented to us.\n  Many opposed to the conference report have made a great deal about \nwhat this bill is not. Well, I have a list of thing the bill is not as \nwell. This bill does not place national security investigators on a par \nwith their counterparts investigating criminal cases, regrettably, and \nit doesn't give them the same access criminal investigators have to our \nrecords. Unfortunately, we could not get that done. But neither does it \ncompromise any American civil rights.\n  Speaking, as I was, of the war in Iraq, let me point out that we have \nhad a tremendous milestone. Last Thursday, there was a 70-percent voter \nturnout, the highest thus far.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record an op-ed piece by a \nmarine who spoke very eloquently about the reasons why he is signing \nup, why he is going back to Iraq, why significant numbers of people are \nreenlisting because they know we are making progress in the war on \nterror.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       When I told people that I was getting ready to head back to \n     Iraq for my third tour, the usual response was a frown, a \n     somber head shake and even the occasional ``I'm sorry.'' When \n     I told them that I was glad to be going back, the response \n     was awkward disbelief, a fake smile and a change of subject. \n     The common wisdom seems to be that Iraq is an unwinnable war \n     and a quagmire and that the only thing left to decide is how \n     quickly we withdraw. Depending on which poll you believe, \n     about 60 percent of Americans think it's time to pull out of \n     Iraq. How is it, then, that 64 percent of U.S. military \n     officers think we will succeed if we are allowed to continue \n     our work? Why is there such a dramatic divergence between \n     American public opinion and the upbeat assessment of the men \n     and women doing the fighting?\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, our efforts in Iraq are pivotal to our \nstrategic interests in the Middle East and throughout the world. This \npast Wednesday, Osama Bin Ladin's principal deputy, Aman al-Zawahiri, \nin his latest video on the internet called for the insurgent groups in \nIraq to unite in order to drive out the Americans. Zawahiri has stated \nconsistently that the war in Iraq is his holy jihad and the \nbattleground for establishing a worldwide, Islamo-fascist state. \nTerrorists like Zawahiri are clear on their goals for Iraq, let us be \nclear and steadfast in our resolve to defeat their diabolical plans and \nlay the foundation for a peaceful, free Iraq.\n  As I outlined on the Senate floor earlier this year, Southeast Asia \nis of vital importance to the economic health and the security of the \nUnited States--and I have urged active engagement. Home to over 500 \nmillion people and two Muslim democracies, U.S. engagement is essential \nfor strategic, economic and security reasons.\n  I have just returned from my second trip to the region this year. In \nJanuary of this year, I visited Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia, \nincluding a tour of Aceh in the wake of the devastating tsunami that \nhit that part of the country. I have just returned from a trip to\n\n[[Page S14139]]\n\nthe Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand. Throughout Southeast Asia, I \nspread the message that America has vital interests in the region and \nthat we will continue to cultivate economic and security ties.\n\n  Foremost, however, I made it known that the United States wants to \nparticipate in this and any future East Asian summits. The summit was \ninitially billed as a meeting of East Asian countries, but it continued \nto expand until it was a meeting of ASEAN countries plus Japan, Korea, \nChina, India, Australia and New Zealand--it has started to look like \neveryone but the United States.\n  I can understand China wanting to take this opportunity to \nmarginalize the United States while pressing aggressively their \npriorities in the region. However, I pointed out to the leaders with \nwhom I visited in Southeast Asia that the United States was in Asia \nduring World War II to liberate the region from Japanese aggression; we \nwere in Asia to prevent the region from being taken over from the \ncommunists, and we are in the region to fight Islamic fascists bent in \nturning the region into part of an Islamic caliphate. We were in the \nregion immediately to provide resources to save thousands of lives in \nAceh and begin the rebuilding process. We have made a valuable \ncontribution to the quality of life in Asia and we should not be \nexcluded from such an important summit.\n  The Philippines has a population of 87 million people and population \nis expected to double in the next 30 years. I saw a startling statistic \nthat showed in the same time that median income increased over 2,000 \npercent in Korea, increased over 900 percent in Thailand and almost 700 \npercent in Indonesia, median income increased only 90 percent in the \nPhilippines.\n  Despite its longstanding ties to the United States and the presence \nof an English speaking population, the country has not advanced \neconomically to the level it should have. The corruption of Marcos was \na terrible setback but it is time to move ahead. The country is in need \nof U.S. Foreign Direct Investment but I heard from the American Chamber \nof Commerce that reforms are needed before more investment will flow, \nespecially in area of judicial reform and intellectual property \nprotection. We do have extensive U.S. Government presence that is \nactively working with the government on these and many important \nreforms.\n  In an excellent meeting I had with President Arroyo, I commended her \non the leadership role the Philippines has taken to pushing ASEAN \nfinally to get tough on Myanmar. It is long past time for that country \nto improve its human rights record and move towards installing the \npopularly elected government. We also discussed and I thanked her for \nher support of our objective to advance free trade in Asia.\n  Despite the massive undertaking, the rebuilding of Aceh is \nprogressing. The U.S. remains involved, notably we have been integral \nto building a 60 mile road to cross the island of Sumatra, an essential \nartery to rebuilding the country. Between our efforts and between the \nwaiver of military sanctions by the President, our standing in the \nUnited States is on the rise.\n  Reviving military to military relations will pay more dividends than \nsupport for the United States. The reform-minded President of Indonesia \nis a graduate of Webster University in St. Louis, MO, but he is also a \ngraduate of the IMET program. While his tasks are immense, he is \ncommitted to reform and he has taken on corruption in the government \nand needed structural reforms in the military. Change will never happen \nat a pace that will satisfy some in this Congress, but important \nreforms are advancing and I believe we should seize the opportunity to \ninfluence further the professionalism of the Indonesian military \nthrough more IMET participation.\n  I also had the opportunity to dine with some very engaging, forward-\nlooking members of the Indonesian parliament. They share my concern in \nthe limitations of the Indonesian education system and the holes in \ncurriculum that may be exploited by the paesantrans that are Saudi \nfunded and teach an extreme version of Islam.\n  President Bush has identified an important goal, improving the \neducation system in Indonesia, and has proposed a four year, $157 \nmillion education program for Indonesia. USAID is implementing the \nprogram that will work on curriculum issues and train teachers. This \nprogram is targeted at introducing basic education and the teaching of \nskills to young Indonesians, so that they will leave school with the \nability to find work--creating a capable Indonesian labor force in the \nprocess.\n  Finally, I had an excellent visit to Thailand, a great and \nlongstanding ally of the United States. Like the other countries in the \nregion, we have active ties with Thailand on a number of levels. We are \npresently negotiating a FTA with the Thais, successful completion of an \nFTA will make Thailand our second free trade partner in Asia.\n  But there is also a great deal of success in the region in the war on \nterrorism and many of the countries in Southeast Asia have been \nvaluable partners. As I have stated on this floor, Southeast Asia has \nopened up as a second front on the war on terrorism. It is home to its \nown terrorist network, Jemaah Islamiyah, that has made a number of \nsuccessful and deadly attacks, including the two devastating bombings \nin Bali.\n  There have been numerous victories over terrorism in the past 3 years \nin the Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines. For example, last month \non November 9, 2005, in Indonesia, Indonesian police tracked down and \nkilled Dr. Azahari bin Husin, the Jemaah Islamiyah bomb expert who was \nknown as the most feared terrorist in Asia. Azahari was responsible for \nthe two Bali bombings, an attack on the Australian embassy in Jakarta, \nand the bombing of the JW Marriott Hotel in Jakarta, among others. He \nwas in the midst of planning a string of terrorist attacks when police \nassaulted his safe house in East Java. The termination of his terror \ncampaign was the result of a culmination of numerous entities working \ntogether to fight terrorism in the region. U.S. assistance was and \nremains paramount to such efforts and is having great effect.\n  In Thailand on August 11, 2003, Riduan Isamuddin, aka Hambali, was \narrested by Thai authorities near Bangkok, Thailand, after extensive \ncoordination between multiple agencies and authorities. The capture of \nHambali truly is a testament to the effectiveness that we and the \nallies we support are having in the global war on terror. When the \ndetails of this operation are declassified in the future, the \nphenomenal tale of his capture should make for a dynamic, nonfiction \nmovie. President Bush described Hambali as ``one of the world's most \nlethal terrorists'' and a key figure in al Qaeda's global operations. \nHambali was a close associate of September 11 mastermind Khalid Shaikh \nMohammed, KSM, and it is no coincidence that the information we have \ngleaned from detainees like KSM has led to captures like that of \nHambali.\n  In the Philippines, a great success in the war on terror has taken \nplace over the past year on the southern Philippine island of Basilan. \nI met with the Commander of the Joint Special Operations Task Force \nPhilippines, JSOTF-P, and he briefed me on this tremendous success. One \nof the primary terrorist organizations in the Philippines is the Abu \nSayyaf Group, ASG. The ASG is primarily a small, violent Muslim \nterrorist group operating in the southern Philippines. The group split \nfrom the much larger Moro National Liberation Front in the early 1990s \nunder the leadership of Abdurajak Abubakar Janjalani, who was killed in \na clash with Philippine police in December 1998. His younger brother, \nKhadaffy Janjalani, replaced him as the nominal leader of the group. \nThe group's goal is to promote an independent Islamic state in western \nMindanao and the Sulu Archipelago, area in the southern Philippines \nheavily populated by Muslims. In April 2000, an ASG faction kidnapped \n21 persons, including 10 Western tourists, from a resort in Malaysia. \nOn May 27, 2001, the ASG kidnapped three U.S. citizens and 17 Filipinos \nfrom a tourist resort in Palawan, Philippines. Several of the hostages, \nincluding U.S. citizen Guillermo Sobero, were murdered. Philippine \nauthorities say that the ASG had a role in the bombing near a \nPhilippine military base in Zamboanga in October 2002 that killed a \nU.S. serviceman. In February 2004, Khadaffy Janjalani's faction bombed \nSuperFerry\n\n[[Page S14140]]\n\n14 in Manila Bay, killing approximately 132, and in March, Philippine \nauthorities arrested an ASG cell whose bombing targets included the \nU.S. Embassy in Manila.\n  Today, however, after a year of joint operations between U.S. and \nPhillipine personnel consisting of combat patrols, civil affairs \nassistance, and local interaction with the citizens on the island, the \nmajority of ASG personnel and other terrorist groups have been squeezed \nout of the island. Not only have most of the nefarious characters \ndeparted, but as our troops built wells and provided educational \nassistance they gained the trust of the inhabitants. They showed them a \nbetter way of life and thus ensured that once they left the terrorists \nwould not be welcomed back. Thus far the method has worked, and a haven \nfor terrorism has been eliminated. Through establishing security, \nbuilding infrastructure and winning the confidence of the locals, \nBasilan Island has transformed into a place where terrorists are no \nlonger welcome, and although U.S. and Philippine forces have largely \nleft, the terrorists have not returned.\n\n\n                           Rajadamri Compound\n\n  Mr. President, on a number of occasions this session, I have \naddressed my colleagues about the critical importance of engagement and \nmaintaining strong relationships with our allies in Southeast Asia. As \nI have described, an active U.S. presence is essential for a number of \nvital economic, security and strategic reasons. The United States has a \nnumber of strong allies in the region and these relationships are very \nimportant for promoting our policies pursuing peace, stability and \nprosperity in Southeast Asia. I remind my colleagues that the United \nStates and the Kingdom of Thailand will soon celebrate 175 years of \nformal relations between the two countries, which makes Thailand our \nforemost and longest standing ally in Asia. It is in this context that \nI rise to address the significance of the Rajadamri Diplomatic Compound \noccupied by the U.S. Embassy in Thailand.\n  After the end of World War II, the U.S. Government intervened with \nthe Government of the United Kingdom on behalf of the Kingdom of \nThailand. The United Kingdom was demanding war reparations from the \nKingdom of Thailand, which was nominally allied with Japan during the \nwar. However, the United States argued that during the war the Allies \nreceived very meaningful assistance from the Free Thai movement, which \nwas composed of a significant number of the Thai leadership. In 1949, \nin acknowledgment of the U.S. role in assisting the Free Thai movement \nand in persuading the United Kingdom to forego pursuit of war \nreparations, the Royal Thai Government sold Rajadamri to the United \nStates for a nominal sum and transferred title to the 17 acre compound.\n  Rajadamri is a beautiful piece of property. Located in the heart of \nbustling Bangkok, around the corner from the U.S. Embassy and across \nfrom the famous Peace Park, Rajadamri is a magnificent setting where a \nvisitor can simultaneously admire the imposing modern towers of \ndowntown Bangkok and feed a Mekong catfish or pet the good-natured \nChihuahua that lives on the grounds. The tranquil compound also houses \nthree historic Thai homes that were built by the king for favored \nmembers of the royal family. Rajadamri represents a true gesture of \nfriendship from the Thai Government and the people of Thailand. The \ngranting of these royal residences to the U.S. Government is \nunprecedented and emphasizes even more so that this gift is a true \nsymbol of the gratitude of the Thai people.\n  This compound has played a significant role in the long relationship \nwith our stalwart Thai allies. In addition to the close cooperation \nbetween U.S. Forces and the Free Thai during WWII, the Thai Government \nhas stood by the United States during Korean, Vietnam, Gulf, \nAfghanistan and Iraq wars. The Thais remain a very close friend in \nSoutheast Asia and provide a variety of assistance beyond military, \nincluding delivering important assistance to Indonesia, Sri Lanka and \nother countries affected by the tsunami of 2004; and serving as the \nstrategic center for our efforts to deal with Avian influenza and other \npandemic risks. During the Vietnam War, the morgue used for \ntransferring soldiers killed in action from Vietnam to the U.S. was \ninitially located on this compound. Rajadamri has served as a base for \nregional U.S. financial operations. Rajadamri also continues to house \nnumerous embassy support elements, along with other facilities \nsupporting assistance programs, our war against terrorism, operations \nto eliminate trafficking in humans and drugs, and our operations to \npromote peace and stability in the region.\n  As the Rajadamri compound was essentially a gift to the United States \nby a grateful Royal Thai Government, I believe it is our obligation to \ncontinue to use the compound in a manner that is consistent with the \nspirit in which it was given to the United States. The Kingdom of \nThailand is one of the United States true friends in the world. In \nhonor of that friendship, in an effort to strengthen our warm relations \nand in hopes that the relationship will grow as we continue to meet \nchallenges in the region and the world, we must maintain Rajadamri as a \ncenterpiece of our mission to Thailand. I urge my colleagues to support \nme on this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized for up to \n10 minutes as in morning business and that following my remarks Senator \nLevin be recognized for up to 10 minutes and that the time not be \ncharged against the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                Wiretap\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to read a quote that I thought my \ncolleagues might be interested in. Let me first read the quote. It \nsays:\n\n       Secondly, there are such things as roving wiretaps. Now, by \n     the way, any time you hear the United States government \n     talking about wiretap, it requires--a wiretap requires a \n     court order. Nothing has changed, by the way. So when we're \n     talking about chasing down terrorists, we're talking about \n     getting a court order before we do so. It's important for our \n     fellow citizens to understand, when you think Patriot Act, \n     constitutional guarantees are in place when it comes to doing \n     what is necessary to protect our homeland, because we value \n     the Constitution.\n\n  Now, that sounds like something that would come from somebody saying, \nof course, we ought to have court orders before we wiretap our \ncitizens. Well, let me tell my colleagues who made this statement. It \nwas President Bush in 2004, on April 20, in my home State of New York, \nin the great city of Buffalo.\n  Let me read what the President said while we are talking about this \nnew revelation about wiretaps. He says again, this is a quote from \nPresident Bush, April 20, 2004:\n\n     . . . any time you hear the United States government talking \n     about wiretap, it requires--a wiretap requires a court order. \n     Nothing has changed, by the way. When we're talking about \n     chasing down terrorists, we're talking about getting a court \n     order before we do so. It's important for our fellow citizens \n     to understand, when you think Patriot Act, constitutional \n     guarantees are in place when it comes to doing what is \n     necessary to protect our homeland, because we value the \n     Constitution.\n\n  So I have a question for the President: Sir, with all due respect, \nwhat has changed? If, on April 20, 2004, you said we needed a court \norder to do wiretaps when we listen in on our citizens, why is it now \nthat you are out there busy saying we do not need a court order; that \nthe law does not require it?\n  On April 20, 2004, I would say to the President, you obviously knew \nthat this program of wiretapping citizens was in effect. Why did you \nsay we always need a court order, that that is what the Constitution \nsays, ``because we value the Constitution,'' ``constitutional \nguarantees,'' your words?\n  I think this shows the speciousness of the argument that has been \nmade by those in the White House, including the President, that, of \ncourse, wiretapping citizens without a court order is perfectly allowed \nby the law. The President himself stated something that you learn in \nlaw school, that you probably even learn in a civics class in high \nschool or a constitutional law class in college, that a wiretap for an \nAmerican citizen requires a court order.\n  The President of the United States stated:\n\n     . . . any time you hear the United States government talking \n     about wiretap, it requires--a wiretap requires a court order \n     . . .\n\n  I could not have stated it any better myself. That is the law. That \nhas been\n\n[[Page S14141]]\n\nthe law for a long time in this country and many believe that the \nConstitution, the fourth amendment, so requires.\n  So I would ask the President now to admit that in the heat of the \naftermath of 9/11, something we all felt, that a mistake was made; that \nthe Government went ahead and wiretapped American citizens without a \ncourt order. That was a mistake and should not be repeated or defended. \nWe Americans realize that we need security as well as liberty and, in \nfact, in the Pantheon of values, I guess security might come a little \nbit above liberty, but as the President is implying, when it comes to \nwiretaps we can have both. So for all the sturm und drang, for all the \nfuss that has been made, oh, of course, everyone knows the law does not \nrequire us to get a court order for wiretaps, the President's basic \nknowledge--and by the way, from what I am told, this is from the \nPresident's archives. He went off the script and just said this on his \nown, that he knew that a wiretap requires a court order.\n  So I would ask the President to reconsider his words of the last few \ndays. I would ask the President to join the vast majority of Americans \nwho know that if you are going to wiretap an American citizen, of \ncourse, you have to go to court. And if it is unwieldy to do so, that \nyou go to Congress and change the law. You do not change it with the \nflick of a pen.\n  You compare this statement, what the President said in Buffalo, NY, \non April 20, 2004, to what the President is saying in the last few \ndays, it is a 180-degree turn.\n  Mr. President, which one do you really mean? Which one do you really \nbelieve? Please, no one should be playing political games on something \nas serious as the delicate balance between security and liberty.\n  So I ask my colleagues, as we consider possibly renewing the PATRIOT \nAct, to read what the President has said. The view that we have had on \nthis side of the aisle, that it was sort of beyond discussion; that if \none is going to wiretap an American citizen, they needed court \npermission--in emergencies, of course, it is allowed 72 hours after it \nis done--that that was more or less the consensus in this country, and \nit was a consensus the President was part of at least as of a year and \na half ago.\n  What made the President change his views? What made him reverse the \nuniversally accepted view that a wiretap requires a court order is \nbeyond me. But let us move forward here. Let us come together, realize \nthat we must protect ourselves but that we can protect ourselves and \nprotect our liberties at the same time.\n  I urge the President to explain why he said what he did on April 20 \nand why what he is saying now is so different and to return to the \nposition that most Americans accept, the position he had on April 20 \nbut has since vanished, and that is that to wiretap an American citizen \nrequires a court order.\n  I yield my remaining time and yield to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Cantwell be \nrecognized immediately after I conclude, for 10 minutes under the same \nconditions as I am speaking under.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         defense appropriations\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, a totally extraneous provision allowing for \noil and gas drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge--\nANWR--has been inserted in the Defense Appropriations Conference \nReport. The provision was in neither the House or Senate bill which \nwent to conference. This provision clearly violates Senate Rule 28 \nwhich states:\n\n       Conferees shall not insert in their report matter not \n     committed to them by either House, nor shall they strike from \n     the bill matter agreed to by both Houses. If new matter is \n     inserted in the report, or if matter which was agreed to by \n     both Houses is stricken from the bill, a point of order may \n     be made against the report, and if the point of order is \n     sustained, the report is rejected or shall be recommitted to \n     the committee of conference if the House of Representatives \n     has not already acted thereon.\n\n  It is clear that the ANWR provision violates Rule 28 and that the \nPresiding Officer will, on the advice of the Parliamentarian, so rule. \nThe sponsors have indicated that they will appeal such a ruling of the \nPresiding Officer and seek to overrule it. If they are successful, this \nwould, in effect, eliminate enforcement of Rule 28.\n  That is why language has been inserted in the Defense Appropriations \nConference Report which would, upon the signing of the legislation into \nlaw, attempt to reinstate Rule 28's effectiveness. That provision \nstates:\n\n       Effective immediately, the presiding officer shall apply \n     all the precedents of the Senate under Rule 28 in effect at \n     the beginning of the 109th Congress.\n\n  Playing ping pong with the Senate rules is an outrageous process. \nViolating a Senate rule and restoring it, all in the same bill, if \npermitted to occur, means the rules of the Senate are subject to the \nwhim of conference committees. Rules will exist or can be ignored, \nviolated, or reinstated at the whim of the conferees. Conference \nreports could be used by a Senate majority to circumvent any Senate \nrule. Each conference committee becomes a Rules Committee--every \nconference report can accomplish anything the majority wants regardless \nof the Standing Rules of the Senate. Senators should play by the rules, \nnot play with the rules. Do we care if the Senate rules take a massive \nblow? Why are we contemplating destroying our process this way?\n  The majority has cited as a precedent the 1996 Federal Aviation \nAuthorization Conference Report. A Rule 28 point of order was raised \nagainst that bill because of out of scope matters which were added in \nconference. The ruling of the Chair was overturned by the Senate, \ncreating a precedent that the Senate so regretted that, by bipartisan \nagreement, 4 years later, the Senate restored the enforcement of the \nrule.\n\n  The trashing of our rules proposed in this Defense Appropriations \nbill in order to get an unrelated provision passed, is far worse than \nthe mistake we made in 1996. The effort to combine the destruction of a \nrule and its restoration all in the same legislative act would create a \nprecedent which could lead to the routine circumvention of any Senate \nrule by conference committees. Is this what we want to do in the \nSenate--to leave ourselves without rules we can rely on?\n  If the suspension of a rule has merit, the Senate has a process under \nits rules to suspend it. Suspension of a rule simply requires a 1-day \nadvance notice and a \\2/3\\ vote. This is the proper way to proceed \nunder the rules, not abusing the conference committee process to allow \nthe majority to change the rules at any time for any purpose by adding \nlanguage to a conference report.\n  So what can a minority do in response to protect itself in the future \nagainst this trashing of the rules? The minority would presumably never \nagree to allowing the Senate to appoint conferees. Since the steps \nleading to conference require the cooperation of the minority party in \nmost instances, why would the minority leave itself vulnerable to \nlosing the protections of 200 years of Senate rules, precedents, and \nhistory? My colleagues, walking down this road leads us to an abyss. \nWhy are we doing this to the Senate? I am afraid it is because some \nhave the power to do it and get their legislative goal accomplished.\n  Arthur Vandenberg, one of my predecessors from Michigan is one of the \ngiants of Senate history. His portrait was recently added to the Senate \nReception Room outside of this chamber where he joined six other greats \nof the Senate. Senator Vandenberg back in 1949 said:\n\n       I continue to believe that the rules of the Senate are as \n     important to equity and order in the Senate as is the \n     Constitution to the life of the Republic, and that those \n     rules should never be changed except by the Senate itself, in \n     the direct fashion prescribed by the rules themselves.\n\n  Senator Vandenberg added that when:\n\n     . . . we fit the rules to the occasion, instead of fitting \n     the occasion to the rules . . . in the final analysis, under \n     such circumstances, there are no rules except the transient, \n     unregulated wishes of a majority of whatever quorum is \n     temporarily in control of the Senate. That, Mr. President, is \n     not my idea of the greatest deliberative body in the world. . \n     . . No matter how important [the pending issue's] immediate \n     incidence may seem to many today, the integrity of the \n     Senate's rules is our paramount concern, today, tomorrow, and \n     so long as this great institution lives.\n\n\n[[Page S14142]]\n\n\n  No Senator, no matter how he or she feels about ANWR, should accept \nthe abuse of power which is incorporated in the ANWR add-on to the \nDefense Appropriations bill. That bill, so important to our troops and \nour national security should not be misused in this way.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I notice that Senator Cantwell is \non the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. I would say to the Senator from Washington, Senator Frist \nwill be here shortly to do maybe, I hope, a unanimous consent request. \nIf that is the case, I ask the Senator from Washington to allow us to \ninterrupt.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I am happy to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, many of my colleagues have been on the \nfloor talking about the importance of the votes tomorrow, and I want to \nremind my colleagues that I do think that these votes are important for \nthe Senate process. I am very disturbed, as are many of my colleagues, \nthat we have moved forward with the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill that includes language to open up drilling in the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge as well as a provision allowing drug \nmanufacturers to be protected from liability from lawsuits for vaccines \nthat they make.\n  I think most of my colleagues thought we were going to vote on a \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill tomorrow that was going to \nhelp our troops and give military pay raises and help provide security \nfor our Nation. The last thing I think many Americans think is a nexus \nto that is drilling in the Arctic Refuge, particularly when many \nAmericans believe we don't have enough energy independence and need to \nget over our over dependence on fossil fuels.\n  I hope my colleagues understand how important this issue is. We have \nbeen contacted by military leaders, retired military leaders who have \nsaid:\n\n     . . . any effort to attach controversial legislative language \n     authorizing drilling in ANWR to the defense appropriations \n     conference report will jeopardize Congress' ability to \n     provide our troops and their families the resources they \n     need. . . .\n\n  This coming from retired military personnel who thought it was so \nimportant they actually sent a letter saying they were concerned that \nthis legislation would hold up funding for our troops. That letter has \npreviously been printed in its entirety in the Record.\n  We have also been contacted by the Retired Military Officers \nAssociation. These are individuals, too, who want to see legislation go \nthrough because they want to make sure the men and women in the \nmilitary receive their increase in pay and take care of the troops \noverseas and get all the enforcements they need in a Defense bill. But \nthey also wrote to us saying:\n\n       We are concerned that the insertion of any divisive, non-\n     defense related issues at the last minute could further delay \n     the enactment of this crucial legislation.\n  So military leaders from around our country are saying they do not \nlike the antics of putting ANWR drilling, a very divisive issue that \nhas been debated for 25 years, into a Defense appropriations bill. This \nis coming from the military men and women who want to see a clean \ndefense appropriations bill.\n  I should say to my colleagues that there are other people watching \nthis issue as well. We have newspapers across the country that are also \ncalling out for Congress to be more responsible on this legislation. \nThey are hearing the complaint, as I am, from many parts of the country \nabout this legislation and the way it has been put together.\n  The Statesman Journal in Salem, OR, states that some U.S. lawmakers \nare still trying to scheme and allow oil drilling in the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge.\n  I heard my colleague talk about the vote tomorrow and the process. I \njust wish to emphasize that while there will be points of order as it \nrelates to the budget and the budget process allowing for a budget \npoint of order and the rules of the budget as it relates to this bill, \nthe Defense appropriations bill, there is language in here that I \nbelieve is outside the scope of this legislation and should not be \nallowed.\n  I hope my colleagues understand that is one of the possible votes \ntomorrow--on whether this language on the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge, as my colleague from Michigan said, has no inclusion, neither \nin the House nor Senate original proposal, has no place showing up in a \nconference report in the eleventh hour. That is why we are hearing from \npeople all over the country about how absurd it is to include this in \nthe legislation.\n  I hope, if my colleagues are forced to have a vote on upholding the \nruling of the Chair, that they will realize they are really overturning \nthe Senate rules if you disagree with the ruling of the Chair on this \nissue. This is not the same as the budget process. It is part of our \nSenate rules. The Senate rules, as the Senator from Michigan read, are \nvery clear. You can't include things in a conference report that were \nin neither House nor Senate version. But that is exactly what the \nSenator from Alaska has tried to do.\n  Alaska will likely get, from drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge, $5 billion in bid bonuses. I actually think that this proposal, \neven for an Alaskan, is shortsighted.\n  America needs to be diversifying into alternative fuels like \nbiofuels, and be focusing on lightweight materials that help us be \nefficient.\n  I think that is why this newspaper in Oregon calls this plan \nshortsighted, that it is disgusting that lawmakers would try to equate \noil profits with the Nation's true defense needs. That is what \nnewspapers across the country are saying about this legislation. I \nbelieve they are right because we are doing a great disservice to the \nmen and women in the military by continuing to talk about this issue \nwithout being specific to the fact that we are adding something that \nshould never have been put in this legislation.\n  Another Oregon newspaper, the Oregonian also said that Arctic \ndrilling has been thrown into the Defense bill, and it is an \nemotionally charged matter of supporting the troops at a time of war, \nand it does not belong there.\n  This is from another newspaper: It doesn't belong there.\n  Americans are watching and paying attention to the fact that this \nlegislation was thrown in at the eleventh hour. I believe we should \npull it out and get on about our business of passing a Defense \nappropriations bill.\n  Let me mention another issue that I am sorry is in this legislation.\n  I have for the Record several editorials that I would also like to \nsubmit for the Record on this issue of immunity for drug and vaccine \nmanufacturers. There are several here that deserve being a part of the \nRecord. I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times Dec. 14, 2005.]\n\n                    The Stealth Liability Provision\n\n       Republicans are using the last days of this Congressional \n     session to try to grant extraordinary liability protection to \n     the drug companies that will make the vaccines and other \n     medicines to combat a possible influenza pandemic. But they \n     have been slow to mount a comparable effort to help the \n     people who may be harmed by adverse side effects.\n       Although liability protection is being portrayed as a vital \n     step in carrying out the president's $7 billion flu pandemic \n     plan, it serves a political purpose as well. The insulation \n     against liability looks suspiciously like an effort to reward \n     the drug companies, which help bankroll Republicans, and \n     punish the trial lawyers, who help bankroll Democrats.\n       Some form of liability protection is clearly needed, if \n     only to allay the concerns of drug company executives worried \n     about lawsuits. We know how to provide sensible liability \n     protection and have done so for routine childhood \n     immunizations, and for the national swine flu vaccination \n     campaign of 1976 and the smallpox vaccination effort two \n     years ago. But each time individuals had a mechanism to seek \n     compensation, and often, if warranted, the government could \n     sue the manufacturers.\n       For a pandemic, however, Republican leaders would allow \n     suits only if there was willful misconduct. The companies \n     could be reckless or grossly negligent and escape \n     responsibility. As for victims' compensation, the Republicans \n     have been vague and secretive, but claim that they will \n     produce a fair and robust compensation system. Their \n     provision is expected to be attached to a defense \n     appropriations bill that is now before a conference committee \n     and, once approved, cannot be amended on the floor.\n       The conferees ought to shun that provision and leave the \n     complexities to fuller discussion early next year.\n\n[[Page S14143]]\n\n             [From the Des Moines Register, Dec. 9, 2005.]\n\n                      Drug Makers Don't Need Gift.\n\n       President Bush and Congress are trying to give a Christmas \n     present to one of their favorite industries--the drugmakers. \n     Senate legislation seeks to create a new government division \n     within the Department of Health and Human Services with the \n     power to shield drug companies from lawsuits.\n       The legislation would allow drug makers to create a product \n     with no threat of civil accountability--even if they're \n     negligent.\n       That's wrong on its face. But there's also no reason for \n     doing it. The motivation appears to be based on an untruth \n     repeated recently by President Bush.\n       Last month, when he outlined a prevention plan for an \n     avian-flu outbreak, he also called on Congress to ``remove \n     one of the greatest obstacles to domestic vaccine production: \n     the growing burden of litigation.'' He said the industry had \n     been ``flooded'' with lawsuits.\n       In an independent review of jury verdicts and judicial \n     decisions for cases involving flu vaccine, two Harvard \n     researchers found 10 suits in the past 20 years. Just 10.\n       The industry doesn't need protection from litigation--or \n     any more gifts from its friends in Washington.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Detroit Free Press, Dec. 16, 2005.]\n\n     Vaccine Makers: Lawmakers Service People, Not Drug Companies.\n\n       As panicky as Americans may some day become about getting \n     vaccinated against bird flu, that urgency does not translate \n     into walling off vaccine makers from lawsuits or invoking \n     secrecy around medical research.\n       Attempts to add those measures to year-end bills piling up \n     in Congress are subterfuges to dodge the full debate that \n     would probably sink them.\n       Some vaccines do come with risks. The best model so far for \n     addressing them is the one used for children's immunizations, \n     which includes a fund to reimburse anyone harmed by a \n     vaccine.\n       Shielding drug companies completely could undermine \n     confidence in the vaccines they do develop for an epidemic, \n     which would heighten the risk if bird flu mutates into a form \n     easily transmitted from human to human.\n       Managing public fears--whether of the illness or the \n     preventive measures or both--is an essential part of any \n     health strategy.\n       In that context, how to handle a rush vaccination program \n     merits serious debate.\n       Shoehorning industry favors into other bills, such as the \n     defense spending bill, does not meet the threshold.\n       Another potential stealth insert is a plan to create a \n     biomedical research agency that would not have to answer \n     Freedom of Information Act requests or follow other \n     accountability rules normally applied to federal agencies.\n       The vaccine shield was part of that plan; groups allied \n     against it wonder whether some of the secrecy provisions also \n     could get slipped into a spending bill.\n       The research agency bill allows more information to be \n     hidden than any current law, according to analyses by \n     journalists' associations lined up in opposition.\n       Public health programs work best when they live up to that \n     name by operating in the open and serving the common good.\n       Congress needs to remember that its first responsibility is \n     to the health of people in this country, not to the companies \n     that get contracts to help protect it.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. For example, the Register-Guard--I don't know why \nOregon is paying so much attention to what is happening, but they are \non top of things--says in an editorial, ``Unjustifiable protection \nagainst lawsuits,'' making sure to protect the drug companies is an \nimmunity deal for vaccine makers that has been slipped into the Defense \nbill.\n  They think it is unjustifiable.\n  Another paper, the Vindicator, a Youngstown, OH, newspaper with the \nheadline: ``Trading on fear by passing legislation is wrong.''\n  It says that when legislators begin attaching complex legislation \nwith far-reaching effects to must-pass bills, a tactic designed to \ngrease the way for passage with virtually no debate, people should be \nalarmed.\n  I ask unanimous consent these articles be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Register Guard, Dec. 14, 2005]\n\n                        Vaccines Come With Risk\n\n       President Bush and Republican leaders in Congress are right \n     to focus special attention on improving the nation's capacity \n     to develop and distribute vaccines quickly. No response to a \n     bioterrorism attack or influenza pandemic would save more \n     lives than rapid, widespread immunization of healthy people.\n       But it's inexcusable to exploit public fears of a flu \n     pandemic as a means to grant the drug industry unjustifiable \n     protection against lawsuits filed by injured patients. Senate \n     Majority Leader Bill Frist is attempting to slip immunity for \n     drug and vaccine makers into a defense spending bill without \n     debate.\n       It's not just unseemly to concoct such a blatant Christmas \n     giveaway for the pharmaceutical industry. Barring injured \n     patients from seeking compensation undermines the very public \n     health goals an effective vaccination program seeks to \n     promote. Case in point: the Bush administration's 2003 effort \n     to have health professionals and first-responders immunized \n     against smallpox.\n       Some military personnel and others who received the \n     smallpox vaccine suffered heart attacks and neurological \n     disorders. When other first-responders were told there would \n     be no compensation for anyone who experienced adverse \n     reactions, the backlash stopped the program in its tracks.\n       President Bush would have Americans believe that greedy \n     trial lawyers and runaway jury verdicts have crippled vaccine \n     makers. Hogwash. The idea that U.S. vaccine production has \n     suffered as a result of product liability lawsuits is a \n     Trojan horse designed to sneak the administration's tort \n     reform agenda into must-pass public health legislation.\n       Here are the facts: A study of ``Legal Concerns and the \n     Influenza Vaccine Shortage'' by two Harvard University School \n     of Public Health professors found only 10 lawsuits against \n     the manufacturers of flu vaccine during the past 20 years. \n     Moreover, pharmaceutical companies have been making heavy \n     recent investment in vaccine R without any additional \n     liability protection.\n       The common-sense solution to this issue has existed since \n     1986. It's called the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, a \n     no-fault fund that shields drug manufacturers from most \n     lawsuits by compensating patients who can prove they were \n     injured by a vaccine.\n       All Congress needs to do is extend the VIC plan to any new \n     federal flu pandemic vaccine. That solves the problem without \n     creating the first blanket industry product liability \n     immunity in the nation's history.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From the Vindicator, Dec. 13, 2005]\n\n          Trading on Fear to Pass Vaccine Legislation Is Wrong\n\n       When legislators start playing on the worst fears of \n     people, the people should be worried. And when legislators \n     begin attaching complex legislation with far reaching effects \n     to must-pass bills--a tactic designed to grease the way for \n     passage with virtually no debate--people should be alarmed.\n       The American people should be both worried and alarmed by \n     the efforts of Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist to ram \n     through legislation in the name of protecting the nation from \n     a bird flu epidemic. The bill would not only indemnify the \n     pharmaceutical industry from suits involving death, \n     disability or sickness resulting from the use of pandemic flu \n     vaccines, but would create a new secret bureaucracy to shield \n     the government's health decisions from public scrutiny.\n       The need to provide some sort of protection to \n     pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that provide life-\n     saving vaccines is arguably necessary.\n       Even though a study by Harvard public health professors \n     reported in the October 2005 Journal of the American Medical \n     Association concluded that there were only 10 vaccine-related \n     civil lawsuits brought in the United States in the last 20 \n     years, wariness by pharmaceutical companies in pursuing new \n     vaccines is understandable. In today's litigious climate, it \n     only takes one big mistake to bankrupt a company.\n\n\n                       Vigorous debate necessary\n\n       But the need to protect vaccine providers from unreasonable \n     risks should be vigorously and openly debated in Congress. If \n     companies are to be indemnified against potential \n     catastrophic losses by the federal government, should the \n     federal government share in any extraordinary profits a \n     company makes when its vaccine is a market success?\n       But there will be no such discussion of hypotheticals if \n     Frist has his way. He is attempting to attach the liability \n     shield bill of Sen. Richard Burr, R-NC, onto a must-pass \n     defense spending bill.\n       Even more troubling, S.B 1873 would establish the \n     Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Agency within \n     the Department of Health and Human Services. BARDA would be \n     presided over by a presidential appointee and would assume \n     many of the functions of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health.\n       But unlike the CDC and NIH, BARDA would be exempt from the \n     Freedom of Information Act.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. The Toledo Blade editorial said:\n\n       Congress and President Bush have acted sluggishly in \n     protecting the nation from public health emergencies, but \n     they can move at lightning speed when it comes to helping \n     their friends in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Toledo Blade Editorial, Dec. 16, 2005]\n\n                           Congress, on Drugs\n\n\n          helping their friends in the pharmaceutical industry\n\n       One example: A Senate bill aimed at creating a stealthy new \n     federal agency to shepherd rapid development of drugs and \n     vaccines to be used against bio-terrorism and pandemic \n     disease.\n       Against the backdrop of potentially deadly bird flu \n     outbreaks worldwide, it sounds like\n\n[[Page S14144]]\n\n     a good idea, but a closer look reveals a plan for blanket \n     immunity for industry against legal action by anyone hurt or \n     killed by defective drugs or vaccines. Worse, the agency's \n     activities would be shielded from public view by an exemption \n     from the federal Freedom of Information Act, broader even \n     than the CIA enjoys.\n       The bill, introduced in mid-October by Sen. Richard Burr, \n     Republican of North Carolina, reportedly is set to be \n     attached to a defense appropriations bill that Congress must \n     pass this month before lawmakers leave town for the holidays. \n     That means there would be little or no debate.\n       The legislation would be welcomed at the White House, which \n     has demonstrated repeatedly that it wants to govern with the \n     least amount of public input and as much secrecy as possible.\n       Not surprisingly, the action is being taken in the wake of \n     two reports that give the Bush Administration low marks for \n     emergency preparedness.\n       First, the 9/11 commission gave the government an F for \n     lackluster homeland security efforts since the terrorist \n     attacks more than four years ago. That was followed by a \n     stinging D+ from Trust for America's Health, a nonprofit, \n     nonpartisan Washington organization that graded the \n     administration's overall public health capability in the \n     event of a disaster.\n       Senator Burr has been quoted as saying the legislation is \n     necessary to provide ``the incentives and protections \n     necessary to bring more and better drugs and vaccines to \n     market faster.'' Experts, however, say the industry is doing \n     just fine and doesn't need special treatment. Moreover, \n     despite claims to the contrary, there has been no disruptive \n     wave of lawsuits against drug manufacturers.\n       And, working in secrecy, BARDA would have the sole \n     authority to determine what medical equipment, drugs and \n     vaccines would be shielded from civil lawsuits.\n       We have editorialized before about the penchant for the \n     Bush administration, which backs S.B. 1873, to try to expand \n     the secrecy under which government operates. It began long \n     before the threat of avian flu, even before Sept. 11, 2001. \n     But the administration and its supporters have not been shy \n     about using fears of disease or terrorism or national \n     security to further a goal of being able to operate with less \n     and less public oversight.\n       If Burr's bill is a good one, it should be able to survive \n     the healthy debate that is supposed to be a part of the \n     legislative process.\n       Likewise, if bureaucrats are making life and death \n     decisions regarding the medical care that is available to the \n     American people, they should be subject to the same Freedom \n     of Information law that existing public health agencies work \n     under.\n\n     \n                                  ____\n  Ms. CANTWELL.

But \n     that's the approach some in Congress seem bent on taking.\n       Rushing to get home for Christmas vacation, Congress is \n     poised to approve an ill-considered bill introduced by Senate \n     Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn. The bill would create a \n     new bureaucracy, the Biomedical Advanced Research and \n     Development Agency, that would perform many of the functions \n     now carried out by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention and the National Institutes of Health.\n       It's being sold as an essential step in President George W. \n     Bush's pandemic flu plan, and a short-cut to the development \n     of vaccines for other diseases that could be used in a \n     bioterror attack. It is neither.\n       The new agency would be exempt from the federal Freedom of \n     Information Act. And it would have the authority to block \n     civil actions on drugs, vaccines and other medical devices \n     developed for it. That means patients would have no right to \n     compensation if they were harmed, and professional groups \n     could be blocked from getting information about things like \n     complication rates.\n       The foundation of public health is sharing information, \n     making it as widely available to individuals and local \n     governments as possible. Arguing that an agency designed to \n     help combat bird flu or bioterror should work in \n     extraordinary secrecy is as puzzling as it is wrong-headed.\n       Nor is there any reason to provide extraordinary liability \n     protection for drug companies making bird flu vaccine. For 20 \n     years, America has had a vaccine injury compensation fund \n     that helps people injured by side-effects of inoculations and \n     protects vaccine makers from excessive liability. It works \n     fine, so why tamper with it?\n       Most analysts say that recent reductions in the number of \n     vaccine makers are tied to low profit margins and uncertain \n     markets, not to the fear of lawsuits. Now, with guarantees of \n     massive government purchases, the industry is gearing up \n     research and production. It doesn't need these new \n     protections.\n       Dr. Frist's bill could be voted on by the end of the week. \n     It may be attached to a defense appropriation bill that would \n     be the last thing Congress votes on this year. That would be \n     a big mistake.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. The Times-Tribune of Scranton, PA, said:\n\n      . . . the prospect of a pandemic is being used by Congress \n     to pander to the pharmaceutical industry.\n\n  And:\n\n       Congress should not use legitimate concerns about a flu \n     epidemic as a wedge to protect the manufacturers from \n     liability.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Times-Tribune, Dec. 12, 2005]\n\n                           Pandering Pandemic\n\n       Fear of an avian flue pandemic has driven the government to \n     find ways to increase the production of vaccines while \n     improving monitoring and detection technology. Unfortunately, \n     the prospect of a pandemic also is being used in Congress to \n     pander to the pharmaceutical industry.\n       The Biodefense and Pandemic Vaccine and Drug Development \n     Act of 2005 would create a new federal agency that would be \n     exempt from public disclosure laws, while superseding many of \n     the functions now handled by public agencies such as the \n     National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention. It would have the power to designate \n     certain drugs as exempt from civil liability litigation.\n       That measure cannot be directed at vaccines. According to a \n     study of recent flu vaccine shortages by the Harvard School \n     of Public Health, only 10 liability suits have been filed \n     against vaccine manufacturers over the last 20 years. Most \n     such claims are handled under the National Vaccine Injury \n     Compensation Program.\n       Economic factors produce vaccine shortages. Vaccines are \n     difficult and costly to produce, and unlike for prescription \n     drugs, there is no definitive long-term market. That's why \n     the federal government, quite rightly, has begun to subsidize \n     vaccine production.\n       Members should get a copy of the most recent issue of the \n     New England Journal of Medicine, which accuses Merck of \n     misrepresenting the results of clinical trials of Vioxx, the \n     anti-inflammatory medicine that was pulled from the market \n     this year.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Several other articles that I will go through include \nthe Roanoke Times, that this legislation is in pursuit of secrecy \naround this issue.\n  The Orlando Sentinel: Drug firms don't deserve virtually unlimited \nprotection against vaccines lawsuits that would shield manufacturers.\n  The Raleigh, NC newspaper: Wrong way immunity.\n  One more, the Las Vegas Sun, titled ``Vaccines and accountability: \nBush's proposal to shield avian-flu vaccine makers from liability \ninvites health problems.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have those printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the World News, Dec. 11, 2005]\n\n                       Naughty Pursuit of Secrecy\n\n                           (By Tommy Denton)\n\n       As is his custom this time of year, Santa's been making a \n     list and checking it twice, finding out who's been naughty \n     and nice.\n       President Bush and other perpetrators of the nefarious \n     ``Black Drug Act'' should consider themselves in the \n     ``naughty'' column.\n       OK, the ``Black Drug Act'' slightly overstates the \n     nefariousness of the Biodefense and Pandemic Vaccine and Drug \n     Development Act of 2005, its formal title, but not all that \n     much.\n       Introduced in October in response to natural and \n     potentially terrorist-induced pandemics, the bill would \n     create a new federal bureaucracy under a presidential \n     appointee charged with overseeing a vast new initiative to \n     develop remedies for such events.\n       Skeptics might wonder why the administration supports \n     creating another agency that effectively duplicates the \n     functions currently assigned to the highly capable U.S. \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National \n     Institutes of Health and other federal public health \n     operations.\n       The answer, for those untutored in the ways of Washington \n     in general and the Bush administration in particular, lies in \n     the proposed agency's license to operate under smothering \n     secrecy.\n       That's where the ``black'' comes in under the legislation's \n     informal title, as in the ``black'' operations of the \n     military that are exempt from public awareness or exposure.\n       The same would apply for the Biomedical Advanced Research \n     and Development Agency, which, with its extra-judicial powers \n     and supervision by a political appointee, would\n\n[[Page S14145]]\n\n     be cloaked in official secrecy while ensuring that remedies \n     for fighting a biological outbreak or attack would remain \n     equally ``black.''\n       Translated into operational terms, that means BARDA would \n     grant astounding levels of secrecy and legal immunity from \n     civil lawsuits filed by persons harmed by the products of the \n     drug companies overseen by the agency.\n       Even the business of the agency would be exempt from the \n     public protections of the federal Freedom of Information Act. \n     The Defense Department and Central Intelligence Agency are \n     required to meet the accountability standards of such \n     scrutiny, for goodness' sake, so the shield provided to BARDA \n     and its clients in the pharmaceutical industry should elicit \n     a public denunciation of epic proportions.\n       Yet, under the president's eager support, a squadron of \n     Republican senators has been shoving the bill closer to \n     passage with a frightening lack of public attention to its \n     perils.\n       Bush pleaded early last month: ``One of the greatest \n     obstacles to domestic vaccine production [is] the growing \n     burden of litigation. In the past three decades, the number \n     of vaccine manufacturers has plummeted, as the industry has \n     been flooded with lawsuits.''\n       Oh? According to a study published in October of 2004 in \n     the Journal of the American Medical Association by Michelle \n     Mello and Troyan Brennan, Harvard University School of Public \n     Health professors, only 10 lawsuits were filed against makers \n     of flu vaccine in the last 20 years.\n       And the president's alleged flood of lawsuits apparently \n     has not seriously discouraged such manufacturers of vaccines \n     for influenza and other infectious diseases as Merck, Wyeth, \n     GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis and the Swiss company Roche.\n       Sanofi-Pasteur, the nation's largest flu vaccine maker, \n     already has invested $150 million to double its production \n     capacity in response to the likely demand for its products, \n     according to a recent report on National Public Radio.\n       The key for the White House and congressional leadership in \n     this effort to invoke official secrecy and stymie the civil \n     justice system in the event of malpractice and negligence is, \n     simply, fear.\n       Never mind that sound, cutting-edge medical science--\n     indeed, all science--and responsive public policy work best \n     under the confidence-building conditions of public \n     transparency.\n       If you have no concern for science or the patience for \n     transparency, then raise the specter of bio-terrorists \n     preying on a vulnerable nation, invoke the need to work in \n     secret to repel that peril, and you're halfway home.\n       Boogy, boogy, boogy!\n       Killer viruses!\n       Hide, take refuge in secrecy, hide!\n       Boogy, boogy, boogy!\n       Under such fear-inspired secrecy, the public would be \n     stripped of the very openness and accountability required to \n     acknowledge, assess and overcome threats to public health and \n     safety--processes essential in a democratic republic.\n       No, the Black Drug Act has precious little to do with much \n     of anything other than securing an expanded sphere of \n     official secrecy in which the administration and its favored \n     corporate benefactors can exploit the fruits of fear.\n       Santa's still making his list, and he's not amused.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Orlando Sentinel, Dec. 13, 2005]\n\nLearn From Past Vaccines: Drug Firms Don't Deserve Virtually Unlimited \n                  Protection Against Vaccine Lawsuits\n\n       Even with the threat of a worldwide bird-flu pandemic, U.S. \n     vaccine manufacturers might be unwilling to respond without \n     protection from lawsuits. Protection is fine but it needs \n     limits and some recourse for victims.\n       The leading proposal in Congress, from Senate Majority \n     Leader Bill Frist, would bar lawsuits except where a \n     manufacturer's willful misconduct caused injuries or deaths. \n     That standard is much too permissive; it would shield \n     manufacturers in cases of gross negligence, such as failing \n     to follow normal safety procedures.\n       Yet Mr. Frist's proposal would not set up an alternative \n     system to compensate victims of severe reactions, which are \n     inevitable in any mass vaccination. Congress made the same \n     mistake preparing for a swine flu pandemic in 1976. That \n     program collapsed amid widespread fears about harm from the \n     vaccine. The country was lucky the pandemic never \n     materialized.\n       Congress gave lawsuit protections to childhood-vaccine \n     manufacturers in 1986, but wisely created a compensation \n     system for severe reactions. Rep. Dave Weldon, a Palm Bay \n     Republican and doctor, is rightly concerned that the lack of \n     a system for a bird-flu vaccine could deter doctors and \n     others on the front lines in a pandemic from getting \n     vaccinated.\n       Mr. Weldon also sensibly proposes an independent review of \n     the safety of a bird-flu vaccine, to anticipate problems and \n     build public confidence in the program.\n       Without limits and the kind of measures Mr. Weldon \n     advocates, lawsuit protection for flu-vaccine manufacturers \n     could backfire.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the News and Observer, Dec. 16, 2005]\n\n                           Wrong-Way Immunity\n\n       It's understandable why the Bush administration and its \n     Capitol Hill allies are trying to speed up the production of \n     vaccines and drugs to combat pandemics and bioterrorist \n     attacks. But in that effort, the administration and \n     Republican Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina have gone off \n     course.\n       A bill introduced by Burr has come under wide criticism \n     because of its intended formation of a large new bureaucracy \n     wrapped in secrecy and its lack of accountability to the \n     citizens it is designed to protect. With the measure stalled \n     in the Senate, the sponsors appear intent on trying to pass \n     it as a rider to the defense appropriations bill.\n       This kind of end run around fuller consideration would be a \n     mistake. The Senate especially needs a more complete \n     exposition of the Burr bill's proposal that the Biomedical \n     Advanced Research and Development Agency (BARDA) be exempt \n     from the Freedom of Information Act.\n       Even more sweeping is a provision empowering the new agency \n     to shield from any legal action those producing vaccines, \n     drugs, medical equipment or other products turned out to \n     combat pandemics or bioterrorism. Such a broad exemption from \n     liability is hardly justified on the record.\n       A study reported by the Journal of the American Medical \n     Association found, for example, that there had been only 10 \n     lawsuits in 20 years over flu vaccines. Drug companies don't \n     get out of the vaccine business because of liability, the \n     study's authors said, but because of low profit margins and \n     unpredictable demand.\n       These are two factors that clearly should be more fully \n     dealt with in any legislation to spur the production of \n     vaccines, for instance, for an avian-flu pandemic.\n       There is another major question hanging over Burr's bill: \n     Is it desirable to form within the Department of Health and \n     Human Services a new supersecret agency?\n       Already in place are the U.S. Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention, the Department of Homeland Security and the \n     National Institutes of Health. Such programs ought to provide \n     more than enough federal firepower to encourage and monitor \n     the steps being taken to prevent or counter pandemics or \n     bioterror attacks. The forming of a large new agency that \n     would be all but shielded from public and even congressional \n     scrutiny can hardly be the right answer for Americans.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Las Vegas Sun, Nov. 2, 2005]\n\n   Vaccines and Accountability: Bush's Proposal to Shield Avian-Flu \n         Vaccine Makers From Liability Invites Health Problems\n\n       The Bush administration is planning today to release a \n     detailed proposal of its plan to thwart an avian flu \n     pandemic. Scientists say the flu, now present in Asia and \n     parts of Europe, could develop into a worldwide crisis if the \n     virus causing it mutates into a form that makes people, and \n     not just birds, contagious.\n       President Bush spoke Tuesday in general terms of his plan, \n     most of which we believe is well thought out. The plan would \n     provide funding for developing a new technology for producing \n     vaccines. It would commit the country to a continued \n     partnership with the World Health Organization. It calls for \n     helping to fund the people and agencies in other countries \n     who are now battling the virus. It would provide funding for \n     states to develop emergency plans in the event of a pandemic. \n     It also calls for manufacturing and stockpiling supplies of a \n     flu vaccine that shows promise of being effective.\n       These points are all worthy of congressional approval. We \n     do have reservations, however, about another point in Bush's \n     plan. He is asking Congress to absolve the manufacturers of \n     vaccines from all legal liability, meaning they couldn't be \n     sued if people who took the vaccines died or suffered \n     physical harm. We believe this aspect of the plan needs a \n     hard look by Congress.\n       Is there really a good reason to remove accountability from \n     manufacturers of drugs that are intended to safeguard the \n     whole country, if not the whole world? We believe that a \n     solid shield against legal action could lead to a lowering of \n     safety standards by manufacturing executives, who will be \n     under pressure to rush vaccines into production. If the \n     manufacturers want protection from widespread bad outcomes, \n     let them buy insurance.\n  Ms. CANTWELL.

Could the Presiding Officer inform me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The last two speakers have asked their time \nnot be charged. They were speaking as if in morning business. The Chair \nwould honor the request that the Senator's time not be charged against \nthe bill.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That would be my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Defense Appropriations\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am rising to say we now know we will \nget the votes on the reconciliation and we are going to have a vote on \nthe Defense appropriations bill which includes the ANWR legislation as \nwell as the Katrina hurricane relief and the Rita hurricane relief.\n  I rise tonight because I hope we now see the pathway to finishing a \nvery productive year in the Senate. It is never easy to pass \nlegislation in the Senate. We all know that. We have 100 Senators \nrepresenting 50 States and everyone has a different idea. What we have \nto do is come together for the good of our country.\n  If ever there was a time when important legislation for the families \nof our country, for the military men and women of our country, for the \nchildren of our country, for the future, to have energy independence \nfor America, this is the time when we must say, even if I don't like \neverything in this bill we must pass it. I don't like everything in \nthis bill. Not one Member would say we liked everything in this bill.\n  However, what we have pending in the appropriations bill for our \nDepartment of Defense and regarding ANWR is essential for the future of \nour country. I hope my colleagues will look at this last opportunity we \nhave this year to do what is right for our country.\n  On the appropriations bill, the chairman of the committee has done an \nincredible job. We are going to have a budget to which we will adhere. \nIt is going to have an across-the-board cut to pay for the Katrina \nrelief we all are seeking. We are trying to do the responsible thing. \nThat is to meet the crises facing our country, the war on terror, doing \nwhat is right for our military men and women with boots on the ground \nas we speak, helping to make sure terrorists are stopped from \ndisrupting Iraq and Afghanistan and coming back to America.\n  We are trying to do those things. We are trying to help the victims \nof Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. We are trying to make these important new \nexpenditures in a responsible way with an offset of an across-the-board \n1-percent cut in discretionary expenditures with the exception of \nveterans' health benefits. We are not going to cut those. We know the \nVeterans' Administration was running out of health care money, so we \ngave them an emergency supplemental to make sure veterans' health care \nneeds are addressed.\n  Other than that, we have a 1-percent across-the-board cut in \ndiscretionary spending as an offset, because that is the responsible \nway to help rebuild the gulf coast that has been hit so hard this year.\n  We are taking up the Defense appropriations bill along with ANWR. \nSometimes I hear on the other side of the aisle arguments as if we had \nnot passed ANWR in the Senate. We have passed drilling in ANWR in the \nSenate because we know we must have an energy policy in this country \nthat will produce more energy, more types of energy.\n  We have to employ conservation to conserve energy. At the same time, \nwe have to promote solar energy; renewable sources, such as wind \nenergy; research into other types of new fuels, which we are doing \nevery day, so we have new sources; and increasing our domestic supply \nof oil and gas, which is the bread and butter of our energy needs for \nthis country.\n  We are over 50 percent dependent on foreign sources for our energy \nneeds in America. That is not a position in which the strongest Nation \non Earth should find itself. We should have the capability to provide \nour own energy and depend on no one.\n  Drilling in ANWR would give us the amount of oil that we get from \nSaudi Arabia every day. We are looking at 4 billion to 11 billion \nbarrels of recoverable oil and gas in this area.\n  I will never understand why the people who are so opposed to this \nwill not go and look at it. The Wildlife Refuge is an area the size of \nthe State of South Carolina. The area to be drilled is under 2,000 \nacres. Because we have new technologies, you can now drill for miles \nunderground without ever marring the surface.\n  So we are talking about an area the size of Dulles Airport that would \nbe the drilling site in an area the size of South Carolina.\n  Are there trees in this area? No. There is not a tree in this area. \nIt is grassy plains. Drilling is not going to harm the environment. It \nis going to be done in an environmentally safe way. It will increase \nthe energy supply in our country. The people of Alaska, where this is \nto be done, want it. They have overwhelmingly supported it time and \ntime and time again. They have supported it in polls. They have \nsupported it in coming to Washington to seek the approval of Congress \nbecause they want the jobs. They want the economic boost. So this is \nsomething that is good for everyone, and it is the right thing to do \nfor our country.\n  So I hope, as we start voting on these very important bills and \nfinish the business of this year--I hope very soon because so many of \nour Members want to be with their families at this time of year, just \nlike everyone in America does--I hope we will do the responsible thing.\n  We were elected to represent the people and to stay here as long as \nit takes. I hope we do that tomorrow and we deliver to the American \npeople a reconciliation bill that sets the budget on a path to lower \nour deficit by half, as the President has asked us to do, over the next \n5 years; a Defense appropriations bill that will give the Katrina and \nRita victims the help they need and deserve, and to be able to drill in \nANWR so we will be able to add one more new source of energy for our \ncountry that we control, that we do not depend on foreign sources to \nproduce for us. That is another vote for the stability of the economy \nand the national security of our country.\n  I urge my colleagues to do the right thing as we start these \nimportant votes tomorrow.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I rise today to talk about a few of the many ways that \nthis spending reconciliation bill reinforces the misplaced priorities \nof the Republican leadership of this Congress.\n  With the 2 reconciliation bills--the bill that we are considering \ntoday that cuts services for the poor and the bill that we will see \nagain in January that cuts taxes for the wealthy--we again are saying \nto the American people that we believe in shared sacrifice . . . so \nlong as this sacrifice is made only by those who can least afford it. \nEspecially in a time of war, this is wrong.\n  I didn't vote for the Senate version of the spending reconciliation \nbill a few weeks ago because I didn't think that it was right to try to \nreduce our huge budget deficit by cutting funding for those who need it \nmost while cutting taxes for those who need it least.\n  Never mind, of course, that these two bills would actually increase \nthe deficit, and therefore not even meet the purpose they were meant to \nserve.\n  Now we have received the conference report on the spending \nreconciliation bill, after the House passed this report late last night \nwith almost no review or debate. The report cuts funding for the needy \nfar more than the original\n\n[[Page S14147]]\n\nSenate bill did, and therefore is even worse than the bill we saw a few \nweeks ago.\n  I will attempt to address 6 of the many areas in which this bill cuts \nservices to those who need these services most: Medicaid, Child Support \nEnforcement, Child Care, Supplemental Security Income for the Disabled, \nFoster Care, and Higher Education.\n  First, this conference report asks for more from those who need \nMedicaid services while asking nothing of pharmaceutical companies and \nHMOs. In fact, this bill was a victory for big business.\n  This conference report allows States to increase the Medicaid \ncopayments that many beneficiaries must pay in order to receive health \ncare services and medications. The original Senate bill included no \nincreases in copayments or premiums.\n  This conference report, however, reflects the House cuts, which \noverwhelmingly impact beneficiaries.\n  The House and Senate conferees also chose to leave a $10 billion \nMedicare slush fund for managed care companies intact.\n  The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, MedPAC, an independent \ncommission appointed to advise Congress on Medicare spending, found \nthat the $10 billion slush fund was unnecessary and unwarranted, and \nrecommended its elimination.\n  The Senate included its elimination in the Senate-passed budget bill, \nbut the managed care companies and the administration went to work on \nthe conferees, and the slush fund lives.\n  That means the Secretary of Health and Human Services will have $10 \nbillion to dole out to multimillion dollar managed care companies while \nStates will be allowed to increase the copayments of patients making \nbelow the Federal poverty level, which is slightly more than $19,000 \nper year for a family of four.\n  The average compensation of the highest paid executive in each of the \n11 largest managed care companies in America was approximately $15 \nmillion in 2002. These companies are not the ones in need of Government \nsubsidies.\n  Another example of this conference agreement's choice of big business \nover working Americans is the giveaway to pharmaceutical companies \nwhile punishing poor seniors who need nursing home care.\n  The Senate version of this bill insisted that Medicaid get the best \npharmaceutical prices by increasing the minimum rebates drug \nmanufacturers are required to pay the Medicaid program.\n  In a victory for the pharmaceutical industry, this provision was \nstripped. Meanwhile, provisions that would substantially impact middle-\nincome seniors in need of nursing home care were maintained.\n  Medicaid was not meant for people who have enough money to afford \ntheir own nursing home care, and rules restricting the transfer of \nassets to qualify for Medicaid are necessary.\n  However, the rules adopted by the conferees are overly restrictive \nand punish middle-income seniors.\n  Under the rules outlined in this conference report: A woman who \nhelped her granddaughter with her college tuition 5 years ago would be \npenalized.\n  A widow who doesn't know what her husband spent their money on before \nhe died 4 years ago would be penalized.\n  A senior whose home appreciated during the housing boom to $500,000 \nwould be refused Medicaid, even if her house is modest. Medicaid has \nalways had the right to collect from the home of a beneficiary through \na lien. Now, we are going to deny coverage altogether to a senior who \nhappens to live in an active real estate market.\n  The typical nursing home resident is a widow in her 80s with 3 to 5 \nmedical diagnoses who needs help with most daily activities. Almost \nhalf have Alzheimer's disease or another dementia. Many have no \nimmediate family. Why are we punishing them and rewarding HMOs and \npharmaceutical companies?\n  A budget is more than a collection of numbers; it is a reflection of \nvalues. We should all value health care for the least among us.\n  This conference report makes many more cuts beyond the cuts to \nMedicaid.\n  Many low-income mothers cannot afford to lose the child support \npayments to which they are legally entitled simply because deadbeat \ndads can get away with not paying to support their children. Yet the \nHouse has created a conference report that cuts $1.5 billion over the \nnext 5 years and $4.9 billion over the next 10 years from the funding \nfor child support enforcement.\n  The CBO estimates that this will result in $8.4 billion being taken \nout of the pockets of mothers who are owed child support over the next \n10 years.\n  This conference report includes $1 billion in additional funding for \nchildcare. That sounds pretty good. But since the report would \ndramatically change the way the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families \nprogram works, the negative effects on childcare of the conference \nreport as a whole are simply huge.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this conference report \nprovides $11 billion less than what States would need in order to \nsupport the new TANF work requirements that this bill requires and to \nmaintain the existing childcare programs for low-income working \nfamilies not on TANF.\n  Because of this shortfall in funding, many States will likely be \nforced to reduce the number of childcare slots available for TANF \nfamilies. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, an \nestimated 255,000 fewer low-income children will receive childcare \nassistance by 2010 compared to the children who received it in 2004.\n  This conference report also uses a budget gimmick to make it appear \nthat the bill saves more money that it actually does. Shamefully, this \ngimmick comes at the expense of poor people who need supplemental \nsecurity income.\n  Let me explain. Today, when disabled people are forced to wait for \nmany months to be approved for supplemental security income by the \nSocial Security Administration--and unfortunately this seems to happen \nquite often--the money that these disabled individuals are owed is paid \nin one lump sum once these folks are approved for this supplemental \nincome. Under this conference report, however, these people would \ninstead receive the support for which they are eligible in \ninstallments.\n  Why? So that when the savings of this conference report are \ncalculated, it will appear that the savings are bigger than they really \nare, since some of these payments will be pushed outside of the 5-year \n``budget window.'' But this accounting gimmick comes with a real cost: \nthe disabled have to wait longer for the help that they need. That is \njust shameful.\n  The conference report also cuts $343 million in foster care funding, \nincluding cuts that will make it more difficult for some grandparents \nto raise their own grandchildren.\n  Finally, much has been said already about the $13 billion cut in \nFederal financial aid for college students in this bill. About one-\nthird of the total cost-savings in the budget reconciliation bill come \nfrom the student loan program.\n  This bill dramatically increases the cost to middle-income families \nof borrowing money to send their kids to school.\n  The PLUS program, Parent Loans for Undergraduate Students, is \navailable to families who have exhausted their Stafford loan \neligibility, are credit worthy, but have run out of money for college \nbefore their kids are done with school.\n  Today, PLUS loans are made to parents at an interest rate of 6.1 \npercent. This conference report hikes that interest rate to 8.5 \npercent. For the 800,000 families with a PLUS loan, that is an average \nincrease of $550 per year. Instead of paying $989 in interest, they \nwill pay $1,541.\n  At a time when we should be doing everything we can to prepare our \nstudents to compete in the economy of the 21st century, it simply makes \nno sense whatsoever to make it harder for low- and middle-income \nstudents to go to college.\n  In summary, there is simply no reason why we should support this \nconference report which goes much farther in cutting support for the \nneedy than the bill that we barely passed by a vote of 52 to 47 a few \nweeks ago. If we are going to ask some Americans to share in the \nsacrifice that wartime requires, we should ask all Americans to share \nin that sacrifice, not only those who are most in need.\n\n[[Page S14148]]\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Deficit \nReduction and Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 2005.\n  The purpose of this bill is deficit reduction. We did it without \ntaking anything away from students. In fact, we gave new money and a \nnew program to college students. Let me summarize some of the things we \ndid.\n  Academic Competitiveness and SMART grants: Creates new grant programs \nthat award academic competitiveness grants and SMART grants to Pell-\neligible students in an undergraduate program of study. Students in \ntheir first and second years may receive awards of $750 and $1300 \nrespectively, provided they have completed a rigorous program of study \nat the secondary level. Undergraduate students in their third and \nfourth year may receive up to $4,000 in grant aid if they major in \nmath, science, technology, engineering or critical foreign languages \nand make progress toward a degree. Students at both 2-year and 4-year \nacademic colleges will be eligible for the academic competitiveness \ngrants.\n  Increase loan limits: Increases loan limits for first- and second-\nyear students to $3,500 and $4,500 respectively and increases graduate \nborrowing limits to $12,000 per year for unsubsidized loans. In \naddition, the bill permits graduate students to borrow PLUS loans.\n  Interest rates: Reduces the cap on student loan interest rates from \nwhere they are currently capped at 8.25 percent and stabilizes them at \n6.8 percent. The interest rate on parent loans, currently capped at 9.0 \npercent, would be fixed at 8.5 percent.\n  Lender payment cap: Requires lenders to rebate to the Federal \nGovernment the difference between the borrower rate and the lender rate \nwhen the borrower rate exceeds the lender rate.\n  Reduction of work penalty: Reduces the work penalty by increasing the \nincome protection allowance for students and encourages saving for \ncollege by reducing the percent of savings that are assessed.\n  Simplified needs analysis: Simplifies the application process for \nstudent aid by permitting students and families who are receiving \nmeans-tested assistance to file a shorter form and raises the ``auto-\nzero'' amount to $20,000 so that families with income levels below that \namount are automatically determined to have zero expected family \ncontribution.\n  Reduction of origination fees: Reduces origination fees charged to \nborrowers by 1 percentage point immediately and by half of a percentage \npoint for each year beginning July 1, 2007, and continuing through July \n1, 2010.\n  Distance learning: Eliminates the ``50 percent'' rules for \ninstitutions offering distance education programs. One 50 percent rule \nlimits the percentage of courses offered through distance learning and \nthe other rule limits the percent of an institution's students that may \nbe enrolled in distance education courses.\n  School as Lender Program: Imposes a moratorium on the School as \nLender Program effective April 1, 2006. To be grandfathered, schools \nmust be making loans prior to or on April 1. In addition, the bill \nrequires that the proceeds of the sale of loans, in addition to any \ninterest and special allowance payments, must be used for need-based \nstudent assistance programs at the school. Limits expenses to \nreasonable administrative expenses.\n  Extension of loan foregiveness: Permanently extends teacher loan \nforgiveness up to $17,500 to math, science, and special education \nteachers in low-income schools. Private school teachers become eligible \nfor loan foregiveness.\n  9.5 percent loans: Eliminates the recycling of 9.5 loans and extends \nthe limitations already in effect under the Taxpayer-Teacher Protection \nAct. Provides a 5-year extension for the smallest of the non profit \nlenders.\n  Over the past year, I have worked to reauthorize the Higher Education \nAct. I worked closely with my colleague and good friend from \nMassachusetts to develop legislation that would provide students with \naccess to postsecondary education, make it more affordable for students \nto get to college, and provide them with new opportunities.\n  In March of this year, the Senate adopted a budget resolution that \nincluded reconciliation instructions for several committees, including \nmine. The Senate HELP Committee was given a target that represented 40 \npercent of the total deficit reduction package. In conference, the \nSenate HELP Committee again was given the heaviest lift. We were given \na target that made up an even higher percentage, saving $16.1 billion \nof the $39 billion total.\n  One of the principles that guided the committee's efforts to achieve \nthe savings was ensuring that a significant portion of the savings \nwould be used to provide student benefits. In September, the committee \napproved bipartisan legislation unanimously that included several \nprovisions designed to help students, including $8 billion in need-\nbased grant aid. Of that $8 billion, over $2 billion was targeted to \nencourage students in their junior and senior year to major in math, \nscience, and critical foreign languages. In November, the Senate \napproved this program as part of the larger reconciliation bill.\n  While the conference report is less generous to students than what \nthe Senate had agreed to, the reconciliation bill we are considering \nprovides $10 billion in spending on student benefits. First among \nthese, the bill creates a new academic competitiveness program that \nprovides grant aid to low-income students. Students eligible for Pell \ngrants are able to receive up to $700 in additional grant aid their \nfirst year of college, and $1,300 in their second year. Students \nmajoring in math, science, and critical foreign language programs in \ntheir third and fourth years are eligible for up to $4,000 in \nadditional grant aid.\n  This report dedicates $3.75 billion to grant aid for the next 5 \nyears. This is an extraordinary commitment and a larger increase in \ngrant aid than we have seen in the last 5 years under Pell or any other \nFederal student aid source. This is real money that will help today's \nstudents enter and succeed in college. It will also help support \nstudents in programs of study critical to our national security and \neconomy and create a strong incentive for more students to enter these \nfields.\n  The $3.75 billion grant program is smaller than this body approved in \nNovember. This is a first step, and the first step is a critical step \nto take, but it is often the most difficult and misunderstood. I \nbelieve this is a good start, but we must continue to work toward what \nit takes to ensure this Nation's competitiveness. Access to \npostsecondary education is critical to this effort, and we cannot lose \nsight of the goal of a strong and competitive American economy.\n  The reconciliation conference report also includes provisions to \nreduce borrower origination fees in both major Federal student loan \nprograms. Borrowers currently pay origination fees of up to 3 percent \nwhen they take out their loans. The conference report provides for the \nreduction of these fees, so that students will not pay more than 1 \npercent in either program.\n  These fees cost students millions of dollars every year, and they \ndon't provide any benefit. They make college more expensive, and \nstudents typically end up paying interest on these fees for 10 years or \nlonger. The reduction of these fees will save individual students \nhundreds of dollars over the life of their loans.\n  The bill allows current law to take effect on schedule, setting \nborrower interest rates at 6.8 percent. Many people have suggested that \nthe 6.8 percent rate will cost students more over the life of their \nloans. They don't realize that this provision is already part of \ncurrent law. Four years ago, when Congress approved the fixed interest \nrate for borrowers, students supported this change because they had \npaid interest rates of up to 8.25 percent for years. Now, after 4 years \nof historically low interest rates, the 6.8-percent fixed rate doesn't \nseem as attractive.\n\n  I want to point out, however, that current trends and projections \ndon't support the conclusion that the 6.8 percent interest rate will \ncost students more in the long run. At each of the last 13 meetings, \nthe Federal Reserve Board has voted to increase interest rates. The \nhistoric lows that interest rates have been set will not continue and \nwill likely to continue to go up. The rate increases accounted for a \nnearly 2 percent increase in borrower interest rates in 1 year. By \nsetting the student loan interest rate at a set rate\n\n[[Page S14149]]\n\nwe will save future interest rate increases from effecting student \nlending. This is the same interest rate policy that passed the Senate \nHELP Committee unanimously.\n  Only 5 years ago, borrower interest rates exceeded 8 percent. At the \ncurrent rate of increases, students would be paying more than 6.8 \npercent by July 1, 2006. That is before the next school year. In fact, \nthey would be paying more than 7.3 percent if we had kept the current \ninterest rate structure. The same can be said of the parent loan \nprovisions. Parent loans are currently capped at 9 percent. At the \ncurrent rate of increase, parent borrowers would be paying more than \n8.5 percent by July 1, 2006. This is the same rate that passed the HELP \nCommittee unanimously.\n  The bill that initially established the 6.8-percent fixed interest \nrate was passed by unanimous consent over 4 years ago. In September, \nthe HELP Committee voted unanimously in support of these provisions. In \nOctober, the HELP Committee, with the support of five Democrats, voted \nagain to allow the scheduled interest rate change to take effect.\n  The conference report also provides for increased loan limits for \nstudents. This has been criticized as a provision that will only \nencourage more students to take out increased loans. However, since \n1994, many students have been taking out significantly more private \nloans to meet their education expenses. Many of these loans have \ninterest rates of up to 18 percent or more. The difference between a \n$10,000 private loan at the 18-percent rate and a federally guaranteed \nloan at a rate of 6.8 percent would save a student almost $8,000 over \nthe life of the loan. As the cost of college across the country has \nskyrocketed, this provision will help more students afford the \nincreased cost of tuition and subsidize their interest, so they don't \nhave to take out private high-interest student loans.\n  As I said earlier, this bill provides almost $10 billion in student \nbenefits over 5 years and significantly more over the long term. At the \nsame time, we have been able to additionally net more than $12 billion \nfrom Federal loan programs to make them operate more efficiently, which \ncontributes to reducing the deficit.\n  While I am very disappointed that the conference report does not \ninclude broader-based grant aid to improve access to and persistence in \npostsecondary education, I am pleased that the report includes the \ngrant funding that it does. These are funds that will benefit low-\nincome students and will help our country and its economy to remain \ncompetitive by ensuring that tomorrow's workforce has the skills \nnecessary to compete in the global economy. I will continue to work \nnext year and in the coming years on legislation to further our goal to \nprovide the opportunity for all Americans to go to college if they \nchoose.\n  There were a number of provisions important to students included in \nthe conference report provided to the Budget Committee that were \nstripped from the final language due to Senate procedural rules. Among \nthese provisions was one that would have clarified the purpose of the \nnew grant program. That section used to read: ``The purpose of this \nsection is to increase the number of postsecondary students from low-\nincome backgrounds who are enrolled in studies leading to baccalaureate \ndegrees in physical, life, and computer sciences, mathematics, \ntechnology, engineering, and foreign languages critical to national \nsecurity.'' This language was removed from the conference report \nbecause of potential conflicts with the ``Byrd rule.'' It is my hope \nthat the Department of Education will consider this language when they \npromulgate the appropriate regulations on the administration of this \nprogram.\n\n  Another important provision that was stripped from the report was \nlanguage to repeal the so-called single holder rule, which limits the \nability of students to consolidate their loans with the lender of their \nchoice. I hope the Senate will take action on this important issue \nquickly and permit students to take advantage of this additional \nflexibility.\n  I will continue to work toward the goals we held for the \nreauthorization of the Higher Education Act. I hope that this process \ncan continue in a bipartisan way, because ultimately, it is about \nstudents, it is about the economy, and it is about our national \nsecurity.\n  With respect to pensions, the conference report also adjusted \npremiums payable to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, PBGC, and \nwill save a total of $3.6 billion. These savings will be achieved by a \nseries of increases to pension insurance premiums.\n  The per-person premium for single employer plans will rise from $19 \nto $30 and will be indexed; the per-person premium payable for \nmultiemployer plans will rise from $2.60 to $8 and will be indexed; and \na new premium will be charged against underfunded, terminated plans of \n$1,250 per person and will be payable for the first 3 years after the \nsponsor emerges from bankruptcy. This ``termination premium'' will \napply to plans of sponsors whose parent company filed for protection \nunder Chapter 11 after October 18, 2005. This increase in premiums \npayable by plan sponsors to the PBGC is long overdue. Single-employer \npremiums have not been increased since the early 1990s. This conference \nreport marks the first instance in which multiemployer plan premiums \nhave been increased since 1980. Now, all of the language in the pension \npart of this bill will be superceded when the full pension bills passed \nby the House and by the Senate are conferenced to one bill to provide \nfull pension reform to protect the pensions of all hard-working \nAmericans who were promised a defined benefit plan.\n  This bill meets the goal of deficit reduction, and it does so by \ntaking the money from corporate windfalls, not students. It protects \ncurrent student programs. It adds a new student grant program to the \ntune of $3.75 billion. Much of what is in the education part passed the \nSenate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee unanimously. \nThat means that Republicans and Democrats voted for it. We did not get \nall the money we wanted for students. We got more than they had before. \nWe had to settle for some limitations--but limitations that will \nimprove America's competitiveness. In legislation you seldom get all \nthat you would like to have. We can be proud of what we have done for \nstudents--and for people on pensions.\n  Overall, the bill provides significant saving measures while at the \nsame time providing billions of dollars in new student grant aid. In \naddition, this bill will help to stabilize our Nation's defined benefit \npension system.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to the \nspending reconciliation conference report.\n  The Federal budget should reflect the Nation's priorities. \nUnfortunately, the priorities on display in this year's budget \nreconciliation process are out of touch with those of the American \npeople. Worse yet, the rhetoric we hear about fiscal responsibility is \nat odds with the reality of the pending legislation.\n  This bill cuts deeply into programs that serve our country's most \nvulnerable citizens in order to fund tax breaks for those who need them \nthe least. I support lower taxes. I also support lower Government \nspending. Most Americans do. But at what cost, and for what purpose?\n  What sacrifices in our domestic priorities, our economic security and \nindependence, our humanity are we asking the American people to endure \nso that the wealthiest can pocket a little more income each year, even \nas working class Americans--facing rising fuel prices and health care \ncosts--are pocketing a lot less?\n  And it is not even as if the spending cuts here will fully pay for \nthe tax breaks. The majority's campaign to do away with pay-as-you-go \nrules has meant that the tax breaks over the past 4 years have been \nfinanced by debt. Debt that now exceeds $8 trillion and keeps rising.\n  Debt, not discipline, has been the hallmark of the majority's fiscal \nstrategy. They want us to believe that we can't afford the Government \nwe need. But funding our domestic priorities like education, health \ncare, and equal opportunity for America's children is not inconsistent \nwith budget discipline. In fact, a responsible fiscal policy is a \nprerequisite to tackling the challenges of a relentlessly competitive \nglobal economy.\n\n[[Page S14150]]\n\n  First, ensuring access to basic health care is critical to our \nNation's productivity. But this bill undermines Medicaid and essential \nhealth services for the poor, cutting benefits by $6.3 billion over 10 \nyears.\n  Second, education is the key to economic competitiveness. But this \nbill cuts student loans by $12.7 billion, the largest cut in history. I \ndon't understand how the majority expects middle-class American \nfamilies to make it in the 21st century workforce if we turn our backs \non students.\n  Third, helping people move from dependence to independence, from \npoverty to prosperity is in all of our best interests. And many States \nhave made great progress implementing TANF requirements and moving \npeople from welfare to work. But this bill deprives States of the \nflexibility they need to set realistic and meaningful work targets for \ntheir caseloads. It also dramatically underfunds childcare, thus \nassuring that it will be even more difficult for States and families to \nfulfill the Federal mandates.\n  The TANF program affects millions of American children and families \nand deserves a full and fair debate. Under the rules, the \nreconciliation process does not permit that debate. Reconciliation is \ntherefore the wrong place for policy changes and the wrong place for \nthe proposed changes to the TANF program.\n  In short, the reconciliation process appears to have lost its proper \nmeaning. A vehicle designed for deficit reduction and fiscal \nresponsibility has been hijacked to facilitate reckless deficits and \nunsustainable debt. Instead of being a tool to get us back on track to \ndeal with our serious economic challenges, reconciliation has become a \ntool for enacting tax cuts for the wealthy while punishing the poor.\n  This is a profound disappointment to me. Indeed the entire 2006 \nbudget process has been a disappointment.\n  Mr. President, as we wrap up this session and look towards next year, \nI hope we will find ways to work in a bipartisan manner on the issues \nand choices that really matter to American families. The importance of \nour task and the demand for responsible leadership will only grow in \nthe years ahead.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the conference report on \nspending reconciliation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the budget \nreconciliation conference report. The conference report cuts total \n$39.7 billion versus the Senate proposed $34.6 billion. It reduces \nmandatory outlays for entitlement programs by relying heavily on added \nfinancial burdens on poor, working Americans.\n  This ``deficit-reduction'' effort of cuts in vital programs is offset \nby provisions soon to come which will provide $95 billion in additional \ntax cuts--including cuts to capital gains and dividends rates. The \nconference report will raise $39.7 billion while capital gains and \ndividends tax cuts passed by the House will reduce revenues by $20 \nbillion over 5 years and $50 billion over 10 years. This strategy is \nclearly not reducing the deficit, and it does not justify cutting \nprograms for the poor to benefit the wealthy.\n  This bill is just another step to further the Republican agenda of \nseverely cutting benefits to working-class families while handing out \ntax cuts to the wealthy. The fiscal year 2006 Department of Defense \nappropriations conference report is another illustration of this--this \nbill contains a 1 percent across-the-board cut to discretionary \nprograms totaling $8.6 billion in fiscal year 2006.\n  While Republican leaders had the opportunity to create significant \nsavings in the conference report by reducing prescription drug costs \nand eliminating unnecessary payments to HMOs, they chose not to. This \nbill provides relief for special interests in exchange for greater \nburdens on poor, working families, welfare recipients, and children.\n  Here is an overview of who wins and who loses in this conference \nreport.\n  The conference report fails to include provisions in the Senate bill \nthat would have limited what Medicaid pays for prescription drugs. The \nSenate bill increased the minimum rebates that drug manufacturers are \nrequired to pay the Medicaid Program for drugs provided to Medicaid \nbeneficiaries. The Senate bill also applied the rebates to drugs \nprovided to Medicaid beneficiaries in managed care plans. In total, the \nprescription drug provisions in the Senate bill would have saved $3.9 \nbillion over 5 years and $10.5 billion over 10 years. The conference \nreport eliminates all but a few hundred million of these cuts.\n  Although not in this bill, the drug industry scored another major \nvictory in the fiscal year 2006 Department of Defense conference report \nby being handed broad liability protection even in instances of \nreckless disregard or gross negligence. This egregious provision \nprotects drug companies even when there are criminal violations of FDA \nstandards.\n  I think we can safely say this holiday season will be a merry one for \nthe drug industry. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for poor and \nworking Americans on Medicaid under this bill.\n  The conference report maintains the $10 billion Preferred Provider \nOrganization, PPO, stabilization fund even though 52 Senators voted to \neliminate it and the extremely strong showing of private health \ninsurance participation in the Medicare prescription drug benefit \nobviates the need for it.\n  Even the independent, non-partisan Medicare Payment Advisory \nCommission, MedPAC, recommended, nearly unanimously, that the $10 \nbillion stabilization fund be eliminated because it is unnecessary and \nunwarranted and provides an unfair competitive advantage to PPOs.\n  In total, the conference report contains $1.9 billion in increased \ncopays and premiums for poor families and children in Medicaid. That is \nover 5 years. If you look at the 10-year figure, that amount jumps to \n$10.1 billion.\n  The Senate bill contained no such increases in premiums and copays.\n  In total, the conference report cuts $3 billion that will directly \nimpact Medicaid beneficiaries.\n  What is going to happen to these families once they are required to \npay possibly as much as 20 percent of the cost of each medication they \ntake or 20 percent for each doctor visit with no annual limit on how \nmuch they have to pay out-of-pocket? They simply won't go to the \ndoctor, they won't take their medications, or they will simply not \nenroll in Medicaid at all.\n  For those Medicaid beneficiaries who can no longer afford to stay \nenrolled in Medicaid or choose not to enroll, who wind up in an \nemergency room for their medical care, under this bill there is no \nlimit on what they may be charged, other than a 10-percent limit of the \ncost of service for those who are between 100 percent and 150 percent \nof poverty, which is equivalent to between $9,570 and $14,355 of \nindividual annual income.\n  As under the House-passed spending reconciliation bill, the \nconference report allows providers to deny a service if the patient has \nno ability to pay the charges at the time of services and States can \nterminate Medicaid coverage if the family cannot pay premiums.\n  The conference report allows States to provide any child, without \nregard to income, a lower benefits package than they have today. That \nmeans low-income children, no matter how poor they are, are no longer \nguaranteed vision screenings, eyeglass coverage, therapy services, and \nmedical equipment that would allow them to attend school.\n\n  I am disappointed that the conference report eliminates a provision \nthat Senator Hutchison and I worked hard to get included in the Senate \nbill which protects Medicaid adult day health care services in eight \nStates: California, Texas, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, \nMassachusetts, New Hampshire, and Washington. In California alone, the \nelimination of this provision means that 47,000 seniors and disabled \npeople are at risk of losing community-based health care services.\n  And why are they at risk? They are at risk because of aggressive \nactions by this administration to force California's adult day health \ncare program into a 1915(c) Medicaid waiver which the State of \nCalifornia estimates will make 40 percent of currently eligible program \nparticipants ineligible for the services they receive today. These \nservices include skilled nursing care, physical, occupational, and \nspeech therapy, and nutrition services for low-income, frail elders and \ndisabled adults.\n  The administration is pursuing this despite vocal, bipartisan \nopposition from California's Congressional Delegation. I ask unanimous \nconsent to\n\n[[Page S14151]]\n\nenter into the record two letters from the California delegation to the \nadministration opposing a waiver.\n  Cuts to Federal student loan programs in the conference report will \npush college out of reach for many middle- and low-income families. The \n$12.7 billion reduction over 5 years, nearly one-third of the \nconference report's total cuts, will be the largest cut to student aid \never enacted.\n  This conference report makes it more expensive for students and their \nparents to borrow for college by increasing the interest rates and fees \nthey pay on loans. At the same time, this bill protects private lenders \nat a higher cost to the Government.\n  This is being done as students and families are struggling to pay \nskyrocketing college costs. The average cost of attending a public \nuniversity for 1 year in our country has increased 66 percent within \nthe last decade.\n  Students will be forced to take out more loans to meet the cost of \nincreasing tuition. This will only drive them greater into debt, making \nit even more expensive for students to pursue a college degree.\n  The conference report reauthorizes the TANF Program for 5 years \ndespite overwhelming opposition in the Senate to including TANF \nreauthorization in budget reconciliation. The conference report \ncontains drastically inadequate child care funding and will cost \nCalifornia approximately $350 million more annually as a result of \nchanges to work participation requirements.\n  Lastly, I am deeply concerned about the impact this conference report \nwill have on child welfare in California. This bill, like the House-\npassed bill, reduces Federal foster care supports that help \ngrandparents and other relatives care for abused and neglected \nchildren. It also contains a provision overturning a 2003 Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals decision in Rosales v. Thompson that may harm more \nthan 4,400 foster kids in California alone.\n  Mr. President, the bill before us today represents a victory for \nspecial interests over the interests of our nation's poorest and most \nvulnerable citizens. I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting this \nbill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 29, 2005.\n     Hon. Michael O. Leavitt,\n     Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Leavitt: As Senators representing \n     California, we are very concerned about the future of adult \n     day health care (ADHC) in California due to the recent \n     requirement imposed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \n     Services (CMS) to convert the ADHC program to a 1915(c) \n     waiver. If implemented, this proposal would radically \n     diminish what services are provided. how the services are \n     delivered, and to which populations the services are \n     provided.\n       As you know, ADHC services manage disease and chronic \n     conditions; prevent and reduce hospitalizations, physician \n     and emergency department visits; and maintain or improve \n     health status while permitting the individual to retain \n     important community and familial contacts. The provision of \n     these services is qualitatively equivalent to those provided \n     in institutional long term care environments but less costly \n     than when the same services are provided in such settings.\n       California and seven other states have long been innovators \n     in providing ADHC services as an alternative to institutional \n     long-term care for the frail elderly and disabled. ADHC \n     services have been offered in California and the other states \n     as an optional state plan benefit under Medicaid since the \n     1970's, prior to the introduction of the 1915(c) home and \n     community based services waiver.\n       ADHC services are currently provided to 47,000 participants \n     in California, including the frail elderly, persons with \n     disabilities, persons with Alzheimer's disease and related \n     dementia, persons with developmental disabilities, persons \n     with psychological disabilities and those infected with HIV.\n       In 2003, CMS ordered California to remove ADHC services \n     from the state plan as an optional benefit and offer the \n     services through a 1915(c) waiver. CMS's stated rationale for \n     taking this action is that, despite the provision of these \n     services under Medicaid for more than two decades, they are \n     not defined in the federal statute and therefore must be \n     stopped.\n       Unfortunately, transposing ADHC into a waiver would deny \n     access to these services to many of those within the \n     currently served populations. It is estimated that the \n     transition to a waiver would leave approximately 40 percent \n     without ADHC services in California due to the restrictive \n     rules governing 1915(c) waivers.\n       While seven other states also offer ADHC services as an \n     optional state plan benefit under Medicaid, it is our \n     understanding that to date none of those states have been \n     requested to transform their ADHC services into a waiver. Yet \n     the policies your agency is pursuing make those states \n     vulnerable to the same consequences that are anticipated \n     in California.\n       The action by CMS, attempting to reinvent a program that \n     has worked for more than 25 years and saves the Medicaid \n     program money, is totally contrary to your own stated \n     interest in reducing the institutional bias in Medicaid and \n     encouraging the use of community-based services. Further, it \n     occurs as CMS is launching a new demonstration program in \n     Medicare to allow beneficiaries access to ADHC under the home \n     health benefit.\n       At a time when both your Administration and the National \n     Governors' Association have identified Medicaid's \n     institutional bias as a serious policy problem and are \n     examining options for enhancing home and community-based \n     care, it is puzzling that CMS's Medicaid program is moving in \n     the opposite direction by proposing to dismantle existing \n     ADHC programs and force them into waivers, thereby \n     undermining their effectiveness. Maintaining ADHC services as \n     an optional Medicaid benefit would be consistent with the \n     Administration's New Freedom Initiative and the United States \n     Supreme Court's Olmstead decision, which give priority to the \n     provision of services at home and in the community,\n       We urge you to withdraw CMS's attempt to overturn existing \n     Medicaid policy and thus continue Medicaid beneficiaries' \n     uninterrupted access to ADHC services in California and other \n     affected states. We look forward to your response.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Dianne Feinstein.\n     Barbara Boxer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 29, 2005.\n     Michael O.

Mr. President, I strongly oppose the Deficit Reduction Act \nof 2005 Conference Report. This conference report and the \nAdministration's budget are fiscally irresponsible and reflect \nmisguided priorities.\n  The dual reconciliation process this year illustrates these misplaced \npriorities, as middle- and low-income families are being asked to pay \nthe price for tax cuts for the wealthiest. The second reconciliation \nbill, which will soon be negotiated by the House and the Senate, will \ncontain a reduction of as much as $70 billion in tax revenue that will \nmore than eliminate the effect of the spending cuts to critical \nprograms in the conference report that we are considering today. With \nthe enactment of the two reconciliation bills, there is a real effort \nby this administration and the majority to perform a bait and switch on \nthe American people and at the end of the day the ``so-called'' deficit \nreduction bill along with the tax reconciliation bill will further \nincrease the deficit by as much as $30 billion over the next 5 years.\n  The President's claim at his news conference yesterday that his \npolicies are focused on the priorities of average Americans belies the \nexperience of most working families. The economy has grown this year, \nbut the benefits of that growth continue to show up in the bottom lines \nof companies rather than in the paychecks of workers. The Minority \nViews of the Joint Economic Committee 2005 Annual Report released \nyesterday finds that in the recovery from the 2001 recession, working \nfamilies have been left behind from the start, and they continue to be \nleft behind today.\n  The unemployment rate is nearly a full percentage point higher than \nwhen President Bush took office, about 5 million fewer jobs have been \ncreated in this recovery than at this point after the 1990-91 \nrecession, and millions of Americans who want to work do not have jobs.\n  Higher prices for gasoline, home heating fuel, and medical care are \nalso squeezing the take-home pay of workers. In the past year, average \nhourly earnings are down, after adjusting for inflation. Moreover, wage \ngrowth has been uneven, with low-earning workers hit hardest by \nsluggish wage gains and more recently by declining real wages.\n  The signature policies of the administration and the majority have \nnot addressed the problems facing ordinary American families. \nSuccessive rounds of tax cuts were poorly designed to stimulate job \ncreation and produced a legacy of large budget deficits. Those large \nand persistent budget deficits contributed to an ever-widening trade \ndeficit and massive borrowing from abroad.\n  Most of the benefits of the tax cuts accrued to very high-income \ntaxpayers, while--as this reconciliation bill shows--cuts in programs \nthat benefit middle- and lower-income families are viewed as the best \nway to pay for those tax cuts.\n  As far as health and human service programs go, this bill has gone \nfrom bad to worse as compared to the Senate-passed bill. As expected, \nsignificant portions of the reduction that are achieved in this \nreconciliation bill are achieved by cuts in programs that low- and \nmoderate income Americans rely on. The reconciliation package before us \nincludes roughly $40 billion in spending cuts over 5 years, of which \n$11.2 billion will come from Medicaid and Medicare.\n  Included among these `savings' are new copayments on Medicaid \nbeneficiaries and additional flexibility to States to scale back \ncoverage for certain vulnerable populations. It also tightens rules \ndesigned to limit the ability of elderly people to shed assets in order \nto qualify for nursing home care. And, for the first time, people with \nhome equity of $500,000 or greater would be ineligible for nursing home \ncare under Medicaid.\n  During Senate consideration of the reconciliation bill, I offered an \namendment to restore targeted case management services, TCM, to assist \neligible high-need Medicaid beneficiaries gain access to needed \nmedical, social, educational, and other services. Despite promises that \nthis provision would be corrected, the conference report jeopardizes an \nessential bridge to services for these populations.\n  While low-income Medicaid beneficiaries are bearing the brunt of \nbudget cuts, drug companies and Medicare managed care plans emerged \nvirtually unscathed in the conference report. Specifically, the report \ndrops a Senate provision that would have eliminated the $10 billion \nslush fund to health insurers a key recommendation of the Medicare \nPayment Advisory Commission, MedPAC, because it is unnecessary, \nunwarranted, and provides an unfair competitive advantage to private \nhealth plans over traditional Medicare. Nevertheless, under veto threat \nby the President, the conference report leaves this fund fully intact, \nforgoing $5.4 billion in savings over 5 years and twice that amount \nover 10 years.\n  The bill also shed most of the drug rebate provisions contained in \nthe Senate-passed bill and includes only two minor provisions that \ngenerate savings of only $220 million over 5 years and $720 million \nover 10 years.\n  I would remind my colleagues that this body passed by a vote of 75 to \n16 a Baucus motion to instruct conferees to reject provisions that \nwould undermine Medicaid coverage for pregnant women, the disabled, \nlow-income children, the elderly, or other vulnerable populations. Yet, \nthis conference report entirely ignores the will of the majority of the \nSenate in this area.\n  At the same time, this conference report strikes yet another blow to \ncommunity health care providers who serve Medicare and Medicaid \nrecipients. On the Medicaid side, pharmacy payment reform provisions \ncontained in this bill will be devastating to the Nation's community \nretail pharmacies and could significantly reduce Medicaid recipients' \naccess to their essential services. The provisions cut $6.3 billion out \nof community retail pharmacies payments over the next 5 years by \nreducing the amount that Medicaid pays for generic medications at a \ntime when the program should be doing everything it can to encourage \nutilization of generic medications. Every time a pharmacy dispenses a \ngeneric medication, Medicaid saves about $100, but this report drives \npharmacies to either dispense more expensive medications or simply not \nserve Medicaid customers at all.\n\n  The conference committee also included cuts to Medicare providers \nthat were not included in either the House- or Senate-passed bills. \nUnder the conference report, home health care providers will see their \nreimbursement rates frozen in 2006, in addition to the already \nscheduled .8 percent reduction implemented as part of the Medicare \nModernization Act of 2003. Again, this conference report puts into \neffect the exact opposite policy at a time when the administration and \nStates have made access to home- and community-based care a priority. \nI, along with Senator Collins, had urged the conferees to not consider \nsuch cuts, and I am disappointed that is exactly what the conference \ndid.\n  Another unfortunate provision in this conference report will impact \nindividuals with disabilities who have languished for months waiting \nfor the Social Security Administration to review and approve their \napplications for Social Security Supplemental Income, SSI, and are owed \nback benefits as a result of these delays. They will now have to wait \neven longer under this package. Instead of receiving a single lump sum \npayment as they do under current law, SSI beneficiaries will receive \nback benefits in installments that could stretch out over the course of \na year.\n  This provision means many poor SSI recipients with disabilities who \nhave\n\n[[Page S14153]]\n\nbeen unable to work and who have probably been unable to pay their \nmortgage, heating, and other bills will be forced to endure financial \ndestitution even longer.\n  Another area of concern is the inclusion of the House reauthorization \nfor Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, TANF. This bill adds tough \nnew requirements on States and recipients with no additional funding \nfor child care. The Congressional Budget Office, CBO, has estimated \nthat an additional $11 billion in childcare funding is needed to meet \nthese requirements. Unfortunately, this bill only provides $1 billion \nin additional childcare funding.\n  If my Republican colleagues were truly committed to helping families \nbreak the cycle of poverty, they would not create tough new \nrequirements that States and recipients will be challenged to meet and \nthen provide no additional childcare funding to help them do so.\n  Moreover, the policy goals of this conference report are quite \ndetrimental to States like my home State of Rhode Island. We are a \nleader among States in providing childcare assistance to low-income \nfamilies. We recognize that all working families need help paying for \nchildcare and that high quality early care is the key to the healthy \ndevelopment of our children. Rhode Island has made a commitment to help \nall low-income families pay for childcare, giving equal treatment to \nfamilies on welfare and those who are working but cannot afford the \nhigh cost of childcare. In Rhode Island, we have seen childcare budgets \nrise as Federal investments have remained stagnant. The new TANF work \nrequirements, coupled with inadequate funding for childcare, \njeopardizes my State's commitment to assure that all children have \nsafe, nurturing, and enriching childcare.\n  New harsh requirements will now apply to separate State programs as \nwell, hurting States that have been successful in helping families \ntransition to work through other State initiatives. The Congressional \nBudget Office, CBO, has estimated a cost to States of $8.4 billion over \nthe next 5 years in order to meet these work requirements. This amounts \nto a higher cost to States than even the controversial House-passed \nbill.\n  I want to take this opportunity to remind my colleagues that last \nweek Senator Carper introduced and this body approved by a vote of 64 \nto 27 a motion to instruct conferees not to include the reauthorization \nfor Temporary Assistance for Needy Families in this reconciliation \npackage. I am most troubled that such a vote was ignored, and we now \nface the reauthorization of TANF without allowing the Senate to put \nforth its own bill and have a fair debate on this issue.\n  The reconciliation conference report also includes a $1.5 billion cut \nin Federal funding for child support enforcement efforts over the next \n5 years and $4.9 billion cut over the next 10 years. Some of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle might suggest that these \nchild support cuts are modest, but the fact remains that the CBO has \nestimated that, as a result of these cuts, $2.9 billion in child \nsupport will go uncollected over the next 5 years.\n  In my home State of Rhode Island, 45,000 families rely on the Office \nof Child Support Services for help in securing and maintaining child \nsupport payments. This is an agency that needs more not fewer resources \nin order to continue to make collections efficient. I am baffled that \nthe leadership of this Chamber would cut a program that is cost \neffective, promotes responsibility, and helps families. This program \nhas garnered strong bipartisan support because of its cost \neffectiveness.\n  During consideration of S. 1932, the Budget Deficit Reduction Act, \nthe Senate approved a sense-of-the-Senate amendment offered by Senator \nHarkin, stating that the Senate should not accept any cuts to the child \nsupport enforcement program during this Congress. In addition, last \nweek Senator Kohl introduced and this Chamber passed by a vote of 75 to \n16 a motion to instruct conferees not to include any provisions that \nwould reduce funding for the child support program. How can a program \nthat has this level of bipartisan support receive a $1.5 billion dollar \ncut?\n  This reconciliation conference report also hurts college students by \neliminating the Pro-Gap Program that would have provided $6.5 billion \nin much-needed aid for college students. In its place is a single \nmodest math/science initiative. While I fully support initiatives that \nboost our global competitiveness through encouraging study of math and \nscience, I am dismayed that this bill compromises the successful and \nimportant Pell grant program to do so. For the first time need-based \nfinancial aid under the Pell grant program is tied to curriculum, \nessentially stifling academic freedom for low-income students.\n  Again, I remind my colleagues that last week Senator Kennedy \nintroduced and this Chamber passed by 83 to 8 a motion to instruct \nconferees to insist that the Senate provisions increasing need-based \nfinancial aid, which were fully offset by savings in S. 1932, be \nincluded in the final conference report. I am disappointed that such a \nvote was ignored.\n  In the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, escalating home energy \nprices, and stagnant wage growth, taking money from important Federal \nprograms in order to pave the way for billions of dollars in tax cuts \nshows how out of touch the majority and administration are with hard-\nworking Americans.\n  Unfortunately, there has been no change in the priorities or policies \nof the administration and the majority to address the problems facing \nthe country's most disadvantaged citizens or to help ordinary working \nfamilies.\n  And instead of sound budget policies aimed at preparing for the \nimminent retirement of the baby boom generation, this administration \nand this majority have refused to adopt the kinds of budget enforcement \nrules that helped achieve fiscal discipline in the 1990s and have \nremained committed to extending tax cuts that will add further to the \nbudget deficit.\n  The end result is that policy priorities are distorted and programs \nthat help working families cope in a difficult economy have become \ncandidates for budget cutting in order to fund tax cuts for the \nwealthiest. Meanwhile the problems of large budget and trade deficits \nand the economic insecurity felt by many American families remain \nunaddressed.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I express deep concern about the conference \nreport for S. 1932, the Deficit Reduction bill. Like many of my \ncolleagues, I too have called for fiscal responsibility and restraint \nin government spending. However, my opposition to this conference \nreport is not just based on fiscal restraint, but also against \nmisplaced priorities. I voted against the bill when it first passed the \nSenate because of the draconian message that it sent to the American \npeople, and now we face a package that is worse.\n  We are all conscious that we are heading into the holidays--a time \nfor celebration and reflection. Unfortunately, this is not true for \nsome of us, especially for certain low-income families and individuals \naffected by this reconciliation package. While families who are well \noff sit at their lavishly decorated dining room tables, calculating the \nlargess they enjoy as a result of tax cut extensions advocated by the \nmajority party, other families will sit in stark contrast with spare \nfixings, worry, anxiety, and fear that comes with not knowing how they \nwill survive.\n  The package before us will hit families across the country right in \nthe wallet. The cuts in the conference agreement decrease Medicaid \nbenefits and increase Medicaid copayments and premiums. According to \nthe Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, people living just above \nthe poverty line may experience the most hardship, finding that they \nneed to pay $20 to $100 for health care services that now cost no more \nthan $3. These Medicaid changes, which total roughly $16 billion over \nthe next 10 years, were not included in the original Senate bill.\n  Welfare reform has been pending for several years now, but that is \nbecause the issues are complicated and there exists great contention in \nhow far we want to go to ensure that welfare recipients are fully-\nparticipating members of the workforce. The approach in my State of \nHawaii has been a kinder, realistic approach that works to ensure that \nrecipients have the education, training, and other tools that they need \nto become and remain self-sufficient, for their own good and the good\n\n[[Page S14154]]\n\nof their children. However, the provisions in the reconciliation \nconference report deny the Senate's balanced view on welfare reform and \ninstead adopt some of the most controversial policy changes that will \nimpose major unfunded mandates on States.\n  It makes no sense to eliminate the flexibility States have to design \nwork requirements for those families served wholly by State funds. \nAccording to preliminary estimates, Hawaii would have to increase its \nwork participation rate by 16 percent or bring another 1,600 families \ninto work from FY 2007 and beyond to meet the new standard, or face \nsevere penalties. It also makes no sense to bring more welfare parents \ninto the workforce without ensuring that their children will be \nadequately cared for through appropriate and adequate childcare \nassistance. According to CBPP, under this package, childcare would be \navailable to an estimated 255,000 fewer children in low-income working \nfamilies not receiving cash welfare assistance than in 2004. It is \nunconscionable to do this to our low-income families, particularly \nwithout giving Senators the opportunity for further and adequate \ndeliberation.\n  The conference agreement does not include cuts in food stamps, but \nthat is one of the few bright lights in this package for vulnerable \nfamilies. It also makes significant cuts in child support enforcement \nfunding, Supplemental Security Income, and foster care assistance--none \nof which were included in the original Senate bill. These are clearly \nmisplaced priorities. The better choice would have been to achieve \nsavings by going after special interests catered to by the health care \nindustry, but we are again seeking spending cuts on the backs of low-\nincome families and individuals in our country.\n  Finally, we may say that we are for increasing higher education \nopportunities, but this reconciliation conference report includes the \nlargest cuts to student loan programs in history, a total of $12.7 \nbillion. Some additional assistance is provided for certain students \nwho are eligible for Pell grants, but the most needy students are not \nprioritized and additional hurdles make it difficult to apply for aid \nin the first place. The general Pell population--including about 14,000 \nstudents in my state of Hawaii--have been waiting for an increase in \nthe base grant for several years now, but will have to wait longer \nbecause this conference report does not include that additional help \nfor them to stay in school.\n  For these and other reasons, I strongly oppose the conference report \nbefore us. I cannot vote in favor of a package with such harmful cuts--\nparticularly not this close to Christmas, and particularly not to \nimpact those that need our help the most. Human kindness should abide \nthroughout the year, but particularly at this time of year. This \nconference report simply embodies the opposite message.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, there are many provisions within this \nreconciliation conference report that are deeply troubling to me, but \nat this point, I want to focus my concerns on provisions that undermine \nthe historic 1996 welfare reform bill. That bill changed the old broken \nwelfare system into a new program that encouraged people to work their \nway into self-sufficiency.\n  In 1996, I was an active participant in the controversial but \nbipartisan negotiations to boldly change our outdated welfare system, \nknown then as the Aid to Families with Dependent Children, AFDC. Under \nthe old rules, parents were discouraged and penalized from trying to \nwork. In 1996, after contentious but full bipartisan debate by the \nHouse and Senate, we passed a bold new program called Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families, TANF.\n  The new rules encouraged and required parents to move from welfare to \nwork, but there were incentives to help parents, and billions of new \ndollars in childcare so parents could work with the knowledge that \ntheir child had childcare. Such supports are essential so that parents \ncan make a successful transition.\n  The historic reform of 1996 also made changes in the child support \nenforcement programs, and further enhancements were made in 1998 to \nimprove child support enforcement. While progress has been made on both \nprograms, the child support enforcement has been a real success story. \nIn 1996, child support enforcement collected $12 billion. Thanks to the \nchanges in welfare reform, child support enforcement is now collecting \n$21.9 billion. In the President's fiscal year 2006 budget, the Office \nof Management and Budget, OMB, rated the Federal child support \nenforcement programs among the highest, most efficient programs in all \nof the Federal Government.\n  Despite this record of success, the reconciliation conference cuts \nchild support enforcement by $1.5 billion over the next 5 years and a \n$4.9 billion cut over the next 10 years. These cuts are outrageous \nbecause States use this funding to track down absent parents, establish \nlegally enforceable child support orders, and collect and distribute \nchild support owed to families. CBO has estimated that this loss in \nFederal child support funding will result in $2.9 billion in child \nsupport going uncollected over the next 5 years and $8.4 billion going \nuncollected over the next 10 years. The reality is that children and \nfamilies will be shortchanged. How, in any way, does this lack of \ninvestment promote personal responsibility? The answer is that it does \nnot--in fact, this provision actually undermines past reforms.\n  I want to express my appreciation to Chairman Grassley for his effort \nin forging a bipartisan welfare reform reauthorization bill during \nrecent debates. In March, the Senate Finance Committee secured such \nconsensus that it was able to move the TANF reauthorization package on \na voice vote. On December 14, the Senate voted 64 to 27 on a motion by \nSenator Carper not to include TANF in reconciliation. This amendment \nwas a clear sense of the Senate about the importance of investing in \nchildcare as an essential support for families making the transition \nfrom welfare to work.\n  Despite this bipartisan discussion in the Senate, the welfare reform \nauthorization has been sandwiched into a massive reconciliation \nconference report that we have been given only 10 hours to debate. We \nhave 10 hours to debate on a whole host of issues, many of which, \nincluding welfare reforms, have serious problems that were not part of \nthe original Senate bill.\n  Previous Republican proposals were designed to pressure the States to \nhave at least 50 percent of their TANF families in work activities, \nbut, under these earlier discussions, States would have 5 years to \nachieve these new, tougher standards. The reconciliation package that \nwe are forced to vote on now would impose this new, tougher \nparticipation rate by 2007. And it gets even worse. Under the \nconference report, the Department of Health and Human Services will \nissue new regulations to re-define work activities and how States will \nbe required to verify the hours and activities to avoid serious \nfinancial penalties. These new regulations will be issued in June of \n2006, just a few months before new, tougher standards are imposed. \nAdding insult to injury, very little childcare money is provided--only \n$1 billion over 5 years. The Congressional Budget Office reports that \nthe cost to States of this new bill would be $8.4 billion over the next \n5 years, which is slightly more than the cost would have been under the \nHouse reconciliation bill. CBO projects that some States would not meet \nthe new mandates and would face fiscal penalties as a consequence. This \nis not fair because it essentially sets up States to fail. It will not \npromote work and self-sufficiency among welfare parents. It will \nencourage States to push families off the welfare rolls.\n  West Virginia currently has a 27 percent participation rate. Under \nthese new rules, it would have to reach 50 percent in 2007, and State \nofficials do not even know, at this point, what the rules will be. In \nmy own State of West Virginia, Gov. Joe Manchin has said, ``The \nproposed Federal funding cuts in TANF will greatly impact the families \nand children who depend upon the childcare, transportation assistance \nand welfare-to-work transitional periods. I urge Congress and the \nPresident to reconsider this action. We cannot lose sight of the fact \nthat the individuals affected are those who are the neediest.'' I \nwholeheartedly agree with West Virginia Governor Manchin.\n  In addition to policy concerns raised by this conference report, the \nprocess has been equally unfair. The 774-page conference report on the \nreconciliation spending cut bill was filed in the House of \nRepresentatives at 1:12 a.m. on Monday, December 19. Four hours later,\n\n[[Page S14155]]\n\nafter less than 40 minutes of debate on the measure, the House began \nthe final vote on the reconciliation spending cut bill. Now the Senate \nhas only 10 hours to debate this package with no ability to make \nchanges.\n  This package is patently unfair to our children. It will hinder the \neffort to move parents from welfare to work. It will undermine efforts \nto promote personal responsibility and ensure that parents pay the \nchild support they owe their children.\n  It is unfair to our States to change the rules on welfare reform. \nEven worse, they will be changed just months before States have to meet \nthese new standards.\n  This reconciliation conference report turns its back on \nbipartisanship.\n  It turns its back on needy children and families.\n  It turns its back on personal responsibility.\n  It is the wrong approach to welfare reform, and it should be rejected \nalong with the other cuts in reconciliation.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the budget conference report that is \nabout to be voted on by the Senate decreases access to and \naffordability of needed health care through the Medicaid Program for \nlow-income children, parents, seniors, and people with disabilities \nwhile protecting a $10 billion fund for Medicare private health plans \nthat are already acknowledged to receive payments far in excess of \nMedicare fee-for-service.\n  Clearly, the conferees made the choice to protect private health plan \noverpayments in Medicare while cutting access to care for some of our \nmost vulnerable citizens enrolled in the Medicaid Program.\n  The conference report permit States to cut back on benefits for \nnearly all of the 27 million low-income children enrolled in Medicaid, \nincluding allowing States to restrict and limit benefits even for those \nwith little or no income. The language is ambiguous about whether Early \nPeriodic Screening Diagnostic and Treatment, EPSDT, services, which are \ncritical to ensuring that children have access to all medically \nnecessary services they need, will continue to be provided. Benefits \nthat could be lost include comprehensive developmental assessments, \nassessment and treatment for elevated blood lead levels, eyeglasses, \ndental care, hearing aids, wheelchairs and crutches, respiratory \ntreatment, comprehensive mental health services, prescription drugs, \nand speech and therapy services.\n  While certain populations, like pregnant women, people with \ndisabilities, dual eligibles, and people with long-term care needs, are \nexplicitly protected from benefit reductions, all other children \nenrolled in Medicaid, with the exception of children in foster care, \nare no longer ensured such protections.\n  The conference report also permits, States to reduce Medicaid \nbenefits for many low-income parents and some people with disabilities \nto something called a benchmark package, even if it is bare-bones \ncoverage with minimal benefits. The Congressional Budget Office, CBO, \nhad previously written that it expected a reduction in benefits by 15 \npercent to 35 percent due to this provision. The conference report \nestimates that over $6 billion in cuts will occur to benefits for low-\nincome people in Medicaid.\n  The conference report also allows States to impose substantial cost-\nsharing charges upon Medicaid beneficiaries that will impact millions \nof low-income beneficiaries. Currently, States can generally charge no \nmore than $3 for copayments per service or prescription drugs with \ngroups like children entirely exempt. That is all changed by the \nconference report.\n  For very low-income people, the Secretary would increase the nominal \ncopayments of $3 by the medical portion of the Consumer Price Index, or \nM-CPI, which rises twice as fast as inflation generally. Of course, it \nwill result in sharp rises in cost-sharing for our Nation's most \nvulnerable citizens, which a large body of research indicates will \nresult in having people forgo needed health care services and \nprescription drugs.\n  Meanwhile, beneficiaries with income between 100 and 150 percent of \npoverty could be charged copayments up to 10 percent, and beneficiaries \nwith income over 150 percent of poverty could be charged copayments of \nup to 20 percent of the cost of medically necessary care.\n  Furthermore, providers are allowed to deny care to anyone that cannot \nafford such cost-sharing. There are not even protections for children \nfacing life-threatening conditions and in dire need of medically \nnecessary care, as the language states that it would be incumbent upon \nthe provider to waive the copayment in this case and only if the State \nallows it.\n  It should be further noted that there really are no statutory \nlimitations because even those protections or limitations on cost-\nsharing that I have cited may be waived by the Secretary under the \nconference report.\n  CBO estimates that the conference report will result in $10.1 billion \nin cuts over 10 years resulting from increases in beneficiary \ncopayments and premiums and these reductions are about 90 percent of \nthe size of the cuts in the House package that they previous analyzed. \nIt is important to remind my colleagues what the CBO said about the \nHouse bill, as it so closely mirrors what came out of the conference.\n  As CBO's analysis of the House bill states, ``We estimate that the \nnumber of affected enrollees [due to increased cost-sharing \nrequirements] would increase from 7 million in 2010 to 11 million by \n2015, and that about half of those enrollees would be children.''\n  CBO added that, due to added premiums, ``about 70,000 enrollees would \nlose coverage in fiscal year 2010 and that 110,000 would lose coverage \nin fiscal year 2015 because of the imposition of premiums.''\n  In sharp contrast, the Senate bill had nothing that increased \npremiums or cost-sharing.\n  Without the Medicaid Program, the number of children without health \ninsurance--8.3 million in 2004--would be substantially higher. In fact, \nthe number of uninsured children has dropped by over 300,000 children \nover the past 4 years due in large part to Medicaid and the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP. We should not at this \ntime be taking steps backward by reducing coverage for low-income and \nvulnerable populations, including children.\n  Senators need to fully recognize, understand, and reject what the \nHouse of Representatives and conferees have done with respect to the \nhealth and well-being of children, seniors, and the disabled in their \nbudget reconciliation bill. Our Nation's most vulnerable citizens \nshould not be asked to bear the burden of billions of dollars in budget \ncuts--cuts that are not even being used to reduce the deficit but, \nrather, to help pay for tax cuts.\n  There is also the fact that the conference report will significantly \nrestrict eligibility for nursing home care under Medicaid. The \nconference report adopts most of the punitive provisions in the House-\npassed bill to limit eligibility for long-term care services, but adds \nadditional restrictions so that savings in this area would actually be \n11 percent larger than the House bill and 7 times larger than the \nSenate bill.\n  There are numerous problems with the provisions in this section that \nI do not have time to address today, but I would like to ask unanimous \nconsent to place into the Record a letter from AARP expressing concern \nabout these provisions, that CBO estimates will cut $6.5 billion out of \nnursing home spending over the next 10 years. It should be noted that \nthese figures are just Federal amounts and that if you add State cuts \nin spending that there are billions and billions more in cuts to \neligibility and services to Medicaid beneficiaries.\n  In addition, I also want to raise another major problem that I asked \nconferees to address and was highlighted by my introduction of S. 2074, \nthe Medicaid Indian Health Act. That legislation would have exempted \nAmerican Indians and Alaska Natives, AI/ANs, and Indian health programs \nfrom those provisions and changes being proposed to Medicaid that will \nall have devastating consequences for Native Americans.\n  Unfortunately, the conference report failed mightily in this regard. \nIn fact, there is not even a mention of Native Americans or Indian \nhealth program in the legislation despite the fact the Federal \nGovernment's responsibility for Indian health, the uniqueness of the \nIndian health care system, and the serious health problems of Indian \npeople require that protection of access to health care services for \nNative Americans be reflected in Federal Medicaid\n\n[[Page S14156]]\n\npolicy. Failure of the conferees to address this fact will have \nsignificant harmful consequences for American Indians and Alaska \nNatives.\n  For example, the budget conference report would allow States to \nimpose cost-sharing on Medicaid beneficiaries similar to and at even \nhigher levels than those allowed under the SCHIP program, with the \nstated policy objective of achieving more appropriate utilization of \ncored services. This objective, however, would not be achieved at \nIndian Health Service, IHS, or Indian tribal health facilities, as \nthese programs do not charge their American Indian and Alaska Native \npatients for health care. Rather, imposition of premiums and copays \nwould produce the following unintended--and very harmful impact--on the \nIndian health system:\n  Medicaid enrollment of AI/ANs who are eligible for coverage is \nalready low, since the IHS user population receives health care without \ncharge at IHS and tribal facilities. The financial barriers imposed by \nassessment of Medicaid premiums would further depress AI/AN enrollment. \nDecreases in Medicaid enrollment would deprive already-underfunded \nIndian health programs of vital Medicaid revenues on which they are \nheavily dependent.\n  The imposition of copayments will not change utilization habits of \nIndian Medicaid beneficiaries because IHS and tribal providers do not \ncharge copays to their Indian patients. Copay amounts would be simply \ncost-shifted to the Indian health programs, causing a further reduction \nin the services they can offer, and reducing the resources they need to \npurchase contract health care.\n  These reductions in resources available to the Indian health system \nwill decrease the health services they can provide and cause further \ndecline in the health status of Indian populations. Everybody voting on \ntoday's package should be fully aware of that fact.\n  In addition, the budget reconciliation bill would, for the first \ntime, allow States to offer different Medicaid benefit packages to \n``individuals within one or more groups of individuals'' in the State \nby requiring enrollment in ``benchmark'' or ``benchmark-equivalent'' \nMedicaid coverage. This authority would allow a State to reduce the \namount, duration and scope of Medicaid benefits to many beneficiaries. \nThe Indian Health Service, which is now funded at less than 60% of need \nand is heavily dependent on Medicaid payments, would be decimated by \nany reductions in Medicaid-covered services.\n  While States receive 100% FMAP for Medicaid services provided in an \nIHS or tribal facility, those facilities have limited capabilities and \nare not able to directly supply all needed care. When the IHS or tribal \nfacility must refer an Indian Medicaid beneficiary to a private or \npublic provider, the State must pay the regular State Medicaid match. \nThus, States would have an incentive to limit the benefits AI/ANs \nreferred to outside providers could receive under the State Medicaid \nplan.\n  If Native Americans stay within the IHS system and the benefits are \nnot covered, this is simply yet another cost shift to Indian health \ncare programs.\n  As part of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 1976 report, the \nCongress said, ``The most basic human right must be the right to enjoy \ndecent health. Certainly, any effort to fulfill Federal \nresponsibilities to the Indian people must begin with the provision of \nhealth services. In fact, health services must be the cornerstone upon \nwhich rest all the other Federal programs for the benefit of Indians. \nWithout a proper health status, the Indian people will be unable to \nfully avail themselves of the many economic, educational, and social \nprograms already directed to them or which this Congress and future \nCongresses will provide them.''\n  The Federal Government has a ``Federal trust responsibility'' to \nIndian people that it is simply not fulfilling. This budget conference \nagreement is yet another example of this failure and should be rejected \nfor this reason, as well as the negative consequences that it will have \non low-income children, senior citizens, and people with disabilities \nacross this Nation.\n  Finally, although I do not have the time today to talk at length \nabout the problems with the Medicare provisions, I will say that I am \nvery disappointed and deeply concerned about the $8.1 billion in home \nhealth cuts that have been included in the conference report. It is \nalso disturbing that the conferees would choose to add a provision that \nwas in neither the House nor Senate bills to cut $3 billion out of the \nMedicare disproportionate share hospital, DSH Program, which provides \nfinancial assistance to our Nation's safety net hospitals. These cuts \nwill undoubtedly have negative consequences on safety net hospitals \nacross the country. With 46 million uninsured people in our country, it \nmakes little sense to be cutting our Nation's safety net providers at \nthis time.\n  This is all about choices. The Senate reconciliation bill contained \nthe same level of savings in Medicaid and Medicare without all of these \nprovisions that will certainly have negative consequences on millions \nof people served by Medicaid and Medicare. The conferees had before \nthem the choice of protecting vulnerable, low-income citizens or to do \nthings such as protecting the interests of private health plans.\n  For example, such cuts were added in conference to help pay for \ndecisions such as the dropping of savings that had been obtained in the \nSenate bill by such things as elimination of what is known as the \nhealth plan ``slush fund.'' This $10 billion fund was created in the \nMedicare prescription drug bill to encourage participation by private \nhealth plans, but the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, MedPAC, \nalmost unanimously recommended its elimination and the Senate bill had \nincluded such savings.\n  The dropping of such reasonable cost savings out of the conference \nreport has clearly left low income people to pay the price through \ncost-sharing increases and benefit restrictions that will undoubtedly \nhave negative consequences on the health and well-being of our Nation's \nmost vulnerable citizens enrolled in Medicaid.\n  I would also like to express my opposition to section 1101 of this \nbudget reconciliation conference report the Senate is now considering.\n  I am disappointed the budget reconciliation bill includes a 2-year \nextension of the Milk Income Loss Contract, or MILC, a wasteful subsidy \nthat primarily benefits dairy farmers in only a few states. I helped \nlead the opposition in the Senate in 2002 when this new dairy subsidy \nprogram was created as part of the farm bill. The MILC program has \nalready cost taxpayers over $2 billion. I strongly oppose extending it \nfurther.\n  The Milk Income Loss Contract Program expired on September 30, but \nthis conference report extends it for 2 years at a cost to the \ntaxpayers of almost $1 billion. I oppose the extension because I \nbelieve this MILC Program is basically unfair and unnecessary.\n  Since the subsidy payments began in 2002, almost half the MILC \npayments--about $950 million--has gone to producers in only four \nStates, Wisconsin, New York, Pennsylvania, and Minnesota. In fact, 20 \npercent of the payments, over $410 million, went to producers in just a \nsingle state, Wisconsin. The other half of the Federal payments is \nshared among all the remaining 46 States.\n  California, on the other hand, by far the nation's largest dairy \nstate, isn't even among the top four in Federal MILC payments. \nCalifornia's dairies produce 20 percent of the nation's milk but get \nonly about 7 percent of the payments. Idaho is 4th in dairy production, \nbut 12th in MILC payments. How can anyone say that is a fair and \nequitable use of the taxpayers' dollars? Dairy producers my State of \nNew Mexico rank 7th in the Nation in milk production but are 28th in \nFederal MILC payments.\n  Some of the supporters of this $1 billion boondoggle say that dairy \nfarmers need a safety net. However, I hope all Senators know dairy \nproducers already have a safety net, one that has been in place for \nover 50 years. It's called the Federal Price Support Program, and it \nwas extended in the 2002 farm bill. So this $1 billion program subsidy \nprogram is really just a case of some dairy farmers trying to double \ndip at the taxpayers' expense.\n  Another argument I have heard is that MILC helps the family farms. \nNearly all dairies in this country, regardless of size, are family \nfarms; that\n\n[[Page S14157]]\n\nis, owned and run by families. The families who run New Mexico's \ndairies are strongly opposed to extending MILC.\n  Finally, a recent study by the U.S. Department of Agriculture shows \nthe MILC program actually lowers prices paid to diary farmers. This \nshouldn't be a surprise to anyone, it is just basic economics. Taxpayer \nsubsidies invariable lead to excess production, which pushes prices \ndown. In my opinion, this is a simple case of an unnecessary and \ncounterproductive program that should have been left to die.\n  I understand President Bush made a campaign promise last year to \nsupport extending the MILC Program. But at hearing on October 27 in the \nSenate Finance Subcommittee on International Trade, where I am a \nmember, the deputy trade representative, Ambassador Allgeier, stated \nthe administration would prefer MILC not be extended because of the \npossible impact on the President's ongoing world trade negotiations. \nMILC is a huge trade-distorting subsidy, and extending it now sends the \nwrong signals to our trading partners.\n  I didn't sign the conference report, and I plan to vote against this \nbudget reconciliation bill because I do believe this bill is a missed \nopportunity to establish spending priorities and deal with the nation's \nburgeoning deficit.\n  This bill sets aside $1 billion for an unnecessary subsidy to benefit \nmainly Northeast and Midwest dairy farmers, while at the same time \nmaking deep cuts to essential health care and housing initiatives. \nAgriculture spending for farmers and ranchers has had to be cut an \nextra $1 billion to pay for the MILC subsidy. Our country is in deep \nfinancial trouble which requires us to make difficult choices and set \npriorities. In my view, we have laid out the wrong priorities in this \nbill.\n  Decisions that cost the taxpayers a billion dollars shouldn't be made \non the basis of partisan politics. Section 1101 in this reconciliation \nbill will cost taxpayers $1 billion over the next 3 years. That means \n$1 billion more that has to be borrowed; another $1 billion added to \nthe deficit.\n  New Mexico's family-owned dairies are some of the most efficient in \nthe Nation, and they should be free to compete without this costly and \ntotally unnecessary subsidy program. I do believe it is bad policy to \nput an extra $1 billion of the taxpayers' money into this unnecessary \nMILC subsidy.\n  Groups that oppose this 2-year extension of the MILC subsidy include \nthe International Dairy Foods Association, the American Conservative \nUnion, Americans for Tax Reform, Citizens against Government Waste, \nFreedom Works, and the National Taxpayers Union.\n  In addition to the letter from AARP previously mentioned, I ask that \nletters expressing major concerns and opposition to the conference \nreport from 35 organizations that are part of the Consortium for \nCitizens with Disabilities, the American Cancer Society, the National \nCouncil of La Raza, and an organization representing 2,500 police \nchiefs and other law enforcement leaders be printed in the Record.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that a recent article opposing extending \nMILC by Thomas Schatz, president of the Council for Citizens Against \nGovernment Waste, and John Berthoud, president of the National \nTaxpayers Union, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                         AARP,\n\n                                                December 19, 2005.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Majority Leader Frist: AARP strongly opposes the \n     budget reconciliation conference agreement scheduled to come \n     before the Senate for a vote today. Rather than reflecting \n     the rational provisions of the Senate reconciliation bill, \n     the final conference agreement is irresponsible policy.\n       The final conference agreement does not ask for shared \n     sacrifice to achieve budgetary savings. Rather it protects \n     the pharmaceutical industry, the managed care industry, and \n     other providers at the expense of low-income Medicaid \n     beneficiaries and Medicare beneficiaries who will foot the \n     bill.\n       AARP members and your other constituents will question why \n     members of the Senate would vote for a bill that would:\n       Make it harder for Americans needing long-term care to \n     qualify for Medicaid;\n       Force some Americans to forfeit their homes in order to pay \n     for long-term care services;\n       Require all Medicare Part B beneficiaries to pay higher \n     premiums;\n       Reopen the MMA, not to make improvements in the new drug \n     benefit, but to require those with more income to pay higher \n     Part B premiums sooner; and\n       Force low-income Medicaid recipients to pay more for their \n     care--and if they cannot afford to do so--to potentially be \n     denied care entirely.\n       The conference agreement systematically undermines the \n     critical protections built into both the Medicaid and \n     Medicare programs. If the conference agreement becomes law, \n     then over the course of the next few weeks and months we will \n     make sure that our members across the country fully \n     understand the impact of this conference agreement on them \n     and on their families.\n       We urge the Senate to oppose the reconciliation conference \n     package and urge Congress to instead return to the fair and \n     responsible policies of the original Senate package.\n           Sincerely,\n     William D. Novelli.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           Consortium for Citizens\n\n\n                                            With Disabilities,\n\n                                                December 20, 2005.\n       Dear Senator: We are writing as members of the Consortium \n     for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD). We strongly urge you to \n     opposes the budget reconciliation conference report because \n     of the serious harm it would cause the 9.2 million children \n     and adults with disabilities and others who rely on Medicaid \n     for essential health and long-term services. Unlike the \n     Senate-passed budget reconciliation package, the conference \n     report achieves budget savings in ways that would weaken \n     critical Medicaid protections upon which people with \n     disabilities and other low-income beneficiaries rely. This \n     includes cost-sharing provisions that will only lead to \n     necessary services being denied and effectively punishing \n     people with disabilities who have extensive health and long-\n     term services needs. Changes to the EPSDT requirement can \n     only lead to a bifurcated system that will impose formidable \n     barriers for children in Medicaid trying to access the full \n     range of covered services. The home- and community-based \n     services provisions permit enrollment caps and waiting \n     lists--the very policies that currently prevent Medicaid from \n     meeting the needs of all people with disabilities otherwise \n     eligible for community services. The asset transfer policies \n     also go beyond the consensus reforms in the Senate bill and \n     will make it harder for some seniors with disabilities to \n     qualify for Medicaid--even if they do not have substantial \n     incomes or were not purposefully divesting assets to qualify \n     for Medicaid.\n       CCD is also very concerned about the negative impact of the \n     TANF provisions on people with disabilities and oppose the \n     inclusion of these provisions in the conference report.\n       While we are supportive of the Family Opportunity Act and \n     the Money Follows the Person demonstration, these provisions \n     alone do not justify supporting a Medicaid and TANF reform \n     package that is excessively harmful to people with \n     disabilities.\n       Sincerely,\n       Academy for Educational Development\n       American Association on Mental Retardation\n       American Association of People with Disabilities\n       American Foundation for the Blind\n       American Congress of Community Supports and Employment \n     Services\n       American Council of the Blind\n       American Network of Community Options and Resources\n       American Therapeutic Recreation Association\n       APSE: The Network on Employment\n       Association of University Centers on Disabilities\n       Brain Injury Association of America\n       Council of State Administrators of Vocational \n     Rehabilitation\n       Easter Seals\n       Epilepsy Foundation\n       International Association of Business, Industry and \n     Rehabilitation\n       LDA, Learning Disabilities Association of America\n       Lutheran Services in America\n       National Alliance on Mental Illness\n       National Association for the Advancement of Orthotics and \n     Prosthetics\n       National Association of Social Workers\n       National Association of School Psychologists\n       National Association of State Head Injury Administrators\n       National Disability Rights Network\n       National Down Syndrome Congress\n       National Mental Health Association\n       National Organization of Social Security Claimants' \n     Representatives\n       National Spinal Cord Injury Association\n       NISH\n       Paralyzed Veterans of America\n       Research Institute for Independent Living\n       The Arc of the United States\n       Tuberous Sclerosis Alliance\n       United Cerebral Palsy\n       United Spinal Association\n       Volunteers of America.\n                                  ____\n\n\nAmerican Cancer Society Speaks Out Against Conference Report Provisions \n   That Increase Cost Sharing and Limit Benefits in Medicaid Program\n\n                                                 December 19, 2005\n       Dear Senator: The American Cancer Society is disappointed \n     in House passage of provisions in the Reconciliation Spending \n     Cuts\n\n[[Page S14158]]\n\n     Act Conference Report (H.R. 4241) that will have an adverse \n     impact on access to care for Medicaid beneficiaries who have \n     cancer or are at high risk for cancer. Specifically, we are \n     deeply concerned about the provisions which achieve budget \n     savings by increasing cost sharing and putting benefits \n     packages at risk. We urge the Senate to stand up for a \n     reconciliation package that minimizes the negative impact on \n     beneficiaries by deleting these provisions, as reflected in \n     the Senate bill (S. 1932).\n       Cancer is a disease where up front financial costs are \n     substantial, timely treatment is absolutely critical upon \n     diagnosis, and treatment modalities vary widely. We know that \n     access to screening and quality cancer care can have a \n     substantial impact on outcomes. Therefore policy changes, \n     such as imposing undue financial barriers or reducing \n     benefits that inadvertently limit Medicaid beneficiary access \n     to screening, treatment, and follow up care can be a \n     particular problem for those with cancer.\n       The Society is greatly concerned about cost-saving \n     provisions in the conference report that seek to secure most \n     of its required savings by eliminating the guarantee of \n     coverage, increasing cost sharing and allowing for changes in \n     benefits packages that could negatively impact those who are \n     most vulnerable--particularly low-income individuals with or \n     at greatest risk of chronic diseases such as cancer. We \n     believe that Medicaid beneficiaries' existing access to \n     specialty services and covered cancer protections, including \n     ``optional'' benefits like screenings, cessation services, \n     and prescription drug coverage, should be protected, and not \n     diminished.\n       The Congressional Budget Office estimated that much of the \n     savings from these provisions in the conference report would \n     be achieved by beneficiaries foregoing critical health \n     services or participation in coverage altogether. The Senate \n     has voted in the past to achieve its savings through both the \n     Medicare and Medicaid programs by limiting fraud, waste, and \n     abuse, and by reducing drug prices and other payments--\n     savings which are less likely to hurt beneficiaries. The \n     Senate again expressed its intent to protect beneficiaries in \n     overwhelmingly passing a Motion to Instruct on Medicaid last \n     week. The Society stands in support of this bipartisan \n     approach for achieving cost-savings while protecting access \n     to care for Medicaid beneficiaries.\n       The Medicaid program plays a significant role in providing \n     access to cancer prevention, screening and early detection, \n     treatment, and follow up care for the nation's most \n     vulnerable populations, and we applaud Congress for providing \n     this safety net for Hurricane survivors.\n       While we recognize the fiscal constraints faced by states \n     and the federal government in controlling overall health care \n     costs in addition to administering the Medicaid program, we \n     believe that reforms must be achieved while continuing \n     quality coverage and comprehensive access for cancer patients \n     and those at risk for cancer in the Medicaid program. \n     Therefore, we ask that you support provisions that maximize \n     protection of Medicaid beneficiaries and delete provisions \n     that increase cost sharing, jeopardize benefits, and \n     eliminate the guarantee of coverage. If you have any \n     questions, please contact Kelly Green Kahn, Senior Federal \n     Representative at 202-661-5718.\n           Sincerely,\n     Daniel E. Smith,\n       National Vice President, Federal and State Government \n     Relations.\n     Wendy K. D. Selig,\n       Vice President, Legislative Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  National Council of La Raza,\n\n                                                December 19, 2005.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the National Council of La Raza \n     (NCLR), the largest national Hispanic civil rights and \n     advocacy organization in the United States, I write to \n     strongly urge you to oppose current budget reconciliation \n     legislation, the ``Deficit Control Act of 2005'' (S. 1932). \n     This budget reconciliation would cut vital programs that were \n     established to protect the economic security of low-income \n     families, including Latinos.\n       S. 1932 will move our nation in the wrong direction. In the \n     past, when hardworking Latino families faced economic \n     hardship, they could count on temporary relief such as \n     Medicaid or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) to \n     sustain their households until they could ``get back on their \n     feet.'' The reconciliation package would weaken the ability \n     of federal programs to provide effective services that help \n     Americans move up the economic ladder by cutting services, \n     increasing costs to beneficiaries, or severely compromising \n     program structure.\n       Today there are more than 41 million Hispanics in the U.S.; \n     more than 19 million are in the labor force making \n     contributions to the nation's prosperity and economic growth. \n     With respect to federal budget and tax priorities, six in ten \n     (61%) of registered Latino voters say they would rather pay \n     higher taxes for a government to provide more services. \n     Three-quarters (74%) say the government is spending too \n     little on education and a similar share (76%) say we as a \n     country should spend more to provide health insurance for \n     everyone who needs it, even if it means raising taxes. Yet, \n     Congress is following the opposite route. In addition, this \n     proposal would bring us no closer to a balanced budget.\n       More troubling, the budget reconciliation proposals \n     continue to be described, in some cases, as an effort to pay \n     for disaster relief and in others as must-do legislation to \n     reduce the federal budget deficit. While NCLR agrees that \n     providing relief to disaster victims and improving the budget \n     deficit are critical, we believe that the budget \n     reconciliation package would shift the burden to other low-\n     income families while failing to balance our nation's budget. \n     To close the deficit gap, Congress should seriously consider \n     strategies to raise revenues. Tax cuts increased the budget \n     deficit; low-income families should not now have to pay for \n     them.\n       Much is at stake for Latinos in this budget reconciliation. \n     We hope that the Senate will send a clear message to Latinos \n     and all Americans that Congress is serious about enhancing \n     life opportunities for working families. This budget \n     reconciliation package fails to send that message. Thus, NCLR \n     urges you to VOTE ``NO'' on the budget reconciliation \n     package. NCLR will recommend that the National Hispanic \n     Leadership Agenda include votes associated with this \n     legislation in its Congressional Scorecard.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Janet Murguia,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Fight Crime: Invest in Kids,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 19, 2005.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the 2,500 police chiefs, \n     sheriffs, prosecutors, and victims of violence who constitute \n     the anticrime group, Fight Crime: Invest in Kids, we urge you \n     to support investments in kids proven to reduce crime, and \n     reject proposed bills--which may be considered sometime \n     today--that would reduce those investments. The research \n     confirms what the law enforcement leaders of Fight Crime: \n     Invest in Kids have seen on the front lines; investments in \n     kids like safe foster care homes for abused and neglected \n     children, high-quality early care and education, and \n     comprehensive screenings and treatment through Medicaid help \n     prevent later crime and violence.\n       We thus urge you to reject the House/Senate Conference \n     Report on Reconciliation (S. 1932), expected to be considered \n     later today by the U.S. Senate, which--unlike the original \n     Senate-passed S. 1932--would cut low-income, at-risk kids' \n     access to Medicaid, foster care and child care assistance.\n       Also, we urge you to reject the Defense Appropriations \n     conference report--to be considered by the Senate in the next \n     day or two--which would make indiscriminate (so-called \n     ``across-the-board'') cuts that would, in 2006, leave 25,000 \n     more low-income at-risk children out of Head Start, and would \n     deny 11,000 more low-income at-risk kids the assistance their \n     parents need to access quality child care.\n       Please reject these two fiscally-shortsighted conference \n     reports, which would reduce children's access to proven \n     programs that cut crime, save lives and save money.\n       Medicaid\n       Unlike the original Senate-passed S. 1932, the \n     Reconciliation Conference Report would cut many low-income \n     children from the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and \n     Treatment (EPSDT) program that can help reduce later \n     delinquency. Currently, EPSDT provides comprehensive early \n     screening and treatment to help identify and treat behavioral \n     and emotional problems and mental illnesses while children \n     are young, preventing more serious problems later that \n     increase a child's risk of involvement with the juvenile \n     justice system. Studies show that behavior problems in young \n     children are linked to later antisocial behavior. For \n     example, an estimated 7 percent or more of preschoolers have \n     levels of disruptive, aggressive behaviors severe enough to \n     qualify for a mental health diagnosis and approximately 60% \n     of these children will later manifest high levels of \n     antisocial and delinquent behavior. Eliminating the state \n     requirement to offer EPSDT services would limit at-risk kids' \n     access to proven treatment that can help keep them on the \n     right track and away from the road to crime.\n       The Reconciliation Conference Report would limit kids' \n     access to mental health treatment that can reduce the risk of \n     repeat involvement with the juvenile justice system, Medicaid \n     pays for over 50% of public mental health services, helping \n     cover evidence-based, intensive individual and family therapy \n     programs. For example, Functional Family Therapy (FFT) works \n     individually with troubled, delinquent youths to change their \n     behavior and break the peer connections that lead to crime. \n     FFT cuts re-arrest rates in half, while saving money; the \n     public saves over $26,000 for each youth treated. By \n     eliminating the EPSDT benefit guarantee for many low-income \n     children, the Reconciliation Conference Report would also \n     allow states to adopt benefits packages that would clearly be \n     inadequate for many at-risk children in need of intense \n     mental health intervention. For example, in Colorado, kids \n     could be limited to 20 outpatient mental health visits per \n     year. Mental health treatment under Medicaid helps kids get \n     the care they need, while making our communities safer.\n       Unlike Senate-passed S. 1932, the Reconciliation Conference \n     Report would eliminate affordability guarantees for millions \n     of children on Medicaid (those with incomes just above the \n     poverty line), leaving low-income children subject to new and \n     sometimes unaffordable costs that experts expect will\n\n[[Page S14159]]\n\n     prevent these children from receiving necessary care. \n     Currently, federal law exempts Medicaid-eligible children \n     from cost-sharing and premiums. As a result, low-income \n     children covered by Medicaid are even more likely than low-\n     income children with private insurance to have a well-child \n     visit, helping ensure that children get off to a good start \n     in life. Participation in health insurance programs has been \n     shown to drop to fewer than one in five eligible people when \n     premiums reach the levels allowed under this proposal) \n     however, suggesting that fewer children would receive needed \n     care--care that prevents crime and saves money.\n       Foster Care\n       Unlike Senate-passed S. 1932, the Reconciliation Conference \n     Report would limit the ability of relatives to care for \n     abused and neglected children in need of a safe foster care \n     home, increasing pressure on the already inadequate number of \n     non-relative foster care homes and potentially leaving more \n     children in dangerous homes. Reversing the Rosales court \n     decision would limit federally IV-E foster care reimbursement \n     to some relatives who can now receive these reimbursements. \n     The proposal would also limit federal Title IV-E funds for \n     case management and other services for children living with \n     relatives under certain circumstances. This cut in federal \n     foster care support will decrease the likelihood of safe \n     foster care homes being available for all of the abused and \n     neglected children who need them, resulting in re-abuse and \n     later crime.\n       The Reconciliation Conference Report would put new limits \n     on funding that would restrict states' ability to support \n     prevention services for kids ``at imminent risk of removal \n     from the home'' and limit caseworkers'' ability to perform \n     crucial case management roles. Limiting the ability of states \n     (under certain circumstances) to support prevention services \n     for kids at high risk of entering the foster care system \n     would increase child abuse and neglect and foster care \n     placements, as well as later crime. Restricting caseworkers' \n     ability to help with family reunification and other case \n     management when children are transitioning between foster \n     care and juvenile institutional placements would place an \n     additional burden on the already underfunded juvenile justice \n     system, diverting funding that would otherwise support \n     effective violence prevention programs for at-risk kids and \n     intervention programs for kids who have already committed a \n     criminal or delinquent act.\n       Early Care and Education\n       Unlike the original S. 1932, the Reconciliation Conference \n     Report ''Child Care and Development Block Grant'' (CCDBG) \n     provisions would cut 255,000 low-income children from child \n     care in 2010 (compared to 2004). The Defense Conference \n     Report would, this year alone, deny tens of thousands of low-\n     income at-risk kids access to CCDBG and Head Start. CCDBG and \n     Head Start support the type of quality early childhood care \n     and education programs that have been proven to prevent \n     children from turning to crime. For example, a study of the \n     High/Scope Perry Preschool program showed that three- and \n     four-year-olds from low-income families who were left out of \n     the program were five times more likely to become chronic \n     offenders by age 27 than those who were in the program, and \n     the program saved $17 for every $1 invested. The \n     Reconciliation Conference report provides such a small \n     increase in CCDBG funding over five years that it doesn't \n     account for: (1) inflation; (2) increased work requirements \n     in the proposed Temporary Assistance to Needy Families \n     reauthorization; (3) the need to increase quality; or (4) \n     current unmet need (only 1 in 7 eligible children is now \n     served). The two Conference Reports. together, would limit \n     CCDBG and Head Start funding, thus preventing hundreds of \n     thousands of children from receiving quality early childhood \n     care that can help them become productive citizens rather \n     than criminals.\n       We urge you to reject conference reports that include any \n     of these harmful provisions. Cutting Medicaid, foster care \n     and early care and education now will only lead to higher \n     crime rates and far greater criminal justice system \n     expenditures down the road. The United States Senate must not \n     allow a rush-to-adjournment to result in enactment of bad \n     laws. Your constituents--and the Nation--deserve better.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Miriam A. Rollin,\n     Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                        Deal Milks Taxpayers Dry\n\n                (By Thomas A. Schatz and John Berthoud)\n\n       The dairy-farm lobby is at it again. With the assistance of \n     several key lawmakers, the industry is using must-pass year-\n     end legislation to gain additional subsidies.\n       The latest shenanigans involve the milk income-loss \n     contract (MILC), a costly program that expired Sept. 30.\n       The dairy lobby's objective is to resurrect the MILC \n     program by attaching it to the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, \n     which is supposed to reduce spending by about $50 billion \n     over the next five years. Adding insult to injury, the House \n     Republican leadership is making back-room deals to help the \n     dairy lobby secure its subsidy.\n       To garner the votes necessary to pass the Deficit Reduction \n     Act, Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) promised a \n     number of Republican lawmakers that he would ``instruct House \n     conferees to secure an extension of a MILC program through \n     September 2007.'' This would be accomplished by receding to \n     the Senate, which included a renewal of the MILC program in \n     its version of the Deficit Reduction Act. The failure to vote \n     upon down on the program in the House is a betrayal of the \n     taxpayers.\n       Congress did the right thing when it allowed the MILC \n     program to expire at the end of September. During its \n     existence, the MILC scheme perpetuated economic distortions, \n     created inefficient markets and unnecessarily harmed \n     taxpayers and consumers.\n       When MILC was created as part of the 2002 farm bill, the \n     Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the four-\n     year price tag would be ``only'' $1.3 billion. Since the \n     program's inception, however, taxpayers have been tapped for \n     more than $2 billion. Now, the estimate for a scaled-back, \n     two-year version of MILC is $998 million. If the CBO is as \n     wrong now as it was in 2002, this new two-year concoction \n     will cost taxpayers closer to $1.5 billion.\n       Whether the actual cost turns out to be $1 billion or $1.5 \n     billion or even more, there is no justification for bringing \n     the MILC program back to life, particularly as part of the \n     Deficit Reduction Act. Taxpayers have already taken too many \n     forced trips to this milking machine.\n       The industry is currently subsidized through the dairy-\n     price support program, which cost taxpayers an average of \n     $500 million per year from fiscal year 1999 to fiscal year \n     2004 for the purchase of surplus products.\n       The absurdity of MILC is evident in its own past history. \n     Even the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which \n     oversees the program, agrees that the costly subsidies simply \n     aren't working and have produced unfortunate and unintended \n     consequences.\n       A comprehensive study released by the USDA last year \n     concluded that the MILC program leads to expanded output \n     through production-linked subsidies. Then, incongruously, the \n     federal government purchases the surplus milk production \n     caused by the MILC program through the price supports. In \n     short, taxpayers shell out for the same unneeded milk not \n     once but twice.\n       The MILC program was based on the failed Northeast Dairy \n     Compact, which was also the product of a back-room deal, and, \n     like the late price cartel, MILC primarily benefits certain, \n     less efficient dairy farms.\n       In rewarding and perpetuating such inefficiency, the MILC \n     program is not just expensive for taxpayers but at the end of \n     the day is simply bad, backward policy. Particularly at a \n     time of staggering federal deficits, it would seem hard to \n     justify spending an additional $1 billion to resuscitate a \n     program that never worked in the first place.\n       Aside from the problems inherent in the program itself, \n     using the Deficit Reduction Act to reconstitute MILC is \n     another example of the way in which Washington has grown ever \n     more beholden to special interests. After all, legislation \n     that would have extended the MILC program failed to move \n     ahead earlier this year in either the House or the Senate. \n     Attempting furtively to funnel MILC into legislation that is \n     meant to save tax dollars, not squander them, is deplorable \n     and pathetic.\n       After more than 70 years of meddling in the U.S. dairy \n     industry, Congress was right to begin phasing out our \n     convoluted system of antiquated subsidies by allowing the \n     MILC program to sunset. They ought at least to protect this \n     victory for taxpayers by keeping the menace of MILC out of \n     the Deficit Reduction Act.\n       More important, the House leadership ought to show \n     taxpayers respect, rather than using deficit-reduction \n     legislation to create new government programs and making \n     back-room deals that milk the taxpayers dry.\n\n\n               revisions to payments for therapy services\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I would like to raise an issue of \nclarification regarding section 5107, Revisions to Payments for Therapy \nServices. It is my understanding that this provision retains the \ntherapy limitation of $1,740 for outpatient physical therapy and \nspeech-language pathology and $1,740 for outpatient occupation therapy \nbut provides an exception process for services that are needed by a \nbeneficiary over this amount. This exception process is expressly to \npermit services above the cap that are medically necessary. Mr. \nPresident, I ask the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee whether \nthis interpretation is correct.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this is correct.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. In addition, there should be no delay in implementing the \nexceptions process. CMS should work diligently to develop a process to \ndetermine whether a service is medically necessary. This process could \ninclude a ``code modifier'' and standard audit review of medical \nnecessity and reflect similar processes that currently exist. It is my \nunderstanding, based on the language, that if CMS does not develop a \nprocess, a request for therapy services will be deemed medically \nnecessary if CMS does not act on the request within 10 business days. \nFurther, the language also appears to permit a beneficiary to request \nmedically necessary coverage outside the caps at the\n\n[[Page S14160]]\n\noutset of treatment. If CMS does not develop a process and fails to act \nwithin 10 business days, then the beneficiary can receive covered \ntherapy services in excess of the cap. I would hope that further \ninformation from CMS regarding the exceptions process is laid out as we \napproach January 1, 2006, when the therapy caps go into effect. Senator \nGrassley, do you agree with these statements?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree that CMS needs to develop a process to permit \nmedically necessary Part B therapy services that exceed the cap in a \ntimely manner. I also believe that this process should not result in \nthe delay of needed therapy services. I would hope that CMS would \nprovide an outline as to how they envision the exceptions process to \nwork so that beneficiaries needing therapy services beyond the $1,740 \ncaps receive the therapy they need if medically necessary.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in follow-up with respect to the \neducation provisions in the conference report on the pending bill, it \nis important to note that the Senate bill included $6 billion for Pell \ngrants, to do more to ensure that every talented student who has the \nopportunity to go to college can afford to do so. In addition, the \nSenate bill included a further $2 billion for college students studying \nmath and science.\n  By contrast, the conferees' bill reduces spending in the student loan \nprograms by $13 billion and allocates only $3.75 billion to new grant \naid. That's $13 billion in tax giveaways for the wealthy and only a \nmeager $3.75 billion increase in grants to help students go to college.\n  It gets worse. In order to receive the funds that are available, \nstudents must jump through multiple hoops. As a result, only a very \nsmall percentage of students will ever see the aid. In fact, based on \nan analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, our estimates show only \nabout 10 percent of the students who currently receive Pell grants will \nreceive additional assistance under this bill--hardly a commitment to \neducational opportunity for all students.\n  We need to provide incentives for students to study math and science. \nBut it makes no sense to do so at the expense of other students. As the \ncost of college rises and Pell grants remain stagnant, it's wrong to \ntake $13 billion in savings from the student loan program and not give \na single penny to 90 percent of the students struggling to make it \nthrough college.\n  Senator Gregg pointed to the loan forgiveness provisions in this \nconference report. I strongly support those provisions and urged their \ninclusion in the Senate bill. But these provisions are merely an \nextension of current law. They ensure that we won't now eliminate the \nincentive we've been providing for teachers who agree to teach in high-\nneed fields in high-poverty schools. Loan forgiveness is an extremely \nimportant program, but it does nothing for the almost 170,000 college-\nready students, who each year fail to go to college because they can't \nafford the upfront costs of doing so. These students need additional \ngrant aid--even if they choose to be teachers and not scientists and \nengineers.\n  Senator Gregg also said that the fixed interest rate structure in \nthis conference report will cost students $5 billion. In fact, the \nfixed interest rate structure actually saves about $6 billion more than \nthe variable rate structure proposed by Senator Gregg and included in \nthe House bill.\n  Instead of the variable interest rate capped at 8.25 percent, as \nproposed by Senator Gregg, the Senate bill kept the current law \nstructure of 6.8 percent fixed rate, which is obviously better for \nstudents than an 8.25 percent rate. The Federal Reserve has increased \ninterest rates in each of its last 13 meetings. The Senate bill was \ndesigned to protect more students from the current trend of increasing \nrates.\n  I had proposed a variable rate capped at 6.8 percent--the option \nsupported by the student groups. But our Republican colleagues refused \nto accept this option.\n  Many of us wanted to do even more for students than we achieved in \nthe Senate bill. Instead, we were forced to find $7 billion in \nsavings--now $13 billion in this final version--so that this Republican \nCongress and the Bush administration can provide greater tax giveaways \nto the wealthy.\n  Our Senate bill opened the doors of opportunity for many more young \npeople. We took the fat out of bank profits and put most of it back \nwhere it belongs--helping the nation's neediest students. This \nconference report puts an additional $6 billion into tax cuts for the \nwealthy--on top of the $7 billion in the Senate bill--while doing \nnothing for 90 percent of those struggling to pay for college. Those \nare the wrong priorities, Mr. President, and I very much regret that \nour Republican colleagues have insisted on turning a good Senate bill \ninto a shameful retreat on aid to college education.\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate convenes on Wednesday, December 21, it immediately resume debate \non the conference report to accompany S. 1932; provided further that \nall time be considered expired under the statute other than 5 minutes \neach for the chairman and ranking member; further, that following that \ntime, Senator Conrad be recognized in order to raise a Budget Act point \nof order against the conference report and that immediately after the \npoint of order is raised Senator Gregg be recognized in order to make a \nmotion to waive.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the vote on the \nwaiver, Senator Conrad be recognized to make a further point of order \nand Senator Gregg be recognized immediately in order to move to waive \nfor his point of order; provided that the only Byrd rule points of \norder in order be from the list that is currently at the desk and that \nif both points of order are waived, the Senate proceed to a vote on the \nadoption of the conference report, with no intervening action or \ndebate; further, that if either motion to waive is rejected and the \nChair sustains either point of order following the votes on the motions \nto waive, the Senate then immediately vote on the motion to concur in \nthe House amendment with the Senate amendment as provided under the \nBudget Act, again with no further intervening action or debate, and \nthat there be 4 minutes equally divided before each point of order \nvote.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I direct \nthese remarks as much to myself as to all other Senators.\n  Tomorrow is an extremely important and very difficult day. I ask all \nSenators to be patient, not be upset if things don't go the way they \nthink they should. It is going to be a hard day tomorrow. With a little \nbit of good luck, we should be able to finish everything tomorrow. But \nI hope all Senators would understand that getting to the point where we \nare is very difficult. And tomorrow, I hope everyone will, as I have \nsaid, be considerate of others and try to move through this with the \nunderstanding that we are all trying to get out of here. Everyone \nunderstands that there are a lot of things going on. We are also doing \nthe people's business, and we need to focus attention on that.\n  I have no objection.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, just on the \none point we probably need to clarify, that after the point of order I \nmake, Senator Gregg be recognized to make a motion to waive, that our \nunderstanding is that would be a motion to waive on the specific items \nwhich I have raised.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank my colleague, and I thank the Chair. I will not \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will return later tonight to make further \nannouncements about the schedule for tomorrow. I wish to emphasize what \nthe distinguished minority leader has said. There will be a lot of \nvotes tomorrow. We will begin voting around 10 minutes after 9 \ntomorrow. Thereafter, we are going to have a whole series of votes, \nwith the goal of getting people out sometime tomorrow. It is going to \ntake everybody's patience and cooperation. We will start bright and \nearly. I will have more to say on that later.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S14161]]\n\n                         Defense Appropriations\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, tomorrow morning we will consider the \nDefense appropriations conference report with very little debate. It is \nan important measure. Earlier I came to the floor to speak about one \naspect of the bill which relates to drilling in the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge. It is a large bill, about 1,000 pages. It contains \nmany things. I would like to address the other elements that are \nincluded in that bill.\n  This conference report provides $453 billion in defense spending, \nmoney for body armor, armored vehicles, protective equipment for our \ntroops that they need and haven't always had. The conference reports \nincludes $1 billion for equipment for National Guard and Reserve units.\n  In Illinois, our National Guard units have been forced to leave their \nequipment behind in Iraq for use by the units that follow. Other \nStates' National Guard and Reserve units have done the same. Leaving \ntheir equipment thousands of miles away makes it difficult to train our \nguardsmen in my State and many others. It also makes it harder for \nGuard and Reserve units to respond to civilian disasters here at home. \nWe saw that in Hurricane Katrina. I voted for the Leahy amendment, \noffered by the Senator from Vermont, to increase funding for Guard and \nReserve equipment by $1.3 billion. I am pleased that most of this \nfunding is included in this final conference report.\n  The bill also adds $10 million for the Rock Island Arsenal to ensure \nthat this important military-owned-and-operated facility is ready to \nmake the equipment our troops need when they need it. That Rock Island \nArsenal proved its value to America when we needed to retrofit the \nhumvees with armor plating to protect our troops. The men and women of \nthe Rock Island Arsenal worked 24/7 to meet that need. It provides $20 \nmillion to purchase or refurbish the heavy construction equipment \nneeded by the Navy Seabees and Army Guard and Reserve engineer units. I \nam proud that we make this gear in Illinois.\n  It includes more than $20 million for upgrades to Navy and Marine \nCorps FA-18 fighter aircraft because our pilots deserve the best \nequipment there is. This conference reports also includes $29 billion \nfor Katrina disaster relief. It is important to note that not one dime \nof this $29 billion is new money; $5.1 billion is from the 1-percent \nacross-the-board cuts in this bill as well as other rescissions. The \nrest, $23.4 of the $29 billion total, was already earmarked for FEMA. \nFEMA programs are being cut to pay for Katrina relief. Would you \nbelieve that this conference reports actually cuts FEMA's preparedness, \nmitigation, recovery, and response programs by $2 million? It cuts \nFederal programs, funds for programs such as catastrophic planning and \nplanning for mass evacuations. It is hard to imagine, in the wake of \nHurricane Katrina, that we are reducing spending in this bill for \nplanning for mass evacuations. God forbid we face another one in the \nnear future.\n  Inadequate resources clearly was not the only reason FEMA was \noverwhelmed by Katrina. The main reason was cronyism and incompetence \nat the top. But does anyone seriously believe that cutting FEMA's \ndisaster prevention and preparedness programs is the right way to \nrespond to Katrina? It isn't. Of the $29 billion for Katrina relief, \none-tenth of that total, $2.9 billion, is for Army Corps of Engineers \nprojects including levee repairs. I am glad the administration has \nacknowledged the need for the Federal Government to take the lead to \nrebuild the levees. Homeowners can't rebuild, business owners won't \nrelocate until New Orleans' levees are safe and rebuilt.\n  Let's be clear, $2.9 billion is a very small downpayment on what is \nneeded to rebuild the levees and restore the wetlands. Estimates of \nwhat it will cost range from $18 billion to $32 billion to reach \ncategory 5 hurricane protection. Restoring the wetlands could cost an \nadditional $18 billion. As any good environmental engineer will tell \nyou, strong levees and restored wetlands are needed to fully protect \nNew Orleans and the surrounding areas. In his nationally televised \nspeech from New Orleans' Jackson Square in mid-September, President \nBush promised the Federal Government would help New Orleans and \nLouisiana make the flood protection system stronger than it has ever \nbeen. The $2.9 billion in this bill is a small downpayment on that \npromise. We will look for the next installment next year.\n  The President should also make it clear right now that New Orleans' \nlevees will be rebuilt to withstand a category 5 hurricane. If we don't \nwant New Orleans to turn into a permanent ghost town, the people have \nto know that it is safe to return. Assurance from the President would \nmake that difference.\n  What is missing in this bill? Unfortunately, several critically \nimportant provisions have been stripped out behind the closed doors of \nthe conference committee. Let me tell you one that has become a \nperennial. The Reservist Pay Security Act, which the Senate has now \npassed four different times--I have sponsored this bill and it passed \nin the Senate four different times--is one of the measures that should \nbe in this bill but always gets stripped out in conference. The same \nSenators who stand here and vote proudly for it can't wait to get \nbehind closed doors and strip it out. Four straight years. What is it \nabout? When Guard and Reserve members of top companies such as Sears, \nGM, and Home Depot are called to active duty, companies they work for \nmake up their difference in pay. They can worry about defeating \nterrorism and don't have to worry about missing mortgage payments.\n\n  Thirty State governments do the same thing. They believe their \nworkers who sacrifice to defend America are worth a helping hand. I \nintroduced the Reservist Pay Security Act with a bipartisan team of \nRepublicans and Democrats in the Senate, including my lead cosponsors \nSenator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, Senator George Allen of Virginia, \nLindsey Graham of South Carolina, and others who believe the Federal \nGovernment should make the same commitment to the troops that other \nemployers make. One out of every ten Guard and Reserve members is a \nFederal employee. Yet they don't have the same salary and income \nprotection as those in the private sector. How can you possibly explain \nthat? How can we say, as a Federal Government, we won't stand behind \nour troops when the private sector does, when State governments do, \nwhen local governments do?\n  Again and again that is passed on the Senate floor. We pat ourselves \non the back and it heads to the conference committee and disappears. \nThink about this: The Department of Defense hands out awards to \ncompanies that stand behind the Guard and Reserve. The Federal \nGovernment should hand out a demotion to those in the Senate who \nconsistently vote for this on the floor with a big smile on their \nfaces, head to the conference committee and kill it every time. If they \nthink they are getting even with me, that isn't what it is about. It is \nabout helping our troops.\n  On a bipartisan basis, Members of the Senate have said it is time to \nget this done. This bill doesn't do it. The Department of Defense \nclaims that it would cause disparity and discord if an activated \nreservist is being paid more than an Active-Duty soldier. Active-Duty \nsoldiers don't stand around comparing pay stubs and what they are \nmaking back home. The Reservist Pay Disparity Act doesn't create \ndisparities, it reduces them, by ensuring fewer soldiers have to \nsacrifice a substantial part of their income to serve the Nation. We \ntalk all the time about supporting our troops. It is interesting, we \nsupport it when there is a rollcall on the floor. When it gets to the \ndarkness of a conference committee, that support has been taken out \ntime and time again.\n  I hope we will have a chance to pass this in the next session. I will \noffer it again. This time I hope the conference committee will give us \na helping hand instead of turning its back on our guardsmen and \nreservists.\n  I am also deeply disappointed this defense conference report contains \nno relief funds for farmers who suffered serious income losses this \nyear because of drought and other natural disasters. The year 2005 was \na tough year for farmers from coast to coast. Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita, the drought in the Midwest, the flooding in the upper Midwest, \nall of these things have taken their toll on my State and so many\n\n[[Page S14162]]\n\nothers. Year in and year out we have had a disaster assistance program \nfor farmers. This year we need it and we need it badly in Illinois and \nmany other States. When Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota offered a \n$1.6 billion amendment in the conference committee to restore the \ndisaster assistance program, it was defeated on the House side. The \nHouse Republican leadership refused to agree to an agriculture disaster \nassistance relief program. That is unfortunate. I hope that the \nCongressmen who represent farming areas will come back to Washington \nafter the first of the year and encourage their colleagues to pass \nthis.\n  We need it so a lot of farmers will have the resources they need to \nget back to work and back to farming this next year. What is also \nmissing is this: At least 300,000 innocent people have died in the \ngenocide in Sudan. The number may be 400,000. Nobody knows for sure. \nTwo million people have been driven from their homes and 500 people die \nevery day in refugee camps. We missed an important opportunity to stop \nor slow down that genocide in this conference report. We refused to \nhelp the work of the African Union Mission in Sudan in this bill. The \nUnited States provides approximately $8 million a month in support of \nthe African Union Mission in Sudan. That amounts to one-third of their \ntotal funding. These funds are vital to the African Union peacekeeping \ntroops in Darfur.\n  The Senate included $50 million in our version of the bill, the \nForeign Operations appropriations bill, to support the African Union, \nwhich was dropped in conference. Secretary Rice said these funds are \ncritical. She requested they be included in this Defense appropriations \nbill. The Secretary noted the State Department already had to reprogram \n$13 million that was intended to train the new Afghan Army and use it \ninstead for our commitments in Africa.\n  United States funds for Africa will run out January 1. Without \nadditional funding, the State Department will have to choose between \ndiverting funds from other important priorities and making this \ngenocide situation worse in Darfur. I will quote from Secretary Rice in \na letter she sent to Congress:\n\n       We now face a critical juncture in supporting the African \n     Union Mission in Sudan. . . . Through reprogramming of other \n     peacekeeping monies, the administration has found a way to \n     fund our contribution to AMIS through the end of this year. \n     But the FY2006 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act provided \n     no funding for this peacekeeping mission. We are in critical \n     need of funding to continue this mission at a robust level \n     into 2006.\n\n  She continued:\n\n       To meet ongoing operational costs and to provide adequate \n     logistical and communications support, we are seeking at \n     least $50 million for AMIS.\n\n  She went on to say:\n\n       I have discussed this matter with others in the \n     administration and can assure you that taking immediate \n     action to meet this unanticipated expense is of the highest \n     priority.\n\n  Those are her words--``highest priority.''\n  Despite the urgency of the situation, the House Republican leaders \nremoved the funds for the African Union Mission in Sudan from this \nconference report.\n  Just a few weeks ago, I was with Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas in \nRwanda. We stayed in that hotel in the movie ``Hotel Rwanda.'' That was \nthe hotel that 11 years ago was a refuge for Rwandan victims of the \ngenocide. At the direction of the manager of that hotel, he managed to \nsecrete away and protect hundreds of people who otherwise would have \nbeen hacked to death and killed in the Rwanda genocide.\n  I remember that genocide as a Member of the House of Representatives, \nbecause my senior Senator and close friend, the late Paul Simon, was \none of the few Senators to speak out. He said to the Clinton \nadministration: What is going on in Rwanda is terrible. Whether you \ncall it a genocide or not, with a few American troops, we can bring \nstability to the area and save innocent lives. Senator Simon's request \nfell on deaf ears. The Clinton administration did not respond and the \ngenocide continued.\n  The death toll, when it was all over, is estimated at 800,000 people. \nI went to a Catholic church a few blocks away from this hotel in \nRwanda. The church looked like an ordinary church, filled with people \nwho came to worship at 6 a.m. in the morning. I learned later that a \nthousand people were hacked to death in that church. They came in there \nfor refuge. They were, unfortunately, turned over to the rebels and \nkilled on the spot. They thought they were saving a church.\n  That is what genocide is all about, the wanton killing of people. \nPresident Bill Clinton, when he does his assessment of his \nadministration and lists the liabilities or negatives, is usually going \nto put at the top of the list his failure to respond to the Rwanda \ngenocide. He deeply regrets the fact that our Nation didn't speak up \nand stand up to stop that genocide.\n  Fast forward now 9 or 10 years to the situation in Darfur in Sudan. \nWe have a new President, George W. Bush; we had a new Secretary of \nState, Colin Powell; and now it is Condoleezza Rice. They were able to \nsay the word about Darfur in Sudan which the Clinton administration \nwould not say about Rwanda. They said we are dealing with a \n``genocide.'' That is a word you have to use very carefully. It has \nhappened rarely in the history of the world, but when it has, it has \nhad cataclysmic consequences. So our administration, our Government, \nour country has declared that a genocide is occurring in Darfur in \nSudan. The obvious question to us and those people around the world who \ncare is: What are we going to do? We have not committed any American \ntroops. Maybe we never will, but at the least we should be supporting \nthe African Union troops who are trying to bring order there on the \nground.\n\n  This bill we are going to consider tomorrow took out the money for \nthese African Union troops, despite the pleas of Secretary of State \nRice, despite the knowledge that we are dealing with a genuine genocide \nwhere innocent people are being killed, raped, and displaced every day. \nWe could not find $50 million in a multibillion dollar budget to keep \nthese troops there to protect the poor people in this region. It is \nunthinkable, yet it is a fact.\n  Earlier this year, the Senate unanimously approved the Darfur Peace \nand Accountability Act, calling for the rapid expansion of the African \nUnion force. That legislation stated that if the AU Mission fails to \nstop the ongoing genocide, ``the international community should take \nadditional . . . measures to prevent and suppress acts of genocide in \nthe Darfur region.''\n  In recent months, the violence has worsened. Some aid groups are \nleaving the region because of security concerns. Even the African Union \ntroops have been the target of violence.\n  With the resurgent violence of Darfur, the Sudanese Government and \nits partners, the jingaweit militias, appear to be testing the resolve \nof the African Union, the West, and the United States of America. Not \nproviding these funds--$50 million for troops to protect these innocent \npeople--is inexcusable. It is a signal to the perpetrators of these \natrocities that we cannot be bothered. We cannot afford to come up with \n$50 million to stop a genocide.\n  Mr. President, $50 million for AMIS won't resolve the crisis there, \nbut it will enable the African Union to maintain its current size and \nscope of operations. It would allow this Nation, America, to stand on \nthe right side of history against the repression and genocide in \nDarfur.\n  How can we in good conscience vow ``never again'' and then cut the \nfunds needed to keep that promise? How can we watch genocide in our own \ntime and refuse to do what is needed to stop it? What if a God-fearing, \ncaring Nation such as America declares there is a genocide and does \nnothing? That is what we are up against in this bill.\n  I hope that men and women of conscience in the Senate on both sides \nof the aisle, as soon as we return in January, will do something \nimmediately to provide the assistance they need in Darfur to provide \nthe African Union the support they need.\n  I spoke earlier about ANWR. I will not go into that any further, \nother than to say it is truly unfortunate that a bill of this \nimportance and this magnitude is being dragged down the road in an \neffort to provide this giveaway to the State of Alaska and to oil \ncompanies. Of all of the things we should be doing, this is the last--\nto be drilling for oil in a wildlife refuge set aside almost 50 years \nago to be protected for generations, so some oil company can make a \nprofit and the State of Alaska can end up benefiting.\n\n[[Page S14163]]\n\n  This conference report contains also a huge gift of nearly unlimited \nimmunity for the pharmaceutical industry, one of the wealthiest \nindustries in America. When I first came to Congress, I would have to \nsay the strongest lobby on Capitol Hill in the 1980s was the tobacco \nlobby. You could not beat them. I know because I tried several times \nunsuccessfully before I passed a bill banning smoking on airplanes. It \nwas the first real loss they ever had on the floor of the House. And \nwhen it came to the Senate, Senator Lautenberg led the fight here and \nwe won. It made the news because nobody beat them. The tobacco lobby \nwas unbeatable. Now they have been replaced as the king of K Street. \nThat distinction now goes to the pharmaceutical industry. Hardly a bill \npasses through here where the pharmaceutical industry and drug \ncompanies don't end up getting some little favor that has been offered \nby the majority in the Senate.\n  The Republican leaders in Congress exploited in this bill a real need \nto push through a big favor for wealthy special interests. To prepare \nfor a potentially deadly breakout of avian flu, Senate Democrats, \nincluding Senators Obama, Harkin, Reid, Kennedy, and others, sought \ntwice to add as much as $7.9 billion for the avian flu prevention and \nresponse efforts.\n  In response, the President requested $7.1 billion for avian flu. This \nconference report provides $3.8 billion for avian flu, a little bit \nover half of what the President requested. How in the world will we \nanswer our critics when they come forward and say, Did anyone speak out \nhere in the face of this potential devastation from avian flu, that the \nfunding in this bill was inadequate to the task? We know it is in \nCongress; the President knows it is. But when it comes to the \nconferees, they have decided: Let's save some money here. It is a false \nsavings if this pandemic strikes the United States and endangers the \nlives of innocent citizens.\n  It also includes something that was not in the President's plan nor \nin the Senate Democrats' plans, and that is where the pharmaceutical \ncompanies come in again. It includes sweeping immunity protections that \nwould shield pharmaceutical companies from legal responsibility, even \nwhen their mistakes result in injury and death.\n  In the middle of the night, after conferees were assured that the \ncontroversial liability immunity provision would not be included in the \nbill, after the report had been signed, after all of that, the \nRepublican leadership added 47 new pages to the bill.\n  These new liability protections are not limited to avian flu vaccine, \nwhich is what the press releases said. Oh, it is all about creating a \nmarket for new vaccines to be made. Nope. These immunity provisions are \nso broad that they include drugs such as Tylenol, Advil, even Vioxx.\n  The Republican proposal would shield the drug industry from legal \naccountability for sickness, disability, and even death resulting from \nvaccines, drugs, and other products. The only exception is in cases of \nwillful misconduct. Do you know what it takes to prove willful \nmisconduct? You have to prove a drug company knew its product would \ninjure or kill someone and went ahead and sold it anyway.\n  That is an unrealistically high standard, and it just means fewer \npeople will have a day in court. If that is not bad enough, even if a \ndrug company acts with willful misconduct, it is still shielded from \nimmunity unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services or the \nAttorney General initiates an enforcement action. If no such action is \ntaken, a drug company could knowingly kill hundreds or thousands of \nAmericans and still not be held liable.\n  There are other loopholes. The Secretary of Health and Human Services \ncan declare an emergency at any time. These declarations would also \nshield drug companies from legal accountability. They are not subject \nto appeal or to independent judicial review. This bill overrides State \nlaws.\n  Supporters of this proposal claim it establishes a compensation fund \nfor victims. However, the fund is operated under regulations \nestablished by the Secretary alone. It includes caps on compensation. \nThere is no guarantee Congress will provide sufficient funds to make \ncertain that victims receive any compensation. It could turn out to be \nnothing more than empty promises.\n  Think about the fact that virtually anyone in America, with two \nexceptions now, is held responsible for the products they sell. And if \nthose products cause harm to individuals, they can be held accountable. \nThat kind of standard is used for all of America and for all \nbusinesses, for the products, the goods and services they sell.\n  Just a few months ago, we decided to create the first exception. We \ndecided that people who manufacture firearms should not be held \nresponsible if those firearms injure someone or kill them. That is \nright, firearms. The gun lobby came in here, pushed the bill through, \nand the President signed it gleefully. Now comes the next one, the \npharmaceutical industry, that they will not be held liable for the \ndrugs and vaccines they sell in the ordinary course of business if they \nhave been negligent in preparing those drugs or misrepresenting what \nthose drugs will do to the American public.\n  Let's get down to business. None of these protections in this bill \nare really needed. The Federal Government already has authority to \nwaive liability during a public health crisis. That authority is part \nof the President's pandemic influenza plans. These protections are not \nneeded to lure drug companies into the vaccine. This is a lucrative \nmarket. Roche, the company that makes Tamiflu, estimates that sales of \nits antiviral will reach $1 billion this year, four times the 2004 \nlevel--$1 billion. And we are building into this law protections for \ndrug companies that are so profitable when, in fact, they are not being \nheld as accountable as other businesses.\n  Other biotech firms are competing to develop improved vaccines and \nsee their stock value soar in the process. The most profitable sector \nin the American economy has scored another big one. It is Christmas on \nK Street for drug company lobbyists. I am sure there are big parties \nthis week as they can't wait for this bill to be signed into law and \nescape liability.\n  Why has this bill been stuck into this conference report at the last \nminute? Here is a hint. Big PhRMA, the pharmaceutical companies, is the \nsingle largest influence operation in Washington today. They spent $123 \nmillion lobbying Congress in 2004, according to the Center for Public \nIntegrity. Since 1998, pharmaceutical companies have contributed $87 \nmillion to Federal candidates, nearly all Republicans, but not \nexclusively, according to the same center. This is the worst kind of \nspecial interest dealmaking.\n\n  It is unfortunate that, once again, we are saying to the American \npeople that we are creating a special class in America--a class of \nbusinesses that cannot be held accountable for their wrongdoing.\n  We are also saying to the victims of their wrongdoing: Sorry, you \ncan't go to a jury in your neighborhood and in your community and ask \nthem to judge whether you have been wronged improperly.\n  A third provision that ought not to be included in this bill is in \nthe Katrina relief package. It would create the first national \neducation voucher program. Under this proposal, a disproportionate \nshare of school funding would go to private and religious schools at \nthe expense of public education. At the same time, the bill removes all \nprohibitions against using Federal money for religious education and \nsectarian activity.\n  Using public education dollars for religious purposes is contrary to \nour Constitution, it is contrary to the feelings of most Americans, and \nit is contrary usually to the will of the Senate. The Senate version of \nthe Katrina education proposal, which I supported, and I know Senator \nLandrieu supported it as well, contained assurances that Government \nfunds would not be used ``for religious instruction, proselytization, \nor worship.'' That language was stripped out of the House bill.\n  This is a sad pattern in Congress. For example, the House version of \nHead Start reauthorization would repeal the longstanding civil rights \nprotections that prohibited Head Start teachers and staff from being \ndiscriminated against based on their personal religious belief.\n  House amendments to the Workforce Investment Act would also repeal \nthe important civil rights protections that prevent employment \ndiscrimination based on religion.\n\n[[Page S14164]]\n\n  In the same manner, there is no language in the House conference \nreport that bans schools that receive these funds under the Katrina \nrelief provisions from practicing employment discrimination. If the \nprivate and religious schools refuse to hire people who don't share \ntheir religious belief, according to this bill, that is just fine.\n  The bill also says if your family is forced from your home because of \nHurricane Katrina, and your child is now attending a religious school \nbecause it is the only option available where you are now living, your \nchild will receive religious instruction unless you opt out. It places \nthe burden on the parents. Yet there is no language in this bill \nrequiring that parents and students be notified of the right to opt out \nof religious instruction.\n  We can have a debate about using public school dollars for private \nand religious schools, but to use an unprecedented disaster to in a \nbackhanded way include religious school vouchers in the Federal budget \nwithout adequate public debate is just wrong. When you combine these \nback-door cuts to public schools, the 1-percent across-the-board \nreductions in educational programs designed to help poor children and \nchildren with disabilities, this bill makes a mockery of the promise to \nleave no child behind.\n  There was recently an editorial, a column in the Chicago Tribune on \nMonday, written by Dennis Burns, in which he was arguing for the \nteaching of intelligent design in public schools. He believes \nGovernment should require that to be taught. He argued that faith-based \nbelief is not inconsistent with science, and he felt the Government \nshould step in and make it clear that you can include religious \neducation as part of a public school curriculum.\n  What was interesting was the column next to it. It was a column by \nCharles Krauthammer, and it was about the President of Iran. If you \nhave been following the lunatic ravings of the President of Iran about \nthe fact that he believes there was no Holocaust and he believes that \nthe Israelis have no right to their own homeland, you will find that \nhis crazed beliefs are grounded in his strong religious convictions.\n  That tells us for a moment of the wisdom of our Founding Fathers, who \nunderstood the important necessity of separating church and state in \nAmerica.\n  Our Constitution is explicit. It says that one has the right to \nbelieve what they want to believe, and if they want to believe in no \nGod, they have that right in America, too. It is a matter of personal \nconscience. I believe they were absolutely right in that regard.\n  The second thing they said is this Government will not choose a \nreligion, this Government will not have an official religion. That, \ntoo, was a very incisive and wise observation by those who founded this \ncountry.\n  I hope that many people who are now trying to force religious issues \ninto appropriation after appropriation and issue after issue should \nconsider for just one moment what they are doing. This time of year, \nwhen many of us turn to our religious belief to enrich this holiday \nseason, I hope that everyone will say a little prayer that the \nintelligent design of the Constitution of the United States of America \nwill be respected by the Congress.\n  Finally, this conference report includes a 1-percent across-the-board \ncut in all Federal programs except veterans and spending on the wars in \nIraq and Afghanistan. Managing the Federal budget is supposed to be \nabout making responsible and moral choices. A calculator can cut \neverything by 1 percent, but not every line item in the budget is of \nequal importance. We have been sent here to use some judgment. Cutting \nevery program is an abdication of responsibility and no way to manage a \nbudget.\n  We could spend hours listing examples of why this thoughtless \napproach to budgeting is bad government, but in the interest of time, I \nwill simply highlight a few, based on the Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities.\n  To really understand what these across-the-board cuts mean to the \npeople and the programs, we need to compare this year's funding with \nthe 1-percent cut to the funding level in 2005 adjusted for inflation. \nThat is the budgetary baseline of the Congressional Budget Office.\n  When we look at the funding levels we have already appropriated and \nin some cases already cut for each program in 2006 and then impose an \nadditional 1-percent cut, the results are troubling. Let me go through \nthem quickly. In education, a 1-percent cut in elementary and secondary \neducation amounts to $1.2 billion cut in education for poor children, \nspecial education, school improvement efforts, and vocational and adult \neducation. Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa today told us that this is the \nfirst time we have lost ground in special education in recent memory. \nWe will have less money to educate the children who are born with \nspecial needs and disabilities. In my State of Illinois, we will lose \n$49 million for those kids.\n  A 1-percent cut in child and family services means $350 million less \nfor Head Start, less for services for abused and neglected kids, less \nfor adoption-related services, less for abstinence education, less for \nservices for homeless children and other programs. Funding for early \neducation and health care through Head Start will be cut by $195 \nmillion, and that means 25,000 more children will not be included in \nHead Start next year. Childcare development block grants helping lower \nand moderate-income families afford childcare face a 1-percent cut, \nmeaning 11,000 fewer children from low-income families, working \nfamilies, trying to make sure their kids are in a safe environment, \nwill not be helped because of this 1-percent cut. In my State of \nIllinois, we will lose $16 million.\n  In housing, the section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program is the \nFederal Government's main rental assistance program for low-income \nfamilies. A 1-percent across-the-board cut means approximately 65,000 \nfewer low-income households receive rental assistance next year. Think \nof the struggle of working families in lower income categories to find \ndecent housing. Section 8 is one of the fewer programs that helps them. \nWe are going to make sure that 65,000 fewer people are helped next \nyear. In my State of Illinois, we will lose 3,300 vouchers.\n  Community development block grant--a 1-percent across-the-board cut \nmeans $777 million lost. That is nearly 16 percent below this year's \nfunding level. Illinois losses $24 million.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency provides Federal funding to \nStates to improve water quality to construct and improve drinking and \nwastewater treatment. If we cut these programs by 1 percent, or $243 \nmillion, it means we are cutting them 12 percent below current levels. \nIllinois loses $11 million.\n  These examples are only the beginning. If one thinks these cuts are \nabsolutely essential, remember that we will come back next year and \nconsider another bill by this administration and by the Republican \nleadership in this Congress to give tax cuts to the wealthiest people \nin America. In the midst of a war, facing the biggest deficit in our \nhistory, with Hurricane Katrina and its responsibilities looming over \nus, we are cutting basic programs for education, health care, \nchildcare, and environmental protection to provide tax cuts for the \nwealthy. Those are the priorities of the Republican leadership, \npriorities reflected in this bill. Real fiscal discipline requires \nthoughtful choices. Across-the-board cuts simply hack away \nindiscriminately at all programs.\n  I know the hour is late, and I thank my colleagues for their \npatience. I thank those in the Senate, the staff in particular, as we \ndraw closer to the holiday season, and they are all wishing they could \ngo home, and I am, too. I hope we will consider these bills tomorrow. I \nhope the votes in the Senate will reflect the priorities and values of \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to express a little hometown \npride.\n  Last Saturday, I had the great opportunity to watch history in the \nmaking in Savannah, TN, as the Carroll College Fighting Saints from \nHelena, MT, marched to victory over the St. Francis Cougars from Fort \nWayne, ID.\n  Carroll College is a private, Catholic college in my hometown of \nHelena, MT. Carroll is home to 1,500 students and enjoys a host of \noutstanding accomplishments in its nationally award-winning academic \nand pre-professional programs. Carroll is especially known for its \nflagship pre-medical, engineering and nursing programs.\n  The Carroll Talking Saints Forensics Team is ranked in the top five \nin the Nation and has reigned as Northwest Regional Champions for the \npast 15 years. It is a small school, with a huge record of \naccomplishment.\n  The Carroll College Fighting Saints are the only team on any level of \ncollege football in the modern era to win four national titles in a \nrow.\n  They only gave up 9 points per game this season, adding to their \noutstanding national accomplishments.\n  Led by Tyler Emmer, who claimed the NAIA player of the year for the \nsecond time, the Saints offensive attack has piled up impressive \nnumbers this season. The Saints can stretch the field with long passes \nor they can use their short passing game to keep the chains moving, as \nthey did last Saturday.\n  It was wonderful to be there and watch, as the PA kept saying, ``Move \nthose chains, move those chains,'' as Carroll kept scoring on the first \ndown.\n  Emmert has thrown for 3,039 yards and 33 touchdowns this season. He \nowns a career record of 50-to-3 wins as a starter for the Saints. \nEmmert and his teammate Jeff Shirley were named Frontier Conference \nPlayers of the Year. A class act, Tyler is the first to credit his \nteammates for his success.\n  To win Saturday, putting the Carroll College Fighting Saints in the \nrecord book, is more than just about football. It is about hard work, \ndedication, competitiveness, leadership, friendship, and family.\n  In his 7-year career at Carroll, head coach Mike Van Diest led his \nteam to four national championships. Mike again was named Frontier \nConference Coach of the Year. He is a class act.\n  Working tirelessly to inspire these young athletes, Mike has created \nmore than a championship football team. He has taught them the value of \na quality education, the strength of teamwork, and the importance of \ngiving back to the community and those in need. Coach Van Diest defines \nwhat it is to be a true Montanan. I commend him for setting such high \nstandards for all of us.\n  Also, congratulations go to Carroll College athletic director Bruce \nParker and his staff.\n  I recognize Carroll College President Tom Trebon for his leadership \nand commitment to Carroll College.\n  Finally, I want to commend my good friend from Indiana, Senator Evan \nBayh. The Senator and I had a little wager on the game. We went double \nor nothing on a bet from last year--Montana-brewed beer against \nIndiana-grown popcorn. I look forward to the popcorn. We appreciate the \nSenator being such a good sport.\n  Carroll College is more than a 4-year experience; it is for life. As \nthe 17 senior players complete their football careers, they begin \nlife's journey more equipped to meet the challenges of their new lives. \nI am confident the Saints will continue to march on to many more \nvictories. They are a wonderful bunch of guys and gals at Carroll \nCollege, a great team, a great coach. I was there Saturday to watch the \ngame. I was so pleased to be part of the Carroll family, and I cannot \ncommend all of them enough for what they do in the best sense of the \nterm, all the values that mean so much to basic America. I thank \nCarroll College for what you do.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/20/senate-section/article/S14165-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the fiscal year \n2006 Intelligence authorization bill.\n  As every American knows, we are a nation at war--at war in Iraq and \nat war against radical terrorists. These are wars Democrats and \nRepublicans agree we cannot afford to lose. These wars have demanded a \ngreat deal from our troops and our taxpayers and will require much more \nsacrifice before they are over.\n  Given the stakes involved and the sacrifices required of so many, you \nwould think that funding our troops and our intelligence community \nwould be this Republican controlled Congress's top priority. You would \nthink that our friends on the other side of the aisle would take up \nthis must do legislation at the start of the Congress not at the end.\n  Unfortunately, while the Republican leadership is fond of stating the \nimportance of prevailing in these wars and taking care of our troops, \nthey have not matched those words with action. In fact, the hypocrisy \ndemonstrated by the Republicans in this Congress on national security \nmatters is astounding. How else to explain that with less than a week \nto go before Christmas, in the waning hours of this session of \nCongress, our Republican friends have yet to complete action on three \nmajor pieces of national security legislation--the fiscal year 2006 \nDefense authorization bill, the fiscal year 2006 Defense appropriations \nbill, and the fiscal year 2006 Intelligence authorization bill.\n  In recent times, Republicans have been extremely fond of painting \nthemselves as patriots and extremely quick to brand those who challenge \ntheir policies as traitors. Given the callous way Republicans have \ntreated our national security and our troops, I feel I must speak out \non the Republicans' hypocrisy.\n  Although this point could be made with respect to each of the \nunfinished national security bills bottled up in this Congress, right \nnow, I want to focus my remarks on the Intelligence authorization \nbill--a bill Republicans have not even seen fit to bring to the Senate \nfloor despite the fact that the bill was reported out unanimously by \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee.\n  This bill should have been taken up months ago. And Democrats would \nhave been more than willing to quickly debate and pass this legislation \nonce it reached the Senate floor so it could go to a conference with \nthe House. Democrats know that it is essential that we permit the men \nand women of the intelligence agencies to continue their critical work \non the front lines of the war in Iraq and the war on terror.\n  Unfortunately, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \napparently don't share that view. Republicans have taken months to move \nthis bill through the legislative process. Once the committee acted and \nthe bill was ready for the floor, an anonymous Republican placed a hold \non the bill and prevented the Senate from working its will. As a \nresult, the bill can't go forward. Vital intelligence operations are on \nhold while the bill languishes. And the men and women who selflessly \nserve are left wondering whether the Congress understands how vital \ntheir work is to this Nation's security.\n  I hope the Republican-led Congress will eventually get its act \ntogether and get this bill passed before we adjourn for the year.\n  In the meantime, to the men and women of the intelligence agencies, I \nsay: Senate Democrats stand with you. We are proud of your bravery and \nyour patriotism, and we thank you for your sacrifice working in silence \nand in the shadows against the threats America faces.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/20/senate-section/article/S14165-3", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14165-S14170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            USA PATRIOT ACT\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I wanted to take this opportunity today \nto speak yet again on reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act.\n  I spoke earlier in the day on my dedication to fighting terrorism and \nin my support for giving law enforcement the tools to fight terrorism, \nthe need and desire to reauthorize the PATRIOT Act, the political games \nsurrounding extension of the PATRIOT Act, and the true patriotism of my \ncolleagues in striving to uphold the Constitution and its liberties.\n  The President acts irresponsibly when he refuses--for purely \npolitical purposes--to allow the extension of the PATRIOT Act.\n  If the PATRIOT Act expires at the end of 2005, the responsibility \nlies with\n\n[[Page S14166]]\n\nthe President alone and with those Members of the Senate and the House \nwho rubberstamp his irresponsible direction.\n  We can act today to resolve this impasse over the PATRIOT Act. It \nsimply requires good faith. Surely in the final few days before \nChristmas we can come together, set aside political posturing, and pass \nanother extension of the PATRIOT Act so that we can continue in good \nfaith to fix it.\n  But what we are witnessing with the PATRIOT Act is something more \ntroubling--the abuse of absolute power.\n  It is an age-old self-portrait of America that we are a nation and \npeople governed by the ``rule of law.''\n  Since before the American Revolution, we have held ourselves out to \nthe world as a country and as a people different from all others. We \nhave rejected for our country the tyranny of the powerful, the despotic \nkingships and the dictatorships that have oppressed mankind throughout \nits history.\n  The ``rule of law'' also of course includes the ``rules of law''--how \nwe create laws at every level of government.\n  In our country, the rule of law protects the rights of those not in \ncontrol of the levers of power--from the Bill of Rights to the rules of \nthe Senate, our laws and rules aim to protect those out of power from \nthe abuses of those who are in power.\n  But notwithstanding the ideal of our Nation--that we are governed by \nthe rule of law and not by the whims of the powerful--all too often in \nour history the convictions that ``might makes right'' degrades the \nrule of law.\n  Earlier this year, those in power threatened to break the rules of \nthe Senate to force their will on the Senate. It is happening again \nthis week.\n  I have witnessed over the last few days the naked display of ``might \nmakes right'' and the corrupting influence of absolute power.\n  Instead of an honest debate on differences of opinion between \npatriots on the reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act, our commitment to \nfighting terrorism is questioned.\n  In the closing hours of the session of Congress, we witness the \namazing switch of ANWR from the budget reconciliation bill to the \nDefense Appropriations bill and the trashing of Senate rules. And why? \nSimply because those in power believe that might makes right.\n  We have an administration that has admitted it ignored our \nintelligence surveillance laws because it found them to be \ninconvenient.\n  When people dare to question the legality of these actions, they are \ncalled unpatriotic and obstructionist.\n  That is wrong.\n  Now Mr. President, let me turn my attention in more detail to the \nPATRIOT Act.\n  In March of this year, I joined a group of three Republicans and \nthree Democrats in introducing legislation known as the SAFE Act. This \nlegislation would have extended every single one of the expiring \nportions of the PATRIOT Act, while at the same time imposing reasonable \nchecks on those powers.\n  In keeping with that spirit of compromise, the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee worked tirelessly this spring and summer to draft a \nreauthorization bill that could garner broad support. With the \nparticipation of two of the original cosponsors of the SAFE Act, \nmembers of that committee, in conjunction with our colleagues on the \nSenate Intelligence Committee, worked together to make tough choices \nand hammer out a bipartisan compromise.\n  The legislation passed unanimously out of the Judiciary Committee--a \ngroup not known for its ability to achieve complete consensus on many \nissues--and it passed the Senate with the support of all 100 Senators--\nRepublicans, Democrats, and Independents alike.\n  We stood together behind the principle that we can give law \nenforcement officers the tools they need without sacrificing our basic \nfreedoms--freedoms that Americans are fighting and dying for in Iraq \nand Afghanistan, freedoms that Americans have fought and died to \nestablish and preserve throughout our history.\n\n  But, once again, we were faced with the need to find compromise--this \ntime, with the House. And again, my colleagues and I did not expect to \nget everything we wanted.\n  It is worth repeating that the Senate bill passed with the support of \nall 100 Senators, while the House bill passed in the face of stiff \nopposition.\n  It is also worth noting that, in separate votes, a bipartisan \nmajority in the House supported stronger civil liberties protections \nthan were included in the final conference report.\n  Unfortunately, after the House delayed for months in appointing \nconferees, the conference committee filed legislation that failed to \nprovide the modest--but critical--civil liberties protections that \nAmericans deserve.\n  Once again, I joined with the cosponsors of the SAFE Act--this time \nin a final effort to bring the conference committee back from the brink \nand to pass reauthorization legislation worthy of broad, bipartisan \nsupport.\n  Our requests were modest. We asked the conference committee to \naddress four specific provisions: section 215 of the PATRIOT Act \nitself, which allows the government to obtain sensitive personal and \nbusiness records without any meaningful limitation and no ability to \nchallenge the permanent automatic gag order; national security letters, \nwhich allow the government to obtain certain categories of records \nwithout prior judicial approval, again without the ability to challenge \nthe gag order; the need for periodic congressional review of these \nauthorities; and sneak-and-peek searches, where the government can wait \nup to 30 days before notifying the target of a property search.\n  Last week, my colleagues and I introduced legislation to extend the \nPATRIOT Act by three months to give Congress time to make the final \nchanges to the conference report necessary to protect civil liberties.\n  That proposal was summarily rejected by the majority leadership and \nby the White House.\n  When we have repeatedly this week attempted to propose extending the \nPATRIOT Act to allow for necessary improvements, those efforts have \nbeen again summarily rejected.\n  When the minority leader even attempted yesterday to propose the \nSenate simply re-pass its version of the PATRIOT Act reauthorization, \nthat effort was rejected by the very same Senators who supposedly \nsupported the Senate version the first time around.\n  It is eminent1y clear that those of us who have worked to improve the \nPATRIOT Act over the course of the past days, weeks, and months are \nentirely focused on extending these important powers as we continue to \nfight the war on terror. But, given that we have been labeled \n``obstructionists'' and told that we are putting the nation at greater \nrisk, it is worth examining some of the arguments over the bill's \nsubstance in greater detail.\n  Over the past few days, some on the other side of this debate have \nasserted that the changes we have proposed are unnecessary, because \nintelligence investigations authorized under the PATRIOT Act are no \ndifferent from the routine law enforcement investigative activities \nthat occur throughout our Nation thousands of times a day.\n  At the heart of this disagreement is section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, \nwhich revises substantially the authority under the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act, FISA, for seizure of business records, \nincluding third party records of individuals' transactions and \nactivities.\n  Section 215 broadened the authority to seize business records under \nFISA in two ways. First, it expanded the scope of the kinds of records \nthe government may obtain using this authority from ``records'' to \n``any tangible things.'' Second, it eased the requirements for \nobtaining an order. Previously, FISA required the government to present \nto the secret FISA court ``specific articulable facts giving reason to \nbelieve'' that the subject of an investigation was a ``foreign power or \nthe agent of a foreign power.'' Under section 215, the government is \nrequired only to assert that the records or things sought are needed \n``to protect against'' international terrorism--in effect, that they \nare relevant in some way to a terrorist investigation. There is no \nrequirement for an evidentiary or factual showing and the judge has no \nreal discretion in reviewing an application. If the judge finds that \n``the application meets the requirements'' of the section, he or she \nmust issue an order as requested ``or as\n\n[[Page S14167]]\n\nmodified.'' In addition, section 215 prevented the recipient of a \nsearch order from disclosing the fact that the FBI has sought or \nobtained records, and prohibited the recipient from challenging that \ngag order.\n  Both the SAFE Act and the Senate reauthorization bill retained the \nPATRIOT Act's expanded scope of the FISA records provision, but both \nrestored a standard of individualized suspicion, and permitted the \nrecipient of a search order to challenge that order in court.\n  National security letters have also been at the center of this \ndebate. NSLs allow the government to obtain certain narrow categories \nof records without the prior approval of a judge. The PATRIOT Act \nexpanded the use of national security letters, and authorized a much \nlarger number of government officials to issue them. It has been \nasserted that the number of NSLs has exploded since passage of the \nPATRIOT Act, possibly by as many as 30,000 a year. In addition, as with \nsection 215 orders, the act prohibited the recipient of an NSL from \ndisclosing information about the order, and from challenging that order \nin court.\n  In contrast, the Senate bill would have permitted recipients of an \nNSL to challenge the gag order and to receive meaningful review of that \norder in court. Although many of my colleagues and I would have \npreferred to require a standard of individualized suspicion before an \nNSL was issued--as would have been required by the SAFE Act--we \nunderstood that NSLs are distinct from section 215 orders in that they \nare much more limited in scope, and supported the Senate compromise.\n  As I mentioned previously, supporters of the conference report have \nargued against the changes in the Senate bill on the grounds that the \ngovernment already has the authority to obtain broad categories of \nthird-party records without the prior approval of a judge, and without \nhaving to demonstrate even relevance to an investigation, let alone \nindividualized suspicion.\n  In fact, it has been asserted that there are 335 specific cases in \nwhich the government is authorized to subpoena information without the \nprior approval of a judge.\n  It is important to point out that a vast majority of the \nadministrative subpoena powers the government possesses are related to \nthe ability of regulatory agencies to obtain records to ensure \ncompliance by the industry being regulated. This is vastly different \nthan government intelligence agents seeking information about U.S. \ncitizens engaged in lawful activities. Moreover, the administrative \nsubpoena powers not related to regulatory enforcement are far narrower \nthan the authorities provided by the PATRIOT Act.\n  Secondly, and more importantly, intelligence investigations are \ninherently different from criminal investigations, because criminal \ninvestigations are limited to cases involving unlawful conduct.\n  In contrast, intelligence investigations may focus on lawful activity \nby law-abiding Americans.\n  Accordingly, it is inappropriate--and just plain wrong--to compare \nthe authority provided to the government for intelligence \ninvestigations with the subpoena powers the government currently \npossesses with respect to regulatory enforcement, or under the criminal \ncode.\n  Mr. President, there is still time to get this right. I am confident \nthat, by working in the same spirit of bipartisanship and compromise \nthat the cosponsors of the SAFE Act have exemplified all year, we will \nget this right.\n  That, Mr. President, is my goal.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak briefly about the \nPATRIOT Act. I voted against cloture for the PATRIOT Act because I do \nnot feel that this bill is good for our country. The conference report \ninvades our most treasured civil liberties--the right to be left alone \nwithout the Government invading our personal space. I know the people \nof Montana value this freedom. So does the rest of the country. We can \nbe safe from terrorism and at the same time be free from Government \nrestrictions on our basic civil liberties. The conference report does \nnot strike this essential balance. Instead, it infringes on the rights \nwe hold most dear.\n  The Senate bill I supported in July was a joint effort, between \nRepublicans and Democrats, which took important steps to protect the \nfreedoms of innocent Americans. At the same time, the Senate bill made \nsure that the Government had the power it needed to investigate \npotential terrorists and terrorist activities. I am deeply disappointed \nin the conference report which retreats too far from the bill I \nsupported in the Senate. The conference report fails to make some \nvitally important reforms to the PATRIOT Act that we, in Senate, agreed \nto in July. My colleagues have spoken at length about the broad, \nintrusive powers of section 215. I share these concerns on the \nexpansive powers given to the Government in the conference report. I am \nalso seriously disturbed by the recent news of the Government's ability \nto spy on innocent U.S. citizens and listen to our private \nconversations.\n  This conference report is flawed. And it needs work. Let me make \nmyself clear. I am not opposed to reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act.\n  We need to work together to make the necessary improvements on this \nvery important piece of legislation. We must put aside our party lines \nand come to an agreement that gives our law enforcement officers the \nability to do their jobs. But we must also preserve our freedoms in the \nprocess. We can protect the country from terrorism while at the same \ntime protecting all innocent Americans from unnecessary Government \nintrusion. The safety of our country depends on it.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to make some comments and \nshare my concerns about the provisions of the Department of Defense \nappropriations conference report that open the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge to oil drilling. I do not support drilling in the Refuge. But \neven if I did, I would not support the language in this bill. It is \ninappropriate to make management decisions regarding one of our \nNation's largest and most ecologically important wildlife refuges in a \nclosed conference. Doing so restricts the ability of the Senate and the \nadministration to ensure that drilling is done in an environmentally \nsound way. It is particularly troubling that a military spending \nconference report is being used as the vehicle to sneak this unrelated, \ncontroversial, and reckless legislation through the Senate.\n  As ranking member of Environment and Public Works Committee, I feel I \nmust make clear to the Senate that the language in that this conference \nreport has not passed the Senate before. It does not just open the \nRefuge to oil drilling, it does so in the least environmentally \nsensitive way possible. And, Mr. President, it does so in a manner that \ntreats the Arctic Refuge differently than any other Federal lands or \nwildlife refuges.\n  Arctic Refuge drilling proponents repeatedly profess that oil \ndevelopment in the Refuge would be done in an environmentally sensitive \nway. As the ranking member of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, I want to inform the Senate that this bill is actually \nriddled with clauses that weaken existing environmental standards, \nexempt drilling from key rules, or otherwise allow oil development \nactivities to sidestep environmental protection laws. First, for \nexample, the conference report exempts parts of the proposed Arctic oil \nand gas leasing program from environmental review requirements. In \nparticular, it declares that the Department of Interior's Environmental \nImpact Statement EIS prepared in 1987 satisfies the requirements of the \nNational Environmental Policy Act, NEPA, for preparation of the \nregulations that will guide the leasing program and any preleasing \nexploration or other activities. NEPA is supposed to ensure that public \nand Federal decisionmakers have the most recent, accurate information \nconcerning the environmental impacts of projects, but this clause seems \nto ensure the opposite. In fact, as long ago as 1991, a Federal court \nfound that due to new scientific information, Interior should have \nsupplemented this very same 1987 EIS analysis before recommending to \nCongress that it allow development on the Coastal Plain.\n  In 2002, some 15 years after the 1987 EIS, the U.S. Geological Survey \nreleased a significant report detailing 12 years of study about the \npotential impacts of oil drilling on the wildlife of\n\n[[Page S14168]]\n\nthe Arctic Refuge. This information can, and should, be incorporated as \nthe Interior Department's consideration of drilling.\n  Many now question whether the existing final legislative \nenvironmental impact statement, prepared in 1987 to comply with the \nNational Environmental Policy Act, NEPA, is adequate to support \ndevelopment now or whether a Supplement or a new EIS should be \nprepared. As I mentioned, a court in a declaratory judgment action in \n1991 held that the Interior Department should have prepared a \nsupplemental invironmental impact statement SEIS at that time to \nencompass new information about the Coastal Plain in connection with \nthe Department's recommendation that Congress legislate to permit \ndevelopment. Therefore, without the language of this bill, it seems \nclear that either an SEIS or a new EIS would have to be prepared before \ndrilling could begin.\n\n  But, in this provision, we change the law and the legal precedent. \nThe bill before us states that the Congress finds the 1987 EIS adequate \nto satisfy the legal and procedural requirements of NEPA with respect \nto the actions authorized to be taken by the Secretary of the Interior \nin developing and promulgating the regulations for the establishment of \nthe leasing program. This language explicitly eliminates the need to \nredo or update the EIS for the leasing regulations.\n  The Secretary is only directed to prepare an EIS with respect to \nactions other than the preparation of the regulations. This is \nnoteworthy because only the smaller document, an environmental \nassessment, might not normally be sufficient, given on the magnitude of \nthe action involved. The rest of that paragraph sets out limitations on \nthe alternatives that the Secretary must consider as to leasing, as \nthough this paragraph relates only to the leasing stage, rather than to \nall actions. But, the language is unclear and may curtain environmental \nreview at all stages. The section goes on to say that the Secretary is \nto identify only a preferred action for leasing and a single \nalternative and analyze only those two choices and to consider public \ncomment only on the preferred alternative. Public comments must be \nsubmitted within 20 days of publication of the environmental analysis, \nand the Secretary may only consider public comments that specifically \naddress the preferred action. Compliance with this law is stated as \nsatisfying all requirements for consideration and analysis of \nenvironmental effects.\n  There is no question that this language substantially weakens \nenvironmental review requirements. It significantly diminishes the \ncomprehensive analysis traditionally required by NEPA, by stating that \nthe Secretary of Interior need consider only its preferred action and a \nsingle leasing alternative. The ``alternatives analysis,'' which is all \nbut eliminated by this section of the bill, is the heart of NEPA. \nSenators supporting this provision should be fully aware that these \nlimitations strike at the core of our country's environmental review \nprocess and requirements.\n  Further, this language undermines the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService's authority to impose conditions on leases. It states that the \noil and gas leasing program are ``deemed to be compatible'' with the \npurposes of the Arctic Refuge. According to the Congressional Research \nService, this provision ``appears to eliminate the usual compatibility \ndetermination process for purposes of refuge management.'' CRS notes \nthat without the compatibility process, the authority of the Fish and \nWildlife Service to impose conditions on leases is called into \nquestion.\n  Finally, this language changes judicial review of leasing decisions. \nJudicial review is limited to ``whether the Secretary has complied'' \nwith this legislation. It also states the only appropriate legal venue \nis the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. The judicial review provisions \nundermine drilling proponents' claims that the language will result in \nsufficient environmental protection. A leasing program that is truly \n``environmentally sound'' would be at no risk from judicial review.\n  We can do better, and we should. This debate will never lead us to \nactually fix these problems because a conference report cannot be \namended. And putting this provision in a conference report constrains \nthe way in which Senators who are concerned about these issues and who \ndo not serve on the Appropriations Committee are able to address those \nissues on the floor.\n  I would caution all Members of the Senate who have committed to \nsupport Arctic drilling only in certain cases, or only if certain other \nlegislative or regulatory actions take place, to closely examine the \nlanguage in this conference report.\n  Finally, I oppose including this in a conference report because I \nbelieve it is being used to limit consideration of a controversial \nissue. The American people have strongly held views on drilling in the \nRefuge, and they want to know that the Senate is working to pass \nlegislation to manage the area appropriately in a forthright and open \nprocess.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to state my opposition to \nthis cynical effort to add a very controversial provision to allow \ndrilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and also adds a \nprovision to grant unprecedented liability protection to vaccine \nmanufacturers to a critical Defense appropriations bill.\n  Holding funding for our troops and relief for Hurricane Katrina \nvictims hostage in this manner is just plain wrong and a violation of \nat least two Senate rules--XXVIII and a budget point of order--and \ncynical.\n  Rule XXVII prevents Senators from adding provisions that have not \nbeen included in either the House or Senate bill from being added to \nthe conference report. Neither the House nor the Senate included any \nlanguage on ANWR, so according to the Senate rules, it should not have \nbeen included in the conference report.\n  The provision also appears to violate section 311 of the Budget Act. \nThe budget resolution which we passed in April assumed that the \nTreasury Department would raise about $2 billion from opening the \nArctic for drilling. Yet the appropriations bill spends $5 billion of \nrevenue from ANWR.\n  As far as I know, opening ANWR to drilling has not been rescored, so \nthe score from earlier this year is still in effect. As a result, this \nprovision is subject to a budget point of order.\n  It makes a mockery of the rules and procedures of the Senate and \nstrikes a blow at the heart of collegiality.\n  The ANWR provision was originally added to the budget reconciliation \nbill. Courageous House Republicans stood up and said no. So when this \nroute was closed, it was added to this important appropriations bill, \nin violation of at least one Senate Rule and the Budget Act.\n  To make matters worse, the vaccine proposal was added to the bill \nafter the House-Senate Conference Committee concluded its meeting. This \nis outrageous.\n  I believe it is all being done with a cynical attitude that says \nunless we accept it, we are going to run the risk that we will vote \nagainst a major bill which funds all military operations at a critical \ntime in our history.\n  ANWR is an issue that arouses great passion on both sides of the \nissue. There are strong arguments that underlie the belief that the \nopening of these critical 1.5 million acres of pristine wilderness is \nsmall from an oil production perspective and damaging environmentally.\n  First, the Artic Refuge's Coastal Plain, where the drilling would \noccur, is the ecological heart of the refuge.\n  It is the center of wildlife activity and the home of nearly 200 \nwildlife species, including polar bears, musk oxen, and porcupine \ncaribou.\n  If ANWR were opened up for drilling, the wilderness would be \ncrisscrossed by roads, pipelines, power plants, and other \ninfrastructure.\n  In fact, the Department of the Interior estimated that 12,500 acres \nwould be directly impacted by drilling.\n  I believe that destroying this wilderness does very little to reduce \nenergy costs, nor does it do it very much for oil independence.\n  I also believe deeply that we cannot drill our way out of our \nNation's over dependence on oil.\n  ANWR will produce too little oil to have a real impact on prices or \noverall supply. And it would offer a number of false hopes:\n  First, to those seeking lower gasoline prices: opening the Refuge \nwould only lower gasoline prices only 1 cent per gallon 20 years from \nnow.\n\n[[Page S14169]]\n\n  Second, to those seeking a major boost in oil supply: the United \nStates now consumes 20 million barrels of oil per day, a number that \nwill climb every year unless we learn to conserve and recognize that we \nmust find alternatives to fossil fuels.\n  On average, ANWR is expected to produce about 800,000 barrels per \nday. And in 2025, this 800,000 barrels per day would represent only 3 \npercent of the projected 25 million barrel a day U.S. daily \nconsumption.\n  So, in essence, we would be sacrificing this cherished wilderness to \nobtain about 10.4 billion barrels of oil over the 35-year projected \nANWR lifetime. This amounts to a little more than one year's supply of \noil for the United States.\n  There are other things we can do to meet our energy needs, including \nraising fuel economy standards and drilling at alternative sites.\n  First, just changing the mileage of SUVs and light trucks from 21 to \n27.5 miles per gallon would save the United States 1 million barrels of \noil a day and reduce our dependence on oil imports by 10 percent.\n  This would save more oil in 1 day--1 million barrels--than ANWR would \nproduce in one day 800,000 barrels.\n  Second, there are other important supplies of domestically produced \noil.\n  The Minerals Management Service, MMS, has reported that there are \n36.9 billion barrels of undiscovered, technically recoverable oil that \nexists in the Gulf of Mexico, much of which would likely be found under \nthe 8,043 already leased blocks in the Gulf.\n  These already leased blocks can be drilled right now, without delay, \nif the oil companies were willing.\n  In addition, there are new technologies to produce oil from \n``depleted'' oil fields throughout the United States.\n  According to scientists, using enhanced oil recovery could allow the \nUnited States to produce an additional 32 billion barrels of \ntechnically recoverable oil from already existing wells.\n  The bottom line is that it is hardly worthwhile to damage the \nNation's only refuge that encompasses a complete range of arctic \necosystems and provides an essential habitat for many species for less \nthan 1 percent of the world's oil output.\n  Drilling will not give us more energy security, but it will carry \nhuge environmental costs.\n  We can start to address high energy prices, energy security and \nglobal warming by increasing fuel economy standards, encouraging energy \nefficiency, promoting the development of new and alternative fuels, and \nsupporting the invention and commercialization of new vehicle \ntechnologies. Drilling in ANWR is not the answer.\n  Before I close, I also want to say a few words about another \nproblematic provision in the bill.\n  I was quite surprised to discover yesterday that after the conference \non Sunday had been closed, new liability protections for pharmaceutical \ncompanies were added to the conference report.\n  Over 30 pages of new language were included that provide essentially \ncomplete immunity from civil liability for drug companies and medical \ndevice manufacturers even when there is reckless disregard or gross \nnegligence in developing or manufacturing these products--so long as \nthe Secretary of HHS has made a ``Declaration.''\n  In addition, pharmaceutical and medical device companies are \nprotected even when there are criminal violations of FDA standards so \nlong as the administration has not taken action to enforce the \nviolations.\n  The bill does appear to allow for a lawsuit if an injured patient can \ndemonstrate willful misconduct on the part of the company.\n  However, the language is unclear as to whether the Secretary has to \nfirst approve regulations before even these suits may go forward.\n  In addition, the bill literally directs the Secretary to promulgate \nregulations to further restrict the definition of willful misconduct--a \ndecision that is usually left up to a court.\n  Even more disturbing is that none of the Secretary's decisions are \nsubject to review by a court, essentially wiping out individual's \naccess to an impartial forum.\n  I am also concerned that this legislation preempts State laws. If \nStates have stronger laws to protect consumers from defective drugs or \ndevices those laws are pre-empted, as we do in California, those laws \nare wiped out.\n  Finally, the bill does create a trust fund to pay patients who cannot \nmeet these severely restrictive standards based on the Smallpox \nEmergency Personnel Protection Act.\n  However, that act is meant as a supplemental benefits program for \nhealth care workers administering the potentially deadly smallpox \nvaccine. And more importantly, there is no money for the trust.\n  I am very disturbed that this egregious provision was added to the \nconference report. I am disturbed both by the process in which it was \nadded, and by the substantive impact it could have if enacted into law.\n  It is with a heavy heart that I will vote against cloture on this \nbill. I support the military 100 percent. I support our efforts to help \nthe victims of Hurricane Katrina 100 percent. But I cannot support the \nmanner in which this important bill was hijacked in an effort to get \nseveral very controversial provisions enacted despite widespread \nopposition.\n  In an article that appeared in the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, \nSenator Stevens was quoted saying that if a Senate filibuster over ANWR \nstops this bill, the legislation can be modified and passed so it has \nno impact on military finances. He said, ``If we lose, then we'll \nreconstitute the conference and ANWR will be out.'' I would hope that \nis the result. It would be the best course for this Congress and the \nNation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the Defense authorization bill \nas a strong expression of our support in the Senate for our Armed \nForces at this difficult point in our history. We are proud of the \ncourage of our troops in Iraq and their extraordinary dedication in \ncarrying out their mission.\n  But I strongly object to the action of the conferees in including a \nlast-minute rider to the bill that received little debate and that \nwould drastically restrict the fundamental right to habeas corpus for \naliens detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. \nSection 1405 of the bill amends the habeas corpus statute in the U.S. \nCode by adding these words: ``Except as provided in section 1405 of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006, no court, \njustice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear'' any habeas corpus \nclaim or any other action relating to the detention of an alien at \nGuantanamo.\n  For centuries, the writ of habeas corpus has been a cornerstone of \nthe rule of law in Anglo-American jurisprudence. Since the Second Magna \nCarta in 1679, it has served as the primary means to challenge unlawful \ngovernment detention. Literally, the writ means ``have the body,'' i.e. \nthe person detained, brought before a court or judge to consider the \nlegality of detention. The writ was used to prevent indefinite \ndetention, and ensured that individuals could be held no longer than 3 \nto 6 months without indictment or trial for felony or treason. In other \nwords, it requires the Government to provide a court with a legal basis \nfor its decision to deprive persons of their liberty.\n  This provision strikes at one of the basic principles of liberty \nenshrined in the Anglo-Saxon system of government that the executive \nmay not arbitrarily deprive persons of liberty for an indefinite \nperiod. As Blackstone wrote in his commentaries:\n\n       To bereave a man of life, or by violence to confiscate his \n     estate, without accusation or trial, would be so gross and \n     notorious an act of despotism as must at once convey the \n     alarm or tyranny throughout the whole kingdom. But \n     confinement of a person, by secretly hurrying him to gaol, \n     where his sufferings are unknown or forgotten, is a less \n     public, a less striking, and therefore a more dangerous \n     engine of arbitrary government.\n\n  This principle was so important to the Framers that ``the great \nwrit'' was the only common law writ enshrined in the Constitution. \nArticle I, section 9 of the Constitution states, that ``The privilege \nof the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in \ncases of Rebellion or Invasion the public safety may require it.''\n  Any changes to the writ of habeas corpus, this most fundamental of \nrights, should be made carefully, through open debate, and with a full \nunderstanding of the implications of the change. The Senate did not \nhold a\n\n[[Page S14170]]\n\nsingle hearing on the need for this drastic change. In fact, the \nsponsor of the amendment, Senator Graham, admitted that some of his \ncomments during the debate were not accurate statements of law. Senator \nSpecter, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, opposed the \nprovision, and spoke eloquently on the lack of appropriate process for \nits consideration. The provision was adopted by the Senate with less \nthan 2 hours of debate. Since its passage, all negotiations on this \nprovision have occurred in back rooms, without the involvement of the \nvast majority of Congress, and without even consulting most of the \nconferees. Such a cavalier treatment of the basic right to habeas \ncorpus is appalling.\n  The constitutional writ of habeas corpus deserves better than that. \nJustices Scalia and Stevens, dissenting in the recent case of Hamdi v. \nRumsfeld, acknowledged the power of Congress to suspend the writ of \nhabeas corpus, but they noted the limits on that power embedded in the \nConstitution. In this dissent, they said:\n\n       To be sure, suspension is limited by the Constitution to \n     cases of rebellion or invasion. But whether the attacks of \n     September 11, 2001, constitute an ``invasion,'' and whether \n     those attacks still justify suspension several years later, \n     are questions for Congress.\n\n  Here, neither the legislation nor the report language makes any \nfindings that would satisfy the requirements of the Suspension clause. \nWithout such a record, it would be preposterous for Senators to claim \nthat somehow their actions fulfilled the constitutional requirement for \nsuspending habeas corpus. Section 1405, therefore, can be treated only \nas a modification of the statutory provisions for habeas corpus in the \nU.S. Code. In Rasul v. Bush, for example, decided last year, the \nSupreme Court made clear that it was considering the statutory right to \nhabeas corpus, not the constitutional right. They did not determine \nwhether the constitutional right to habeas corpus was reached. Since \nCongress cannot act in violation of the Constitution to prohibit \njudicial review, the courts still have the power to determine whether \nthe constitutional right of habeas corpus is available in cases where \nsection 1405 deprives a detainee of the statutory right. So this \nunseemly action may well not have achieved its purpose.\n  Some may claim that the right of habeas corpus does not apply to \nGuantanamo because Section 1405 defines the United States specifically \nto exclude Guatanamo Bay, Cuba. But as the Supreme Court found in \nRasul, the common law right of habeas corpus is not limited to the \nformal territorial boundaries of a nation, but is defined by ``the \npractical question of `the exact extent and nature of the jurisdiction \nor dominion exercised in fact by the Crown.' `` It is this common law \nright which our founders enshrined in the Constitution. Thus, the scope \nof the constitutional right to corpus habeas is the same as the common \nlaw right. In Rasul, the Supreme Court stated that the United States \n``exercises `complete jurisdiction and control' over Guanatanamo Naval \nBase, and may continue to exercise such control permanently. . .''\n  Supporters of this provision argue that after stripping the courts of \njurisdiction for habeas corpus claims, the provision adds back limited \nappeal rights for detainees in two classes: No. 1, those who have had a \nCombatant Status Review Tribunal, which serves as an initial \ndesignation of enemy combatant status but is not a final judgment; and \nNo. 2, those who have received a final decision from a military \ncommission. Over 500 detainees in the first category, those who have \nhad a CSRT--many of them have already filed a petition to challenge \ntheir designation as enemy combatants. We are not aware of any \ndetainees in the second category.\n  For the first category, section 1405 does not apply the habeas-\nstripping provision to pending cases, so the courts retain jurisdiction \nto consider these petitions--in addition to pending military commission \ncases--consistent with Lindh v. Murphy. During deliberations on the \nfloor for this provision, the Senate specifically rejected language \nfrom the original Graham amendment, which would have brought these \ncategories of cases within its reach.\n  Section 1405 also leaves completely undisturbed a challenge to the \nmilitary commission process now pending in the Supreme Court in the \ncase of Hamdan v. Rumsfeld. The sponsors of the original amendment made \nit clear on the floor of the Senate that the provision has prospective \napplication only, which is what my colleagues and I understood to be \nthe drafters' intent.\n  When Congress authorizes a procedure to challenge military \ncommissions or the tribunals, Congress is clearly not endorsing or \nauthorizing the use of commissions or tribunals themselves. The Senate \nhas numerous bills before it to authorize military commissions, and it \nhas not acted on any of them.\n  In addition, section 1405 in no way endorses the amorphous and \nunlimited definition of enemy combatant currently used by the Bush \nadministration. We all hope that the administration will soon provide \nCongress and the American people with a definition of who is an ``enemy \ncombatant,'' with clear limits on who is subject to such a designation \nand is subject to indefinite detention as a result.\n  Sadly, section 1405 also undermines the giant step forward we took in \ngiving such overwhelming support to the McCain amendment and its \nprohibitions on abusive interrogation techniques. Yet section 1405 \nappears to undermine that amendment. We have established clear rules, \nbut the Graham amendment is a flagrant attempt to prevent their \nenforcement. That is not what we intended when nearly all of us voted \nfor Senator McCain's prohibition and that is not the message we intend \nto send to the world when we did so. In this devious maneuver, Congress \nhas slammed the front door on torture, then surreptitiously opened a \nback door to it. This legislation obviously raises larger policy \nconcerns in addition to its ambiguous statutory language and the \nconstitutional concerns. America was founded on the principle that no \none, especially not the President, is above the law.\n  Section 1405, however, sends exactly the wrong message. By barring \nclaims from the detainees, it creates a legal black hole in Guantnanamo \nwhere detainees can be abused and tortured. We can't continue to turn a \nblind eye to the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo. The actions of \nour Government, wherever they are taken, should be limited by the rule \nof law.\n  Yet this provision attempts to put Guantanamo above the rule of law. \nAs we try to build democratic societies in Iraq and Afghanistan, how \ncan we possibly prove to them that arbitrary imprisonment is wrong and \nthat all persons are entitled to humane treatment, when Congress so \nblatantly refuses to practice what it preaches? The hypocrisy is as \nbreathtaking as it is shameful.\n  It is an outrage that the conferees have included this irresponsible \nprovision in this must-pass bill, and I hope the Senate will do all it \ncan to remove it in the new session that begins in January.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/20/senate-section/article/S14170-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14170-S14172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DEFENSE CONTRACTING\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend the House and Senate conferees \nfor their agreement to extend the Defense Department program to prevent \ndefense contracting firms supporting or subsidizing the kind of \ndiscrimination that has long been a problem in such contracting. The \nextension through September 2009 is clearly needed to achieve that \nimportant goal.\n  Defense contracting has long been dominated by old-boy networks that \nmake it very difficult for African-Americans, Latinos, Asians, and \nNative Americans to participate fairly in these opportunities, or even \nobtain information about them. Minorities historically have been \nexcluded from both public and private construction contracts in \ngeneral, and from Federal defense contracts in particular. Since its \nadoption, the Defense Department's effort, called the 1207 program, has \nhelped level the playing field for minority contractors. Extending the \nprogram was a priority, since it's clear there is much more to do.\n  Since the program was first enacted in 1986, racial and ethnic \ndiscrimination has continued to be a substantial obstacle to minority \nparticipation in Federal contracts. In some cases, overt discrimination \nprevents minority-\n\n[[Page S14171]]\n\nowned businesses from obtaining needed loans and bonds. Prime \ncontractors, unions, and suppliers of goods and materials have \nconsistently preferred to do business with white contractors rather \nthan minority firms.\n  Minorities have been consistently underutilized in government \ncontracting. In 1996, the Urban Institute released a report documenting \nminority firms received only 57 cents in government contracts for every \ndollar they should have received based upon their eligibility.\n  For specific racial groups and women, the disparities were even \ngreater. African-American owned firms received only 49 cents on the \ndollar; Latino-owned firms, 44 cents; Asian-American owned firms, 39 \ncents; Native American-owned firms, 18 cents.\n  These statistics are particularly troubling, because they exist \ndespite affirmative action programs in many jurisdictions. Without such \nprograms, the problem would be worse. The Urban Institute report found \nthat disparities for minority- and women-owned firms were greatest in \nthe areas where no affirmative action program was in place. For African \nAmericans, the percentage dropped from 49 percent to 22 percent, for \nLatinos from 44 percent to 26 percent, for Asians from 39 percent to 13 \npercent, and for Native Americans from 18 percent to 4 percent. These \nfigures show that affirmative action is not only effective, but still \nurgently needed.\n\n  We've also seen repeated reports of bid shopping and of minority \nbusinesses being denied contracts despite submitting the lowest bid.\n  Also, the Department's decision to award a growing number of defense \ncontracts noncompetitively has excluded minority-owned businesses from \na significant number of contracting opportunities. No-bid contracts \nalso hurt white-owned businesses, but they disadvantage minority-owned \nfirms in particular.\n  These problems affect a wide variety of areas in which the Department \noffers contracts, and the problems are detailed in recent studies.\n  A 2002 Dallas study found that minority business enterprises were \nsignificantly disadvantaged in obtaining contract work. Evidence in \nthat report also suggests that discrimination takes place in subtle \nways, such as by making unrealistic demands on minority contractors, or \nrefusing to pay them on time. A Hispanic-American contractor noted that \non several occasions, he and other minority contractors were not \ninformed of bid opportunities with government agencies, even though \nthey performed services in the field. A Native American contractor in \ngoods and other services noted that some customers visit his company \nand walk out, once they see the owner is not a white man. Many minority \nfirms reported being consistently underestimated by white prime \ncontractors who assume they are not capable of doing the work because \nthey are minority-owned. Minority firms expressed concern that they \nwill never become large enough to compete for larger contracts if they \nare denied a chance to prove themselves on smaller contracts.\n  In Cincinnati, a 2002 study found that ``bid shopping'' by prime \ncontractors continues to harm minority firms. The firms also reported \nnumerous obstacles in seeking work in the city, such as denial of \nopportunities to bid, lack of response to minority presentations for \nbidding, limited financing, problems obtaining bonds, slow pay, \npredatory business practices, and stereotypical attitudes that \nminorities are incapable of performing good work.\n  A 2003 study of contracting in Ohio found racial prejudice in both \nthe public and private sectors. A State inspector was alleged to have \nexpressed hatred for African Americans in ugly terms. An African-\nAmerican professional service contractor said that his prime contractor \ndeliberately sabotaged his work by breaking his equipment. A state \ninspector conceded to an African-American contractor that he was \nrequiring him to do more expensive work than he would have required of \na large white-owned contractor doing an identical job nearby. Banks and \nunions sometimes contribute to the obstacles by discriminating against \nminorities in awarding financing.\n  A 2004 study in Alameda, CA, also found significant underutilization \nof minority-owned firms.\n  I have received a letter from an African-American business owner, Mr. \nJohn McDonald, explaining the difficulties minority firms face in the \ncontracting business and I ask unanimous consent to have it printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                December 18, 2005.\n     Senator Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Senate Armed Services Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: My name is John McDonald and I am an \n     African-American business owner. I understand that the Senate \n     will soon consider the reauthorization of the Department of \n     Defense's 1207 program. I want to urge you to make sure that \n     program continues. As my own experience over the last few \n     years makes clear, discrimination is still a serious and \n     pervasive problem for business owners in America. The \n     unfortunate reality today is that the playing field is still \n     not level for businessmen like me.\n       I work in the fields of institutional real estate \n     acquisition, development and construction. I am very good at \n     what I do and very proud of the quality of my work. Like most \n     businesspeople. I want to grow my company and succeed. This \n     desire comes both from pride in my business and from my \n     desire to give my family, that includes my five beautiful \n     children the best opportunity to succeed in life. I know that \n     the Department of Defense has spent millions of dollars on \n     contracts for the type of work that I do and while I have not \n     worked for DOD in the past, I would welcome the chance to do \n     so.\n       The problem for me, and many businesspeople like me, is \n     that discrimination often stands in our way. I would like to \n     share with you just one example of the seriousness of \n     discrimination against minority business people. A few years \n     ago, I entered into four triple net leases with Domino's \n     Pizza to purchase land and build four prototype corporate \n     leased stores in Las Vegas, Nevada. I purchased the sites \n     they selected, and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars \n     towards completing these stores based on a 30 year, triple \n     net lease. The money was from loans and personal funds \n     invested in my company it also included bank financing which \n     I personally guaranteed. The restaurants were beautiful, top \n     of the line establishments and Domino's even featured my work \n     at their convection in Las Vegas that year. I admit that I \n     was startled to find that I was the only African-American in \n     attendance at the convention, but I was so proud of my work \n     that I didn't think much of it at the time. That was soon to \n     change.\n       Soon after the convention, a senior Domino's official, \n     Debbie Pear called me and told me we had to amend our leases \n     in a way that no businessman in my position could do. She \n     wanted me to give Domino's the right to opt out of the lease \n     with a simple 30 day notice, reneging on the initial 30 year \n     obligation. In my field this is unheard of. When I refused to \n     do this, she made clear tbat she wasn't very concerned at my \n     objections and she said frankly ``I don't like doing business \n     with you people. anyway''. It was her position that I would \n     make the change as I couldn't afford not to. Domino's had \n     more money and could tie the matter up in court and I would \n     either be forced to make the change, or loose my business, \n     either way they would prevail. Sadly, that is exactly what \n     they did.\n       Domino's stopped paying rent to me on the very profitable \n     stores that were built by my company. They stifled \n     construction on stores by removing my name as landowner with \n     local county municipalities. They blocked financing as well \n     as the sale of these properties, making my company income \n     void. Within months, I had to file for bankruptcy. Domino's \n     slandered my name in an organized effort to have a Trustee \n     appointed to the case. who intentionally settled the company \n     claim with Domino's for a mere $45,000. As you could imagine \n     these tactics hit my business hard, and caused emotional and \n     financial trauma for me and my family. The fact is, big \n     corporate conglomerates such as Domino's Pizza, make fairness \n     in business impossible. As Americans, where free enterprise \n     is suppose to prevail, we cannot allow these businesses to \n     put small business out of business.\n       I am not a man who stands still in the face of injustice. I \n     have filed a lawsuit and my chum has been litigated all the \n     way to the U.S. Supreme Court which beard oral argument in my \n     case on December 6, 2005. The problem is that I do not want \n     to be in court while I am willing to stand up and fight for \n     my rights, I would rather spend my time building a business, \n     doing high quality work and providing for my family. \n     Unfortunately in my case, ongoing discrimination has made \n     that impossible.\n       Hopefully my story has made it clear how important these \n     types of programs are. There is such pervasive discrimination \n     in the private markets that we must have assistance from \n     programs like the 1207 program. Help us help all minority and \n     small business survive and fulfill the American dream. Please \n     ensure that this important program is continued.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    John McDonald.\n\n\n[[Page S14172]]\n\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. One of the purposes of this program is to ensure that \ngovernment contracting does not subsidize--even indirectly--private \ndiscrimination. Because discrimination affects contracting by private \nfirms as well as State and local governments, and all contractors bid \nin for these contracts as well as for Federal defense contracts, it is \nimportant to ensure a level playing field in Federal contracting.\n  Finally, the data in the Department of Commerce benchmark study \nsupports the need to improve contracting opportunities for minority-\nowned businesses.\n  The 1207 program helps to correct these pervasive problems of \ndiscrimination without imposing an undue burden on white-owned \nbusinesses. Small businesses owned by white contractors are eligible to \nreceive the benefits of the program if they are socially or \neconomically disadvantaged.\n  All of us benefit when recipients of Federal opportunities reflect \nAmerica's diversity, and I'm proud to support the reauthorization of \nthe 1207 program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/20/senate-section/article/S14172-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14172-S14173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CLIMATE NEGOTIATIONS IN MONTREAL\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of myself and \nSenators Lieberman, Biden, Carper, Feingold, Feinstein, Kerry, \nLautenberg, Obama, Reed, Reid, Sarbanes, and Wyden.\n  Over the last 2 weeks, 189 countries, including the United States, \nmet in Montreal, Canada, to discuss the issue of global climate change. \nThese countries are all signatories to the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change. The Montreal talks also included \ndiscussions by the 157 countries that are signatories to the Kyoto \nProtocol.\n  A key topic of the discussion was whether future talks could include \ndiscussions of additional commitments under the Framework Convention or \nthe Kyoto Protocol. The Bush administration's position from the outset \nwas that such discussions were a ``nonstarter'' and that the United \nStates would not engage in any such talks.\n  On December 5, 2005, 24 members of the Senate wrote to the Bush \nadministration to note that the United States remains a signatory to \nthe Framework Convention and thus is obligated to take actions to \n``prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate \nsystem.'' In the view of those Senators and others, blocking such talks \nwould be inconsistent with the international obligations of the United \nStates under the Framework Treaty.\n  The letter, which I submit for the Record, also noted that in June of \n2005, a bi-partisan majority of the Senate approved a resolution \ncalling for domestic legislation to achieve mandatory reductions in \ngreenhouse gas, GHG, emissions and recognizing the need for comparable \naction by major GHG emitters nations worldwide. It urged the Bush \nadministration to be mindful of this fact and to conduct its \nnegotiations accordingly. The signers of this letter hoped that it \nwould be useful in making clear that many in the United States, \nincluding a majority of members of the Senate, do not agree with the \nBush administration's position.\n  Despite the letter, the Bush delegation did their best to block and \nstall the negotiations and to send the message that the United States \nwill not take mandatory action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions for \nmany years to come. When it was time to actually negotiate about \nfurther commitment discussions, the chief negotiator of the United \nStates bluntly indicated that such discussions were unacceptable and \nabruptly walked away from the negotiating table.\n  The good news is that the rest of the countries involved were not \ndeterred by the U.S. walkout and ultimately reached agreement on a set \nof decisions that will allow initiation of further talks next year. \nOnly when confronted with this agreement in a public way did the United \nStates ultimately accept a version of those agreements.\n  This means that we have made progress and that further discussions \nwill take place under both the Framework Treaty and the Kyoto Treaty \nabout additional commitments. The clear message from the rest of the \nworld to the Bush administration is that we are moving forward. Such \nprogress can take place with or without the United States at the table.\n  The results of these negotiations are encouraging and open a variety \nof pathways to future U.S. engagement. The developments expand the \nopportunities available to the U.S. to fulfill its Framework Convention \nobligations to engage the international community prior to the \nFramework Convention and Kyoto Protocol meetings in 2006--in meeting \nthe Convention's goal of ``preventing dangerous anthropogenic \ninterference with the climate system.''\n  Even without the United States, those nations that are parties to the \nKyoto protocol have agreed to initiate a process by which commitments \nwill be established for the period following 2012, when the first \ncommitment phase of the Protocol ends. Contrary to the claims of some, \nthe Framework Convention process and the Kyoto process remain as viable \nlegal vehicles for future reductions of greenhouse gases.\n  It is also worth noting that the parties to the Framework Convention, \nincluding the United States, also agreed to initiate a process for \nconsidering reductions in greenhouse gas emissions through avoided \ndeforestation. As much as 25 percent of global GHG emissions are \ngenerated by tropical deforestation. The avoided deforestation \ninitiative, prompted by the efforts of Papua New Guinea and Costa Rica \nand endorsed by the G77 Group of Developing Nations and China, means \nthat developing countries are open to ways in which they could reduce \ntheir greenhouse gases emissions, consistent with the Framework \nConvention principle of ``common but differentiated responsibilities \nand respective capabilities.''\n  The United States is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases and has \nbeen for some time. We have an obligation to be a leader in the fight \nto reduce greenhouse gases. We have an obligation under the Framework \nConvention to take actions to ``prevent dangerous anthropogenic \ninterference with the climate system.'' We have not yet honored those \nobligations, even as other countries, including developing countries, \nmove forward.\n  A majority of Americans support taking some form of action on climate \nchange. A recent poll by the Program on International Policy Attitudes, \nsponsored by the Center for International and Security Studies at the \nUniversity of Maryland, found that 86 percent of Americans think that \nPresident Bush should act to limit greenhouse gases in the United \nStates if the G-8 countries are willing to act to reduce such gases. \nAll the G-8 countries except the United States are signatories to the \nKyoto Treaty. Finally, the study found that 83 percent of Americans \nfavor ``legislation requiring large companies to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions to 2000 levels by 2010 and to 1990 levels by 2020.''\n  We cannot afford further delay on climate change, which appears to be \nthe desired outcome of the Bush administration policy. The Montreal \ntalks are a positive step forward, but we need to do much more, much \nfaster. Climate change is here and it will accelerate the longer we \nwait. The time has come for the United States to adopt mandatory \nlegislation to reduce greenhouse gases and for the United States to \nreengage in the international negotiation process in a constructive \nway.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 5, 2005.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President, as you know, one of the most pressing \n     issues facing humankind is the problem of human-induced \n     global climate change. Between November 28 and December 9, \n     2005, 189 countries, including the United States, are meeting \n     in Montreal, Canada to discuss future actions that can be \n     taken under the United Nations Framework Convention on \n     Climate Change (UNFCCC). That conference will be the 11th \n     UNFCCC Conference of the Parties (COP 11). Simultaneously, \n     157 parties to the Kyoto Protocol, an extension of the \n     UNFCCC, will be meeting and the United States will \n     participate as an observer in that process, which will be the \n     first Meeting of the Parties (MOP1).\n       The United States is a signatory to the UNFCCC treaty, \n     which the Senate ratified in\n\n[[Page S14173]]\n\n     1992 and which entered into force in 1994. Article 2 of that \n     Convention commits the parties to achieving ``stabilization \n     of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level \n     that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with \n     the climate system.'' In addition, Article 4.2(d) requires \n     that the parties review the adequacy of measures relating to \n     the mitigation of climate change, beginning in 1998 and \n     ``thereafter at regular intervals.''\n       We are writing to remind the Administration of its \n     continuing legal obligation to participate in the COP \n     negotiations in a constructive way that will aid in meeting \n     the agreed-upon goal of ``preventing dangerous anthropogenic \n     interference with the climate system.'' In our view, a \n     deliberate decision by the Administration not to engage in \n     such discussions, solely because they may include the topic \n     of future binding emissions reductions requirements, is \n     inconsistent with the obligations of the United States as set \n     forth in the UNFCCC treaty. In any event, the United States \n     should, at a minimum, refrain from blocking or obstructing \n     such discussions amongst parties to the Convention, since \n     that would be inconsistent with its ongoing treaty \n     obligations.\n       We would also like you to be aware that a bipartisan \n     majority of the United States Senate has now agreed that \n     human-induced climate change is real and that ``mandatory \n     steps will be required to slow or stop the growth of \n     greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere.'' On June 22, \n     2005, the Senate went on Record for the first time in support \n     of mandatory limits on greenhouse gases by a vote of 53-44. \n     The Resolution states that:\n       ``It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should enact \n     a comprehensive and effective national program of mandatory, \n     market-based limits and incentives on emissions of greenhouse \n     gases that slow, stop, and reverse the growth of such \n     emissions at a rate and in a manner that--\n       (1) will not significantly harm the United States economy; \n     and\n       (2) will encourage comparable action by other nations that \n     are major trading partners and key contributors to global \n     emissions.''\n       As this Sense of the Senate Resolution makes clear, the \n     Senate intends, at some future date, to require a program of \n     mandatory greenhouse gas limits and incentives for the United \n     States. Moreover, that system will be designed to ensure \n     comparable action by other nations that trade with the United \n     States. This system, therefore, will build on the actions of \n     the United States and other countries in implementing the \n     UNFCCC. It is only a matter of time before Congress takes \n     such action.\n       The United States Senate is on the path towards requiring \n     mandatory commitments and reductions of greenhouse gases and \n     supports working through and alongside the Framework \n     Convention process. The Administration should remain mindful \n     of that key fact in its negotiations with all Parties and \n     comport any discussions about future obligations accordingly.\n       Sincerely,\n         Olympia Snowe, Jim Jeffords, John McCain, Jeff Bingaman, \n           Susan M.

Mr. President, I speak about the need for hate crimes \nlegislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate crimes \nlegislation that would add new categories to current hate crimes law, \nsending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our \nsociety. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight \na separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On Aug. 17, 2001 in Reno, NV, police and the F.B.I. arrested Adam \nEzerksi for the murders of several gay men in Florida and San \nFrancisco, CA. Ezerksi, a teenager, was suspected of being a serial \nkiller of gay men. He confessed to the murder of Anthony Martilotto, a \ngay man in Weston, FL. who was found dead in a Fort Lauderdale hotel \nroom. Police have linked Ezerksi to another murder of a gay man in \nFlorida. Ezerksi was discovered while the police and the F.B.I. were \npursuing another serial killer of gay men in the San Francisco area.\n  Our Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, in all \ncircumstances, from threats to them at home. The Local Law Enforcement \nEnhancement Act is a major step forward in achieving that goal. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/20/senate-section/article/S14173-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14173-S14174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the Violence \nAgainst Women Act, which Congress has finally reauthorized after many \ndelays. As my colleagues know, the final bill passed the Senate on \nFriday, it passed the House on Saturday, and it is now headed to the \nPresident for his signature.\n  As domestic violence leaders in my home State of Washington will tell \nyou, this reauthorization is long overdue. VAWA has been a critical \ntool for fighting domestic violence, and it should have never been \nallowed to expire. The Republican leadership finally recognized that, \nand now we will strengthen and expand that critical law.\n  Today I want to discuss some of the improvements we have passed--\nincluding new tools related to health care, housing, and abuse that \ninvolves police officers. I also want to share my disappointment that \nthe economic protections I have worked to include were removed when \nthis bill was considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  I have tried to advance critical economic protections at every turn, \nand I want to update my colleagues--and advocates in Washington State--\nabout where those efforts stand. I do want to thank several of my \ncolleagues for their hard work on this bill, including Senators Leahy, \nSpecter, Biden, Hatch, and Kennedy.\n  The original Violence Against Women Act, VAWA, created a national \nstrategy for dealing with domestic violence. And that strategy has been \nvery successful. VAWA brought together victims' advocates, social \nservice providers, and law enforcement professionals to meet the \nimmediate challenges of domestic violence. This bill reauthorizes and \nstrengthens those core programs.\n  This bill also creates new programs that represent important steps \nforward in areas such as health care, housing and officer-involved \nabuse.\n  The first new step concerns health care. For the first time, VAWA \nincludes a national health care response to domestic violence, dating \nviolence, sexual assault and stalking. It authorizes new grants to \ntrain health care providers to recognize and respond to domestic or \nsexual violence. These grants will help establish partnerships between \nvictims service providers and health care providers in State hospitals \nand public health departments. It also provides funding for direct \nservices for sexual assault victims, including 24-hour emergency and \nsupport services.\n  Second, this law now addresses housing inequities for victims by \nproviding new grants to help victims find long-term housing. It also \nprotects the confidentiality of victims who are receiving assistance \nfrom Department of Housing and Urban Development-funded programs. VAWA \nalso now includes provisions to protect mail-order brides and expands \nprotections for immigrant victims.\n  This legislation also addresses the issue of police officer-involved \ndomestic violence. I have spoken about this issue on the Senate floor \nbefore because of a terrifying case in Washington state. In April 2003, \nTacoma police chief David Brame shot and killed his wife, Crystal \nJudson Brame. Then he took his own life, all while their two young \nchildren watched. The final tragic act was the last in a long history \nof abusive events.\n  In response to this incident, the City of Tacoma, the Tacoma Police \nDepartment, and others formed a task force to examine officer-involved \ndomestic violence. They created a new policy for the Tacoma Police \nDepartment, and they helped pass a State law which requires that \ndepartments have policies on officer-involved abuse.\n  This VAWA bill gives local communities new resources to deal with \nabuse that involves police officers. It funds the Crystal Judson \nDomestic Violence Protocol Program. It allows law enforcement agencies, \nvictim service providers, and Federal, State and local governments to \nuse STOP grant funds to create new protocols for handling officer-\ninvolved domestic violence.\n  What happened in Tacoma is a tragedy that cannot be weighed. Out of \nthat tragedy, Washington State changed its laws, and now the Federal \nGovernment is giving communities across the country new tools to \naddress\n\n[[Page S14174]]\n\nofficer-involved abuse. So that new provision--along with the \nhealthcare and housing measures--represent new progress in fighting \ndomestic violence. But frankly, we have got a lot more work to do. I am \ndeeply disappointment that the economic protections I have been \nfighting for since 1998 were not included in this reauthorization--\ndespite some early progress.\n  If we are going to break the cycle of violence, we need to address \nthe economic barriers that trap victims in abusive relationships.\n  We know that financial insecurity is a major factor in ongoing \ndomestic violence. Too often, victims don't have the financial strength \nto leave a violent relationship. As a result, they are forced to choose \nbetween protecting themselves and keeping a roof over their heads. When \na victim cannot afford to move out, or cannot afford to pay the rent, \nor has lost a job because of abuse, that person is trapped, and \nCongress needs to help free them from that trap.\n  In this bill, we had an opportunity to help victims. In the Senate \nversion of the bill, I worked to include an unpaid leave provision. It \nwas in the Senate version, but it was dropped by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  In my view, that was wrong. It is like leaving someone trapped in a \nburning building. We should have knocked down the barriers and thrown \nopen the exit doors, but the Senate failed and that will have a real \nimpact on people trapped in abusive relationships.\n  The protections I sought were reasonable. It would have allowed \nvictims to take up to 10 days of unpaid leave per year to address \ndomestic violence. Over 40 percent of American workers get no paid time \noff. They cannot use vacation time to address abuse, and missing work \nputs them in danger of losing their job. My provision would have \nallowed victims to take unpaid leave to get a protective order, see a \ndoctor, or make a safety plan.\n  But unfortunately, there was opposition and complaints about \njurisdiction, and these protections were stripped from the bill during \nconsideration in the Judiciary Committee.\n  Once those protections were dropped, I kept fighting. I offered \nanother tool to help victims escape abusive relationships. I asked the \nmanagers of the bill to include a provision on unemployment insurance. \nI asked them to provide victims of domestic violence, dating violence, \nsexual assault, or stalking with unemployment insurance if they have to \nleave their job or are fired because of abuse.\n  We know that a job is often the only way for victims to build up the \nresources to leave a violent relationship, but abuse and stalking can \nmake it impossible for a victim to keep a job.\n  Many of my colleagues may recall the story of Yvette Cade, of \nMaryland. As reported in the Washington Post, Ms. Cade's estranged \nhusband showed up at her job at a wireless phone store, threw gasoline \non her, and lit her on fire. A restraining order against her estranged \nhusband had been dropped shortly before the incident, even though she \nhad indicated he was still threatening her.\n  Ms. Cade was burned over 60 percent of her body and remains in the \nhospital.\n  There are many more cases of abusers who deliberately sabotage a \nvictim's ability to work, placing harassing phone calls, cutting off \ntheir transportation, and showing up at the workplace and threatening \nother employees. When a victim loses a job because of violence, that \nvictim should have access to unemployment compensation benefits.\n  Some people might claim that it is too expensive to allow victims to \naccess unpaid leave. But I would remind my colleagues that domestic \nviolence imposes costs on a workplace too. When violence follows \nvictims into the workplace, it doesn't just hurt victims--it hurts \ntheir employers. It means less productivity and higher insurance costs.\n  So anyone who says it is too expensive to provide unpaid leave should \nalso remember that domestic violence is expensive to businesses to in \nboth lives and dollars. Providing the tools that will allow abused \nwomen to escape abusive relationships can help offset billions of \ndollars in costs that domestic violence imposes on businesses.\n  Unfortunately, my efforts to include unpaid leave provisions were \nrejected as well. But I am not giving up. I have been at this since \n1998 and I know who I am fighting for. I have been to the shelters in \nmy State, and I have talked with the victims. I have met with their \nadvocates, and I am not giving up on them.\n  I am going to keep pushing for my SAFE Act, which stands for the \nSecurity and Financial Empowerment Act. It contains the protections \nvictims need to break the cycle of violence. I thank Senators Leahy, \nCorzine, Dayton and Dodd for signing on as original cosponsors, and \nwould invite all of my colleagues to sign on as well.\n  I am going to continue to tell their stories because we need to hear \ntheir voices here in the Senate. It is easy to argue about \njurisdiction, but that doesn't mean anything to someone who is getting \nbeaten up every night. It is easy to argue about the cost of unpaid \nleave--but that doesn't mean anything to someone who needs to get a \nprotective order so they can escape a violent relationship.\n  This Congress has a lot of work to do to help victims, and I will \ncome to this Senate floor as many times as it takes, until we finally \ngive victims the help they need and deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/20/senate-section/article/S14174-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14174-S14175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President I ask that the following editorial which \nwas written by my good friend, former Senator Fritz Hollings, and \npublished in the Charleston Post and Courier on October 27, 2005, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Misled About Iraq, Secure It or Leave\n\n       A G.I. with his legs blown away in Iraq asks, ``Senator, \n     why did we go into Iraq?'' Answer: ``to secure Israel by \n     democratizing the Mideast.'' Immediately my over-sensitive \n     Jewish friends withdraw in horror: ``There you go, blaming \n     Israel.'' Not at all. The fact is that Israel opposed the \n     plan. Now, with our unwarranted invasion and al-Jazeera \n     reporting daily on U.S. ``atrocities,'' we are spreading \n     terrorism and have damaged the security of Israel.\n       In 1996, incoming Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of \n     Israel commissioned a think-tank headed by Richard Pearle, \n     Douglas Feith and David Wurmser. The three submitted the plan \n     ``Clean Break'': Negotiating with Arafat is futile. Instead, \n     secure Israel by democratizing the Middle East.\n       First bomb Lebanon. Next invade Syria on the pretext of it \n     possessing weapons of mass destruction. Then replace Saddam \n     with a Hashemite ruler favorable to Israel. Netanyahu \n     rejected ``Clean Break.''\n       Determined, Pearle, Feith and Wurmser returned to the \n     United States and joined in the Project for the New American \n     Century with Dick Cheney, Paul Wolfowitz, Donald Rumsfeld and \n     Scooter Libby, among others. In 1998, the group prevailed on \n     Congress for regime change in Iraq, and the Senate by a voice \n     vote adopted such a resolution. At the time, no senator \n     thought we were endorsing an invasion--just encouraging \n     resistance in Iraq. But when George W. Bush was elected \n     president ``Clean Break'' hit pay dirt.\n       The Project for the New American Century crowd took office. \n     Richard Cheney became vice president, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz and \n     Feith took the number first, second and third positions in \n     the Department of Defense. Richard Pearle became chairman of \n     the Defense Advisory Board. ``Scooter'' Libby and David \n     Wurmser were advising Cheney.\n       President Bush, days before taking office in 2001, sought a \n     briefing on, of all things, Iraq from then Secretary of \n     Defense William Cohen.\n       Secretary of Treasury Paul O'Neill tells in ``The Price of \n     Loyalty'' how he was astonished at the first meeting of the \n     National Security Council. He went to discuss the recession \n     but all talk was about Iraq. The day after 9/11, President \n     Bush turned to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, \n     requesting a plan to invade Iraq even though Iraq had nothing \n     to do with 9/11. The administration was determined to invade \n     Iraq.\n       Jason Leopold and Larisa Alexandrovna in ``Raw Story'' now \n     report: ``Although the CIA documents that Wurmser and his \n     staff pored over showed Iraq as being an immediate threat, \n     Wurmser was dead-set on finding and presenting evidence to \n     Vice President Dick Cheney that suggested as much, even if \n     the veracity of such intelligence was questionable.\n       ``Wurmser helped Cheney's office, particularly ``Scooter'' \n     Libby, construct a case for war. He met frequently with \n     Cheney, Libby, Feith and Richard Pearle, the former head of \n     the Defense Policy Board, to go over the ``evidence'' of the \n     threat posed by Saddam Hussein that could then be used by the \n     White House to build public support. Wurmser routinely butted \n     heads with the CIA over the veracity of the intelligence he \n     was providing to Cheney's office.''\n       In short, the invasion of Iraq was not based on \n     intelligence but was contrived. ``But Senator why did you \n     vote to go into Iraq?'' Answer: I followed the rationale of \n     the White\n\n[[Page S14175]]\n\n     House for invasion carefully. Having served on the Hoover \n     Commission investigating the intelligence activities of the \n     United States with Gen. Mark Clark, I learned that Israel's \n     intelligence, Mossad, is the best on the Middle East. As an \n     island of democracy in a sea of hostility, Israel has to know \n     what is going on in Baghdad. Israel has no time to call for a \n     summit meeting or to go to the United Nations. Any real \n     threat must be knocked out immediately.\n       This is why Israel knocked out Iraq's nuclear facility \n     without warning in 1981. Days before we voted, President Bush \n     said, ``Facing clear evidence of peril, we cannot wait until \n     the smoking gun is a mushroom cloud.'' When the commander-in-\n     chief says this, he's got my vote.\n       I was sure Mossad had found nuclear weapons and we were \n     knocking them out and eliminating Saddam.\n       Now we're waiting for Iraqis to do what we've never done--\n     secure Iraq; secure the Syrian and Iranian borders \n     immediately; and clean out the Sunni triangle. It would cause \n     casualties but to fight a war you have to fight a war. Either \n     get in or get out.\n       If we're not going to secure Iraq, then the next best thing \n     is to get Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani to ask us to leave.\n       Ernest F. Hollings, a Democrat, served as a U.S. senator \n     for South Carolina from 1966 to 2003.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/20/senate-section/article/S14175-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CONGRESSMAN MURTHA\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, one of the reasons I love and respect my \nwife Teresa Heinz Kerry so very much is because she has always \nmaintained the strength of her convictions. She speaks her mind, and \nshe speaks the truth. I am especially proud of her passionate defense \nof her fellow Pennsylvanian--the decorated veteran and respected \nmilitary expert, Representative Jack Murtha. In a recent essay, \nTeresa's powerful words spoke of Jack Murtha's courage and integrity \nrose above the disparaging and unconscionable words of those who \nsmeared him. As I read what she wrote, I realized why this issue had \nstruck such a chord with her--and why she was able to speak with such \nincredible clarity--because, as someone who grew up under a \ndictatorship, Teresa believes deeply in the freedom of every American \nto speak their mind without fear of condemnation.\n  The characteristics we all admire in Representative Murtha--honesty, \ncompassion, strength and patriotism--are the characteristics that make \nTeresa such an incredible citizen. I am glad she spoke out, and for \nthat reason, I ask that her words be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        [From CNHI News Service]\n\n                        (By Teresa Heinz Kerry)\n\n                 Assault on Murtha Should Alarm Us All\n\n       ``Because we in Congress are charged with sending our sons \n     and daughters into battle, it is our responsibility, our \n     obligation, to speak out for them. That's why I am speaking \n     out.''\n       U.S. Rep. John Murtha, Nov. 17, ``War In Iraq.''\n       U.S. Rep. John Murtha completely changed the public debate \n     in our country by calling for an immediate redeployment of \n     our troops in Iraq. Whether you agree or disagree with his \n     specific proposal is not the point--but his critics' words \n     demand a response. Murtha speaks with special authority.\n       His national security credentials are impeccable. His \n     patriotism is unwavering. His influence on national defense \n     is unsurpassed. None in Congress spends as much time as \n     Murtha with the wounded from the Iraq war. His voice on \n     matters of national defense deserves--indeed, commands--great \n     respect. This is why his political opponents think him so \n     dangerous. The orchestrated assault on Murtha should alarm us \n     all. Just when you thought the debate could sink no lower, \n     the politicians committed to staying the course in Iraq \n     turned the fire hoses of smear and intimidation on this icon \n     of national security. Listen to what they said:\n       They said he had given aid and comfort to the enemy. They \n     accused him of abandoning the troops. And one rookie \n     representative, the most junior member in the House, so lost \n     any decency or sense of decorum that she called Murtha a \n     coward.\n       I think they smeared the wrong representative. Murtha's \n     history is one of heroism and leadership. He served in the \n     Marine Corps from 1952 to 1955. He served as a Marine Corps \n     drill instructor and a reservist. He re-upped so he could \n     serve in Vietnam. He was wounded twice while serving as a \n     Marine intelligence officer, and then went back into the \n     reserves from 1967 to 1990. He was the first Vietnam veteran \n     elected to the Congress, where he has served with honor and \n     distinction as a bipartisan advocate of national defense ever \n     since.\n       How bipartisan? When President Reagan wanted to build the \n     MX missile, Murtha broke with his party to fight for what \n     Reagan called the ``peacekeeper.'' Reagan sent him to El \n     Salvador and the Philippines as an election observer and, as \n     an official representative of the United States, to Pakistan \n     to attend President Zia's funeral. When President George H.W. \n     Bush said of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, ``this will not \n     stand,'' Murtha stood with him and voted to use military \n     force to drive Iraq out.\n       His credentials on national defense are unimpeachable. He \n     has been named Minuteman of the Year by the Reserve Officers \n     Association of the United States. He has been honored by the \n     Blinded American Veterans Foundation. He is a winner of the \n     Henry M. Jackson Distinguished Service Award, and an honoree \n     of the Association of the United States Army. When Murtha \n     received the distinguished public service award from the \n     American Legion, he was praised by the national commander as \n     a veteran, supporter of a strong national defense and holder \n     of an outstanding track record on veterans' issues.\n       That is Jack Murtha's history, and the summer soldiers and \n     the sunshine patriots who attack him cannot rewrite it. \n     That's why they resort instead to the most reprehensible type \n     of personal attacks. We've seen this before. I know and love \n     another Vietnam veteran who served our country with \n     distinction and honor--who suffered the slings and arrows of \n     distortions, half-truths and falsehoods.\n       Scoundrels who would stifle debate and smear dissenters \n     weaken our democracy and diminish our Nation's ability to \n     make decisions and change course when circumstances demand.\n       This war is hard--hard to win, hard to support, and for \n     most, hard to figure out. We all want the best for our \n     troops, our country, the Iraqi people and what is best for \n     the Middle East. Much is at stake.\n       But if we want the best outcome, the best minds we have \n     must be free to express their strongest beliefs and best \n     advice. Murtha has earned our respect. His right to speak out \n     is an intrinsic component of our democracy. It should be \n     honored--we should hold that right sacred--even if his words \n     deviate from the party line, the president's talking points, \n     or public opinion.\n       I think Murtha did our country an enormous public service \n     for speaking out as he did, and I support for him for \n     exercising his right. A courageous person is always to be \n     admired.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/20/senate-section/article/S14175-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14175-S14176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HUGS NOT BULLETS CAMPAIGN 2006\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to commend an outstanding \ngroup of young people in Detroit, MI, for their efforts to reduce gun \nviolence as part of the Neighborhood Service Organization's Youth \nInitiatives Project. Their dedication to this admirable cause is \ncertainly worthy of our recognition and appreciation.\n  The Youth Initiatives Project was created in 1999 to address growing \ncommunity issues including violence and substance abuse in Detroit. For \n6 years, students, community organizations, and local police have been \ninvolved in a coordinated effort to accomplish the goals of the \nproject. Many of these goals are centered on the need to reduce gun \nviolence.\n  Hundreds of Detroit teenagers have been involved in the Youth \nInitiatives Project through activities such as afterschool programs to \nreduce gun violence, gun buybacks, anti-violence rallies, and gun \nsafety workshops. As part of these activities, the Youth Initiatives \nProject has been responsible in the last 3 years for handing out more \nthan 5,000 free trigger locks to Detroit gun owners.\n  The Youth Initiatives Project's ``Hugs Not Bullets'' campaign for \n2005 built upon their overall theme of reducing gun violence, while \nalso putting a specific focus on the use of firearms during the \ncelebration of the New Year's holiday. In addition to hosting a number \nof public forums and rallies, the Hugs Not Bullets campaign used \nseveral 4-foot by 8-foot cards to collect signatures of those who \npledge not to engage in gun violence. To date, more than 3,000 \nDetroiters have signed these cards. These cards serve as a powerful \nsymbol of the community's determination to fight gun violence.\n  For 2006, the Youth Initiatives Project plans to expand the Hugs Not \nBullets campaign into a comprehensive grass roots and media campaign \nagainst gun violence. This year, more than 200 Youth Initiatives \nProject participants will reach out to their peers by visiting \ncommunity centers, schools, and churches, as well as social clubs and \nevents widely attended by other teenagers. In addition, the Hugs Not \nBullets campaign will amplify its antigun violence message through \npublic service announcements and appearances on local television and \nradio. This is an ambitious next step, which will build upon the \nprevious success of the campaign.\n\n[[Page S14176]]\n\n  It is important to also recognize the contributions these young \npeople are making in their communities outside of their official \nparticipation in the Youth Initiatives Project. The Youth Initiatives \nProject gives young people valuable knowledge and experience, thereby \nenabling them to push for change in their own neighborhoods and \ncommunities on a daily basis. For the rest of their lives, these \nteenagers will be able to draw on the communications and conflict \nresolution skills they have gained through the Youth Initiatives \nProject to make a difference in their own lives and those around them.\n  I know my colleagues will join me in thanking the participants, \norganizers, and supporters of the Youth Initiatives Project for their \noutstanding dedication to the worthwhile goal of reducing gun violence. \nThis is a program which can serve as an appropriate model to be \nfollowed in many cities across the Nation. I hope my colleagues will \nalso join me in working to pass commonsense gun safety legislation to \nmore adequately support their efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/20/senate-section/article/S14176-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          POPULATION EXPLOSION\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about developing \ncountries around the world that are dealing with population explosions. \nAs we near the end of the year, we are trying to wrap things up before \nthe Senate goes out of session. But we continue to ignore this \nimportant issue.\n  This topic does not get very much attention here on the Senate floor, \nbut in the developing world, there is a population explosion. Some \nexperts believe that the population of Earth may top 9 billion by 2050. \nEighty-eight percent of Americans believe that international population \ngrowth is either a major problem right now or that it will become one \nin the future. Almost all of the growth is occurring in countries that \nare the least able to govern, ensure jobs for, and care for their \ncitizens.\n  But this is also about safe access to health care for women. Even \nthough these countries are experiencing huge population growths, \nhundreds of thousands of women are dying each year from complications \nfrom pregnancy. These women do not have access to the health care that \nthey need, especially reproductive health care.\n  In many poor countries around the world, nongovernmental \norganizations and medical professionals are working to make things \nbetter. They have set up clinics and reached out to the women and \nfamilies in poor communities. They are doing great work. But their \nhands are tied because the Bush administration has imposed a political \nideology on the world.\n  When President Bush took office in 2001, he signed an Executive order \nknown as the global gag rule. It denies U.S. funds to any overseas \nhealth clinic unless it agrees not to use its own private, non-U.S. \nfunds for anything related to abortion. What that means, is that if you \nare a medical professional living in an impoverished country trying to \nhelp people and save their lives, you are gagged from even talking \nabout certain reproductive health services. The gag rule places limits \non women and doctors that we would never accept here in the United \nStates.\n  Earlier this year, the Senate passed an amendment to the Foreign \nAffairs Authorization Act to reverse the President's policy and ensure \nthat health care clinics for women and families receive this much-\nneeded funding. Unfortunately, this legislation has not passed by the \nfull Senate. I am pleased that the Foreign Operations appropriations \nbill contains $34 million for the United Nations Populations Fund, \nUNPA, for this purpose. But in order to ensure that this money goes \ntoward funding health care clinics for women and families in poor \ncountries, we must overturn this global gag rule.\n  In closing, I would like to share the following article, which ran on \nDecember 3, 2005, with my colleagues because I believe that it provides \nsome important food for thought as we continue to work on this \nimportant issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my remarks and the following article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Does Population Explosion Threaten U.S.?\n\n                           (By David Horsey)\n\n       Flying in or out of Mexico City, the traveler can look down \n     on the human sprawl metastasizing in every direction. The \n     Mexican megalopolis is now home to 25 million people and vies \n     for first place among the world's most gigantic cities. From \n     a bird's eye view, it's easy to conclude that the planet has \n     more than enough homo sapiens taking up space.\n       Having just flown back from a study tour in Mexico that \n     focused on issues of overpopulation, family planning and \n     development, I can report positive news on the population \n     front. In the developed world, population growth has been put \n     in check. Birth rates are roughly at replacement levels and \n     no higher.\n       An even better story is Mexico. Not that long ago, the \n     Mexican population was spiraling out of control with an \n     average seven children per family. The population doubled \n     between 1950 and 1970 and doubled again by the end of the \n     20th century. Today, though, thanks in large part to \n     government commitment and successful family-planning \n     measures, the fertility rate has dropped to about 2.1, \n     putting Mexico on track to see a leveling off of population \n     by 2015.\n       However, this good news is qualified by a disturbing \n     caveat. The successes of recent years have created \n     complacency. Some people think the population bomb has been \n     defused while in reality only the easier part of the job has \n     been done.\n       In the developing world, the numbers continue to explode. \n     Earth's current human population of 6.5 billion may top 9 \n     billion by 2050 and 99 percent of the growth will be in the \n     least developed nations. If these countries fail to follow \n     Mexico's path, calamity may be just around the corner. In the \n     regions of the world that are the most poor and the least \n     able to care for, employ or govern their rapidly expanding \n     populations, widespread famine, environmental destruction and \n     social collapse are inevitable.\n       Most countries have reached agreement on what needs to be \n     done to avert such disaster, but, in recent years, the United \n     States has been a maverick on the population issue. The \n     politics of abortion and religion have given current leaders \n     reason to act as if it is not our problem.\n       Is this an area where self-interest and traditional values \n     dictate that we let less fortunate countries find a way to \n     cope on their own? Here's my Burning Question:\n       Is the developing world's population explosion a threat to \n     America?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/20/senate-section/article/S14176-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14176-S14177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PAKISTAN EARTHQUAKE RELIEF\n\n  Mr. ALLEN.

Over the past 2\\1/\n2\\ years, our brave soldiers have fought courageously and nobly \nsacrificed to extend the sphere of liberty into what was--up until \ntheir arrival--one of the darkest, most despotic alleys on Earth. Their \nheroic work has helped deliver a new free and just country into the \nfamily of nations.\n  We here at home watch the developments in Iraq with a feeling of \npride. We are proud of our troops who have borne so much to advance the \ncause of freedom. We are proud of the Iraqi people, who risked their \nown lives to cast ballots three times this year for a better future. \nAnd we are proud of the heritage of our country--from the American \nRevolutionary secession from the British monarchy to the Second World \nWar against fascism to the Cold War against imperial communism to \ntoday's fight against global terrorists, America has been the shining \ncity on a hill--an ally to all men and women--on every continent, in \nevery country--who yearn to breathe free.\n  In addition to Iraq, we have extended our hand of friendship to the \npeople of Pakistan. A little more than 2 months ago, a devastating \nearthquake ripped through northern Pakistan. The toll from this tragedy \nis almost impossible to comprehend: 79,000 men and women lost their \nlives, an additional 72,000 were injured, and a total of 2.9 million \npeople are now homeless.\n  Last month, my wife Susan cochaired a charity event near our home in \nVirginia to raise money for the earthquake victims. She then joined me \nwhen I traveled to Pakistan to visit some of the victims, and the 1,200 \nU.S. troops who are now stationed in Pakistan to assist in the \nrecovery.\n  We presented a check to the Citizens Foundations charity, which will \nuse the money to rebuild the Bagh School for Girls and other schools. \nWhen we visited a Pakistani classroom for children needing medical \ntreatment, we\n\n[[Page S14177]]\n\nsaw children on the floor, singing in English, learning new words, and \npainting artwork as well. On the wall behind the teacher was a drawing \nof a green Chinook helicopter and on the side of the helicopter was a \nbig painted smile across the length of the helicopter.\n  That is the way these young people look at the United States. They \nare looking at these vessels of our military not as weapons of war but \nas machines that bring relief, and help. Later, Susan and I had supper \nwith our troops there at the airfield. We told them how proud we are of \ntheir outstanding relief effort, about what great ambassadors they are, \nnot just for the strength of America but also for the caring heart of \nAmerica.\n  Today, in Pakistan, the heart of America is needed more than ever. As \ninternational attention fades and funds dry up, millions of earthquake \nsurvivors are now facing a harsh, cold winter. In the remote Himalayan \nregion, villages at altitudes of 5,000 to 7,000 feet will soon be \ncovered in snow. By leaving the earthquake victims exposed to the \nHimalayan winter, there is the real risk of seeing perhaps hundreds of \nthousands of preventable deaths.\n  We should not let such deaths happen. And thankfully, avoiding this \ntragic scenario is in our power. Our U.S. administration has pledged \nover $500 million in aid, but these funds are urgently needed today and \nmust reach the devastated people of Pakistan as soon as possible.\n  During this holiday season, and beyond, we should continue to help \nAmericans in Louisiana and Mississippi and extend our arms to the \npeople of Pakistan. By saving hundreds of thousands of lives during the \nharsh Himalayan winter, we can transform this tragic event into a story \nof hope, courage and perseverance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/20/senate-section/article/S14177-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   INDIAN HEALTH CARE IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to explain my action today \nrelated to S. 1057, a bill to amend the Indian Health Care Improvement \nAct. I requested that Leader Frist inform me prior to entering into any \nunanimous consent agreement relating to any amendments, motions, or any \nother actions relating to consideration of this bill.\n  This legislation exempts American Indians/Alaskan Natives from being \ncharged a deductible, copayment, or coinsurance for an item or service \nfor which payment may be made under the Medicaid or SCHIP programs in \nthe Social Security Act. I am reluctant to treat one group differently \nfrom other groups. In my opinion, this is a precedent setting change. \nIf we start by exempting one group from costsharing, then many other \ngroups may start asking for the same exemption.\n  This legislation also exempts several types of property from being \nconsidered in Medicaid eligibility. We understand that there may be \nspecial circumstances that may necessitate the need for these \nprovisions. We have requested additional information from the Indian \nAffairs Committee to facilitate our understanding of these exemptions. \nHowever, we have not yet received the requested information. In my \nopinion, without further information, these provisions send the message \nthat resources are irrelevant to a determination of Medicaid \neligibility. I don't believe that individuals should have significant \nresources and still be eligible for Medicaid. These provisions would \ncreate an imbalance by allowing a loophole solely for one group.\n  I want to be clear: it is not that I am concerned about making these \nchanges for American Indians/Alaskan Natives, I am concerned about \nmaking these changes for any group. I welcome the opportunity to \ncontinue to work with the sponsors of this legislation, Senators McCain \nand Dorgan, and with members of the Indian Affairs Committee on this \nmatter. My staff has been working with staff from the Indian Affairs \nCommittee, but they have not yet resolved my concerns.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/20/senate-section/article/S14177-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               COMMENDING THE SERVICE OF JAMES D.E. JONES\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the \ndeparture of Mr. James D.E. Jones from the Port Authority of New York \nand New Jersey. A native of Morristown, NJ, Mr. Jones has served with \nthe Port Authority for 20 years, 19 of them in the Washington, DC, \noffice. During this time, he served as liaison with Congress and \nseveral administrations on issues involving aviation, surface \ntransportation, economic development, and public finance. I know Mr. \nJones primarily for his efforts and expertise on aviation matters.\n  As a former Port Authority commissioner, I can tell you that the Port \nAuthority is the most complex regional transportation agency in the \ncountry. It runs three major airports where almost 100 million \npassengers traveled in and out of last year. It operates the largest \nseaport on east coast of the United States and the second largest \ncontainer port in the country. It runs a bistate mass transit system \nand maintains under its care and responsibility such landmark assets as \nthe Lincoln Tunnel, the Holland Tunnel, the Bayonne Bridge, the George \nWashington Bridge, and the World Trade Center complex in lower \nManhattan.\n  During his service at the Port Authority, Mr. Jones assisted \npolicymakers in Washington as our country debated such ideas as \nderegulation of the airline industry to responding to the 9/11 terror \nattacks, which involved a substantial modification of how we provide \nfor aviation security in our country.\n  Previously, Mr. Jones served as a senior staff member in the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation's Office of the Secretary, where he \nfocused on policy development and international agreements. In that \ncapacity, he represented the U.S. Secretary of Transportation in dozens \nof bilateral international negotiations on aviation, taking him to 20 \nforeign countries.\n  Mr. Jones completed his undergraduate work at Howard University and \nreceived his MBA degree from Harvard University Business School. His \naccomplishments are evidence that his skills have certainly served him \nwell throughout his career.\n  I am thankful for Mr. Jones' service at the Port Authority. His \ntalents were a great asset to policymakers and lawmakers throughout the \nFederal Government, and his services helped shape policies for our \ncountry that make our aviation system the envy of the world.\n  On behalf of many New Jersey travelers, I thank Mr. Jones, and I wish \nhim continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/20/senate-section/article/S14177-3", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CONGRATULATING THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL TEAM\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am excited to congratulate the \nwomen Huskies on their terrific win in the NCAA Championships. Not only \nhas UW's women's volleyball team given the University a new \nchampionship trophy, but they have given young girls across our State \nnew role-models and proof that they can reach their dreams.\n  We need to ensure that any young girl who dreams of making the team, \nwearing a sports jersey or winning a college championship has the \nopportunity to succeed. That's why--as a Congress--we need to protect \nTitle IX and the future of every girl in Washington State and around \nthe country who wants to play sports.\n  For the past 33 years, Title IX has opened doors to athletics, \neducation and success for millions of young women across America. Title \nIX is not about politics, it is about helping young women--like the \nmembers of UW's women's volleyball team--achieve their dreams.\n  I am proud of the UW women's volleyball team, their 32-1 record, and \nthe fact that they became the first team in a 64-team NCAA tournament \nformat to win all six matches by a sweep. I know I join volleyball fans \nstatewide--and young female athletes everywhere--in congratulating them \non their accomplishment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/20/senate-section/article/S14177-4", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14177-S14180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO STAN AND EUNICE KIMMITT\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the lives of \ntwo people very close to me, Montana, and the Senate. Stan and Eunice \nKimmitt were both remarkable individuals and touched many lives over \nthe years. In an effort to preserve their memory, I\n\n[[Page S14178]]\n\nthink it is fitting that I share the kind remarks made at their \nfunerals with the full Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the material be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Eulogy to J. Stanley Kimmitt\n\n             (December 21, 2004, Ft. Myer Memorial Chapel)\n\n       The poet and dramatist William Butler Yeats once wrote: \n     ``Being Irish, you know that in times of great joy you're \n     comforted by the thought that tragedy lurks around the \n     corner.'' Stan Kimmitt had a lot of Irishman in him. On March \n     20, 1972, my siblings and I threw a surprise 25th wedding \n     anniversary reception for my parents, during which I said a \n     few words. Driving to dinner that evening, my father was as \n     happy as I had ever seen him, so he returned to his Irish \n     roots and said, ``Let's talk about my funeral.'' ``Bob,'' he \n     said, ``I really liked your words today. For my funeral Mass, \n     I would like you to write the eulogy--but have your brother \n     Tom deliver it.'' In the ensuing 32 years, I never mustered \n     enough courage to ask what my delivery deficiencies were on \n     that March day long ago. But, since Dr. Tom is watching today \n     with Dad and our sisters Kathy and Margaret from premier \n     upper deck seats, the honor of both composing and delivering \n     brief remarks falls to me.\n       The first thing Dad would want me to do is to thank all of \n     you for joining us today. He would be humbled, but also very \n     pleased, by this turnout. Second, he would ask me to thank \n     all those who are involved in today's events, especially the \n     soldiers of the Old Guard, the Congressional Chorus, his \n     partner Deacon Vinnie Coates, and especially Archbishop Edwin \n     O'Brien of the Military Archdiocese. Archbishop O'Brien first \n     met my dad when serving as a young priest at West Point \n     during my years as a cadet. The Archbishop later volunteered \n     for military service himself, went to jump school, and served \n     as a combat chaplain in Vietnam with many of us in attendance \n     today in the 173rd Airborne Brigade and 1st Cavalry Division. \n     What a wonderful person not only to celebrate today's Mass, \n     but also to help provide spiritual direction to our brave \n     young servicewomen and men both at home and abroad.\n       We Catholics use the term ``celebrate'' even for funeral \n     Masses. We celebrate, because we firmly believe that our \n     father Stan is now in a better, more peaceful place. And that \n     is how I think of today, celebrating an extraordinary man and \n     the exemplary life of service he lived.\n       Dad did not come from a government or service background, \n     far from it. He was born in 1918 in Lewistown, Montana, the \n     son of a prosperous wheat farmer who was the largest \n     landowner in the fertile Judith Basin, and he later moved to \n     Great Falls. With the Great Depression, however, all material \n     wealth was lost, and his family's life story went from riches \n     to rags. However, he was firmly determined to be the first in \n     his family to attend college, which he did at the University \n     of Montana in Missoula. He admitted that he majored in \n     football and minored in bartending, but fortunately for his \n     later career, one class he did attend was an Asian History \n     course taught by a young professor named Mike Mansfield.\n       Dad was drafted in 1941 and was assigned to the mule-drawn \n     pack artillery of what would become the 10th Mountain \n     Division. Not wanting, as he said, to ``spend the war on the \n     south end of a mule,'' he went to Officer Candidate School at \n     Fort Sill and then trained and led Battery C, 309th Field \n     Artillery of the 78th ``Lightning'' Division from 1942 to \n     1945. Sixty years ago today, the battery was fighting in the \n     Battle of the Bulge, then proceeded to the Hurtgen Forest, \n     crossed the Rhine River at Remagen, and became the first \n     American division to occupy Berlin. Alongside him throughout \n     was then Colonel, later Major General Bob Schellman, my \n     parents' best man and my namesake and godfather, whose widow \n     Helen and son Jim are here today. In the recently written \n     words of Len Cravath, one of Dad's soldiers: ``Stan Kimmitt \n     was my Captain, our leader, and our inspiration.'' Lewis \n     Guidry, another soldier, called me and said: ``Your father \n     took a bunch of boys and turned us into men. We will never \n     forget him.''\n       In the Korean War, Dad commanded the 48th Field Artillery \n     Battalion of the 7th Infantry Division. His bravery during \n     the Battle of Pork Chop Hill was immortalized in S.L.A. \n     Marshall's book of the same name. Less well known is an \n     incident recounted in a recently-published book called ``On \n     Hallowed Ground, the Last Battle for Pork Chop Hill:'' \n     ``Lieutenant Colonel Kimmitt was an aggressive, hard-charging \n     artillery commander who always worked closely with the \n     infantry. He was at the infantry battalion CP when the \n     personnel carrier brought Ray Barry . . . to the nearby \n     battalion aid station. Kimmitt went into the aid station, and \n     saw his former battery commander, Ray Barry, on a table, \n     obviously critically wounded and near death. . . . A few \n     minutes earlier, the 7th Division G-2 had arrived by \n     helicopter. Kimmitt, seeing the severity of Barry's wounds, \n     went immediately to the helicopter and told the waiting pilot \n     to fly the wounded officer to the MASH. . . . At first the \n     pilot balked, and told Kimmitt the helicopter belonged to the \n     division G-2. With a few choice, sharp words Kimmitt said he \n     did not give a damn who it belonged to, the pilot would fly \n     the wounded Ray Barry to a MASH, right now. When Kimmitt told \n     the battalion surgeon who examined Barry he had a helicopter \n     to evacuate him, the doctor's words were less than \n     encouraging. `He won't make it to the MASH. He's lost too \n     much blood.' '' Ray Barry, who won a Silver Star for his \n     bravery that day, is today alive, well, and a retired Colonel \n     in Texas.\n       In 1955, Dad was assigned to the Office of the Chief of \n     Legislative Liaison, ``Army L,'' where he reacquainted \n     himself with Mike Mansfield and befriended such titans as \n     Richard Russell, John Stennis, Everett Dirksen, John Pastore, \n     Theodore Francis Green, Stuart Symington, and Scoop Jackson. \n     In 1960 we moved to Germany, first to Heidelberg then to \n     Baumholder. In August 1961, he was with the battle group of \n     the 8th Infantry Division that drove from the Soviet \n     checkpoint at Helmstedt to Berlin shortly after the Wall went \n     up to assert Allied transit rights. He later commanded the \n     8th Division Artillery, which included an Airborne Artillery \n     Battalion, so he started the family's airborne heritage by \n     going to jump school at age 44.\n       In 1966 he accepted Mike Mansfield's offer to retire from \n     the Army to become Secretary for the Majority, where he \n     served for 11 years; then he won a contested vote and was \n     Secretary of the Senate from 1977 to 1981. The Wall Street \n     Journal wrote a piece during this time, describing him as \n     ``The Man at the Senate's Back Door,'' and, though always a \n     loyal Democrat, his approach to his work in the Senate was \n     nicely summarized in a letter Bob Dole sent to my mother: \n     ``So sorry to learn of Stan's passing. I need not tell you \n     what a good man he was. I can tell you he was loved and \n     respected by all the `Senate family' regardless of party.''\n       One of Dad's proudest achievements in the Senate was when \n     he, together with Senators Warner and Mathias, got all 100 \n     Senators to sponsor the bill granting land on the Mall for \n     the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Next time you are there, \n     please look for the small brass marker at the back of the \n     Wall's apex and you will see Dad's name. He was particularly \n     pleased that the Vietnam Memorial helped pave the way for his \n     generation's memorials: Korean War, FDR, and World War II, \n     the dedication of which he attended with our son Mac, who was \n     born on his grandfather's birthday. Mac told us later that \n     his grandfather asked if it were OK to leave the ceremony a \n     bit early, because Dad was embarrassed by so many people \n     thanking him for his service. (He probably also wanted to \n     beat the traffic!)\n       Dad's third career, as a company Washington representative, \n     lasted 10 years, during which time he worked on the Apache \n     attack helicopter and other programs for Hughes Helicopter \n     Company, which was acquired by McDonnell Douglas and later by \n     The Boeing Company. In 1991, he then started the consulting \n     firm of Kimmitt, Coates & McCarthy with his friends George \n     McCarthy and Vinnie Coates, and after George's death, Dad and \n     Vinnie joined David Senter and John Weinfurter in forming \n     Kimmitt, Senter, Coates & Weinfurter, for which he was \n     Chairman until the day he died.\n       To give you an idea of the pace at which Dad lived his \n     life, I would note that this year alone, at age 86, he had \n     visited his beloved Montana seven times, including just two \n     weeks before he died. He had also traveled in August to \n     Belgium to celebrate with his friend, U.S. Ambassador Tom \n     Korologos, the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Hoeselt, \n     a small town east of Brussels, and in November he attended \n     the 78th Division Reunion in Biloxi, Mississippi. On the last \n     day of his life, December 7, he organized his desk, stopped \n     in at Boeing, dropped by the Senate Democratic cloakroom, \n     shopped at the Ft. Myer Commissary for my mother, went by his \n     office, then went to a farewell reception for Senator John \n     Breaux, whom Dad admired from the day he arrived in the \n     Senate. If Dad could not be with his natural family at his \n     death, he would have wanted to go just as he did--surrounded \n     by Democrats, with no pain or struggle, with his boots on.\n       Debbie Boylan, of the Democratic Leadership Council, wrote: \n     ``I was with him on Tuesday at the party for Senator Breaux, \n     and thought you'd like to know that he seemed like a very \n     happy man that night: He was the first to arrive, had a smile \n     and a chuckle for everyone he met, and--as he put it, `as the \n     senior Democrat in the room'--made short, eloquent remarks \n     about the Senate and Senator Breaux. Please know this: On \n     that night, as I'm sure on many others, he was surrounded by \n     people who loved him.'' Jodi Bannerman, who was also there \n     that evening, wrote: ``Stan told an anecdote to the DLC and \n     its guests of Russell Long, saying Long once said: `When I \n     have a friend, I have a friend. I'll fight for him or her \n     until hell freezes over. And then, I'll fight on the ice.' ''\n       And Dad fought on the ice for many people. If you were \n     down, in trouble, or just in need of a friendly, non-\n     judgmental listener, he was your man. He looked up to many, \n     down to none, and right in the eye to all. Even after almost \n     50 years in Washington, he never looked over your shoulder to \n     see if someone ``more important'' were approaching. At a 78th \n     Division reunion in Pittsburgh several years ago, he was with \n     his friend and divisionmate, former Congressman Lionel Van \n     Deerlin and his daughters. Liz Van Deerlin recounted in a \n     recent note: ``My sister, my dad, and I walked Stan back to \n     his hotel which was about 6 blocks away. There was a guy on \n     crutches with one leg who had\n\n[[Page S14179]]\n\n     a cup out for some cash. Stan was ahead of us in his stride \n     and he went right up to this guy, gave him some money and \n     they talked a bit, but I was moved at how Stan treated him. \n     He didn't avoid eye contact and hurriedly drop cash into his \n     cup, he lingered a while and had somewhat of a conversation \n     with this man, who thanked him heartily. If I didn't know \n     better, I would have thought they knew one another.''\n       My wife Holly captured this sentiment when discussing which \n     photograph we should use for Dad's obituary in the Washington \n     Post, one from his younger days or a more recent one: ``I \n     would not use the younger one. That was definitely Stan, but \n     of a younger, different time, at the height of his \n     professional prime. I like the older one because, to me, that \n     is who he really was. He came into his own as an older man, \n     still busy, productive, and effective, but he had a more \n     loving and lovable way about him, a person who knows how \n     great his life has been, how good he has it, has taken the \n     sadness in stride and still looked forward to every moment of \n     every day and reveled in contact with every person he met.''\n       In the hundreds of cards, e-mails, phone messages, and \n     visits since Dad's death, the most heartwarming and humbling \n     words have been how his family--children, grandchildren, \n     great grandson--are reflections of his life well lived. I \n     know how very proud Dad was that government service was and \n     is an essential element of the professional careers of his \n     children. He was very proud of Judy's long service in the \n     Senate, most recently with Senator Carper; Mary's time with \n     both the National Park Service and now ministering to the \n     health needs of the women and men and families of the 1st \n     Infantry Division as an Army Physician's Assistant in \n     Bamberg, Germany; Mark's military career and especially his \n     recent service in Iraq and the Gulf; Jay's time both in the \n     House and Senate and the Army; and my service in the Army and \n     the White House and several departments--even in Republican \n     Administrations! Dad's pride in his children knew no \n     political boundaries.\n       Dad was a man of character, but no eulogy would be complete \n     without mentioning that he also was a character. Just saying \n     the following words will bring smiles to many faces here \n     today: gutters; leg wrestling; frequent flyer miles; tennis \n     shorts & black socks; large paper napkins, especially if \n     embossed; and Unterberg. And several of you have shared some \n     of the phrases we heard so often from him:\n\n     ``Enunciate !''\n     ``Wheels rolling.''\n     ``Plan your work and work your plan!''\n     ``Do something, even if it's wrong!''\n     ``You decide what you want to be in life; then be the best at \n           it.''\n     ``Into every life a little rain must fall, but we don't have \n           to be drenched by it.''\n     And, the one all the grandchildren know by heart: ``An excuse \n           is an opiate\n     administered by nature to deaden the pain of mediocrity.''\n\n       Archbishop, two days before Dad died, he went to his last \n     Mass at the Chapel at Georgetown University Hospital. Why, \n     you might ask, would he drive from McLean to the District for \n     Mass? Well, the Mass at Georgetown Hospital is never more \n     than 35 minutes long; there is no music and no collection; \n     and they validate your parking ticket. That was his kind of \n     Mass. And, in another vein, I am sure that I know my Dad's \n     last two thoughts before dying. One would surely have been of \n     Mom and the family, but I am equally sure the other would \n     have been: ``Thank God I mailed the Christmas letters!''\n       My brother Jay asked me to note that the vast majority of \n     the Washington legislative community treated Dad with respect \n     and inclusion to the day he passed. As we all know, one \n     becomes less relevant the longer one is away from positions \n     of power in I this town. On the day Dad died, he was leaving \n     Boeing and he turned to a receptionist and said, ``Thanks for \n     putting up with an old soldier.'' Actually, Dad may have used \n     a noun other than ``soldier.'' The Kimmitt family would like \n     to thank the entire legislative community for their kindness \n     to and respect for Dad over all these years.\n       Let me close with one final anecdote. In 1978, at the peak \n     of Dad's career in the Senate, Holly and I were introduced to \n     Congressman and Mrs. Lucien Nedzi at a Christmas party. Mrs. \n     Nedzi's eyes lit up, and she asked, ``Are you related to . . \n     . Eunice Kimmitt, the school bus driver?'' No one would have \n     been more pleased than Dad to hear Mom's service as a St. \n     John's School bus driver in the 1950's recognized. In \n     discussing preparations for his funeral after my brother \n     Tom's interment last December, he said he had only three \n     requests: (1) to be buried in Arlington Cemetery at the site \n     where our sister Margaret was buried in 1959; (2) to have \n     ``Oh, Shenandoah'' sung during the service, as was done so \n     splendidly by the members of the Congressional Chorus as we \n     entered the chapel; and (3) to make sure that Mom as well as \n     he was recognized in these remarks.\n       Eunice Wegener Kimmitt also led a life of service, both as \n     a young Red Cross girl in Europe during World War II and as \n     an Army wife and mother who sent her husband and sons off to \n     wars in Korea, Vietnam, and Iraq. But even more, she was and \n     is the firm foundation of our family--no matter how many \n     times we moved to new houses, we always knew that home was \n     where Mom was. Dad would have said that this eulogy is as \n     much about Mom's service and contributions as his--and he \n     felt that way for all their nearly six decades together. Mom, \n     thanks for what you meant to Dad and still mean to all of us.\n       Please note in your program that you are welcome either to \n     join us at the graveside service immediately following this \n     Mass or to proceed directly to the Officers Club, where the \n     family looks forward to greeting you after the interment. \n     Whether you are at the gravesite today or later, you will see \n     that there is a clear view of the Capitol Building from the \n     site, which was selected serendipitously 45 years ago when \n     our sister died. We will also be burying with Dad soil from \n     Lewistown and Great Falls, Montana; Baumholder, Germany; and \n     the Capitol grounds. Only symbols, but powerful symbols, of \n     the life and life of service you have kindly allowed me to \n     share with you today.\n       I can almost hear Dad tapping his feet and saying: ``Let's \n     get moving so these good people can get back to work!'' In \n     such moments, there is just one reply: ``Yes, sir, Colonel!'' \n     Dad, thank you for the life of service you lived and for the \n     example that will inspire many more such lives in generations \n     today and to come. We love you, we miss you, we will see you \n     again.\n       Well done, Soldier. Be thou at peace.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      Eulogy to Eunice L. Kimmitt\n\n   (December 3, 2005, St. Agnes Catholic Church, Arlington, Virginia)\n\n       Shortly after Mom and Dad were married, she wrote in their \n     brand new family album that her favorite poem was entitled \n     ``If'' by Rudyard Kipling. That poem, which is printed in \n     full on the back of your program, captures the spirit of the \n     mother, grandmother, and friend whom we remember today. Let \n     me read just several lines from the poem:\n\n     If you can keep your head when all about you\n     Are losing theirs and blaming it on you\n\n     If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster\n     And treat those two imposters just the same\n\n     If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew\n     To serve your turn long after they are gone\n\n     If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue\n     Or walk with kings--nor lose the common touch\n\n     Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it\n\n       The earth was Mom's, and now so much more.\n       Even though Mom was among the first in her family to go to \n     college and had worked both at home and abroad for six years \n     before she was married, she wrote in that same album that her \n     goal in life was ``to be a good wife and mother.'' She \n     achieved that goal, and so much more.\n       In the words of the Old Testament, our mother was ``a wife \n     of noble character''--and she lived with a noble character. \n     No man ever had a more faithful, hardworking, and devoted \n     spouse than did our father, even though he delighted in \n     expressing his respect and appreciation in unusual ways. \n     Though she had to call the Senate Cloakroom most nights to \n     overcome the uncertainty of when he would be home, there was \n     no uncertainty when he called to ask, ``Old Mother, do you \n     have any steaks defrosted?'' That meant at least one, and \n     more likely a half dozen, Montanans were about to descend on \n     Mom for the evening. Once there, they got a great steak \n     dinner (2\\1/2\\\" New York strips, specially cut at Safeway). \n     Drinks continued after dinner, but only with Mom--since Dad \n     would have left her and his friends as soon as his steak was \n     down.\n       It is a great honor to us, but especially to Mom, that the \n     senior Montanan in Washington, Senator Max Baucus, is with us \n     today. Senator, thank you for your service to our country and \n     your friendship to our family.\n       But it wasn't just Montanans. Former Senator Fritz Hollings \n     from South Carolina was among the many Senators who called to \n     express his condolences, and he related the following about \n     his first night in Washington as a new Senator forty years \n     ago, ``Your Daddy asked me what I was doing for dinner, and \n     an hour later I was eating a big Montana steak with him and \n     that dear, strong Eunice.'' On our honeymoon a decade later, \n     Holly and I stayed with friends of my parents in Dublin. On \n     arrival--I think even before hello--Frank Fitzpatrick said, \n     ``My God, we're still talking about those steaks.''\n       Senator and Mrs. Hollings were with Mom and Dad on their \n     trip to Paris, mentioned in the obituary in The Washington \n     Post, during which Mom injured herself in a fall. To \n     paraphrase Paul Harvey, you will now know the rest of the \n     story. Mom and Dad had gone to Mass at Sacre Coeur on the \n     Montmarte one rainy evening, and, because Dad was not one to \n     take a cab, they were hustling (he was always hustling) down \n     wet, steep, centuries-old steps to the Metro, and my mother \n     took a hard fall, breaking her upper arm and knee. When we \n     saw her at Walter Reed after her Medevac trip home, Dad was \n     at her bedside and, in his most compassionate and \n     understanding way, said, ``Well, they told me Paris would \n     cost me an arm and a leg, but I didn't believe that till \n     now.'' Mom's reaction to hearing this comment, I am sure not \n     for the first time, was a wan smile through her casts and \n     bandages.\n       Everyone who knew my mother knew how much she loved sports. \n     She herself played basketball, tennis, and golf when she was \n     younger, and she swatted a mean ping pong\n\n[[Page S14180]]\n\n     paddle later in life. While she loved any sport on \n     television, watching her beloved Redskins was her real \n     passion. Once in the 1970's, during the Redskins' heyday, she \n     and Dad were in Europe when the Redskins were playing an \n     important Monday night game. My Dad awoke about 5 a.m. on the \n     Tuesday morning--11 p.m. Monday night Washington time--to \n     find Mom lying very still on the floor next to their bed. \n     Alarmed, he called out to her, only to be told to ``Be quiet, \n     Stan!''--because she was listening to the `Skins on the Armed \n     Forces Network using a transistor radio she brought for the \n     occasion, and reception was better on the floor.\n       But, as much as we laugh about those stories now, the most \n     remarkable thing is that Mom's role as spouse never once kept \n     her from performing well her other life's goal as a mother. \n     In the first twenty years of their marriage, the family lived \n     in ten different houses, in four states, and on two \n     continents. Change was a constant in our lives, as it was for \n     all service families of that era and today. But no matter \n     where we were or what house we were in, we always knew that \n     home was where Mom was. Dad traveled or was deployed \n     frequently in those years, and though his strong persona was \n     never far from our thoughts, Mom was never far from our \n     sides--and always on our side. I remember Dad at many of \n     my Little League games, but I remember Mom at all of them, \n     and I can still see her, vividly, running along the fence \n     with her arms held high as I circled the bases after my \n     first home run at the McLean Little League fields.\n       But one thing Mom left out of the album those many years \n     ago was a goal she achieved nonetheless--world's greatest \n     grandmother. While I do not recall a lot of gum, candy, soft \n     drinks, or Pringles in our home growing up, there were entire \n     shelves--lower shelves, of course--and a separate \n     refrigerator filled with whatever her grandchildren's little \n     hearts desired. For those who can join us at our home for the \n     reception after Mass, you will be treated to a Eunice Kimmitt \n     menu that will include these and many more of her favorites. \n     What a gift it was and is that the grandchildren and she--as \n     well as my Dad--got to know each other so well. And she was \n     so very proud of her grandchildren, and fiercely protective \n     of each of them.\n       Mom was a person of deep and abiding faith. She was raised \n     Methodist in Napoleon, Missouri, in a church whose hymnals \n     were in German, so it was big news in that small town when \n     she returned from Germany in 1947 as a pregnant Catholic \n     married to an Irishman from Montana. And, just like \n     naturalized American citizenship, no one appreciates the \n     Catholic faith like a convert who embraces the faith later in \n     life on their own initiative. From weekly confession--even \n     when my Dad was in Korea and the confessional sessions must \n     have been brief--through weekly Holy Communion when she was \n     homebound, and then Last Rites just before she died, Mom's \n     faith was an integral part of her being and thus the legacy \n     she leaves to all of us.\n       Indeed, I am firmly of the view that my mother was and is a \n     saint. I am as sure of that fact as I am of any tenet of my \n     faith. For 16 of the 18 years our brother Tom lived after his \n     accident in 1985, Mom spent an average of six hours a day \n     with him, every day of every year, whether in Arlington, \n     Washington, Alexandria, or Richmond, as we, led by her, \n     sought the best possible care for Tom. That is over 35,000 \n     hours, or 4 full years, at Tom's side. Many in the Church \n     today visited Mom and Tom at some point during that period, \n     and I am sure felt, as did I, that we were privileged to be \n     in the presence of two of God's most blessed children, now \n     reunited by and with Him. And I would like to offer \n     particular thanks to Father Roos and the St. Agnes community, \n     who were so attentive to Tom and Mom during those many years \n     when Tom was just down the road at Cherrydale Nursing Home.\n       So, if Holly is right--that Dad met Mom at the Pearly Gates \n     last Friday with a cigarette, glass of wine, and a to-do \n     list--I am pretty sure that Mom told Dad, after hugging him, \n     Kathy, Margaret, and Joe, that sitting down to continue her \n     personal Scrabble tournament with Tom was at the top of her \n     to-do list. And as they sat down for their first game after a \n     twenty-year break, I know Tom's first words to her were, \n     ``Mom, thanks. I always knew you were there.''\n       And I also know that at 2:30 p.m. this afternoon, they and \n     Dad will all say, as they did so many years in person, ``Go \n     Army, Beat Navy!''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/20/senate-section/article/S14180-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMENDING THE SERVICE OF PAUL H. BEA, JR.\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to thank a dedicated \npublic servant for his service to the people of New Jersey. Mr. Paul H. \nBea, Jr., has been Washington representative for the Port Authority of \nNew York and New Jersey for over 25 years, serving as a voice of the \nPort Authority here in Washington, DC.\n  As a former Port Authority Commissioner, I can tell you that this \nagency is the most complex regional transportation agency in the \ncountry. It runs three major airports that handled almost 100 million \npassengers last year. It operates the largest seaport on the east coast \nof the United States and the second largest container gateway in the \ncountry. It runs a bi-state mass transit system and maintains under its \ncare and responsibility such landmark assets as the Lincoln Tunnel, the \nHolland Tunnel, the Bayonne Bridge, the George Washington Bridge, and \nthe World Trade Center complex in lower Manhattan.\n  Mr. Bea has provided lawmakers and policy makers advice and \ninformation on a variety of topics including the Federal budget, \naviation, surface transportation, tax, and trade issues, but he has \ndeveloped a particular expertise in the field of maritime, port \nsecurity, and environmental matters. Through Paul's work with the New \nJersey and New York congressional delegations on behalf of the Port of \nNew York-New Jersey, he has contributed to the improvement of both the \nunderwater infrastructure and the Hudson-Raritan estuary.\n  In 2002, Paul became chairman of the Coastwise Coalition, a public-\nprivate sector partnership that works to educate policy makers on the \npotential of domestic waterborne transportation to enhance the capacity \nof the national transportation system.\n  In 2004, he was invited by the U.S. Secretary of Transportation, \nNorman Y. Mineta serve on the Maritime Transportation System National \nAdvisory Council. His principal efforts on that panel involve coastwise \nshipping, intermodal freight transportation, and waterway issues.\n  Mr. Bea's experience in Washington dates back to 1970, when he \narrived to work on the staff of the late Congressman Edward J. Patten \nfrom New Jersey. He was responsible for Federal budget, appropriations, \nenergy, environment, transportation and other issue areas.\n  In 1978, Mr. Bea went to work as a Washington representative for New \nJersey Governor Brendan T. Byrne on environmental and energy concerns, \nwhich were a focus of President Carter's administration at the time.\n  I am very grateful for Mr. Bea's service at the Port Authority. His \ncapable representation has helped the Federal Government navigate \nthrough some very tumultuous times for our country, including the 9/11 \nterror attack on the World Trade Center, and the bombings at the same \nlocation in 1993.\n  On behalf of the people of New Jersey, I thank Mr. Bea for all he has \ndone and will continue to do to make our country a safer, more secure, \nand efficient place to live and conduct business, and I wish him \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/20/senate-section/article/S14180-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/20/senate-section/article/S14180-3", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/20/senate-section/article/S14180-4", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14180-S14182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-5075.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to enacting comprehensive natural disaster insurance \n     legislation affecting financial capacity that will address, \n     encourage, and support insurance company reserving for future \n     catastrophes by making such reserves deductible for federal \n     income tax purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \n     and Urban Affairs.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 43\n\n       Whereas, the loss of life and property from severe natural \n     disasters, as evidenced by recent Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, \n     and Wilma, represents a major national problem; and\n       Whereas, severe natural disasters, including but not \n     limited to damages caused by windstorm and earthquake, can \n     strike any state or several states at any time, with the \n     potential of threatening large segments of the population of \n     the United States; and\n       Whereas, severe natural disasters can cause losses in the \n     tens of billions of dollars or more, threatening the solvency \n     of insurers and the viability of insurance markets on a \n     local, regional, and national level; and\n       Whereas, individual state responses are appropriate but \n     limited in protecting against disasters, as state and private \n     insurers lack the resources to cover catastrophic disasters; \n     and\n       Whereas, the existing federal disaster programs rely a \n     great degree on the congressional appropriation of disaster \n     relief dollars on an ad hoc basis and at great and \n     unnecessary cost to taxpayers; and\n       Whereas, states have documented that problems in the \n     current insurance market are rooted in and exacerbated by \n     federal tax policy which discourages reserving for future \n     catastrophes; and\n\n[[Page S14183]]\n\n       Whereas, federal tax laws and accounting principles do not \n     permit deduction of reserves for future natural disaster \n     losses and discourages insurers from accumulating assets to \n     pay for future catastrophic losses; and\n       Whereas, some non-United States insurers are able to deduct \n     reserves for future catastrophe losses free of tax, giving \n     those insurers a competitive advantage over United States \n     insurers by enabling them to attract insurance and \n     reinsurance business that would otherwise be written by \n     United States insurers; and\n       Whereas, the 1997 Coopers & Lybrand report entitled \n     Analysis of Pre-Event Tax-Deductible Catastrophe Reserves \n     underscored the following projections if congress were to \n     enact legislation to encourage the use of pre-event tax \n     deductible catastrophe reserves: that the property and \n     casualty industry would build substantial catastrophe reserve \n     funds; that overall industry assets would increase \n     substantially; that the number of insolvencies taking place \n     after a catastrophic disaster would significantly decrease, \n     and that the magnitude of insolvencies taking place after a \n     catastrophic disaster would significantly decrease; and\n       Whereas, the same Coopers & Lybrand report also underscored \n     the further projections if congress were to enact legislation \n     to encourage the use of pre-event tax deductible catastrophe \n     reserves: that United States reinsurers would become more \n     competitive in the global reinsurance marketplace; that \n     United States insurers would likely cede monies to United \n     States reinsurers rather than to foreign reinsurers; that \n     federal tax receipts could dramatically increase due to \n     increased tax revenue from underwriting profits associated \n     with retained United States premium, investment income earned \n     on that same premium, and profits from additional foreign \n     premiums that would come onshore as United States reinsurers \n     seek to diversify their catastrophic losses; and that the \n     number of policyholders who lose insurance after a major \n     event could decrease: therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to enact comprehensive \n     natural disaster insurance legislation affecting financial \n     capacity that will address, encourage, and support insurance \n     company reserving for future catastrophes by making such \n     reserves deductible for federal income tax purposes; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, that a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-247. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to enacting a health insurance premium reimbursement \n     program and a federal income tax credit for the health \n     insurance premiums for affected victims of Hurricanes Katrina \n     and Rita; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n     Affairs.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 44\n\n       Whereas, the destruction left in the wake of Hurricanes \n     Katrina and Rita poses a growing risk that hundreds of \n     thousands of people in the most severely affected areas will \n     soon lose their privately paid access to health care \n     benefits; and\n       Whereas, this is particularly true for those individuals \n     who work for small businesses facing financial difficulties \n     and for those who have lost or are about to lose their jobs; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Gulf Coast's health care system as a whole is \n     already under considerable stress with few health care \n     facilities in operation and thousands of medical \n     professionals currently displaced; and\n       Whereas, if returning residents are not able to pay for \n     required medical services after the current grace period \n     instituted by the commissioner of insurance for payment of \n     health insurance premiums in Louisiana which ends on November \n     30, 2005, the system could deteriorate further in the most \n     severely affected areas; and\n       Whereas, a two-component program to provide interim support \n     to those who are most at risk of losing their private health \n     benefits coverage is needed; and\n       Whereas, the program would apply only to certain parishes \n     within the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) orange \n     zone in Louisiana for both Hurricane Katrina, specifically \n     Orleans, St. Bernard, Plaquemines, Jefferson, St. Tammany, \n     and Washington, and for Hurricane Rita, specifically Cameron, \n     Vermilion, and Calcasieu; and\n       Whereas, the first component could be a federal premium \n     reimbursement program to pay the premiums of individuals with \n     personal policies and of small employers, those with fifty or \n     fewer employees, with group policies by paying to insurers \n     the premium amount fixed for August 2005 for the months of \n     September, October, and November 2005; and\n       Whereas, the program could cover both paid and unpaid \n     premiums to provide the same benefits to all defined \n     individuals and small businesses, such that if a \n     reimbursement payment duplicates a premium actually paid, \n     that amount could be applied to future premiums or refunded \n     to the insured upon request; and\n       Whereas, definitions of eligible individuals and small \n     employers, along with administrative provisions, could be the \n     same or similar to those in S. 1769; and\n       Whereas, the second component could be a federal income tax \n     credit for eligible individuals who are unemployed due to \n     Hurricane Katrina or Rita; and\n       Whereas, the tax credit could be sixty-five percent of \n     premiums actually paid by eligible unemployed individuals to \n     health insurers for the twelve months from December 2005 \n     through November 2006; and\n       Whereas, the tax credit could be eighty percent for \n     individuals who are at or below three hundred percent of the \n     federal poverty level; and\n       Whereas, an eligible individual could be defined as a \n     person who worked in one of the affected parishes at the time \n     of the hurricane, was covered by health insurance at the time \n     of the hurricane, and is determined to be unemployed during a \n     premium period as a result of the hurricane; and\n       Whereas, former employees of companies of all sizes could \n     be eligible, not just small businesses and individuals \n     purchasing their own insurance; and\n       Whereas, the credit mechanism could be structured like the \n     trade adjustment credit in Internal Revenue Code Section 35, \n     which is applied to make federal payments directly to the \n     health insurance company for individuals eligible for the \n     credit: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to enact a health \n     insurance premium reimbursement program and a federal income \n     tax credit for the health insurance premiums for affected \n     victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita;

Stafford Disaster Relief and \n     Emergency Assistance Act the state of Louisiana would owe the \n     federal government approximately three billion seven hundred \n     million dollars as its portion of responsibility for the \n     disaster relief assistance provided by the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency; and\n       Whereas, the largest portion of federal assistance for \n     which the state is being held responsible for reimbursing the \n     Federal Emergency Management Agency is that for other \n     assistance payments, over which the state has no control \n     whatsoever in the granting or amount of payments; and\n       Whereas, the citizens of Louisiana certainly should enjoy \n     the benefit of assistance from the federal government during \n     a crises such as Hurricane Katrina or Rita, and such benefit \n     should be provided by the federal government without a \n     requirement that the state provide reimbursement for \n     provision of such federal benefits; therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to amend the Robert T.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to taking such actions as are necessary to provide \n     federal financial assistance to aid in rebuilding the \n     investor-owned utility systems that are indispensable to the \n     recovery efforts of the state of Louisiana and the city of \n     New Orleans, including but not limited to providing funding \n     through the United States Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development in the form of Community Development Block Grants \n     to investor-owned utilities for the restoration of electric \n     and gas service damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita; to \n     the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 69\n\n       Whereas, on August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina, a category \n     four storm with sustained winds of one hundred forty miles \n     per hour, came ashore in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, near \n     the city of Buras, causing unprecedented flooding and \n     devastation in southeastern Louisiana, including breaches of \n     the levee system and flood walls of the city of New Orleans, \n     the death of more than one thousand state residents, the \n     displacement and evacuation of hundreds of thousands more, \n     and the widespread loss and destruction of businesses and \n     property; and\n       Whereas, on September 24, 2005, Hurricane Rita, a category \n     four storm with sustained winds of one hundred twenty-five \n     miles per hour, came ashore near the Louisiana/Texas border, \n     causing unprecedented flooding and devastation in \n     southwestern Louisiana and southeastern Texas, the widespread \n     loss and destruction of property, and total disruption of the \n     lives of thousands, many of whom have no homes to which they \n     may return; and\n       Whereas, Entergy Corporation (Entergy), through its \n     subsidiaries, Entergy Louisiana (ELI), Entergy Gulf States \n     (EGS), and Entergy New Orleans (ENO), is Louisiana's largest \n     electric and gas utility, and the resulting wind and flooding \n     of Hurricane Katrina significantly damaged major portions of \n     Entergy's utility infrastructure; and\n       Whereas, in the aftermath of the disaster, Entergy and \n     others worked rapidly to provide emergency and temporary \n     services, and Entergy is currently working to restore \n     permanent service to all customers in its service territory; \n     and\n       Whereas, Entergy estimates that the total restoration costs \n     for the repair or replacement of Entergy's electric and gas \n     facilities damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and \n     business continuity costs are in the range of 1.1 to 1.4 \n     billion dollars and that the costs to Entergy New Orleans \n     alone to repair its utility infrastructure exceed four \n     hundred million dollars, not including potential incremental \n     losses; and\n       Whereas, safe and reliable electric and gas utility service \n     is vital to the state's post-hurricane recovery efforts, and \n     the state of Louisiana deems it essential to keep Entergy and \n     its subsidiaries as productive and financially viable \n     companies that provide safe and reliable electric and gas \n     utility service to the residents and businesses of Louisiana; \n     and\n       Whereas, the legislature is committed to the protection of \n     Entergy's residential and business customers from the \n     tremendous costs associated with the necessary rebuilding \n     efforts and in assisting Entergy and its subsidiaries, \n     particularly Entergy New Orleans, in regaining their \n     financial strength and stability so that they will be able to \n     continue providing safe and reliable service to their \n     customers; and\n       Whereas, the legislature notes that following the terrorist \n     attacks of September 11, 2001, which caused catastrophic \n     destruction of life and property, the loss of an untold \n     number of jobs, and the displacement of many individuals and \n     businesses, billions of dollars in funds and other forms of \n     essential assistance were provided to the state of New York \n     and New York City by the federal government; and\n       Whereas, the legislature notes that congress, in Public Law \n     107-206, passed on August 2, 2002, authorized the United \n     States Department of Housing and Urban Development to provide \n     seven hundred eighty-three million dollars in disaster \n     assistance for damaged properties and businesses, including \n     the restoration of utility infrastructure, and for economic \n     revitalization directly related to the September 11, 2001, \n     attacks; and\n       Whereas, the state of Louisiana has suffered similar if not \n     greater human and economic losses as a result of Hurricanes \n     Katrina and Rita, resulting in devastating loss of life, \n     damage to businesses and property, and destruction of much of \n     Entergy's utility infrastructure in Louisiana: Therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States of America to take all \n     measures necessary to provide federal financial assistance to \n     aid in rebuilding the investor-owned utility systems that are \n     indispensable to the recovery efforts of the state of \n     Louisiana and the city of New Orleans, including but not \n     limited to providing funding through the United States \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development in the form of \n     Community Development Block Grants to investor-owned \n     utilities for the restoration of electric and gas service \n     damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-251.

Perry \n     (Texas) and ACLU v. McCreary County (Kentucky), concluded \n     that it is consistent with the First Amendment to display the \n     Ten Commandments in an outdoor public square in Texas, but \n     not on the courthouse walls of two counties in Kentucky; and\n       Whereas, American citizens are concerned that the court has \n     produced two opposite results involving the same Ten \n     Commandments leading to the conclusion that, based on the \n     Kentucky decision, the Ten Commandments may be displayed in a \n     county courthouse provided it is not backed by a belief in \n     God; and\n       Whereas, Supreme Justice Scalia emphasized the importance \n     of the Ten Commandments when he stated in the Kentucky case \n     ``The three most popular religions in the United States, \n     Christianity, Judaism, and Islam which combined account for \n     97.7% of all believers are monotheistic. All of them, \n     moreover, believe that the Ten Commandments were given by God \n     to Moses, and are divine prescriptions for a virtuous life''; \n     and\n       Whereas, Chief Justice Rehnquist in the Texas case referred \n     to the duplicity of the United States Supreme Court in \n     telling local governments in America that they may not \n     display the Ten Commandments in public buildings in their \n     communities while at the same time allowing these same Ten \n     Commandments to be presented on these specific places on the \n     building housing the U.S. Supreme Court stating ``Since 1935, \n     Moses has stood, holding two tablets that reveal portions of \n     the Ten Commandments written in Hebrew, among other lawgivers \n     in the south frieze. Representations of the Ten Commandments \n     adorn the metal gates lining the north and south sides of the \n     courtroom as well as the doors leading into the courtroom. \n     Moses also sits on the exterior east facade of the building \n     holding the Ten Commandments tablets''; and\n       Whereas, a recent poll by the First Amendment Center \n     revealed that seventy percent of Americans would have no \n     objection to posting the Ten Commandments in government \n     buildings and eighty-five percent would approve if the Ten \n     Commandments were included as one document among many \n     historical documents when displayed in public buildings; and\n       Whereas, the First Amendment of the United States \n     Constitution, which provides in part that ``Congress shall \n     make no law respecting an establishment of religion'' is a \n     specific and unequivocal instruction to only the United \n     States Congress and the United States Constitution makes no \n     restriction on the ability of states to acknowledge God, the \n     Supreme Ruler of the Universe; and\n       Whereas, the federal judiciary has overstepped its \n     constitutional boundaries and ruled against the \n     acknowledgment of God as the sovereign source of law, \n     liberty, and government by local and state officers and other \n     state institutions, including state schools; and\n       Whereas, there is concern that recent decisions of the \n     court will be used by litigants in an effort to remove God \n     from the public square in America, including public buildings \n     and public parks; and\n       Whereas, there is pending before the 1st Session of the \n     109th Congress the Constitution Restoration Act of 2005, \n     which will limit the jurisdiction of the federal courts and \n     preserve the right to acknowledge God to the states and to \n     the people and resolve the issue of improper judicial \n     intervention in matters relating to the acknowledgment of \n     God: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to adopt S520 and HR 1070, \n     the Constitution Restoration Act of 2005 and in doing so \n     protecting the ability of the people of Louisiana to display \n     the Ten Commandments in public placs, to express their faith \n     in public, to retain God in the Pledge of Allegiance, to \n     retain ``In God We Trust'' as our national motto, and to use \n     Article III, Section 2.2 of the United States Constitution to \n     except these areas from the jurisdiction of the United States \n     Supreme Court: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the administrator of the General Services, \n     Washington, D.C., to the secretary of the United States \n     Senate and the clerk of the United States House of \n     Representatives, and each member of the Louisiana delegation \n     to the United States Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/20/senate-section/article/S14185-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. STEVENS, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, \n     and Transportation, with an amendment in the nature of a \n     substitute:\n       S. 967.

Res. 340\n\n       Whereas the Gulf Coast of the United States has experienced \n     one of the worst hurricane seasons on record;\n       Whereas Hurricane Katrina and multiple levee breaks \n     destroyed an estimated 205,330 homes in Louisiana;\n       Whereas 18,752 businesses in Louisiana, 41 percent of the \n     overall number of businesses in the State, sustained \n     catastrophic damage from Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane \n     Rita;\n       Whereas according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis at the \n     Department of Commerce, personal income has fallen more than \n     25 percent in Louisiana in the third quarter of 2005;\n       Whereas in the time since Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the \n     Small Business Administration has only approved 20 percent of \n     disaster loan applications for homeowners in Louisiana and \n     has a backlog of more than 101,400 applications for this \n     assistance as of December 20, 2005;\n       Whereas of the 11,644 homeowner disaster loan applications \n     that have been approved in Louisiana by the Small Business \n     Administration, only 835 have been fully disbursed;\n       Whereas, in response to these circumstances, commercial \n     banks, mortgage banks, credit unions, and other mortgage \n     lenders instituted 90-day loan forbearance periods after \n     Hurricane Katrina and did not require home owners in \n     Louisiana to make mortgage payments until on or about \n     December 1, 2005;\n       Whereas after the termination of the 90-day forbearance \n     period, many home and business owners have received notice \n     from their lenders that they face foreclosure unless they \n     make a lump sum balloon payment in the amount of the mortgage \n     payments previously subject to forbearance; and\n       Whereas foreclosure on homes and businesses in Louisiana \n     will have a detrimental impact on the economy of the State, \n     will deprive property owners of their equity at a time when \n     they can least afford it, and will have a negative impact on \n     lenders who will be holding properties that may not be \n     readily saleable on the open market: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) Congress should consider legislation to provide relief \n     to homeowners in Louisiana whose properties were devastated \n     by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita; and\n       (2) commercial banks, mortgage banks, credit unions, and \n     other mortgage lenders should extend mortgage payment \n     forbearance to March 31, 2006, in order to allow Congress the \n     time to consider such legislation.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, right after Katrina hit the financial \nservices industry responded with compassion to their customers in \nLouisiana. Every bank, credit union, mortgage broker, and other \nmortgage holders instituted a 90 day forbearance period during which \nthey did not collect mortgage payments. They deserve to be commended \nfor this policy. They gave peace of mind to the thousands of families \nwho lost their homes to Katrina and Rita, or whose homes were damaged \nby the storms.\n  Many of these forbearance periods have now ended, most effective \nDecember 1st. I have heard from homeowners throughout the state who are \nnow being told by their lenders that in addition to making December's \nmortgage payment, they now also have to come up with a lump sum payment \nfor the payments they missed. A lot of these people were under the \nimpression that their loans would be restructured to add the three \nmonths on to the end of the loan term. Instead, they are getting a bill \nfor thousands of dollars.\n  Can you imagine what it must be like for a person in New Orleans or \nSt. Bernard Parish to get this notice from their lender? Their home is \ngone. Their community has been wiped out. We have lost over 200,000 \nhomes in Louisiana to these storms and more than 18,000 businesses have \nbeen destroyed. Personal income in Louisiana has fallen by more than 25 \npercent in the third quarter of 2005. And now these homeowners--in this \nkind of situation--face foreclosure.\n  People in Louisiana are hard working and want to pay what they owe. \nMost lenders have reported that even with the forbearance period, close \nto 80 percent of borrowers continued to make their mortgage payments. \nPeople who have called my office have said that they can make the \nmonthly payment, but the balloon payment is out of reach and will be \nfor some time.\n  I was hoping that Congress could pass legislation before we adjourned \nto establish a Louisiana Recovery Corporation that would bring some \nstability and guide the redevelopment of the state after these storms. \nIt would create an entity that will give homeowners the opportunity to \nsell destroyed properties if they feel that it would be in their best \ninterest. The bill that we were working on with the leaders of the \nSenate Banking Committee--Chairman Shelby and Ranking Member Sarbanes--\nas well as Congressman Baker in the House of Representatives, still \nneeded a lot of work. We simply were not going to have time to complete \nthe bill before the holidays. It will be one of my top priorities when \nwe return in the Second Session.\n  In the meantime, homeowners in Louisiana need more time before they \ncan begin making mortgage payments. Today I am submitting a sense of \nthe Senate Resolution calling on mortgage lenders to continue their \nforbearance periods through March 31, 2006. This will give the Congress \nmore time to consider and develop legislation to restore peace of mind \nto our homeowners.\n  It is my hope that this resolution will prompt the Senate to make \npassing legislation to give our homeowners peace of mind a priority \nwhen we return next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/20/senate-section/article/S14187-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 341--COMMENDING DR.

A bill to authorize resources to provide students with \nopportunities for summer learning through summer learning grants; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill--the \n``STEP UP Act''--to establish grants for summer school enrichment \nprograms to increase the academic skills of students in need.\n  According to the 2005 Nation's Report Card of Educational Progress, \nthe gap in reading scores between fourth grade children in poverty and \ntheir more affluent peers did not decrease between 1998 and 2005. Fewer \nthan half of the fourth graders eligible for free or reduced priced \nlunch are able to read at even the basic level--a level attained by \nmore than three-quarters of wealthier students. This data confirms that \ntoo many of our children are not attaining skills at levels that will \nlead to success, and too often, it is the children most in need who are \nleft behind by the educational system.\n\n[[Page S14188]]\n\n  Teachers understand that students return to school in the fall at \nlevels below their performance of the previous spring. Educators know \nthis as summer learning loss. Research has shown that students, on \naverage, lose more than one month of reading skills and two months of \nmath skills over the summer. That is the average.\n  But the impact of summer learning loss is greatest for children \nliving in poverty, children with learning disabilities, and children \nwho do not speak English at home. Achievement levels for such children \noften plummet during the summer, so that that the reading skills of \ndisadvantaged students can fall more that three months behind the \nscores of their more affluent peers. The summer learning losses for \nchildren in poverty accumulate over the elementary school years, so \nthese students end up falling further and further behind in school.\n  Several programs have been successful in countering summer learning \nloss. The BELL programs and the Teach Baltimore Summer Academy provide \nevidence that students can achieve months of progress, rather than \nmonths of decline, when they participate in structured enrichment and \neducation programs for several weeks during the summer. These programs \nare successful but reach too few of the students who need them.\n  The bill I am introducing today establishes a grant program for \nstates to support summer learning in selected local districts. These \ngrants would be used to help students in the early elementary grades \nwho are living in poverty, by supporting their participation in six \nweeks of summer school. These summer opportunities could be offered by \na variety of providers, including the public schools, but also by other \ncommunity organizations that have shown success in providing \neducational enrichment, such as youth development organizations, \nnonprofits, and summer enrichment camps. These summer programs would be \naligned with the school year curriculum to increase the reading and \nmath skills of students in need and to provide them with learning \nopportunities to avoid a path that might otherwise lead to failure in \nschool--a path that too often ends, years later, with these students \ndropping out of the educational system.\n  The achievement gap in education begins in the early grades and \nremains a burden for too many throughout their time in school. It is \nbecoming increasingly clear that much of this early difference can be \ncombated by structured summer learning opportunities. That is the \npurpose of this bill, and I hope my colleagues will support this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2149\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Summer Term Education \n     Programs for Upward Performance Act of 2005'' or the ``STEP \n     UP Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) All students experience learning losses when they do \n     not engage in educational activities during the summer.\n       (2) Students on average lose more than 1 month's worth of \n     reading skills, and 2 months or more in mathematics facts and \n     skills, during the summer.\n       (3) The impact of summer learning loss is greatest for \n     children living in poverty, for children with learning \n     disabilities, and for children who do not speak English at \n     home.\n       (4) While middle-class children's test scores plateau or \n     even rise during the summer months, scores plummet for \n     children living in poverty. Disparities grow, so that reading \n     scores of disadvantaged students can fall more than 3 months \n     behind the scores of their middle-class peers.\n       (5) Summer learning losses by children living in poverty \n     accumulate over the elementary school years, so that their \n     achievement scores fall further and further behind the scores \n     of their more advantaged peers as the children progress \n     through school.\n       (6) This summer slide is costly for American education. \n     Analysis by Professor Harris Cooper and his colleagues finds \n     that 2 months of the school year are lost: 1 month spent in \n     reteaching and 1 month spent not providing new instruction.\n       (7) Analysis of summer learning programs has demonstrated \n     their effectiveness. In the BELL programs in Boston, New \n     York, and Washington, DC, students gained several months' \n     worth of reading and mathematics skills in 6 weeks, with a \n     majority of those students moving to a higher performance \n     category, as assessed by standardized mathematics and reading \n     tests. In the Center for Summer Learning's Teach Baltimore \n     Summer Academy, randomized studies show that students who \n     regularly attended the program for not less than 2 summers \n     gained advantages of 70 to 80 percent of 1 full grade level \n     in reading over control-group peers who did not attend summer \n     school.\n       (8) Summer learning programs are proven to remedy, \n     reinforce, and accelerate learning, and can serve to close \n     the achievement gap in education.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to create opportunities for \n     summer learning by providing summer learning grants to \n     eligible students, in order to--\n       (1) provide the students with access to summer learning;\n       (2) facilitate the enrollment of students in elementary \n     schools or youth development organizations during the summer;\n       (3) promote collaboration between teachers and youth \n     development professionals in order to bridge gaps between \n     schools and youth programs; and\n       (4) encourage teachers to try new techniques, acquire new \n     skills, and mentor new colleagues.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey \ncertain Bureau of Land Management Land to the City of Eugene, Oregon; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I introduce, with my friend and \ncolleague from Oregon, Senator Smith, a small bill that should pack a \nbig score for ecological education in the City of Eugene. This bill \nauthorizes the transfer of 12 acres from the Bureau of Land Management \n(BLM) to the City of Eugene on which the City of Eugene plans to \nconstruct the West Eugene Environmental Education Center (WEEEC). The \nWEEEC is a planned campus that will eventually hold laboratories, \ngreenhouses, a reference library, and public gathering places including \nan exhibit hall, auditorium, and three classrooms. Transfer of this \nacreage by this bill is the first step towards making the promise of \nthis educational center a reality.\n  The WEEEC and this bill are supported by the West Eugene Wetland \nPartnership (Partnership). The Partnership is made up of the BLM, \nEugene School Districts, Northwest Youth Corp, and the Willamette \nResources and Educational Network (WREN) which was formed to assist in \nplanning, funding, building, and operating portions of this education \ncenter. This bill\n\n[[Page S14190]]\n\nis also supported by the Oregon and California Counties (O counties) \nwho originally had issue with the land transfer because they opposed \nloss of the 12 acres from the BLM land base. They are now in support of \nthis bill because the City of Eugene has stepped up to the plate and is \ntransferring land they currently own to the BLM to keep the public land \nroles consistent.\n  The WEEEC will be the culmination of over a decade of work on the \npart of local folks to preserve the West Eugene Wetlands. I urge its \nswift passage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2150\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to promote simplification and fairness in the \nadministration and collection of sales and use taxes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Sales Tax \nFairness and Simplification Act, a bill that will level the playing \nfield for all retailers--in-store, catalog, and online--so each \nretailer has the same sales tax collection responsibility. All retail \nsales should be treated equally. The bill will also help States begin \nto recover from years of budgetary shortfalls.\n  This bill is not a disguised attempt to increase taxes or put a new \ntax on the Internet. Consumers are already supposed to pay sales and \nuse taxes in most States for purchases made over the phone, by mail, or \nvia the Internet. Unfortunately, most consumers are unaware they are \nrequired to pay this use tax on purchases the retailer does not choose \nto collect sales tax on at the time of purchase.\n  That means consumers who buy products online are required to keep \ntrack of their purchases and then pay the outstanding use tax \nobligation on their State tax forms. This has proven to be unrealistic, \nbut what is real is most people do not know this or do not comply with \nthe requirement. As such, States are losing billions of dollars in \nannual revenue. This legislation will help both consumers and States by \nreducing the burden on consumers and providing a mechanism that will \nallow States to systematically and fairly collect the taxes already \nowed to them.\n  This bill is not about new taxes. Simply put, if Congress continues \nto allow remote sales taxes to go uncollected and electronic commerce \ncontinues to grow as predicted, other taxes--such as income or property \ntaxes--will have to be increased to offset the lost revenue. I want to \navoid that. That is why we need to implement a plan that will allow \nStates to generate revenue using mechanisms already approved by their \nlocal leaders.\n  This bill is about economic growth. Sales and use taxes provide \ncritical revenue to pay for our schools, our police officers, \nfirefighters, road construction, and more. It will bring more money--\nmoney that is already owed--into rural areas that are struggling \neconomically. It will also help businesses comply with the complicated \nState sales tax systems. That means the business resources that have \nhistorically been spent on tax compliance could be used, among other \nthings, to hire new people and buy new equipment.\n  This bill is about tax simplification. As the Supreme Court \nidentified in the Quill versus North Dakota decision in 1992, the \ncomplicated State and local sales tax systems across this country have \ncreated an undue burden on sellers. The Quill decision stated that a \nmultitude of complicated and diverse State sales tax rules made it too \nonerous to require retailers to collect sales taxes unless they had a \nphysical presence in the State of the buyer. Local brick-and-mortar \nretailers collect sales taxes, while many online and catalog retailers \nare exempt from collecting the same taxes. This is not only \nfundamentally unfair to Main Street retailers, but it is costing States \nand localities billions in lost revenue.\n  The bill will help relieve this burden by requiring States to meet \nthe simplification standards outlined in the Streamlined Sales and Use \nTax Agreement. Working with the business community, the States \ndeveloped the Agreement to harmonize State sales tax rules, bring \nuniformity to definitions of items in the sales tax base, significantly \nreduce the paperwork burden\n\n[[Page S14191]]\n\non retailers, and incorporate new technology to modernize many \nadministrative procedures. This unprecedented Agreement will increase \nour Nation's economic efficiency and facilitate the growth of commerce \nby dramatically reducing red-tape and administrative burdens on all \nbusinesses and consumers. However, most importantly, the Agreement \nremoves the liability for collection errors from the retailer and \nplaces it with the State. This historic Agreement was approved by 34 \nStates and the District of Columbia on November 12, 2002.\n  The States have made tremendous progress in changing their State tax \nlaws to become compliant with the Agreement. Already, 19 States have \nenacted legislation to change their tax laws and implement the \nrequirements of the Agreement. On October 3, 2005, the Streamlined \nSales and Use Tax Agreement became effective.\n  This bill requires States to implement and maintain these \nsimplification measures before they can require any seller to collect \nand remit sales tax. The Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement \nincludes dramatic simplification in almost every aspect of sales and \nuse tax collection and administration, especially for the sellers who \nsell their products in more than one State. Areas of simplification \ninclude exemption processing, uniform definitions, State level \nadministration of local taxes, a reduced number of sales tax rates, \ndetermining the appropriate tax rate, and reduced audit burdens for \nsellers using the State-certified technology.\n  While the States have made great progress, the Quill decision held \nthat allowing States to require collection is an issue that, ``Congress \nmay be better qualified to resolve, and one that it has the ultimate \npower to resolve.'' The States have acted. It is now time for Congress \nto provide States that enact the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax \nAgreement with the authority to require remote retailers to collect \nsales taxes just as Main Street retailers do today.\n  Congress needs to ``level the playing field'' for all retailers--in-\nstore, catalog, and online--so each has the same sales tax collection \nresponsibility. All retail sales should be treated equally. I believe \nCongressional action is needed to provide States that implement the \nStreamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement with the authority to collect \nsales and use taxes from remote retailers. Adoption of the Agreement \nand Congressional authorization will provide a level playing field for \nbrick and mortar and remote retailers.\n  Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota and I have worked tirelessly to \nassist sellers and State and local governments to find true \nsimplification in almost every aspect of sales and use tax collection \nand administration. I want to thank Senator Dorgan for working with me \non this policy issue for so many years. We have been successful in \nmoving this issue forward from discussing it at the Federal level with \nMembers of Congress to the drafting of the Streamlined Sales and Use \nTax Agreement to approving the Governing Board this year to push \nforward with implementation.\n  For the past eleven months, Senator Dorgan and I have worked with all \ninterested parties to try to find a mutually agreeable legislative \npackage to introduce this year. Many hours have been dedicated in \ntrying to find the right solution to address all concerns. I appreciate \neveryone's hard work on this piece of legislation and believe it is \ntime to introduce the bill before the end of the year.\n  Senator Dorgan and I will be introducing two separate bills this \nyear, but will continue to work with each other and all interested \nparties to find compromise on the outstanding policy issues of concern \nto the stakeholders. Some of the issues that will be further discussed \ninclude, but are not limited to, modifications to the small business \nexception language, inclusion of tribal governments language, and \nmodifications to the language about transactional taxes on \ntelecommunications services. Bill introduction does not stop us from \nnegotiating and working together to improve the final product that \nshould be enacted into public law. I look forward to working with \nSenator Dorgan and all interested parties to produce a compromise bill \nin 2006 that addresses all concerns raised over the past year.\n  The Sales Tax Fairness and Simplification Act provides States that \nimplement the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement with the \nauthority to collect sales or use taxes equally from all retailers. \nAdoption of the Agreement and Congressional authorization will provide \na level playing field for brick and mortar and remote retailers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2152\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Sales Tax Fairness and \n     Simplification Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Sales and Use Tax System.--It is the sense of the \n     Congress that the sales and use tax system established by the \n     Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, to the extent that \n     it meets the minimum simplification requirements of section \n     6, provides sufficient simplification and uniformity to \n     warrant Federal authorization to Member States that are \n     parties to the Agreement to require remote sellers, subject \n     to the conditions provided in this Act, to collect and remit \n     the sales and use taxes of such Member States and of local \n     taxing jurisdictions of such Member States.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to--\n       (1) effectuate the limited authority granted to Member \n     States under the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement; and\n       (2) not grant additional authority unrelated to the \n     accomplishment of the purpose described in paragraph (1).\n\n     SEC. 4.

MINIMUM SIMPLIFICATION REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The minimum simplification requirements \n     for the Agreement, which shall relate to the conduct of \n     Member States under the Agreement and to the administration \n     and supervision of such conduct, are as follows:\n       (1) A centralized, one-stop, multistate registration system \n     that a seller may elect to use to register with the Member \n     States, provided a seller may also elect to register directly \n     with a Member State, and further provided that privacy and \n     confidentiality controls shall be placed on the multistate \n     registration system so that it may not be used for any \n     purpose other than the administration of sales and use taxes. \n     Furthermore, no taxing authority within a Member State or a \n     Member State that has withdrawn or been expelled from the \n     Agreement may use registration with the centralized \n     registration system for the purpose of, or as a factor in \n     determining, whether a seller has a nexus with that Member \n     State for any tax at any time.\n       (2) Uniform definitions of products and product-based \n     exemptions from which a Member State may choose its \n     individual tax base, provided, however, that all local \n     jurisdictions in that Member State shall have a common tax \n     base identical to the State tax base of that Member State. A \n     Member State may enact other product-based exemptions without \n     restriction if the Agreement does not have a definition for \n     the product or for a term that includes the product. A Member \n     State shall relax the good faith requirement for acceptance \n     of exemption certificates in accordance with section 317 of \n     the Agreement, as amended through the date of enactment of \n     this Act.\n       (3) Uniform rules for sourcing and attributing transactions \n     to particular taxing jurisdictions.\n       (4) Uniform procedures for the certification of service \n     providers and software on which a seller may elect to rely in \n     order to determine Member State sales and use tax rates and \n     taxability.\n       (5) Uniform rules for bad debts and rounding.\n       (6) Uniform requirements for tax returns and remittances.\n       (7) Consistent electronic filing and remittance methods.\n       (8) Single, State-level administration of all Member State \n     and local sales and use taxes, including a requirement for a \n     State-level filing of tax returns in each Member State.\n       (9) A single sales and use tax rate per taxing \n     jurisdiction, except that a State may impose a single \n     additional rate, which may be zero, on food, food \n     ingredients, and drugs, provided that this limitation does \n     not apply to the items identified in section 308 C of the \n     Agreement, as amended through the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (10) A Member State shall eliminate caps and thresholds on \n     the application of sales and use tax rates and exemptions \n     based on value, provided that this limitation does not apply \n     to the items identified in section 308 C of the Agreement, as \n     amended through the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (11) A provision requiring each Member State to complete a \n     taxability matrix, as adopted by the Governing Board. The \n     matrix shall include information regarding terms defined by \n     the Agreement in the Library of Definitions. The matrix shall \n     also include, pursuant to the requirements of the Governing \n     Board, information on use, entity, and product based \n     exemptions.\n       (12) A provision requiring that each Member State relieves \n     a seller or service provider from liability to that Member \n     State and local jurisdiction for collection of the incorrect \n     amount of sales or use tax, and relieves the purchaser from \n     penalties stemming from such liability, provided that \n     collection of the improper amount is the result of relying on \n     information provided by that Member State regarding tax \n     rates, boundaries, or taxing jurisdiction assignments, or in \n     the taxability matrix regarding terms defined by the \n     Agreement in the Library of Definitions.\n       (13) Audit procedures for sellers, including an option \n     under which a seller not qualifying for the small business \n     exception in section 4(d) may request, by notifying the \n     Governing Board, to be subject to a single audit on behalf of \n     all Member States for sales and use taxes (other than use \n     taxes on goods and services purchased for the consumption of \n     the seller). The Governing Board, in its discretion, shall \n     authorize such a single audit.\n       (14) As of the day that authority to require collection \n     commences under section 4, each Member State shall provide \n     reasonable compensation for expenses incurred by a seller \n     directly in administering, collecting, and remitting sales \n     and use taxes (other than use taxes on goods and services \n     purchased for the consumption of the seller) to that Member \n     State. Such compensation may vary in each Member State \n     depending on the complexity of the sales and use tax laws in \n     that Member State and may vary by the characteristics of \n     sellers in order to reflect differences in collection costs. \n     Such compensation may be provided to a seller or a third \n     party service provider whom a seller has contracted with to \n     perform all the sales and use tax responsibilities of a \n     seller.\n       (15) Appropriate protections for consumer privacy.\n       (16) Governance procedures and mechanisms to ensure timely, \n     consistent, and uniform implementation and adherence to the \n     principles of the streamlined system and the terms of the \n     Agreement.\n       (17) Each Member State shall apply the simplification \n     requirements of the Agreement to taxes on telecommunications \n     services, except as provided herein. This requirement is \n     applicable to Member States as of July 1, 2008, except that \n     sales and use taxes on telecommunications services shall be \n     subject to the Agreement and the authority granted to the \n     Member States when the requirements of section 4(a) are met. \n     On or after July 1, 2008, for those Member States which meet \n     the requirements of this paragraph, the authority granted \n     such Member States under section 4 may be exercised by such \n     Member States, pursuant to the terms of section 4 and section \n     5, with respect to taxes on telecommunications services other \n     than sales and use taxes on such services. The following are \n     exceptions to the requirement established under this \n     paragraph:\n       (A) The requirement for one uniform return shall not apply, \n     provided, however, there shall be one uniform return for each \n     type of tax on telecommunications services within a State.\n       (B) The requirements for rate simplification are modified \n     to require that each taxing jurisdiction shall have only one \n     rate for each type of tax on telecommunications services.\n       (C) The requirements for tax base uniformity in section 302 \n     of the Agreement shall apply to each type of tax on \n     telecommunications services within a State, but shall not be \n     construed to require that the tax base for\n\n[[Page S14193]]\n\n     different types of taxes on telecommunications services must \n     be identical to the tax base for sales and use taxes imposed \n     on telecommunications services.\n       (18) Uniform rules and procedures for ``sales tax \n     holidays''.\n       (19) Uniform rules and procedures to address refunds and \n     credits for sales taxes relating to customer returns, \n     restocking fees, discounts and coupons, and rules to address \n     allocations of shipping and handling and discounts applied to \n     multiple item and multiple seller orders.\n       (b) Requirement to Provide Simplified Tax Systems.--\n       (1) In general.--The requirements of this section are \n     intended to ensure that each Member State provides and \n     maintains the necessary simplifications to its sales and use \n     tax system to warrant the collection authority granted to it \n     in section 4.\n       (2) Reduction of administrative burdens.--The requirements \n     of this section should be construed--\n       (A) to require each Member State to substantially reduce \n     the administrative burdens associated with sales and use \n     taxes; and\n       (B) as allowing each Member State to exercise flexibility \n     in how these requirements are satisfied.\n       (3) Exception.--In instances where exceptions to the \n     requirements of this section can be exercised in a manner \n     that does not materially increase the administrative burden \n     on a seller obligated to collect or pay the taxes, such \n     exceptions are permissible.\n\n     SEC. 7.

SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON DIGITAL GOODS AND SERVICES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that each State that is a \n     party to the Agreement should work with other States that are \n     also party to the Agreement to prevent double taxation in \n     situations where a foreign country has imposed a transaction \n     tax on a digital good or service.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN:\n  S. 2153. A bill to promote simplification and fairness in the \nadministration and colleciton of sales and use taxes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have been working closely with Senator \nMike Enzi of Wyoming for several years now on Federal legislation that \nencourages and rewards State and local governments that radically \nsimplify their sales tax systems by granting them authority to require \nlarge sellers to collect taxes on remote sales after substantial \nsimplifications are implemented. This year we have delayed \nreintroducing related legislation that we cosponsored in the last \nCongress, S. 1736, primarily due to concerns that some parties have \nraised about the bill's small business exemption language.\n  After months of negotiation, there's still disagreement among the \nstakeholders about how the bill should define small remote sellers who \nwould be exempted from the bill's sales tax collection requirements. \nRegrettably, the small business exemption issues have not been resolved \nto the satisfaction of all parties and Senator Enzi is re-introducing \nessentially our same proposal from the 108th Congress as he promised. I \ncertainly respect his right and decision to do so.\n  However, I have been working on small business language that I think \nis a fair approach and will greatly improve the odds that this bill \nwill become law.\n  The bill I am introducing today is identical to the bill that Senator \nEnzi is introducing today in every respect--except one. Instead of \nputting a small business exemption in the bill with a specific dollar \nthreshold, my proposal sets up a process that I believe will help us \nget to the right answer. Under my proposal, the Small Business \nAdministration (SBA) is required, after considering all relevant \nfactors and soliciting input from the Treasury Department, the \nStreamlined Sales Tax Governing Board and others, to develop a \nrulemaking and propose to Congress a definition of those small sellers, \nincluding small businesses, which would not be required to collect and \nremit sales and use taxes. My bill provides\n\n[[Page S14194]]\n\nfor the expedited consideration of SBA's proposal by the U.S. House and \nSenate and takes steps to ensure that a small sellers' exemption will \nultimately be approved by Congress. States would be allowed to require \nimpacted remote sellers to collect sales taxes only after federally \nmandated simplification is accomplished and a small business exemption \nis approved by Congress.\n  All of the other parts of my bill are identical to those included in \nSenator Enzi's bill. These provisions also deserve our immediate \nattention. There are over 7,000 tax jurisdictions across the country \nthat rely on sales taxes to fund a range of local activities, from \neducation and fire suppression to police protection and road \nconstruction. But billions of dollars in needed sales tax revenues go \nuncollected year after year in many jurisdictions due to a ruling by \nthe U.S. Supreme Court in 1992 that said current State and local sales \ntax systems impose an undue burden on sellers without a physical \npresence in each State.\n  Internet and catalog sellers have argued that collecting and \nremitting sales taxes for thousands of different tax authorities is \nexceedingly complex. This is a legitimate complaint. And I understand \nwhy the U.S. Supreme Court in its Quill decision said that States and \nlocalities could not require sellers to collect sales tax on remote \nsales until the States and localities have first dramatically reduced \nthe complexity and burden of collecting sales taxes.\n  The States and localities have stepped up to the challenge outlined \nin the Quill decision. For five years now, the States have been working \nwith the retail community and local governments to develop a \nstreamlined and uniform sales tax system agreement that will alleviate \nthe burden of sales tax collection on local retailers and remote \nsellers.\n  The Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, which was approved by 34 \nStates and the District of Columbia in November 2002, requires \nparticipating States to comply with dozens of stringent simplification \nrequirements that streamline how State sales and use taxes are \nidentified and collected. By early next year, 19 States will have \nenacted legislation to bring them into compliance with the Agreement \nand will be members of its Governing Board.\n  By harmonizing their State sales and use tax rules, bringing \nuniformity to definitions in the sales tax base, significantly reducing \nthe paperwork burden on retailers, and incorporating a seamless \nelectronic reporting process, compliance with the Agreement will result \nin a significantly reduced tax collection burden on all sellers.\n  As the volume of remote on-line retail sales grow, states are losing \nmore and more sales tax revenues. An estimated $15 billion in sales and \nuse taxes will go uncollected in 2005. This threatens the future \nability of states and localities to make critical investments in even \nthe most basic community services, while forcing local retailers who \nare required to collect sales taxes today to compete with large remote \ncompetitors who are not. Senator Enzi and I are determined to address \nthis problem.\n  I think that the legislation I am introducing today strikes a \nreasonable balance between the interests of consumers, local retailers, \nremote sellers and the states. Having said that, I will be working with \nSenator Enzi early in the next session to see if we can put together a \nsingle approach that would address any remaining concerns about the \nsmall business exemption and help us move this legislative effort \nforward in the next session.\n  We will also have an opportunity to more fully examine some issues \nraised by the representatives of local governments and some Indian \ntribes about the impact of our initiative on their constituencies.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Isakson):\n  S. 2155. A bill to provide meaningful civil remedies for victims of \nthe sexual exploitation of children; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today Senator Isakson and I introduce \nlegislation to increase civil penalties for child exploitation. Our \nlegislation is a small piece of a larger battle that we believe will \nstop would-be child predators and protect our children. Predators like \nthe ones who exploited Masha, a little girl who was featured on Prime \nTime Live a few weeks ago, and the thousands of other children who are \nvictims of these horrific crimes.\n  According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, \nchild pornography has become a multi-billion dollar internet business. \nWith the increasingly sophisticated technology of digital media, child \npornography has become easier to produce and purchase. Countless people \naround the world have instant access to pictures and videos posted on \nthe Internet and, unfortunately, millions of these images are \npornographic depictions of infants and children. Masha is one of these \nchildren, whose images--hundreds of them--are on the Internet and being \ndownloaded around the world. And while the man who sexually abused \nMasha and posted the pictures on the web is in jail, the damage has \nbeen done and will continue until people stop downloading pictures of \nher off the internet.\n  Under current law, a victim of child exploitation is entitled to \ncivil statutory damages in U.S. District Court in the amount of \n$50,000--less than the civil penalty for illegally downloading music \noff the internet. This penalty is far too low to effectively deter \nwould-be child pornographers. This legislation increases the civil \npenalties recoverable by victims of child sexual exploitation, \nincluding internet child pornography, to at least $150,000. This \nincreased penalty will serve as a deterrent to those who disseminate \nand possess child pornography, as well as a means of compensating \nvictims of this terrible abuse. If someone downloads a song off the \nInternet, Federal copyright law provides for statutory damages to be \nawarded to the copyright holder in the amount of $150,000. Downloading \nchild pornography is far more detrimental to the victim than \ndownloading copyrighted music and, as a result, the penalty should \nreflect that.\n  But it is not only the statutory damages that are flawed. The current \nstatute states that ``Any minor who is a victim of a violation [of the \nact] may sue in United States District Court''. This language has been \ninterpreted literally by a Federal district court to restrict recovery \nto plaintiffs whose injuries occurred while they were minors. Thus, \nwhen victims turn 18 they cannot recover against their perpetrators \neven if pornographic images of them as children are still distributed \nvia the internet. Our legislation would clarify the statute to include \nvictims of child pornography who are injured as adults by the \ndownloading of their pornographic images.\n  This bill takes an important step towards ensuring justice for \nvictims of child exploitation. I would urge speedy passage of this \nlegislation as a stand alone bill or encourage its inclusion in a \nlarger child protection package. It is the very least Congress can do \nfor Masha and the thousands of children like her who have suffered at \nthe hands of these criminals. I thank Senator Isakson for his co-\nsponsorship, and I look forward to working with him and all my \ncolleagues to see that it passes the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/20/senate-section/article/S14194-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Res. 341) commending Dr. Douglas Holtz-\n     Eakin for his dedicated, faithful, and outstanding service to \n     his country and to the Senate.\n\n                              S. Res. 341\n\n       Whereas Dr. Douglas Holtz-Eakin has served as the sixth \n     Director of the Congressional Budget Office since February 4, \n     2003 and will end his service on December 29, 2005;\n       Whereas during his tenure as Director, he has continued to \n     encourage the highest standards of analytical excellence \n     within the staff of the Congressional Budget Office while \n     maintaining the independent and nonpartisan character of the \n     organization;\n       Whereas during his tenure as Director, he has expanded and \n     improved the accessibility of the Congressional Budget \n     Office's work products to the Congress and the public;\n       Whereas he has expanded and enhanced the agency's \n     macroeconomic analyses of the range of negative and positive \n     feedbacks on the economy and budget from fiscal policy \n     changes; and\n       Whereas he has earned the respect and esteem of the United \n     States Senate: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the United States commends Dr. \n     Douglas Holtz-Eakin for his dedicated, faithful, and \n     outstanding service to his country and to the Senate.\n\n  There being no objection the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the executive branch agencies have many \nprograms to recognize performance and talent. In the legislative \nbranch, we too often take personal effort and hard work for granted. \nUnfortunately, the Senate does not possess many ways to recognize \nexcellence, and thank the people who make this institution function so \nwell.\n  Today, I would like to take a little time to mention something that \nis not debatable. I think this is simply stating something that all \nMembers, on both sides of the aisle, know only too well.\n  In the three years that Dr. Douglas Holtz-Eakin has been Director of \nthe Congressional Budget Office, he has led with dedication and \nintegrity. He has provided the Members of Congress with impartial \nanalyses of a wide array of budgetary and economic issues. He has never \nhesitated to meet with Members and staff regarding any issue. Douglas \nhas always approached his responsibilities with enthusiasm and a desire \nto make sure that the information CBO provides leads decisionmakers to \ncreate better public policy outcomes.\n  Douglas Holtz-Eakin is the sixth Director of the Congressional Budget \nOffice. He was appointed to that position on February 4, 2003; \nfollowing an 18-month stint as chief economist for the President's \nCouncil of Economic Advisers.\n  During his tenure, he has certainly made an impression on CBO; \nleaving behind a legacy that Congress will benefit from for years to \ncome. He has strengthened and improved the transparency of CBO's \nanalytical methods by convening an annual Director's Conference to \nbring in outside experts to assist the agency in tackling complex \neconomic issues. He also has enhanced the publication production effort \nby publishing background papers that explain CBO's models and methods, \nworking papers that discuss new analytical developments and \nimprovements, and issue briefs that communicate analyses in a concise \nmanner for those unable to commit the time to more indepth research. \nDr. Holtz-Eakin has devoted a great amount of attention to improving \nthe clarity of CBO's work to make it more accessible to policymakers, \nprofessional analysts, and the public.\n  Under Doug's guidance, CBO extended its modeling and analytic \ncapacity; most notably in the critical areas of dynamic analysis and \nlong-term microsimulation. CBO also has begun to apply the tools of \nmodern financial analysis to improve budgetary and economic cost \nmeasures.\n  Prior to his appointment as CBO Director, Dr. Holtz-Eakin already had \na remarkable career, distinguishing himself in academia and as a public \nservant. He is a trustee professor of economics at the Maxwell School \nof Syracuse University, where he also served as chairman of the \nDepartment of Economics and as associate director of the Center for \nPolicy Research. He held positions as editor of the National Tax \nJournal, associate editor of the Journal of Human Resources, and as a \nmember of the editorial board for Public Budgeting & Finance, Economics \nand Politics, Journal of Sports Economics, Regional Science and Urban \nEconomics, and Public Works Management and Policy.\n  Earlier in his career, he held academic appointments at Columbia \nUniversity and at Princeton University. Since 1985, he has served as a \nfaculty research fellow and research associate for the National Bureau \nof Economic Research. He has been a consultant to the New Jersey State \nand Local Expenditure and Revenue Policy Commission, the State of \nArizona Joint Select Committee on State Revenues and Expenditures, and \nthe New York State Office for the Aging. He also has served as the \nExecutive Director, Tax Study Commission, New York State Assembly.\n  Dr. Holtz-Eakin's remarkable career in public service will not end \nwith CBO. He will continue making positive contributions to public \npolicy research as the next Paul A. Volcker fellow in international \neconomics and as the director of the Maurice R. Greenberg Center for \nGeoeconomic Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. The council is \na nonpartisan research organization that is national in scope and \nglobal in its reach.\n  Doug's quick wit and sense of humor will be sorely missed in the \nHalls of the Capitol and on the fourth floor of the Ford House Office \nBuilding. We wish him good luck in his new endeavors and are grateful \nfor his contributions and work on our behalf. He leaves behind a first-\nrate professional staff with high morale, testimony to his excellence \nin leadership. We wish him well.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to join Senator Gregg in commending \nthe public service of Congressional Budget Office, CBO, Director \nDouglas Holtz-Eakin. Congress will lose a valuable member of the budget \ncommunity when he leaves CBO at the end of this year to join the \nCouncil on Foreign Relations. He has been an exemplary leader for the \nagency and deserves to be recognized for his outstanding performance.\n  Director Holtz-Eakin has lived up to the high standards set by his \npredecessors at CBO. He will be remembered for leading the agency in an \nopen, straightforward, professional, and nonpartisan manner. From day \n1, Director Holtz-Eakin has been responsive and helpful on a wide range \nof requests. And he has repeatedly shown his considerable knowledge of \nthe budget and economic affairs of the Nation.\n  I was initially concerned about Director Holtz-Eakin's appointment in \n2003 to the nonpartisan CBO, because he was coming directly from an \nadministration position, as the chief economist of the President's \nCouncil of Economic Advisers. However, Director Holtz-Eakin put my \nconcerns to rest by demonstrating his desire and ability to rise above \npolitical pressures and focus on the best interests of the American \npeople.\n  Notably, Director Holtz-Eakin took a balanced and scientific approach \nregarding the issue of dynamic scoring. Ultimately, he concluded that \nthe dynamic impact of various fiscal policies could include a range of \npositive and negative effects and, in any case, was likely to be small.\n  Although we have faced difficult times for our Nation's budget, \nDirector Holtz-Eakin has provided Congress with crucial information and \ninsight. His expertise, honesty, and good humor will be missed. I \ncommend Director Holtz-Eakin for his public service and wish him the \nbest of luck in his new position.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized for 20 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/20/senate-section/article/S14196-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14196-S14198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HURRICANE KATRINA RELIEF\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, we do have some important work to finish \ntomorrow. That is why I thought I would spend a few minutes tonight \nreminding my colleagues of a very significant part of that work.\n  Before I came to work this morning, I spent a little time with our \ntwo children, our 8-year-old precious little angel girl, Mary Shannon, \nand our 12-year-old little boy. We spent some time at breakfast, and \nthen we started doing what a lot of families do around this holiday, \nand that is listen to some Christmas music and some holiday music and \nwrap a few gifts that they had actually, amazingly picked out \nthemselves for their Kris Kringles. We talked about how important it \nwas going to be to see family over the holidays. As they struggled to \nwrap the gifts, with their tape and their scissors, we tried to spend a \nlittle family time together before I came to work today.\n  It reminded me of how simple but wonderfully special those moments \nare with families at this time of year, as moms and dads make their \nregular cookies and traditional dinners and recipes and wrap packages \nthe same way and decorate the trees the same way and put out the \nnativity scenes. And all over the country that is happening.\n  There is one place that that is not happening the way it usually does \nand that is along the gulf coast of this country, and particularly in \nLouisiana.\n  About 3 months ago, two fierce storms hit our coast. We basically \nsurvived through the night, only to wake up the next morning and find \nthe levees had broken, and 200,000-plus homes and 18,000 businesses \nwere destroyed literally in a matter of a few hours.\n  The devastation was so great and so expansive and so unprecedented \nthat it has literally taken the Nation and this Congress and even \nofficials in the region, major business operations in the region, 3 \nmonths or more to actually realize the extent of the devastation.\n  I have spent a lot of time on the Senate floor with my colleague, \nSenator Vitter, showing pictures and graphs to try to explain what \nactually happened. This one isn't fancy. It is simple, but it is pretty \nclear. When we come down here to try to explain how much help the \npeople of Louisiana need, the people of Mississippi, and to some extent \na little bit in Alabama and Texas because of two killer storms, Katrina \nand Rita, and the multiple levee breaks that ensued, one figure that \nhelped my staff and our people to understand is this chart that shows \nHurricane Andrew as the most expensive storm ever to hit the coast of \nthe United States in 1992. They are still recovering from it in \nFlorida.\n  In that massive storm, 28,000 homes were destroyed--28,000, in \nHomestead, FL, and in places around. People are still living in \ntrailers after 10-plus, 14 years.\n  But I have to show my colleagues right here, in Katrina, 3 months \nago, a storm and levee break came through and around 275,000 homes, 10 \ntimes the amount of Hurricane Andrew, 10 times the amount of \ndestruction.\n  I was sitting in my home just a few blocks from here with my children \nthis morning, with three rolls of wrapping paper and a couple of pairs \nof scissors. And, thank goodness, we could find the Scotch tape which \nis always a challenge when you are wrapping gifts. I had to close my \neyes and think about my mother's house that is not occupied now after \n45 years of raising 9 children and 37 grandchildren. It had 7 feet of \nwater in it.\n  And my sisters and our friends and people from all walks of life, \nrich and poor, Black and White, senior citizens and moms and dads who \nare looking forward to having their children and grandchildren with \nthem, there are no homes to wrap these gifts or to put the tree or to \nhang the lights.\n  I just came tonight to tell my colleagues that while this bill looks \nlike just sort of a regular package of lots of words and lines and fine \nprint, what is in one of these bills tomorrow is a package of hope for \nthe 275,000 families who lived in those homes that were completely \ndestroyed--not a roof damaged, not a porch falling over, not a few \nsteps missing but homes completely destroyed.\n  I want to show you what a home completely destroyed looks like; \n275,000 homes along the gulf coast look something like this. Some of \nthem look worse.\n  This picture was in the National Geographic a couple of weeks ago. \nThis is what the homes along the gulf coast look like.\n  That is why I am not going home this Christmas while we will be \nworking as many hours and days as it takes until people like this have \nsome hope that they can get back to their home. It is not just \nChristmas, which would be impossible in this situation, but at least by \nnext Christmas.\n  I am going to say again, for the one-hundredth time, FEMA is not \nsufficient to get us back to our homes, to build our churches again, to \nrebuild our schools and to rebuild our communities. It is an \ninsufficient mechanism, and on its best day it could not accomplish \nthis goal.\n  In this package tomorrow in the Defense appropriations bill, because \nof political concerns of the Congress, we find our $29 billion hope \npackage in there that finally moves money from an agency that can't \nmanage to spend it well into the hands of competent local officials and \nlocal entities and private businesses and faith-based organizations and \nindividual Americans who show a lot of grit and a lot of heart to build \ntheir State and their community again.\n  We are not going home without the hope package. It is not fair and \nAmerica can do better.\n  This is what the inside of many homes in New Orleans looks like \nbecause the water was so high in many of our neighborhoods, even \nneighborhoods\n\n[[Page S14197]]\n\nthat had never flooded, neighborhoods that had never had a drop of \nwater before. After several weeks and finally the water went down, this \nis what families saw all throughout south Louisiana and in New Orleans, \nSt. Bernard Parish, parts of Jefferson Parish, in neighborhoods in some \nplaces where the average home is valued at $50,000 to $75,000. But \nthere are also some neighborhoods where the average home is worth $1 \nmillion.\n  In all homes, large and small, rich and poor, this is what families \nare doing this holiday season. They come up here to Senator Vitter's \noffice and to my office. ``Senator, does anybody know we are down here? \nDoes anybody know we have lost our churches, our schools, our \ncommunity? Does anybody care? What is Congress doing?''\n  Because of the good work of many Members of this body, particularly I \nhave to say Senator Thad Cochran from Mississippi, who basically \nrefused to accept an anemic and incomplete proposal from the \nadministration that basically sent money to fix a few Federal \nbuildings--I don't see a Federal building anywhere in this picture. I \nsee a family's home. I see everything that they owned destroyed, \nimpossible to reclaim. While you can buy a few sofas--let me assure you \nthat there are many you can choose from--I promise you that the wedding \nalbum which was lost is irreplaceable. The pictures of the children are \nirreplaceable. The special mementos handed down from grandmother to \nmother to daughter are gone, are priceless and can't be replaced. And \nno insurance company can provide you sufficient funding for those \nthings that have been lost.\n  This is what 250,000 homes in Louisiana look like. It is bad enough \nto lose your home. But I also want to try to impress upon the Members \nof Congress that losing your home is pretty bad because it is where \nmost people have equity. Most of the net worth of Americans is in their \nhomes. We pride ourselves on being homeowners and a nation of \nhomeowners and middle-class families.\n  But let me show you what this hurricane and flood did. It destroyed \n18,752 businesses, catastrophically destroyed, gone in Louisiana, \ncompared to 1,912 in Mississippi, 295 in Texas, and 20 in Alabama; \n18,700 businesses gone, no more; restaurants, cleaners, manufacturers, \nlaw firms, doctors' offices, clinics, just gone.\n  People who are cleaning out their houses are also cleaning out their \nbusinesses, and insurance checks are slow to come, and this hope \npackage is stuck right here in Congress.\n  Last week we had some, I guess, good news about the economic front in \nAmerica. I think you can read statistics many different ways. But for \nthe Record tonight--this came out yesterday--I saw one or two submitted \nfor the Record. The Bureau of Economic Analysis in the U.S. Department \nof Commerce, which issued the growth rate of State personal income, \nsays the hurricane slowed personal income growth.\n  You can see in a different case, but there is an absolutely dead, \nstop, halt, reverse taking place in Louisiana. There is a 25 percent \nreduction in personal income growth in Louisiana. There is no State in \nthe Nation even close.\n\n  Mississippi was hard hit, and I do not underestimate the destruction \nalong that gulf coast which we love, as I have said as many times as I \ncan, almost as much as we love Louisiana because many people in \nLouisiana grew up on the gulf coast and spent many happy days on those \nbeaches. Mississippi has grown .8 percent. The national average was \nsomething closer to 1.8 percent. Look at the dramatic fall in \nLouisiana. There is nothing close: 25 percent reduction.\n  What we are trying to say is it was not just a regular hurricane. It \nwas not just the second hurricane. It was a multiple break of Federal \nlevees that this Congress had the responsibility to build, to design, \nand to maintain, which we utterly failed to do, and we lost 250,000 \nhomes.\n  What do we tell those people? You are on your own? Go gather up your \nchurch members and see if you can raise a roof? The churches are not \nthere, either. Go to your school and gather up your community and let's \njust be self-reliant and raise ourselves up by our bootstraps. The \nschool is gone. There is no cafeteria. There is no multipurpose room. \nThere is no auditorium.\n  Least week, I went home and attended a church service briefly. It was \namazing to walk into a church where the roof was still sort of caved in \nhalfway--not dangerous but hanging; you could see the top of the roof, \nthe inside of the roof was damaged--with 1,500 people in this church. \nYou look out the front door of the church, and there are no homes \nanywhere around that are inhabitable. You wonder, Where did the people \ncome from? People drove, from what Father Vien told me, 2 and 3 hours \nto come to Mass. People are driving half a day to go back to their \nchurch to say Mass and to be in church with their community--that is \nhow meaningful it is--with the hope that maybe someday they can get \nback to their neighborhood.\n  I am not saying that Members of this Congress individually have not \ntried. There have been heroic efforts made, I believe, with what \nSenator Enzi has done in our education package; Senator Kennedy. \nSenator Cochran and Senator Lott have worked tirelessly. Senator Vitter \nhas been in this Senate and in many meetings and has taken Senators to \nLouisiana.\n  We cannot go home without help. We cannot go home without help. If \nthis package is not passed tomorrow--and I didn't package it in the \nbill it is packaged in, which is Defense--we cannot go home without our \n$29 billion hope package, moving money from FEMA, finally, thank \ngoodness; not adding money to the deficit but moving that money to \ncommunity development block grants to use in an expanded way; $3 \nbillion to protect our levee system, to give people hope and security \nthat as we begin the plan for rebuilding, they will not be flooded \nagain; help for our universities; help for our medical schools; help \nfor the infrastructure, the major highways that have been destroyed. We \ncannot go home without that hope package.\n  I hope my colleagues know what is at stake. I know everyone is \nanxious to get home to their families and to their children. I am \nlooking forward to spending some off time with my family. We cannot \nleave without passing that package of hope for the people on the gulf \ncoast. I am prepared to work through Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and \ninto Christmas on Sunday if we have to until we can get this package \ndone. If I thought we could wait until January, we could take a break \nand come back--we cannot. People are holding on by a thread.\n  Banks are threatening to foreclose on people's houses. Having given \nthem forbearance for 3 months, they are now sending people notices that \nthey will have to pay their mortgage in January. But not just the \nJanuary mortgage; they have to pay four mortgages in the month of \nJanuary. So the people who have lost 1 of the 18,000 businesses, the \npeople whose homes look like this, they are being asked to pay 4 months \nof a mortgage on this home. This family is having trouble getting a \ntrailer to live in. Meanwhile, they have to pay mortgages on this home. \nIf not, they will be foreclosed. All the equity they built up, which \ncould be considerable--several hundred thousand in some cases, \nsometimes more, maybe even over $1 billion of equity--lost, not because \nthere isn't a solution to their dilemma but because this Congress and \nthis administration haven't figured out, haven't worked hard enough to \ngive them a helping hand.\n  These people aren't looking for charity. They give to charity. Most \nof the people in Louisiana who have lost their homes have never asked \nfor a penny from anybody. All they have been doing is digging in their \npocket for the last 50 years as a family. They make a little bit of \nmoney and give to people in more need. Now the middle-class families \nwho never asked for a thing need help from us, and we can't figure out \nhow to get their hope package through?\n  I express that I am prepared to stay through Christmas day, if need \nbe, and beyond, to get this package through. I will read into the \nrecord a beautifully written paragraph from a new book that is out \nwhich is written by Tom Piazza, ``Why New Orleans Matters.''\n  I am the Senator for the whole State, and I love all 64 parishes. It \nis quite a special place and one we will fight hard to restore. The \nsouthern part of our\n\n[[Page S14198]]\n\nState has been very hard hit. Thank goodness our capital city of Baton \nRouge is standing up very strongly. They have grown from a city of \n350,000 to a city of 500,000 over the weekend, 3 months ago. The mayor \nof that city, ``Kip'' Holden, has now had to take on an additional \n150,000 citizens and is managing very well under the circumstances. \nLafayette is in the southwest and is part of Cajun Country. They have \nprobably increased 50,000 or 60,000. New Orleans is my hometown, and it \nis something we will fight hard to restore. It is representative of the \nspirit of all of Louisiana.\n  I will read into the record in closing why this fight is worth having \nand why we are not going to give up until we get the help, the money, \nthe tools, and the support.\n  He writes:\n\n       New Orleans is not just a list of attractions or \n     restaurants or ceremonies, no matter how sublime and subtle. \n     New Orleans is the interaction among all these things and \n     countless more. It gains its character from the spirit that \n     is summoned, like a hologram, in the midst all these \n     elements, and that comes, ultimately, from the people who \n     live there, and from those whose parents and grandparents and \n     ancestors lived there. That spirit, as much as, or more than, \n     the city's physical and economic infrastructure, is what is \n     in jeopardy right now. In the wake of the worst natural \n     disaster in this country's history, one from which New \n     Orleans, and the rest of the country, will be digging out for \n     years, it may be good to remember what has been lost, and to \n     think hard about what is worth fighting to save.\n\n  I plan to fight with all of my strength and energy and commitment to \nsave this wonderful city, to save south Louisiana, which has given so \nmuch, and to fight hard for people who only ever expected their \nGovernment to meet them halfway, for this Federal Government to be what \nit was created to be, which is a help to people in time of need. We are \ngoing to be here through Christmas if we have to.\n  I thank all of my colleagues for their patience and forbearance. Many \nof them have stepped up beyond the call of duty to help a State they do \nnot even represent. But, of course, as Senators, they know the need of \npeople in times like these.\n  I look forward to the debate tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/20/senate-section/article/S14198-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9 A.M.
