Mr. President, today we will start a period of morning \nbusiness until 3 p.m. Following that time, we will return to the debate \non the Gulf of Mexico energy security bill. We have a cloture vote \nscheduled for 5:30 on this bipartisan bill. I hope cloture will be \ninvoked and that we can then work together to bring that bill to a \nclose at the earliest opportunity.\n  This is our final week of business prior to the August adjournment, \nand we have some extraordinarily important measures to consider before \nwe leave.\n  We now have a freestanding pensions bill that has arrived from the \nHouse which we will need to consider before the close of the week. We \nalso have a bill that relates to an increase in the minimum wage, death \ntax reform, and some other very important tax provisions. I expect to \nschedule that bill at the earliest time, and I hope we can get \ncooperation from all Senators. The Senate will address that package \nbefore we adjourn for the recess. Chairman Stevens is ready to bring \nthe Department of Defense appropriations bill to the floor, and we will \nlook for a window to have that bill debated and voted on as well. There \nare a number of nominations--judicial and otherwise--that I hope we can \nconsider this week.\n  We have a very aggressive agenda this week that has been laid out \nbefore us--a very important one because I believe the importance and \nweight of each of these bills demands that we address them this week.\n  We have acted on a number of issues over the past several weeks, and \nmost of the recent debate has been on the issue we will consider later \ntoday, the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act.\n\n[[Page S8418]]\n\nToday we are scheduled to conclude that debate on this important piece \nof legislation. It fundamentally is a bill which will substantially \nreduce overwhelming dependence on foreign sources of oil. It would move \nus toward energy independence. It strengthens our national security, \nand it helps reduce the cost of living for American families and \nbusinesses.\n  Moving toward that energy independence is not only possible, but it \nis the key to reducing the energy prices that people feel every day \nwhen they fill up their cars with gas, when they cool their homes, or \nother times of the year when they heat their homes. The high energy \nprices affect people in their everyday lives.\n  I believe energy independence can be achieved, but a first and very \nimportant major starting point will be to make sure we bring more of \nAmerica's energy to American consumers. That is what the bill does by \nallowing deep sea exploration in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n  As I mentioned, we have a cloture vote this afternoon, and I expect \nthe final vote on the Energy Security Act hopefully sometime tomorrow.\n  There are a number of different issues before us as we continue to \nmove and produce meaningful solutions to the problems facing \nAmericans--and that is what we will continue to do.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that following the remarks by myself and \nSenator Reid, Senator Hagel be recognized for 30 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/31/senate-section/article/S8418-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Very difficult thing to get anything out of this . . . Congress. They \ndon't want to do anything for the people. They are awful anxious to do \nthings to the people, and they have done a lot of things to the people \n. . . and it's beginning to hurt.\n  That is a quote of Harry Truman.\n  Again:\n\n       Very difficult thing, to get anything out of this . . . \n     Congress. They don't want to do anything for the people. They \n     are awful anxious to do things to the people, and they have \n     done a lot of things to the people . . . and it's beginning \n     to hurt.\n\n  Those are the words of Harry Truman in 1948. He was referring to the \n80th Congress, but those remarks are directly in tune with the 109th \nCongress.\n  Like the ``do-nothing Congress'' of 1948, it is ``very difficult'' to \nget anything out of this Republican Congress. The things they are doing \nare ``beginning to hurt.''\n  Look at national security. The majority's rubberstamping of President \nBush in Iraq has made America less safe and emboldened our enemies such \nas Iran, North Korea, and al-Qaida. For the third week in a row, Iraq \nand the Middle East are plunging further into crisis, and what is the \nresponse of this Republican Congress? The estate tax, repeal of the \nestate tax.\n  Look at our economy. The majority's reckless fiscal policies have \ncreated a $9 trillion debt, placing a birth tax on our children and our \nchildren's children. In recent years, the poor have gotten poorer and \nthe rich have gotten richer, and the middle class have been squeezed.\n  What is the response of the Republicans? Repeal the estate tax--\nhundreds of billions of dollars to go to a small group of Americans, a \nvery small group of Americans, a country with 300 million people. This \nrepeal of the estate tax may affect 10,000 people--less than two-tenths \nof 1 percent of the American people.\n  Look how divided America has become. The majority's focus on issues \nsuch as marriage and flag desecration has divided our country and \ndistracted this body from more pressing concerns, problems in health \ncare, ignoring global warming, energy and gas prices.\n  I appreciate the distinguished majority leader saying he believes we \nshould move to energy independence--and we certainly should. I support \nthis drilling bill. President Clinton supported it. It allows drilling \nin the gulf coast. And it is important because it allows coastal \nrestoration--and money goes to that. But it has little to do with \nenergy independence.\n  With energy and gas prices and the rising cost to the middle class, \nwhat is the response of the Republicans? Repeal the estate tax.\n  There are just 15 legislative days left this year. Everyone knows \nthat Mondays and Fridays are not voting days in this Republican Senate. \nThat leaves us with 3 days this week and 12 when we return. What is the \nresponse of the Republicans today in the U.S. Senate? Move to repeal \nthe estate tax. Fifteen days ahead of us, and behind us 19 wasted \nmonths. The truth is this Republican Congress is actually worse than \nthe famous ``do-nothing Congress'' of 1948. That Congress worked almost \na month longer than we have.\n  Republicans ought to be ashamed of their dismal record, but it is \nclear from press reports that they are not. I got up to read the \nWashington Post yesterday morning and was really appalled when I read a \nquote from the House Republican leader in which he actually bragged \nabout how little this Congress has done.\n  I quote:\n\n       Republican leaders shrug off the ``do-nothing'' charge.\n       ``You get used to hearing that nonsense,'' said House \n     Majority Leader John Boehner (R-OH).\n\n  He went to say:\n\n       As for beating the 1948 Congress' record for lethargy, he \n     joked, ``Most Americans will be pretty happy with that.''\n\n  I don't know what his congressional district is like and how people \nfeel there, but in the rest of the country, that is not how they feel. \nAmericans aren't ``happy'' that they are paying hundreds of dollars \nmore for gasoline--sometimes every month--because this Republican \nCongress refuses to pass relief measures and won't investigate the \nsurging profits of big oil. Exxon is going to make $40 billion net \nprofit this year--$40 billion; British Petroleum, the best year they \nhave ever had.\n  They will not be investigating the surging profits of big oil because \nthis administration is the most oil-friendly administration in the \nhistory of the country.\n  This Congress doesn't have the political will necessary to rapidly \nmake us more energy independent. And what is the Republican response? \nRepeal the estate tax for two-tenths of 1 percent of the American \npeople, the richest of the rich.\n  Americans aren't ``happy'' that our troops are in the middle of a \ncivil war in Iraq because the Republican Congress won't demand the \nPresident change course.\n  That is the law which passed on a bipartisan basis. The law, as we \nspeak, is there should be a change of course in Iraq. The law says that \nthe year 2006 will be a year of significant transition in Iraq. Not \nhappening.\n  I get a report on my way to work every morning from my stalwart \nstaffers. I talked to Nathan this morning on the way to work. He said:\n\n       Senator, I don't know where to start with Iraq. We know at \n     least four American soldiers have been killed, as \n     mentioned on page A10 of the Washington Post. It doesn't \n     make the front page anymore.\n\n  The death and destruction of Iraq, as Nathan said, is hard to keep up \nwith. In the past 24 hours, scores dead. Today, there were a dozen \nIraqis beheaded. In the last month alone, 1,200 Iraqis have been \nkilled, murdered. We tried to offer the military in Iraq a strategy for \nsuccess, but Republicans chose instead to rubberstamp the President.\n  What is the response to date to all these problems? Repeal the estate \ntax. We have spent more time on repealing the estate tax than any other \none issue for the entire Congress, in this Senate. It should be clear \nwho the majority favors. We have spent all this time on less than .2 \npercent of the American people, costing the country hundreds of \nbillions of dollars.\n  Americans are not happy this President has worn down, exhausted, \noverstretched our military. In a paper I don't read very often, the \nWashington Times today reported that the military is in a state of \ndisrepair. If you are not on the front lines, you are using equipment \nthat does not work, equipment that is in need of repair. As Senator \nJack Reed has said for months and months, we have a military \ninfrastructure that is failing. The soldiers are\n\n[[Page S8419]]\n\nfighting valiantly. The Washington Times reports our military is \nshowing the wear of 5 years of war.\n  Rather than doing the Defense appropriations bill, we are going to \nwork on the estate tax repeal. Think about that. The Defense \nappropriations bill should take a few days. Readiness levels for the \nArmy are at lows not seen since Vietnam as virtually no active \nnondeployed combat brigade is prepared to perform its wartime mission. \nThe Army has asked for $17 billion in emergency funds, but the \nPresident has not submitted that. His military leaders in the field \nhave said $17 billion is what we need.\n  We do not hear anything from the President on this except ``repeal \nthe estate tax.'' Can anyone imagine that? Rather than doing what we \nshould do to help our valiant soldiers, we are going to move this week \nto repealing the estate tax. Talk about dangerous incompetence from the \nadministration and Congress, as well as making us less safe.\n  America is not happy with our borders remaining unsecure 6 years \nafter September 11, but this Republican Congress cannot pass \ncomprehensive immigration reform. Rather than the President pushing on \nthis--he says he is in favor of it--we still have this bill in the \nHouse that makes a felon of everyone, including health care workers, \npreachers, Catholic priests, and undocumented people in this country.\n  What is the answer to that in the Senate today? Repeal the estate \ntax, giving hundreds of billions of dollars to a few of the richest \npeople in the world.\n  Contrary to Majority Mr. Leader Boehner, Americans are not happy with \nthis Republican Congress which has bowed to the radical right and \nrefused to override a Presidential veto of legislation to allow our \nbest and brightest scientists to explore the promise of stem cell \nresearch. On the news today it was reported Prime Minister Blair is \ngoing to California to do a deal with the State of California to do \nstem cell research in Great Britain. We have farmed out hope for the \nmost desperate of the sick, people who have suffered injuries, who are \nparalyzed from the neck down, the waist down.\n  And what is the answer of this Congress, this Senate? Repeal the \nestate tax. Contrary to what my friend says, the majority leader in the \nHouse, Americans are not happy. This Republican Congress has \nconcentrated all its efforts on the well-off, well-connected few and \ndone nothing to assist America's middle-class families who are \nstruggling to pay the rising costs of health care, education, energy, \nwith paychecks that keep shrinking. If you are college educated in \nAmerica today, you have lost 5 percent of your earning power under this \nadministration. What is the answer of this Senate, led by the \nRepublicans? Repeal the estate tax.\n  Americans are not happy this Republican Congress has virtually \nignored the health care crisis. I have talked about stem cell research. \nThat is only part of it. Forty-six million Americans have no health \ncare. During this administration, 1 million people every month have \nbeen added to the roll of those who have no health insurance, and \nmillions of others have inadequate health insurance. The Republicans \nhave sat on their hands for 6 years as millions and millions have lost \ntheir insurance, while companies such as Ford and General Motors, \ncompanies that used to drive this economy, staples of the U.S. economy, \nhave been crippled by the rising costs. What are we doing to help them? \nWe are being asked to repeal the estate tax.\n  Americans are not happy with this Republican Congress that has pushed \nits investigation of the President's manipulation of Iraq intelligence \nuntil after the election. We were promised--promised--we would do all \nfive investigations. No way. Nine months after Democrats sent the \nSenate into a closed session over this issue, it has been announced the \nRepublican-led Intelligence Committee will not complete its work before \nNovember. And I bet they don't do it even after that. Vice President \nCheney will not let them. He runs the Intelligence Committee; we all \nknow that.\n  The only conclusion to draw is that the investigation is too \nembarrassing to Republicans to make public before the November 7 \nelection. What is the answer? I repeat, repeal the estate tax.\n  Even though my friend Congressman Boehner thinks Americans are happy, \nAmericans are not happy with this Republican Congress's cynical plan to \nplay politics with minimum wage and pensions later this week. For 10 \nyears, American workers have waited for the Republican Congress to \nraise the minimum wage. Isn't it interesting, even though it is in a \nconvoluted legislative package--and that is an understatement--when we \nsaid there would be no congressional pay raises until the minimum wage \nis increased, they are suddenly interested? During the 10 years that \npoor Americans have been waiting for a wage increase, Congress has \ngiven itself $30,000 in pay increases. In that time, the cost of \neverything--from gas to housing to heat--has gone up. And the answer of \nthe Republicans? Repeal the estate tax.\n  The Federal minimum wage has stayed the same, $5.15 an hour. For \nsomeone earning $10,000 a year, it is hard to live. Oprah did a story \non that. Maybe that is one reason--in addition to Congress not further \ngetting pay raises--for this bill. This issue is about to catch up with \nthem. But they are afraid to come forward on a straight minimum wage \nvote. They stick it in with everything else. To think they have stuck \nthe minimum wage package into the estate tax repeal. The majority does \nunderstand that elections are just around the corner and they are about \nto pay the price for ignoring America's workers. In a most transparent \nand cynical trick, Republicans have offered to give America a raise if, \nand only if, their wealthiest friends also get billions of dollars in \ntax breaks. It is such an unbelievable ploy, let me say it again: \nRepublicans are threatening to deny a $2.10 raise for 11 million \nAmericans unless they can give away hundreds of billions to less than \n.2 of 1 percent of the American people. The $2.10 raise is over a \nperiod of years. It should be immediate. The $2.10 an hour raise occurs \nif the richest of the rich get billions of dollars. It is political \nblackmail that reeks of desperation. It should fail. The estate tax has \nbeen defeated before in the Senate. Democrats have been willing to deal \nwith the estate tax and change it. We are willing to do that.\n\n  Now Republicans have backed off and only about 80 percent agree. This \nis the most contemptuous election year trick I have ever seen. It has \nnothing to do with giving workers a raise and everything to do with \nproviding Republicans political cover. Everything we have done in this \nSenate has been directed toward repealing the estate tax.\n  We had a deal we worked for a year on a conference on pensions. It \nwas all done. They were ready to sign the papers. It was a bipartisan \nagreement. It is gone because of the estate tax. Now we have a \nfreestanding bill on pensions coming to the Senate.\n  To make matters worse, Republicans are willing to put the defense of \nour Nation on the back burner. I talked about the deterioration of our \nmilitary. It was recorded in the news today all over the country. I \nread it in the Washington Times. The Senate has not acted on a Defense \nappropriations bill even though the President's own military leaders \nhave said they need an emergency supplemental appropriation of $17 \nbillion to take care of the equipment that has gone to pieces as a \nresult of the war.\n  The Defense appropriations bill funds our national security policy \nand includes money for our troops and our equipment and determines how \nwe address our national security challenges around the world. What are \nthey doing? Not the Defense appropriations bill, but how can they get \nto the meat of repealing the estate tax?\n  With all the problems we have in this country, where are their \npriorities? We see what their priorities are. In a time of war, one \nwould think this bill would be priority No. 1, that we would do \neverything in our power to ensure the Senate has ample time to debate \nand pass this important legislation, but Republicans are threatening to \njeopardize Senate passage of this bill so they can focus on their \nmillion-dollar friends. It is an insult that the American people can \nsee through, as they can see through the tricks Republicans are playing \nwith the pension bill.\n  As I indicated, the conferees have worked to reconcile this House \npension bill for more than a year. They basically have completed it, \nand now the wealthy few are ahead of the retirement security of \nmillions of working\n\n[[Page S8420]]\n\nAmericans, further evidence that America needs a new direction. Cry as \nthey might, Republicans cannot escape the record. History will record \nthis as the do-nothing Congress of 2006 and it will be forever, most \nlikely, the 1948 do-nothing Congress. No one is happy about this \nsituation, contrary to what Republican leaders say.\n  We have 15 days left. I respectfully suggest to the other side it is \ntime to get to work on the real problems, not the estate tax.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Nebraska is next.\n  Mr. REID. I have not yielded the floor. I still have the floor.\n  I yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I see the Senator from Nebraska, and I will not take much \ntime, but I would ask a question of the Senator from Nevada.\n  The Senator from Nevada has been in the Congress as long as I have. \nWe came together in 1982. We have seen a lot of things happen. I ask \nthe Senator from Nevada if, in his time in serving in Congress, he has \never seen a worse special interest bill than this bill which would \nrepeal the estate tax which affects about 2 families out of every \n1,000, families who are the wealthiest in America, that the Republican \nleadership in the House and Senate insist we have to reduce their taxes \nbefore we can ever consider giving an increase in the minimum wage to \n11 million workers who get up every morning and go to work? For 9 \nstraight years, the Republican leadership in the White House and \nCongress has said to these hard-working Americans, no pay raise. Now--\nnow--comes the deal. The Republicans have finally said: OK, all right, \nour conscience has finally gotten to us--or maybe it is the fear of \nlosing our congressional pay raise--but now we will consider the \nminimum wage pay raise as long as you will cut the taxes on the \nwealthiest people in America as part of the bargain.\n\n  Has the Senator from Nevada ever seen a worse special interest \nbargain in 24 years?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the distinguished minority whip, the \ntime we have spent on this Senate floor dealing with estate tax, think \nwhat we could have done in energy, health care, education, the debt, \nbut they are spending it on this massive debt increase. Hundreds of \nbillions of dollars we will increase the debt--this year's deficit--the \ndebt over the next 10 years. I have never seen anything like it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator from Nevada this--and he \ngoes to the point. It is not just the basic injustice and unfairness of \nsaying you will not give the hardest working, lowest paid Americans any \nincrease in their hourly wage unless you give the wealthiest Americans \na tax break that, frankly, only but a few of them have asked for.\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada, the outcome of this deal--if they pull \nit off--will increase the debt of America, will increase the money we \nhave to borrow from China and Japan and Korea and Saudi Arabia, will \nleave a greater debt for our children so the Republican dream of \nreducing the estate tax for the wealthiest people in America will come \ntrue. Does the Senator from Nevada think that increasing America's \ndebt, cutting taxes in the midst of a war, is sound evidence of fiscal \nconservatism?\n  Mr. REID. This increases the national debt by hundreds of billions of \ndollars. I ask my friends on the other side of the aisle, how could you \nlet this happen? I say that. I plead: How can you let this happen?\n  We will try to stop it. We would like a little help. How can you let \nthis happen? I am really troubled. I cannot understand how they would \neven have the audacity to bring this up: a $2.10 increase over 2 or 3 \nyears--it is not all at once--and a massive, immediate cessation of the \nrichest of the rich having to pay basically any taxes on their estates.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Last question I would like to ask the Senator----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the minority in morning \nbusiness has expired.\n  Mr. REID. I will use my leader time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Nevada to yield for one further \nquestion. I thank the Senator from Nebraska for his patience.\n  We have struggled long and hard over the last several months to ask \nthe Republican leadership in the Senate to bring up the issues, the \nbills, the laws that people care about: reducing the cost of gasoline \nfor working families and businesses and farmers in Nevada, Illinois, \nTexas, and Nebraska; working on doing something about the 46 million \nuninsured Americans; dealing with the issues that we face when people \ncannot afford to send their kids to college; dealing with the real \nsecurity of America so we live up to the 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations to make America safe.\n  I will ask the Senator from Nevada, in closing, as we have asked time \nand time and time again, to bring up the real issues that count, such \nas an increase in the minimum wage, is it not a fact that, instead, the \nRepublican leadership has pushed aside the real issues, such as money \nfor our troops, pushed aside the energy program which we need for \nAmerica, and said, instead: We are going to have a parade of \nconstitutional amendments that are extreme--many of them--and then we \nhave to always come back to repealing the estate tax? It is a higher \npriority to them than anything I have mentioned.\n  Mr. REID. Legislative heaven, obviously, for the Republicans in this \nCongress is the estate tax.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/31/senate-section/article/S8420-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8420-S8422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MIDDLE EAST--A REGION IN CRISIS\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, the Middle East today is a region in \ncrisis. After 3 weeks of escalating and continuing violence, the \npotential for wider regional conflict becomes more real each day. The \nhatred in the Middle East is being driven deeper and deeper into the \nfabric of the region, which will make any lasting and sustained peace \neffort very difficult to achieve.\n  How do we realistically believe that a continuation of the systematic \ndestruction of an American friend, the country and people of Lebanon, \nis going to enhance America's image and give us the trust and \ncredibility to lead a lasting and sustained peace effort in the Middle \nEast?\n  The sickening slaughter on both sides must end, and it must end now. \nPresident Bush must call for an immediate cease-fire. This madness must \nstop. The Middle East today is more combustible and complex than it has \never been. Uncertain popular support for regime legitimacy continues to \nweaken governments in the Middle East. Economic stagnation, persistent \nunemployment, deepening despair, and wider unrest enhance the ability \nof terrorists to recruit and succeed.\n  An Iran with nuclear weapons raises the specter of broader \nproliferation and a fundamental strategic realignment in the region, \ncreating more regional instability. America's approach to the Middle \nEast must be consistent and sustained, and it must understand the \nhistory, the interests, and the perspectives of our regional friends \nand allies.\n  The United States will remain committed to defending Israel. Our \nrelationship with Israel is a special and historic one. But it need not \nand cannot be at the expense of our Arab and Muslim relationships. That \nis an irresponsible and dangerous false choice.\n  Achieving a lasting resolution to the Arab-Israeli conflict is as \nmuch in Israel's interest as any other country in the world. Unending \nwar will continually drain Israel of its human capital, resources, and \nenergy as it continually fights for its survival.\n  The United States and Israel must understand that it is not in their \nlong-term interests to allow themselves to become isolated in the \nMiddle East and the world. Neither can allow themselves to drift into \nan ``us against the world'' global optic or zero-sum game. That would \nmarginalize America's global leadership, our trust and influence, \nfurther isolating Israel, and it would prove disastrous for both \ncountries, as well as the region. It is in Israel's interest, as much \nas ours, that the United States be seen by all states in the Middle \nEast as fair. This is the currency of trust.\n  The world has rightly condemned the despicable actions of Hezbollah \nand\n\n[[Page S8421]]\n\nHamas terrorists who attacked Israel and kidnapped Israeli soldiers. \nIsrael has the undeniable right to defend itself against aggression. \nThis is the right of all nations.\n  Hezbollah is a threat to Israel, to Lebanon, and to all who strive \nfor lasting peace in the Middle East. However, military action alone \nwill not destroy Hezbollah or Hamas. Extended military action is \ntearing Lebanon apart, killing innocent civilians, devastating its \neconomy and infrastructure, and creating a humanitarian disaster, \nfurther weakening Lebanon's fragile democratic government, \nstrengthening popular Muslim and Arab support for Hezbollah, and \ndeepening hatred of Israel's position across the Middle East. The \npursuit of tactical military victories at the expense of the core \nstrategic objective of Arab-Israeli peace is a hollow victory. The war \nagainst Hezbollah and Hamas will not be won on the battlefield.\n  To achieve a strategic shift in the conditions for Middle East peace, \nthe United States must use the global condemnation of terrorist acts as \nthe basis for substantive change. For a lasting and popularly supported \nresolution, only a strong Lebanese Government and a strong Lebanese \nArmy, backed by the international community, can rid Lebanon of these \ncorrosive militias and terrorist organizations.\n  President Bush and Secretary Rice must become and remain deeply \nengaged in the Middle East. Only U.S. leadership can build a consensus \nof purpose among our regional and international partners. To lead and \nsustain U.S. engagement, the President should appoint a statesman of \nglobal stature, experience, and ability to serve as his personal envoy \nto the region. This individual would report directly to the President \nand be empowered with the authority to speak and act for the President. \nFormer Secretaries of State Baker and Powell fit this profile.\n  The President must publicly decry the slaughter today and work toward \nan immediate cease-fire in the Middle East. The U.N. Security Council \nmust urgently adopt a new binding resolution that provides a \ncomprehensive political, security, and economic framework for Lebanon, \nIsrael, and the region--a framework that begins with the immediate \ncessation of violence.\n  I strongly support the deployment of a robust international force \nalong the Israel-Lebanon border to facilitate a steady deployment of a \nstrengthened Lebanese Army into southern Lebanon to eventually assume \nresponsibility for security and the rule of law.\n  America must listen carefully to its friends, its partners in the \nregion. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, and others--countries that \nunderstand the Middle East far better than we do--must commit to help \nresolve today's crisis, and they must be active partners in helping \nrealize the already-agreed-upon two-state solution.\n  The core of all challenges in the Middle East remains the underlying \nArab-Israeli conflict. The failure to address this root cause will \nallow Hezbollah, Hamas, and other terrorists to continue to sustain \npopular Muslim and Arab support--a dynamic that continues to undermine \nAmerica's standing in the region and the Governments of Egypt, Jordan, \nSaudi Arabia, and others, whose support is critical for any Middle East \nresolution.\n  The United States should engage our Middle East and international \npartners to revive the Beirut Declaration, or some version of that \ndeclaration, proposed by King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and adopted \nunanimously by the Arab League in March of 2002. In this historic \ninitiative, the Arab world recognized Israel's right to exist and \nsought to establish a path toward a two-state solution and broader \nArab-Israeli peace. Even though Israel could not accept it as it was \nwritten, it represented a very significant starting point--starting \npoint--document initiated by Arab countries. Today, we need a new \nBeirut Declaration-type initiative. We squandered the last one.\n  The concept and intent of the 2002 Beirut Declaration is as relevant \ntoday as it was in 2002. An Arab-initiated, Beirut-type declaration \nwould reinvest regional Arab States with a stake in achieving progress \ntoward Israeli-Palestinian peace. This type of initiative would offer a \npositive alternative--a positive alternative--vision for Arab \npopulations to the ideology and goals of Islamic extremists. The United \nStates must explore this approach as part of its diplomatic engagement \nin the Middle East.\n  Lasting peace in the Middle East, and stability and security for \nIsrael, will come only from a regionally oriented political settlement. \nFormer American Middle East Envoy Dennis Ross once observed that in the \nMiddle East a process is necessary because a process absorbs events. \nWithout a process, events become crises. He was right. Look at where we \nare today in the Middle East with no process. Crisis diplomacy is no \nsubstitute for sustained, day-to-day engagement.\n  America's approach to Syria and Iran is inextricably tied to Middle \nEast peace. Whether or not they were directly involved in the latest \nHezbollah and Hamas aggression in Israel, both countries exert \ninfluence in the region in ways that undermine stability and security. \nAs we work with our friends and allies to deny Syria and Iran any \nopportunity to further corrode the situation in Lebanon and the \nPalestinian territories, both Damascus and Tehran must hear from \nAmerica directly.\n  As John McLaughlin, the former Deputy Director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency, recently wrote in the Washington Post--and I quote \nMr. McLaughlin--\n\n       Even superpowers have to talk to bad guys. The absence of a \n     diplomatic relationship with Iran and the deterioration of \n     the one with Syria--two countries that bear enormous \n     responsibility for the current crisis [in the Middle East]--\n     leave the United States with fewer options and levers than \n     might otherwise have been the case.\n       Distasteful as it might have been to have or to maintain \n     open and normal relations with such states, the absence of \n     such relations ensures that we will have more blind spots \n     than we can afford and that we will have to deal through \n     surrogates on issues of vital importance to the United \n     States.''\n       Ultimately, the United States will need to engage Iran and \n     Syria with an agenda open to all areas of agreement and \n     disagreement. For this dialog to have any meaning or possible \n     lasting relevance, it should encompass the full agenda of \n     issues.\n       There is very little good news coming out of Iraq today. \n     Increasingly vicious sectarian violence continues to propel \n     Iraq toward civil war.\n       The U.S. announcement last week to send additional U.S. \n     troops and military police back into Baghdad reverses last \n     month's decision to have Iraqi forces take the lead in \n     Baghdad and represents a dramatic setback for the U.S. and \n     the Iraqi Government.\n       The Iraqi Government has limited ability to enforce the \n     rule of law in Iraq, especially in Baghdad. Green zone \n     politics appear to have little bearing or relation to the \n     realities of the rest of Iraq. The Iraqis will continue to \n     face difficult choices over the future of their country.\n       The day-to-day responsibilities of governing and security \n     will soon have to be assumed by Iraqis. This is not about \n     setting a timeline. This is about understanding the \n     implications of the forces of reality. This reality is being \n     determined by Iraqis, not Americans.\n       America is bogged down in Iraq and this is limiting our \n     diplomatic and military options. The longer America remains \n     in Iraq in its current capacity, the deeper the damage to our \n     force structure--particularly the U.S. Army.\n       And it will continue to place more limitations on an \n     already dangerously overextended force structure that will \n     further limit our options and public support.\n       The Middle East crisis represents a moment of great danger, \n     but it is also an opportunity.\n       Crisis focuses the minds of leaders and the attention of \n     nations. The Middle East need not be a region forever captive \n     to the fire of war and historical hatred. It can avoid this \n     fate if the United States pursues sustained and engaged \n     leadership worthy of our history, purpose, and power. America \n     cannot fix every problem in the world; nor should it try. But \n     we must get the big issues and important relationships right \n     and concentrate on those.\n       We know that without engaged and active American \n     leadership, the world is more dangerous. The United States \n     must focus all of its leadership and resources on ending this \n     madness in the Middle East now.\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today I pay tribute to my very close \nfriend, Roger Andal. Last month, Roger died following a long battle \nwith Crohn's disease. His passing is a tremendous loss to our veterans, \nas well as a personal loss for my family and me. His friendship will be \nterribly missed.\n  Roger began his extraordinary service to our country as a combat \nmedic with the Army's Fourth Infantry Division during the war in \nVietnam. It was Roger's duty to help his fallen comrades and tend to \ntheir wounds, and it was a responsibility that came naturally to him.\n  He braved enemy fire to ensure the injured were safely evacuated from \nthe battlefield. Roger often did so with little regard to his own \npersonal safety and was ultimately wounded in battle.\n  He received the Purple Heart, the Vietnam Service Medal, the Campaign \nMedal, and the Army Commendation Medal for his service to his country. \nBut for Roger what mattered most were not the commendations, but the \nknowledge that he had helped his fellow soldiers.\n  After returning stateside, Roger dedicated himself to working on \nbehalf of our Nation's veterans. For the next 30 years, he was active \nin various veterans' causes, and at the time of his death he was \ncompleting his service as the South Dakota commander of the Disabled \nAmerican Veterans.\n  The creed of the Disabled American Veterans is ``building better \nlives for America's disabled veterans and their families.'' I think \nit's profoundly true to say Roger personified these words and made them \nhis life's mission.\n  As a former Army medic, Roger understood both the physical and \nemotional wounds of war. Some soldiers survive the harrows of battle, \nonly to suffer severe injuries including brain trauma and amputated \nlimbs. These veterans required lifelong medical treatment, and Roger \nwas adamant that they receive it.\n  Roger also recognized that some wounds heal long after the battle is \nover, if at all. That is why he consistently called upon his \ncongressional Representatives to increase funding for posttraumatic \nstress disorder initiatives.\n  Roger fought to make sure homeless veterans were sheltered. He worked \nto make sure that soldiers returning from war were transitioned back to \nsociety with as much ease as possible. But the issue most identified \nwith Roger was mandatory funding.\n  I have introduced mandatory funding legislation in each of the past \nthree Congresses, and Roger was the bill's most tireless and dedicated \nchampion. If it were possible to pass mandatory funding based on \nRoger's passion and commitment, enacting this legislation into law \nwould have happened long ago.\n  Mandatory funding is long overdue, and in honor of Roger, I believe \nwe must redouble our efforts to ensure the VA health care program has \nguaranteed funding adequate to provide veterans' health care each and \nevery year.\n  For over three decades Roger never shied away from a fight. He was \nmotivated by his sincere belief that if you make a promise to the men \nand women placed in harm's way, then you have a responsibility to honor \nthose commitments when they return.\n  But what Roger valued most was honesty. He was a straight-shooter, \nand it was one of his most endearing personality traits. If you asked \nRoger a question, he would give you a straight answer--and he expected \none in return.\n  It speaks volumes about Roger's character that his peers continually \nelected him to leadership positions within the Disabled American \nVeterans. In addition to holding every elected position in the Sioux \nFalls chapter of the DAV, Roger served twice as the State commander, \nand represented South Dakota on the executive national committee.\n  On a personal note, Roger had a close working relationship with my \nstaff and in particular with my Chief of Staff, Drey Samuelson. He was \nan invaluable resource and often provided insight on legislation and \nveterans' benefits programs. Despite occasional legislative setbacks, \nRoger always kept a positive outlook on the process.\n  In the days following Roger's death some veterans have expressed how \nmuch more difficult the fight will be without Roger to lead the charge. \nWithout question, Roger's voice will be missed. But we should remember \nthat the best way to honor Roger's life is to fight wholeheartedly for \nthe causes he championed.\n  Mr. President, my thoughts are with Roger's wife Peggy and their two \nchildren during this difficult time. Roger left us much too soon, but \nhis commitment to our veterans and his service to the public and to our \nNation will continue to inspire us all.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I rise to speak on S. 3711. My understanding is, \nthrough a unanimous consent agreement, I am permitted to speak for 10 \nminutes on the bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/31/senate-section/article/S8422-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8422-S8423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   GULF OF MEXICO ENERGY SECURITY ACT\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, over the last several days we have been \ndiscussing the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act. Today, in an hour or \nso from now, we will have a cloture vote on this very important \nlegislation. For my part, I have tried to make it clear how important \nthis legislation is to my State of Florida, how important the \nprotection of our fragile environment in our State is to our people. As \na young 15-year-old, I came to Florida as many people who have been \ntransplanted from elsewhere, to enjoy a Florida lifestyle. Since that \ntime I have been in love with this wonderful State, what it has to \noffer to people, to families, and the great traditions Florida has had \nas a place to enjoy the outdoors. I have on countless occasions enjoyed \nFlorida's beaches, fishing, enjoyed other outdoor pursuits which are \nsuch a natural part of what Florida is about.\n  As the years have gone by, I have passed that on and instilled that \nin my children, as I did a little bit yesterday, passing it on to my \ngrandchildren when we were enjoying New Smyrna beach yesterday, under \nthat hot Florida sun, but also the beautiful sandy beaches. Part of \nwhat this bill is about for Floridians is protecting the future, \npassing that love on to other generations by ensuring that Florida \nremains pristine, that it remains the kind of place a visitor from all \nover the country would choose to come to enjoy year after year and \nwhere other Florida families might begin to develop and enjoy their own \nfamily traditions, enjoying the great outdoors Florida has to offer, \nour sandy beaches, the fishing, and other recreational opportunities \nthat come about as a result of this wonderful natural habitat we have.\n  But also protecting it is important as an economic consideration. It \nis part of what makes Florida's economy so thriving and important--the \ntourism. Before there was Disney and Universal Studios, and those types \nof attractions, it was the beaches and the climate that brought folks \nto Florida to come and enjoy. At the end of the day, that is our \ncalling card.\n  Protecting Florida's environment is not something we take lightly. \nProtecting the environment in Florida is not something that is a \nRepublican or a Democratic issue. That is why Senator Nelson, my \ncolleague from Florida, and I have worked so closely together over the \nlast year or so as this great debate has raged on about what to do to \nprotect Florida, while at the same time yielding ever more increasing \npressures to drill and explore in the Outer Continental Shelf.\n  In the Senate, I maintain another tradition--the tradition of other \nFlorida Senators, Connie Mack, Bob Graham, others who have fought over \ntime to protect Florida's treasures from those who don't share our \nvalues. I am proud to be part of that tradition.\n\n[[Page S8423]]\n\nI am firmly committed to this tradition. And in that tradition, I have \nworked very hard on--and I am proud to say--what I believe has been a \ngood compromise for our State, along with Senator Nelson and members of \nthe Florida delegation in the House of Representatives, who have worked \ndiligently as well to protect their areas of Florida, protect the State \nand at the same time understanding the great pressures we are under and \nthe battle that has gotten fiercer and fiercer as demand has increased \nfor ever more production of gas and oil.\n  As the prices at the pump continue to go up, as prices drive \nbusinesses abroad and overseas because of the high cost of natural gas, \nthat pressure has been ever increasing. What I want to do today, in \nhoping that the people across the State and also across our Nation \nunderstand, is say that this bill puts the control of the future of our \nState in our hands.\n  As the map here shows, it provides a tremendous zone of protection \nfor the State of Louisiana--125 miles south of Pensacola and the \npanhandle, but almost 320 some miles from Naples and 237 miles from \nTampa. This yellow area is all part of the zone of protection that \nFlorida will enjoy until the year 2022, a long time from now.\n  As a result of that protection, we have also done something very \nimportant to our State, which is upholding the tradition of our \nmilitary readiness. This is a military mission line here, where no \ndrilling will take place east of this line. What this does is protects \nthe training missions that take place out of Eglin Air Force Base, \nHurlburt Field, and the Naval Air Station in Pensacola as well. They \ntrain and practice. They test in this area here the guided munitions \nthat are such a part of the necessary and difficult and dangerous world \nin which we live. Those marvelous weapons can sometimes make the \ndifference between striking the right target or not due to these tests \nin the Gulf of Mexico. The F-22 fighter, which is going to be a very \nimportant part of the future of our military readiness, is going to \ntrain here. It is so fast that it requires the vastness of the Gulf of \nMexico to be able to conduct maneuvers and training exercises that are \nnecessary.\n  So this is a zone of protection for our State until 2022. Some might \nsay it is just protection for the gulf. What about the Keys and the \neast coast of Florida? That is under a moratorium presently. The \nimportant protection here is to the gulf coast.\n  What has been under siege, gone after, is this area denoted as 181 \nand this shore, which is the stovepipe. This is what we have been \nseeking to protect, so we could protect our beaches until we had \nassurances that as exploration took place in this area for what is such \na needed product, we also were protecting the military line and \nFlorida's west coast. The east coast at this point is not under the \nsame kinds of threat.\n  At the end of the day, there are going to be other attempts that we \nwill have to fight and do what we can to protect Florida. At this \nmoment, the crucial protection was to the gulf coast.\n  I am very thankful to Senator Domenici, chairman of the Energy \nCommittee, who worked closely with me and has allowed me to play a role \nin crafting this important legislation, attempting to understand \nFlorida's concerns, attempting to understand the difficult choices we \nhave to make in this issue. Also, I appreciate the members of the House \nof Representatives. They have passed a very different bill from this \none. I believe the protections for Florida in this bill are superior. I \nwill take a moment to thank them for their diligence and vigilance for \nour State and for trying to come up with solutions and answers in a \ndifferent environment than I have worked in with Senator Nelson in the \nSenate.\n  I want to make sure that, with great respect, we hope this is the \nlegislation that will ultimately emerge and be passed by both Houses. I \ncannot support the House version. I have had clear assurances from our \nleaders that we are committed to working from the framework of the \nSenate bill. That has been important to me, and while I respect the \nhard work of our House colleagues and their autonomy as a body of \nCongress, I believe also we have to prevail on this Senate version of \nthe bill. It is what the Senate can pass this year. It is the reality \nof the situation. I am hopeful we can impress upon our colleagues in \nthe House by an overwhelming vote of support for this measure. Now is \nthe time and this is the opportunity to protect Florida while at the \nsame time providing some measure of improvement to the conditions we \nfind ourselves in today with such a desperate need for oil and gas.\n\n  This area is rich in not only oil but natural gas. The natural gas \nproduction from this area may be greater than that of oil. That is a \ntremendously important resource for our Nation today as we try to power \nour plants and other facilities, at a time when so much electricity is \nbeing generated by the use of natural gas. It is important that we do \nall we can to bring down the price of natural gas. Chairman Domenici \nbelieves that, in talking with people in the industry, the passage of \nthis bill could have a significant impact on the price of futures as it \nrelates to natural gas. I hope that will come to pass because that will \nbode well for our Nation's energy needs and also for those who are \ntrying to maintain jobs here that have been recently moving overseas.\n  Another part of the bill--and the Senator from Louisiana is on the \nfloor; she has been such a good person to work with and is very \nunderstanding of Florida, but also has a very different perspective \nfrom her State. I know the revenue-sharing parts of the bill are going \nto be a great opportunity for the Gulf States that do so much of the \ndirty work involving this--that put their shoreline on the line so the \nUnited States can be more energy self-sufficient--to do the things that \nare necessary as a result of the demanding nature of this work. Florida \nwon't be doing that. Florida sought protection rather than revenue, and \nthat is what we got.\n  I feel good about the bill. I think this is the best Florida can do \nat this time. The zone of protection we wanted to have, which was 125 \nmiles, has been greatly exceeded in most dimensions, and we can go \nforward until the year 2022 with a settled plate, understanding that \nthere will be production coming out of the gulf, but it will not impact \nour State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/31/senate-section/article/S8423-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the hour \nof 3 p.m. having arrived, the Senate will resume consideration of S. \n3711, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3711) to enhance the energy independence and \n     security of the United States by providing for exploration, \n     development, and production activities for mineral resources \n     in the Gulf of Mexico, and for other purposes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 5:30 p.m. shall be divided equally between the two managers or \ntheir designees.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, before the Senator from Florida leaves \nthe floor--and he may be staying through the debate--he has been \nextremely essential and instrumental and vital to the compromise that \nhas come forward. I want to thank him for his leadership. As he alluded \nto, the five States in the gulf coast came together--the States of \nLouisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, and the State of the \npresiding officer, Texas, and he did an outstanding job as part of the \ncoalition as well--with an arrangement that would have many mutual \nbeneficial parts. One, it is going to provide oil and gas, and \nparticularly natural gas. That is in such short supply. The Senator \nfrom Florida knows and all of our colleagues from Florida understand \nthat natural gas is a raw material that is used to literally produce \nalmost every product in America that you can think of, from rubber \ntires, to the automobiles themselves, to the products of ethanol, to \nfertilizers, chemicals--you name it, natural gas is used as a raw \nmaterial.\n  The prices are too high. They have to come down. The industry is \ndoing a\n\n[[Page S8424]]\n\nvery good job of conserving, but we must open domestic supply, as well \nas--unfortunately, because the demand is so high--import liquefied \nnatural gas, now that the technology has presented itself. But before \nwe establish another network of dependency, let's at least do our part \nand produce the natural gas we have here. So on this bill, the Gulf \nCoast States have come together to open up 8 million new acres, four \ntimes more than the original bill--in the compromise we provided, four \ntimes more than the original bill to open natural gas for the country.\n  The other beneficial aspect of this bill is establishing a strong and \nreliable, trustworthy partnership between the Federal Government and \nthe Gulf Coast States--the four producing States, of which Texas is \none--and to say the infrastructure that we provide, basically allowing \nthe Federal Government to access the land it owns--and there is no \nquestion that this land off the coast of the United States is owned by \neverybody, not just the States along the coast. But, frankly, as you \nknow, without our highways and helicopter pads, and our sheds, and our \nboat launches, and our shipping facilities, and fabrication facilities, \nthe Federal Government could not even access the minerals. So, \nbasically, by providing the servitude and the services and the \nplatform, if you will, to host this great industry, we are saying let \nus share in all future revenues--as you know, 37.5 percent. That is the \nsecond most important thing in my mind that has been established.\n  For Louisiana's purposes, and according to the way the bill is \ncurrently structured for all of the Gulf Coast States, we will use that \nmoney to restore a great coastline, to secure and buffer America's only \nenergy coast. We don't have to roll the reels back or rewind the tape \nof Katrina and Rita. We know what megastorms can mean for the gulf \ncoast. We have all lived through them. We have watched our families \nstruggle. We have watched our constituents struggle, having lost homes, \nchurches, and schools, having seen the great infrastructure, the huge \npipelines and facilities, drilling ships, and oil rigs and platforms \nbent by the great winds and waves. We know how important it is to take \na little bit of that money we are paying in taxes and reinvest back \ninto the gulf coast to strengthen the infrastructure, not just for the \npeople who live there in the big towns such as New Orleans and Creole, \nLA, and midsize towns such as Beaumont and Galveston, and Gulfport, and \nPass Christian, but for the whole Nation, because the Nation needs the \ngulf coast to be strong and secure in these storms.\n  So using this money to restore the great wetlands, which our \nscientists know we can do--but, frankly, we have not had the money to \ndo it. People say, Senator, get a plan. I could almost fill up this \nChamber with plans our people have had--or I can say dreams our people \nhave had.\n  We have dreamed all we can dream. We have thought all we can think \nabout this. We need money to turn the dirt and restore the wetlands. \nThe technology is there to do it.\n  That is another great reason that we can have industry and the \nenvironmental community support this bill shoulder to shoulder, because \nthe uses of the revenue sharing are going to be of such benefits to our \ncommunities.\n  Besides the drilling and the additional revenues for the gulf coast \nand the additional gas for the Nation, we also have the benefit of \ndirecting these revenues to a great purpose, which is the restoration \nof these wetlands.\n  Just a little more on that subject that might bring this home to \nthose who are listening. When Katrina and Rita hit--and we are just \nabout a month away from the anniversary, August 29 for Katrina and \nabout 7 weeks away from the anniversary of Rita--we lost an area the \nsize of the District of Columbia to open water, 100 square miles. The \nDistrict isn't 100 square miles today, as you know, Mr. President, \nbecause a portion was given back to Virginia, but about 70 square miles \nis the District of Columbia now. We lost in a matter of a few days that \namount of expanse. It went from marsh to open water because of the \ncatastrophic loss of this great wetland. At that rate, all of our \ncommunities along the gulf coast will eventually be threatened.\n  I laugh at my colleagues from Arkansas because the reason they are \nvery supportive of this bill is because they told me privately: \nSenator, we don't want to be a coastal State; we like Arkansas the way \nit is.\n  I know that is a little bit of an exaggeration, but, Mr. President, \nyou have been down to east Texas, to Padre Island, to Galveston and \ncoastal communities in Texas. You understand the wetland losses that \nare occurring. Ours in Louisiana are exacerbated because we are the \nmouth of the Mississippi River. We are truly a delta, not just a \ncoastal wetland, which you find all over our coast from the east to the \nwest. But the delta, the mouth of the river system, is strong, yet \nfragile, and these wetlands are leaving us in extraordinary numbers. \nThis money, this sharing of revenues we are going to get from this \nbill, will go a long way to build on the science and technology that is \nthere to restore these wetlands. We know we can do it.\n  Mr. President, 37.5 percent will go to the gulf coast producing \nStates for these purposes; 12.5 percent will establish a great stream \nof revenue for the Land and Water Conservation Fund that benefits the \nwhole Nation.\n  I see the Democratic whip on the floor. I will wrap up my remarks in \njust a moment. I think I am scheduled later to speak.\n  I am very grateful to particularly Senator Salazar and others who \nstepped up--Senator Alexander--and said: Senator Landrieu, why don't we \ntry, with Senator Domenici's leadership, to see if we can restore the \nreal purpose of the Land and Water Conservation Fund when it was \ncreated in 1965.\n  I wish I could take credit for creating it. I didn't, but I have been \ndetermined since I got here to help fund it so we can live up to a \npromise we made to America's Governors a long time ago: If you want to \nbuild parks, we will help you. If you want to build recreational \nopportunities for your community, we will help you. The Federal \nGovernment said that and then backtracked year after year until today \nwe are spending less than $40 million a year nationally. I would say \nthat is a disgrace, $40 million nationally. The program is authorized \nat $450 million. At $450 million, it is still not enough, but at least \nit gives a few million dollars to each State to match private \ndonations, to match faith-based donations, to match literally the \npennies children collect for the planting of a tree in a park or the \nexpansion of a bike path that means a lot to them. We can at least do \nour part in Congress, and this bill will do that.\n  Then finally, 50 percent will go to the Federal Treasury. So as those \nrevenues come in, we can help reduce the deficit, help encourage \ndrilling where people will accept it. Maybe they won't accept it \neverywhere. We have made a lot of mistakes in Louisiana, we admit it. \nWe have learned from our mistakes. We have perfected the technology, \nand we believe we can minimize the environmental footprint and maximize \nthe benefit to the Federal Treasury. There are many benefits.\n  I yield the time to those scheduled to speak as well. I have some \ntime reserved later in the day. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first let me acknowledge my colleague from \nthe State of Louisiana. No person has worked harder than Senator Mary \nLandrieu for a State devastated by Hurricane Katrina and the city of \nNew Orleans, which is still in recovery. My colleague, Senator Obama, \nvisited there 2 weeks ago and came back and told me personally of \ntraveling for long periods of time within the city of New Orleans and \nseeing very few homes that have not been devastated by Hurricane \nKatrina and were still barely inhabitable, some virtually \nuninhabitable. It is hard to imagine in the United States of America, \nalmost a year after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, that great \ncity is still reeling from all the damage done.\n  I know Senator Landrieu feels as strongly as anyone--maybe more\n\n[[Page S8425]]\n\nstrongly because of her personal experience--that the State of \nLouisiana needs a helping hand. I want to do my best to try to be on \nher side as she continues this battle. I thank her for her leadership \non this issue.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Durbin pertaining to the introduction of S. 3765 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, when the matter of the pending Gulf of \nMexico Energy Bill was first brought to my attention, and every day \nthereafter, I repeatedly spoke to the distinguished managers of this \nlegislation about the need for States other than those specifically \ncared for in this legislation--namely, the Gulf States--the other \ncoastal States to be permitted to amend this bill such that coastal \nStates could begin the long process of asserting our rights as coastal \nStates to those energy resources that, in all probability, are on the \nOuter Continental Shelf. Therefore, I readied an amendment that I send \nto the desk, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the \nRecord following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bond). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. My amendment represents a unique opportunity for this \nSenate, and indeed the entire Nation as a whole, to seek to determine \nif we cannot, as several coastal States, help our Nation in this dire \nneed for additional sources of natural gas, and possibly, in some \ninstances, States might elect to include oil, to meet the ever-looming \nresource crisis.\n  I remember when the Energy bill which is now law was passed by the \nSenate. I stood at this very desk and I had an amendment very similar \nto the one which I am speaking about today. When that amendment was \npushed to one side, I said I would stand here again, and here I am \nagain today. But I understand--this is the 28th year I have been in the \nSenate--there are parliamentary means under the rules of the Senate to \npreclude Senators from offering amendments, and as such, I am being \ndenied that opportunity.\n  The bill before us today represents a step in the right direction--\nand I commend those who have worked on it--to open access to more \nnatural gas and oil in the Gulf of Mexico. However, I, like many others \nin this body, believe that more must be done because there is such a \ntime lag between the potential passage of my amendment and the actual \nrecovery of gas and oil from any of these moratorium states. We have to \nbegin, and I had hoped on this bill I could mark that beginning.\n  I worked with many of my colleagues on a proposal to address this \nsupply issue by giving opportunities to the individual States to open \nup areas in the Outer Continental Shelf waters for the future potential \nexploration of gas and oil; thus, the coastal States. The amendment I \ncrafted would address the current moratorium on energy and exploration \nin most of America's Outer Continental Shelf and is the evolution of \nvarious amendments and bills I have offered since the debate on last \nyear's Energy Policy Act. It would give States the authority to extend \nthe current moratorium prohibiting oil and gas development in most of \nthe Nation's offshore waters or petition for waivers on their own terms \nto contribute to the Nation's energy supply. The facts, as I understand \nthem, are as follows:\n  U.S. demand for natural gas will grow by 40 percent in this country \nin the next decade to decade and a half. The demand for oil in the \nUnited States will grow by 31 percent over the same period of time. At \ncurrent rates, domestic production will only meet one-third--I repeat--\none-third of our demand growth, leaving us increasingly dependent on \npolitically unstable regions. I shall not recount all of them because \nthey are growing by day. Regrettably, it looks as if Venezuela, from \nwhich we receive a good deal of our energy supplies, could be placed in \nthe column of ``politically unstable.'' Indeed, many parts of Africa \nhave become unstable, and we all know at this very moment the tragic \nsituation that is unfolding in the Middle East.\n  We must also be aware of the virtually exponential growth and demand \nin the developing nations, all competing in the world market for this \nfungible good named ``energy.'' China's energy consumption has grown by \nover 100 percent in the past 20 years. It is expected to double again \nin the next 20 years. Mexico's natural gas demand is expected to double \nby 2025. Energy consumption in India is expected to more than double in \nthe next 20 years.\n  We are too dependent indeed on overseas supplies, so we turn to our \ncontinental limits. Indeed, the question at hand is about the Gulf of \nMexico. The bill authored by Chairman Domenici does increase our \nsupplies, and I am very hopeful the Senate will act in passing this \nimportant piece of legislation. I propose to support it.\n  I want to make clear that more must be done outside the Gulf of \nMexico. With 20 percent to 25 percent of our domestic oil and gas \nproduction located in the Gulf of Mexico, we simply have to diversify \nour geographic supply.\n  The Gulf of Mexico is subject to natural disasters. It is a tragic \nsituation, but history records it. As a result of last year's \nhurricanes alone, we will lose 30 percent of our oil and 21 percent of \nour projected annual natural gas from in the Gulf of Mexico. This is \nall because of the extended closure of a significant number of \nplatforms. In fact, a report issued last month by the Department of \nInterior states that 12 percent of U.S. oil production in the Gulf of \nMexico remains shut in almost a year after last summer's events. \nHopefully, that production will eventually return to normal levels, but \nit shows a certain degree of fragility in that area of the United \nStates upon which we rely for such a high percentage of our energy \nrequirements.\n  The bill Chairman Domenici has brought to the floor will open up more \nthan 8 million acres of oil and gas production. The amendment I propose \nwould not directly open any areas or mandate any production. However, \ndepending on the will of the individual States--and that is a \ncombination of, depending on the State, the Governor, the legislature, \nand indeed the people themselves--my proposal would provide the \nopportunity for up to 350 million acres--mind you, 8 million acres \nunder this bill pending--350 million acres to be considered for \ndevelopment. That is the coastal area around the United States.\n\n  Now, I fully recognize the concerns of the environmentalists, and \nmany times I have tried to work on this, but we have to strike a \nbalance. We must do that. We have an obligation to our citizens. Modern \ntechnology has enabled the drillers to put down pipes and other devices \nto extract the oil and gas which, if subjected to a natural disaster or \nother problem, seal up quickly and do not spew forth into the pristine \nocean and on to the shores the pollution we have witnessed in other \ncatastrophic situations usually involving the transportation of oil \nfrom overseas. The Minerals Management Service reports that since 1980, \n4.7 billion barrels of oil have been produced offshore with a spill \nrate of less than one-thousandth of one percent. Technology has \nprogressed and it must be accepted that production of and protection of \nour natural resources are not mutually exclusive opportunities.\n  Based upon preliminary resource estimates, my amendment could provide \nmore than $2 billion in new Federal revenues and over $1 billion to \nStates and their citizens that are willing to accept whatever risks \nstill remain, who authorize production in Federal waters off their \nshores over the next 10 years.\n  Many of my colleagues have expressed concerns about the Gulf of \nMexico bill, and they stem from what is in the House bill. They said \nthey do not want to lift the moratorium as the House bill would do. \nWell, I am not going to inject myself into the conference. I will leave \nthat to the able leadership of others. However, I will say that my \namendment would not lift one square inch of the current Federal \nmoratorium. Instead, it would establish a process by which the States \ncan petition the Secretary of Interior, subject to their own \nspecifications, for a waiver from the moratorium on natural gas or oil \nproduction in most of the Outer Continental Shelf. If a State would \nrather continue the moratorium beyond 2012, the amendment establishes a \nprocess that would authorize the extension of that moratorium for up to \n10 additional years. The principle of my amendment is simply to enable\n\n[[Page S8426]]\n\nthe individual States to have more control over the waters off their \ncoasts than they do today and more control than they would under the \nrecently passed House bill.\n  I support the effort to open up areas of the Gulf of Mexico to \nenhanced energy production. However, it is my sincere hope that the \nMembers of this body do not believe that this alone will solve our oil \nand gas supply problem. More must be done in conservation and more must \nbe done in the area of American production.\n  The time has come for the Senate to act on the issue of American \nproduction of natural gas and oil. Energy Security is National Security \nand for the people of America to be dependent upon foreign sources of \nenergy is dangerous to our economy and our way of life.\n  I have offered a balanced approach to address supply needs and \nenvironmental concerns. This is the way for all States to have a say in \nthe policy. The current moratorium expires in 2012 and without \nlegislation like that which I propose, these States would have no \nguarantee of protection.\n  Mr. President, I see a number of our colleagues waiting here. But I \nwill return to this floor time and time again, as long as I can draw \nbreath, to fight for the rights of the individual coastal States to \ndecide for themselves--not to be mandated by the Federal Government but \nto decide for themselves whether they want to step up and help America \nreach its energy needs.\n  Now, I have talked to the managers of this bill--and at some point, \nmaybe I can have a colloquy put into the Record today--but some \nassurances are being given to Senators who, like myself, represent the \ncoastal States to see whether the legislation along the lines of the \nbill I have introduced today, a copy of which is appended to this \nstatement, can, once again, be brought before this Chamber.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       Beginning on page 17, strike line 19 and all that follows \n     through page 18, line 17 and insert the following:\n       (f) Limitations on Amount of Distributed Qualified Outer \n     Continental Shelf Revenues and Covered Revenues.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), the total amount \n     of qualified outer Continental Shelf revenues and covered \n     revenues made available under subsection (a)(2) and section \n     6(j)(1)(B) shall not exceed $500,000,000 for each of fiscal \n     years 2016 through 2055.\n       (2) Expenditures.--For the purpose of paragraph (1), for \n     each of fiscal years 2016 through 2055, expenditures under \n     subsection (a)(2) and section 6(j)(1)(B) shall be net of \n     receipts from that fiscal year from any area in the 181 Area \n     in the Eastern Planning Area, the 181 South Area, or any area \n     off the coastline of a covered State.\n       (3) Pro rata reductions.--If paragraph (1) limits the \n     amount of qualified outer Continental Shelf revenue or \n     covered revenues that would be paid under subparagraphs (A) \n     and (B) of subsection (a)(2) or clauses (i) and (ii) of \n     section 6(j)(1)(B)--\n       (A) the Secretary shall reduce the amount of qualified \n     outer Continental Shelf revenue and covered revenue provided \n     to each recipient on a pro rata basis; and\n       (B) any remainder of the qualified outer Continental Shelf \n     revenues and covered revenues shall revert to the general \n     fund of the Treasury.\n\n     SEC. 6.

and\n       (E) provide that, at the request and with the consent of \n     the Governor of the State adjacent to the lease area, and \n     with the consent of the lessee, an existing natural gas lease \n     may be converted, without an increase in the rental royalty \n     rate and without further payment in the nature of a lease \n     bonus, to a lease under section 8(b) of the Outer Continental \n     Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1337(b)), in accordance with a \n     process, to be established by the Secretary, that requires--\n       (i) consultation by the Secretary with the Governor of the \n     State and the lessee with respect to the operating conditions \n     of the lease, taking into consideration environmental \n     resource conservation and recovery, economic factors, and \n     other factors, as the Secretary determines to be relevant; \n     and\n       (ii) compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act \n     of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.).\n       (3) Effect of other laws.--Any Federal law (including \n     regulations) that applies to an oil and gas lease on the \n     outer Continental Shelf shall apply to a natural gas lease \n     issued under this subsection.\n       (h) Exchange of Leases for Areas Located Within 100 Miles \n     Off States Imposing a Moratorium.--\n       (1) In general.--Effective beginning on the date that is \n     180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the lessee \n     of an oil and gas lease in existence on the date of enactment \n     of this Act for an area located completely within 100 miles \n     of the coastline and within the Adjacent Zones of States that \n     have extended a moratorium under subsection (c) shall have \n     the option, without compensation, of exchanging the lease for \n     a new oil and gas lease having a primary term of 5 years.\n       (2) Tracts.--For the area subject to the new lease, the \n     lessee may select any unleased tract--\n       (A) at least part of which is located within the area \n     between 100 and 125 miles from the coastline; and\n       (B) that is located--\n       (i) completely beyond 125 miles from the coastline; and\n       (ii) within the same Adjacent Zone of the adjacent State as \n     the lease being exchanged.\n       (3) Administrative process.--\n       (A) In general.--The Secretary shall establish a reasonable \n     administrative process through which a lessee may exercise \n     the option of the lessee to exchange an oil and gas lease for \n     a new oil and gas lease in accordance with this subsection.\n       (B) Relationship to other laws.--An exchange of leases \n     conducted in accordance with this subsection (including the \n     issuance of a new lease)--\n       (i) shall not be considered to be a major Federal action \n     for purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \n     (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.); and\n       (ii) shall be considered in compliance with the Outer \n     Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.).\n       (C) Withdrawal.--The Secretary shall issue a new lease in \n     exchange for the lease being exchanged notwithstanding that \n     the area that will be subject to the lease may be withdrawn \n     from leasing under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 \n     U.S.C. 1331 et seq.) or otherwise unavailable for leasing \n     under any other law.\n       (4) Priority.--\n       (A) Bonus bid.--The Secretary shall give priority in the \n     lease exchange process under this subsection based on the \n     amount of the original bonus bid paid for the issuance of \n     each lease to be exchanged.\n       (B) Exchange of partial tracts for full tracts.--The \n     Secretary shall allow leases covering partial tracts to be \n     exchanged for leases covering full tracts under this \n     subsection conditioned on payment of additional bonus bids on \n     a per-acre basis, as determined based on the average per acre \n     of the original bonus bid per acre for the partial tract \n     being exchanged.\n       (5) Cancellation of lease.--As part of the lease exchange \n     process under this subsection, the Secretary shall cancel a \n     lease that is exchanged under this subsection.\n       (6) Conditions for lease exchange.--For a lease to be \n     cancelled and exchanged under this subsection--\n       (A) each lessee holding an interest in the lease must \n     consent to cancellation of the leasehold interest of the \n     lessee;\n       (B) each lessee must waive any rights to bring any \n     litigation against the United States related to the \n     transaction;

and\n\n[[Page S8428]]\n\n       (B) 50 percent of covered revenues in a special account in \n     the Treasury from which the Secretary shall disburse--\n       (i) 75 percent to covered States in accordance with \n     paragraph (2); and\n       (ii) 25 percent to provide financial assistance to States \n     in accordance with section 6 of the Land and Water \n     Conservation Fund Act of 1965 (16 U.S.C. 460l-8), which shall \n     be considered income to the Land and Water Conservation Fund \n     for purposes of section 2 of that Act (16 U.S.C. 460l-5).\n       (2) Allocation among covered states and coastal political \n     subdivisions.--\n       (A) Allocation among covered states for fiscal year 2007 \n     and thereafter.--\n       (i) In general.--Subject to clause (ii), effective for \n     fiscal year 2007 and each fiscal year thereafter, the amount \n     made available under paragraph (1)(B)(i) shall be allocated \n     to each covered State in amounts (based on a formula \n     established by the Secretary by regulation) that are \n     inversely proportional to the respective distances between \n     the point on the coastline of each covered State that is \n     closest to the geographic center of the applicable leased \n     tract and the geographic center of the leased tract.\n       (ii) Minimum allocation.--The amount allocated to a covered \n     State each fiscal year under clause (i) shall be at least 10 \n     percent of the amounts available under paragraph (1)(B)(i).\n       (B) Payments to coastal political subdivisions.--\n       (i) In general.--The Secretary shall pay 20 percent of the \n     allocable share of each covered State, as determined under \n     subparagraph (A), to the coastal political subdivisions of \n     the covered State.\n       (ii) Allocation.--The amount paid by the Secretary to \n     coastal political subdivisions shall be allocated to each \n     coastal political subdivision in accordance with \n     subparagraphs (B), (C), (D), and (E) of section 31(b)(4) of \n     the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. \n     1356a(b)(4)).\n       (3) Timing.--The amounts required to be deposited under \n     paragraph (1)(B) for the applicable fiscal year shall be made \n     available in accordance with that paragraph during the fiscal \n     year immediately following the applicable fiscal year.\n       (4) Authorized uses.--\n       (A) In general.--Subject to subparagraph (B), each covered \n     State and coastal political subdivision shall use all amounts \n     received under paragraph (2) in accordance with all \n     applicable Federal and State laws, only for 1 or more of the \n     following purposes:\n       (i) Projects and activities for the purposes of coastal \n     protection, including conservation, coastal restoration, \n     hurricane protection, and infrastructure directly affected by \n     coastal wetland losses.\n       (ii) Mitigation of damage to fish, wildlife, or natural \n     resources.\n       (iii) Implementation of a federally-approved marine, \n     coastal, or comprehensive conservation management plan.\n       (iv) Mitigation of the impact of outer Continental Shelf \n     activities through the funding of onshore infrastructure \n     projects.\n       (v) Planning assistance and the administrative costs of \n     complying with this section.\n       (B) Limitation.--Not more than 3 percent of amounts \n     received by a covered State or coastal political subdivision \n     under paragraph (1)(B) may be used for the purposes described \n     in subparagraph (A)(v).\n       (5) Administration.--Amounts made available under paragraph \n     (1)(B) shall--\n       (A) be made available, without further appropriation, in \n     accordance with this subsection;\n       (B) remain available until expended;

Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WARNER. I am happy to do so.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator. I know our colleague from \nMassachusetts is here to speak on another subject, but I would just ask \na question of the distinguished Senator from Virginia.\n  First of all, I would like to thank him for the bill he has \nintroduced. I know in the form of an amendment it won't be appropriate \nin this debate, but I thank him for that.\n  Would the Senator just explain briefly for maybe a minute or so the \nfeelings of people in Virginia--your legislature has done a lot of good \nwork--about the possibilities of opening additional drilling, perhaps \nat a later date, and how that might affect the neighbors of Maryland, \nDelaware even, and perhaps even the Carolinas? Could the Senator just \ncomment for a minute about how those negotiations are potentially \nmoving forward, if not for this bill, then maybe at a later time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nLouisiana. Indeed, in two consecutive sessions of the General Assembly \nof Virginia, this subject has been on the agenda and bills have been \npassed by the House of Delegates and State Senate to send bills to the \nGovernor. For whatever reason, Governor Warner--I am not here to \ncriticize, but he saw fit not to let the bill become legislation, and \nGovernor Kaine likewise disapproved of the language this past \nlegislative session encouraging offshore development. I think progress \nhas been made in our legislature as evidenced by the overwhelming votes \nof more than 75 percent of the State Senate and House of Delegates on \nthis year's bill, and clearly the legislature is speaking for the \npeople of Virginia, and they are ready to take on this challenge and to \naccept the consequences, whatever they may be. But I repeat: I think \ntechnology has gotten to the point where that risk is minimal, in my \njudgment. How it would affect adjoining States, that is subject to \ndebate. If there were a mishap off the shore of Virginia and depending \non the winds, the drift, the seas, and other things, if there were an \naccident which did emit some pollution, I am not sure anyone could \nwrite that into law as to what happens. It is important to note that my \namendment includes provisions requiring the concurrence of neighboring \nstates that would be within twenty miles of any production and, as I \nhave said before, modern technology has made these risks very minimal.\n  But it is an important aspect worth consideration--any legislation of \nthe type I have offered. But it would seem to me collectively the \ncoastal States should look to this as a possible increase in their \nenergy and financial resources. As a matter of fact, my bill allows the \ncitizens of any coastal State authorizing such production to retain a \nsignificant part of the proceeds from such drilling. I thank you for \nasking the question.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator for his comments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask the Chair, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 51 minutes remaining on the minority \nside.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would like to yield myself 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kennedy are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes under the \nprevious time agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if my colleague will yield for a unanimous \nconsent request, my colleague from Maine and I wish to speak in 15-\nminute increments, taking the time from each side in the debate. I ask \nunanimous consent to follow my colleague from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleague, Senator \nDorgan.\n  I rise today, along with my colleague, Senator Dorgan, to address the \namendment before the Senate based on legislation that Senator Dorgan \nand I introduced regarding drug importation.\n  First and foremost, I thank my colleague, Senator Dorgan, for his \nrelentless and dedicated leadership on this very important question \nwhich we hopefully can address once and for all here in the Senate and \nin the overall Congress because it certainly is an issue that deserves \nconsideration. But more importantly, it deserves to become law because \nit is so important to the interests of the American people.\n\n[[Page S8429]]\n\n  We have been joined on this legislation by a broad coalition of 30 of \nour colleagues and many of the leaders of the importation effort, along \nwith Senators Grassley, Kennedy, McCain, and Stabenow unified with us \nin advancing this bipartisan legislation. Our voice has echoed those 7 \nout of 10 Americans who have called for the lifting of the ban on \nprescription drug importation. We have worked together to see that this \nlegislation is considered in the Senate, and we have had 10 related \nhearings on this very matter in the Senate since 2004.\n  When we recently considered the Homeland Security appropriations \nbill, over two-thirds of the Senate responded to the increase in \nseizures of medications from Canadian pharmacies earlier this year by \nvoting to stop impeding safe access to affordable medications.\n  Today, we must do more to respond to this issue. We must pass the \nlegislation we have introduced which will ensure Americans have a safe \nand effective system to provide access to affordable medications. Our \nconstituents are suffering as the cost of health care is rising rapidly \nin America, and prescription drug costs have led to that increase.\n  In response to a request of Senator Wyden and myself to track the \nprice of medications most used by seniors, the GAO has repeatedly \nreported that the cost of these medications has increased at two to \nthree times the rate of inflation as indicated by this chart. In fact, \nAARP reported recently that the fact is this the highest third-quarter \nincrease in the cost of brand drugs since they began these studies. We \ncan see here two to three times the rate of inflation in the cost of \nmedications.\n  As a nation, we are growing older, and as we do we use more \nprescription drugs. At the same time, relentless price increases have \nmade access to lifesaving drugs more and more unaffordable for \nAmericans. The problem of affordability is shared by everyone. If you \nhave prescription drug coverage, rapid price increases drive up your \npremiums. If you are one of the millions without drug coverage, the \nsituation is far worse. You bear the full cost of the world's highest \nprices for medications.\n  Today, even with the new Medicare prescription drug benefit in place, \nover 46 million Americans are saddled with the burden of exorbitantly \npriced medications. A drug can be safe and effective, but what good is \nit if you can't afford to take it? That is why we simply cannot afford \nto postpone action any longer on this legislation. We have acted before \nrepeatedly in the Senate and in the overall Congress. It has been law \nsince 2000, when Congress last acted to allow importation.\n  We have also required certification by the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, that the HHS Secretary must certify the safety of \nimportation. Unfortunately, that has been the caveat and a disguise for \nblocking the importation measure. It has denied access to importation. \nThe Department of Health and Human Services has not taken steps to \nensure that we can allow Americans to import drugs safely from other \ncountries--and in particular Canada. While the FDA was unable to point \nto any single individual harmed by Canadian drugs, they have actually \ndenied importation from Canada. In Europe, in over 30 years of parallel \ntrading of pharmaceuticals, no death or injury has ever been documented \nbecause they know it is safe.\n  While our constituents have found importation offers them access to \nlifesaving drugs, we have repeatedly heard from FDA how the practice \nthreatens health. Opponents claim importation will cause harm, but they \nfail to note that the greatest prescription drug threat to the safety \nof Americans--that is, the inability to take drugs that are \nprescribed--exacts a toll of thousands of American lives every year. As \nDr. Peter Rost--a former Pfizer executive up until a few months ago--\nwho joined Senator Dorgan and I and others in a press conference, \nobserved, ``Holding up a vote on reimportation, stopping good \nreimportation bills has a high cost, not just in money but in American \nlives.'' He is a former executive of Pfizer who actually had the \ncourage to make that statement.\n  Today, thanks to the intensive reporting of health professionals, we \nare seeing more evidence of the cost of unaffordable medications. In my \nown State of Maine, one of our physicians reported hospitalizing two \npatients in a single month--one of them in the intensive care unit with \na dangerous heart arrhythmia simply because they could not afford to \nrefill a prescription.\n  But Americans recognize the value of prescription drugs, and they \nhave turned to affordable sources of these medications so they can \npreserve and protect their health. Many of my Maine constituents have \nused Canadian pharmacies and found both savings and safety. But dangers \ndo exist. There are certainly those who would exploit consumers with \ndangerous or counterfeit medications. It is imperative that we work \nproactively to ensure that the importation of prescription drugs is \nsafe.\n  That is why Senator Dorgan and I, along with our colleagues, have \ncomprehensively addressed the various concerns that have been raised \nover the months and years about drug importation--so that we can get \nsomething done. But certifying safety isn't the answer; any measure \nshould actually make it safe. And there are two key issues we must \naddress as we consider importation legislation. First and foremost, is \nit safe? Second, will the legislation be effective in delivering real \nsavings for consumers? Our legislation which is incorporated in the \namendment before us today does both.\n\n  Our constituents have taken action to purchase the drugs they could \nafford--mostly in Canada--and have demonstrated that importation can be \nsafe. In Europe, with over 30 years of parallel trading of \npharmaceuticals, no death or injury has ever been documented. They know \nit is safe.\n  Dr. Rost, as I said, who was a Pfizer executive up until several \nmonths ago, stated from his own firsthand experience in Europe--and I \nquote:\n\n       I think it is outright derogatory to claim that Americans \n     would not be able to handle reimportation of drugs when the \n     rest of the educated world can do this.\n\n  And I agree. Under our legislation, Americans will receive imported \ndrugs from 30 countries. In most cases, Americans will purchase \nimported prescription drugs from their local pharmacy. The pharmacist \nwill receive those drugs from a U.S. wholesaler which imports them. \nThese wholesalers will be registered, inspected, and monitored by the \nFDA. This higher level of safety is also a first step in establishing a \nhigher standard for the handling of all medications in the United \nStates.\n  Our legislation also allows individuals to directly order medications \nfrom outside the United States when using an FDA registered and \napproved Canadian pharmacy. Again, just as with wholesalers handling \nprescription drugs, the FDA will examine, register, and inspect these \nfacilities on a frequent basis. The FDA will assure the highest \nstandards for such essential functions as recording medical history, \nverifying prescriptions, and tracking shipments. But regardless of \nwhether one purchases imported drugs from the local pharmacist or uses \na Canadian pharmacy, we assure that a legitimate prescription and a \nqualified pharmacist will be vital ingredients in ensuring safety.\n  Toward that end, we have also worked with Senator Feinstein to \nincorporate provisions of the Ryan Haight Act to assure that as we \nprovide safety in an importation system we do not ignore the need to \nassure safety and integrity in domestic internet pharmacies. These \nprovisions will assure that properly licensed pharmacies and \npharmacists are behind Web sites offering prescription drugs and that \nwe no longer see prescriptions issued based on a submitted form or a \ntelephone conversation. There must be integrity and a proper \nprofessional relationship between medical professionals and patients.\n  For those who say the consumers could unwittingly purchase an \nunapproved or suspect drug, our legislation assures that the drug \nreceived will always be FDA approved. If any difference exists in a \nforeign drug, even the most minute, our legislation assures FDA will \nevaluate the product and determine its acceptability.\n  We provide a process to assure imported drugs are the same FDA-\napproved product, and if a minor difference exists, such as a coloring \nor inactive ingredient is different, and has no effect on the efficacy \nof the drug,\n\n[[Page S8430]]\n\nour legislation assures that it will be tested and labeled so that \ndifferences are known. So there will not be motivation for a \nmanufacturer to game the system by making a minor change in order to \nmake a product unapproved and thus unimportable.\n  For those who say that counterfeiting is a threat, our legislation \nrequires the use of anticounterfeiting technologies to protect drugs. \nThe fact is, we can employ technologies like the one now used on the \nnew $20 bill. We can do the same with prescription drugs. Moreover, \nthis bill supports the development of future anticounterfeiting and \ntrack-and-trace technologies which we hope will be used to protect all \nprescription drugs.\n  For those who say consumers won't know who has handled an imported \nprescription drug, our bill requires that a chain of custody--a \n``pedigree''--be maintained and inspected to help ensure the integrity \nof the imported prescription drugs. A pedigree for medications was \nmandated by law, believe it or not, back in 1988--that is correct, in \n1988--and we still await its implementation by the FDA. Almost 20 years \nlater, the FDA has yet to implement that requirement to establish a \npedigree for medications to ensure that we have a chain of custody so \nwe understand how they have been handled from the initial process of \nmanufacturing.\n  Some even attempt to alarm Americans about the countries from which \nwe import drugs, citing Latvia, Estonia, and Slovakia, members of the \nEuropean Union. Another member is Ireland, where Lipitor is made.\n  I call your attention to this chart on which the European Union and \nother countries from which we would import is in blue. These countries \nmeet or exceed our standards. In contrast, we have in red many \nadditional countries in which the FDA inspects pharmaceutical \nmanufacturing plants. These include China, India, Bulgaria, Jordan, and \nothers with lower standards.\n  For those who say importation isn't safe, we show that it will be, \nand this legislation sets a model of improving safety in the handling \nof all prescription drugs. The safety has been attested to by none \nother than the former FDA Commissioner, Dr. David Kessler. He said our \nlegislation `` . . . provides a sound framework for assuring that \nimported drugs are safe and effective. Most notably, it provides \nadditional resources to the agency to run such a program, oversight by \nFDA of the chain of custody of imported drugs back to FDA-inspected \nplants, a mechanism to review imported drugs to ensure that they met \nFDA's approval standards, and the registration and oversight of \nimporters and exporters to assure that imported drugs meet those \nstandards and are not counterfeit. Some say the consumers will not see \nsignificant savings, but drugs imported under this program will be \nlabeled as imports, and consumers will be able to compare the side-by-\nside savings. With increasing consumer awareness of foreign prices and \ncompetition between importing wholesalers, we are confident of consumer \nsavings.\n\n  Let me say in conclusion, I hope the Senate will give due \nconsideration to this legislation. In the final analysis, it \nincorporates every issue regarding safety concerns, every measure, \nevery standard that could be put in place to ensure we can have safe \ndrug importation and accomplish the ultimate goal, ensuring affordable \nmedications to the American people. They deserve it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield myself 15 minutes from the time on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank my colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, who has \nspoken at some length about the piece of legislation we have offered \ndealing with prescription drugs and the price of prescription drugs in \nthis country.\n  Thirty-two Senators have cosponsored a piece of legislation. It is a \nbipartisan group, including Senator Snowe, myself, Senator Kennedy, \nSenator McCain, Senator Grassley and Senator Stabenow. A wide range of \nSenators have cosponsored a piece of carefully crafted legislation that \nallows the American people to import FDA-approved prescription drugs \nthat are, in almost all cases, sold for a much lower price in other \ncountries.\n  I will not go over all of the issues that have been raised by my \ncolleague, Senator Snowe, because she has done an excellent job of \nlaying out the issue. The issue, very simply, is this: The \npharmaceutical industry prices FDA-approved prescription drugs in this \ncountry with the highest prices in the world. The American consumer is \nrequired to pay the highest prices for prescription drugs in the world. \nThat is unfair.\n  This chart shows United States versus Canada. But the chart could \nshow the United States versus Italy, the United States versus Germany, \nthe United States versus Spain, and it would show the same result.\n  I ask unanimous consent to show in the Senate two bottles of Lipitor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The two bottles of Lipitor are identical bottles: same \ncompany, same pill, made in the same manufacturing plant, sent to \ndifferent places. One is sent to the United States to be purchased by a \nUnited States consumer, and the other is sent to Canada to be purchased \nby a Canadian consumer. What is the difference? This is 40 percent less \nexpensive than this one. The American consumer is charged more than the \nCanadian consumer.\n  Why is the American consumer not able to get that 40 percent discount \nor pay a price that is 40 percent less? The answer is, the \npharmaceutical industry stops the reimportation of prescription drugs \nexcept for the small use by those who can go back and forth physically \nacross the border. They do that because that enforces their pricing \nmechanism which requires the highest prices be paid by the American \nconsumer.\n  Prevacid, 50 percent savings in Canada versus the United States--same \npill, same bottle, made by the same company, shipped to two different \nplaces, and one is a dramatically lower price. Zocor, 46 percent \ndifference; Celebrex, a 55-percent difference--and the list goes on. \nThe American consumer is charged the highest prices in the world for \nthese prescription drugs.\n  I, personally, think it is unfair. The way to deal with that is to \nallow the American consumer access, as others have access, to an \ninternational trading system; to say if you can purchase an FDA-\napproved drug from Canada, you are welcome to import it into this \ncountry. The pharmaceutical industry says there are safety issues with \nthat. There are no safety issues with that, not if it is an FDA-\napproved drug produced in FDA-approved plants.\n  The Europeans have been doing something called parallel trading for a \ncouple of decades. If you are in Germany and want to buy a prescription \ndrug from Spain, no problem. You can do that. If you are in Italy and \nwant to buy a prescription drug from France, no problem. Under a system \ncalled parallel trading, they are able to import and reimport \nprescription drugs to find the best price. Only in the United States \nare we prevented from doing that.\n  We put together a piece of legislation. We worked very hard on the \nlegislation. Thirty-two Senators, Republicans and Democrats, have \nworked to accomplish this legislation.\n  On March 11, 2004, over 2 years ago now, at midnight in the Senate, I \nlifted a hold I had on a nominee in exchange for what I thought was a \ncommitment by the majority leader to bring drug importation legislation \nto the Senate. I thought it was a commitment. He says he didn't think \nit was a commitment. I am not going to try to question his integrity \nbut, nonetheless, we still wait 2 years later and are not able to have \na vote on this legislation.\n  In July of 2005, my colleague, Senator Vitter from Louisiana, said he \nreceived a commitment from the majority leader to bring this very issue \nto the Senate if the Senate achieved a 60-vote demonstration of support \nfor reimportation. The Senate met that hurdle when it adopted the \nVitter-Nelson amendment on a 68-to-32 vote. On July 14, I and my \ncolleagues--three Democrats and three Republicans--wrote to the \nmajority leader saying: We have now waited for a long while, and we \nhope that you will decide to do what you had assured us you would do; \nthat is, give us an opportunity in the Senate to pass this legislation.\n\n  The U.S. House has already passed legislation on this. The Senate \nclearly has the votes to pass it if the attempts to block it are ceased \nand we would be\n\n[[Page S8431]]\n\nable to pass legislation that, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, will save consumers $50 billion over 10 years, $5 billion a \nyear. That is not an insignificant savings.\n  It seems to me this is an issue that ought not be very controversial \nexcept, as I understand, to the prescription drug industry. Let me \nhasten to say there are some good people working in that industry. \nThose companies produce some miracle lifesaving drugs. But there are no \nmiracles from miracle drugs if you cannot afford to take them. That is \nwhy I believe the pricing of those prescription drugs to the U.S. \nconsumer, charging the highest prices in the world, is fundamentally \nunfair. It is why I and many others are attempting to remove a \nrestriction in law that prohibits the reimportation of FDA-approved \nprescription drugs. In many cases, these drugs are actually made in the \nUnited States and then exported to be sold for a much lower price in \nother countries. Then the U.S. consumer is prevented from accessing \nthose same lower priced drugs despite the fact they were made in this \ncountry.\n  We passed a prescription drug benefit in Medicare recently, and it \nhas now been implemented. That had a provision in it that prevents the \nnegotiation for lower prices--just as the VA and others have done. This \nactually prevents Medicare from negotiating lower prices. I cannot \nthink of anything that makes less sense than a prohibition of the \nFederal Government from negotiating lower prices. But that is what has \nhappened.\n  Since the prescription drug benefit in Medicare has taken effect, in \nthe first quarter of 2006, we see while the inflation increased at 1.1 \npercent, we can see the increase in the price of prescription drugs on \nthis chart. I have developed several of them--Ambien, Proscar, Atrovent \ninhaler, Lexapro--and the price on average has run triple the rate of \ninflation in the first quarter. This is like hooking a hose to the tank \nand sucking it dry.\n  It will break the bank from two standpoints: One, the cost of this \nprogram to the Federal Government; and No. 2, the ability of consumers \nto be able to access the same FDA-approved drug for lower prices from \nCanada and other countries just makes great sense. It is why 32 Members \nof the Senate have cosponsored the legislation before the Senate.\n  As I said when I started, the majority leader has indicated he fully \nexpected legislation such as this to be in the Senate and to be \nconsidered. He said: But we will take it up in the committee of \njurisdiction first. That happened last year, in April of last year. \nThey had a hearing. We expected then, and they all said then: We will \nreport legislation out and have time in the Senate to deal with it. But \nthe fact is, it has not happened.\n  On behalf of the American people, who deserve to have the opportunity \nto have fair prices on their prescription drugs, this Congress, this \nSenate, ought to take up this legislation and pass it.\n  The legislation that is before the Senate is an authorization bill. \nWe are now on the legislation. It is open for amendment. The amendment \nthat I will ask to be considered is not an amendment that falls by the \nrules. It is an amendment that is perfectly appropriate under the \nrules. My understanding is that the bill on the floor of the Senate has \nbeen amended. I think we have a first-degree amendment and a second-\ndegree amendment. What has been done, as they say in legislative terms, \nthe tree has been filled so that no other amendments are in order.\n  So in order to offer an amendment, which is proper, you have to ask \nthat the current amendment be set aside, which is the last second-\ndegree amendment that was offered.\n  My expectation is, and I am told this request will be objected to, \nbut let me say, even if it is objected to, I hope the majority leader \nwill work with us. We have limited time. Representations have been made \nto a number of Members, including Senator Vitter, myself, and others, \nthat we would have an opportunity in this Congress to deal with this \nissue.\n  The U.S. House of Representatives has done so; the Senate has not. My \nhope is the Senate would allow consideration of a very carefully \ndeveloped bipartisan piece of legislation that nearly one-third of the \nSenate has embraced as cosponsors.\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent the pending amendment be set \naside, that the Senate immediately consider the Dorgan-Snowe amendment \nnumber 4742 to make drug importation legal and safe.\n  Mr. ALLEN. On behalf of the leader, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I appreciate all of the Senator's \nleadership on this issue, but would the Senator agree it is so \nimportant for our colleagues to recognize the savings that would be \nrealized for our American consumers? Their counterparts in other \ncountries pay 35 to 55 percent less, so this is an enormous savings \nboth in terms of the U.S. Government and the $50 billion the Senator \nhas mentioned, but also more than $6 billion in direct savings to the \nFederal Government and to the U.S. budget. Not only do we save $50 \nbillion, with $6.1 billion of that in savings to the U.S. budget \naccording to the CBO, but we begin to address the fact that the \nAmerican consumers are paying $87 billion more than counterparts in \nother countries.\n  This is an enormous savings in all respects. Would the Senator not \nagree this also would advance those savings to American consumers but, \nas well, to our Government?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the large bipartisan group of Senators \nthat has worked to put this bill together and endorsed the bill through \ncosponsorship has done so believing, first of all, that there is no \nsafety issue. These are FDA-approved drugs that would be allowed to be \nimported, No. 1. And, No. 2, very substantial savings would exist. The \nCongressional Budget Office has said that it would be $50 billion over \n10 years, $5 billion a year. There would be additional savings to the \nFederal Government itself.\n  At a time when we are up to our necks in debt, it is very important \nto do the right thing not only on behalf of the American consumers but \nalso on behalf of our Government's fiscal policy. The right thing is \nallowing this to be an opportunity to access the identical FDA-approved \ndrugs at the much lower price that they are being sold in virtually \nevery other country of the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon in strong support of \nthe Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act. This is commonsense \nlegislation. It will have a powerful and positive impact on one of the \ntruly most important challenges facing our country today: we need to \nreduce the price of gas. We need to reduce our dependence on foreign \nsources of energy. It needs to be reduced for our competitiveness. We \nneed to reduce the dependence on energy for our national security, \nespecially the amount of foreign oil we get from the Middle East.\n  American households, families, and businesses are paying high prices \nfor gasoline. They are paying high prices for natural gas as well as \ndiesel. Our country, the United States of America, is far too dependent \non a single source of energy which is primarily located in a hostile, \nunstable region of the world, 8,000 miles away.\n  This dependence that we have on the Middle East needs to be reduced. \nWe have paid a very high price for our energy dependence, not just in \nthe actual cost of energy--which has skyrocketed in the last year, \nharming individuals, harming families, harming manufacturing jobs, \nhaving an adverse impact on our farmers and small businesses--we have \nalso, as Americans, paid a high price in terms of our national security \nsince our economy is becoming increasingly vulnerable to the whims of \nsome Iranian mullah or some dictator in Venezuela.\n  Moreover, there is increasing demand around the world. Every barrel \nof oil produced in Saudi Arabia or Iran or anywhere else is in \ncompetition with the growing economies in Central Europe, and the very \nlarge growing economies in India and China--all competing for that same \nbarrel of oil.\n  This dependence on foreign oil is a serious problem, a serious \nchallenge which requires and demands a serious long-term solution. The \nold brain-dead energy policies of the past are not\n\n[[Page S8432]]\n\ngoing to work in today's innovative and expanding global economy. We \nneed to adopt a comprehensive, 21st century energy program that will \nincrease energy affordability, energy reliability, and, above all, our \nmission of energy independence.\n  The best way to strengthen our energy independence is through more \nAmerican energy diversity. We need to adopt a flexible, diverse \nportfolio of energy options. That, also, of course, first and foremost, \nmust include increased domestic energy production, including American \noil and natural gas. As to clean coal, American coal, we are the \n``Saudi Arabia'' of the world in coal, and we ought to be using clean \ncoal technology for electricity generation as well as gasifying coal or \nmaking it into a diesel-like fuel. We also ought to be using American \nadvanced nuclear power for electricity generation.\n  We need to increase our refinery capacity. Right now, refineries are \ngoing at 100 percent capacity. When they shift from one formulary to \nanother, there is disruption, increased prices, some shortages, and not \njust at the refineries but also in the pipelines. So we need more \nrefineries in this country.\n  We need, as Americans, to conserve and become more efficient and \nsmart in the use of our energy and our methods and even the engines of \npropulsion. We also need to unleash the power to free, creative minds \nand free markets right here in America. We have to unleash the best \nscientists, the best engineers, and the best technicians in the world. \nIt is time to put them to work to develop a 21st century energy \nprogram.\n  Fuel cells can be part of it. Hybrids, clean-burning natural gas, the \nuse of biofuels, whether that is soy diesel or ethanol, are part of the \ninnovative ideas. Also, with advancements in nanotechnology, materials \ncan be lighter and stronger, needing less energy to propel that \nparticular vehicle. Nanotechnology is also making solar photovoltaics \nmuch more of a part of our options. Lithium-ion batteries are moving \nforward, and that is another method of propulsion for the future.\n  We have to adopt, we have to be determined, and we have to move \nforward with a comprehensive 21st century energy independence policy \nfocused on energy production, innovation, and diversity. When we do \nthat, we will see lower gas prices for American consumers. We will see \nmore jobs for American workers and a stronger, more competitive and \nsafer America in the world.\n  I believe that the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, which is \ndesigned to expand deepwater exploration in the Gulf of Mexico, is an \nimportant first step toward a long-term energy solution. Although, I \nknow there is much more to be done--and I will be offering an amendment \nto allow other States to have the same options as well--but this is a \nbipartisan measure, a bill crafted by Chairman Domenici and Senator \nBingaman, with the support of Senators from, expectedly, Louisiana, \nMississippi, and Alabama, and also breakthrough leadership from the \nSenators--including the Presiding Officer, Senator Martinez--from \nFlorida.\n  This measure is going to permit energy exploration of 1.7 million \nacres in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, otherwise known as lease sale 181. \nIt would also lift the production moratorium or ban for 6.3 million \nacres south of that area. Experts estimate that by permitting \nexploration of this area, we will eventually extract 1.26 billion \nbarrels of oil and 5.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.\n  This home-produced American energy can run our cars, heat our homes, \npower our factories. And, best of all, the money stays right here in \nAmerica instead of being sent outside of America. This will have a big \nimpact on jobs.\n  People wonder: Why does it matter for jobs? Well, the natural gas \naspect of this is very important. Our manufacturers of chemicals and \nfertilizers--which affects so many of us, particularly the farmers, but \neverything we use--those manufacturing jobs could be anywhere in the \nworld, whether it is for chemicals, whether it is for fertilizers, \nmanufacturing tires in Danville, VA, at the Goodyear plant. Those tires \ncould be manufactured anywhere. And the cost of natural gas, the \naffordability, the reliability of it matters a great deal.\n  Plastics can be manufactured everywhere. But plastic manufacturers \nrely a great deal on petroleum-based products as well as natural gas. \nForestry products for paper, cardboard, and lumber use natural gas. \nAgain, it is very important we have affordable natural gas to keep \nthose jobs in America rather than going overseas.\n  Now, as a former Governor, I believe a large portion of the royalties \nfrom the new deepwater exploration should be shared with the adjacent \nStates. That is why I am supporting the revenue-sharing portion of this \nlegislation, notwithstanding opposition from the White House. In this \nlegislation, as much as 37.5 percent of the available revenues will go \nto the Gulf Coast States, many of which were severely damaged by \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n  Now, these revenues will free up money for worthy projects, such as \neducation, transportation, and coastal shoreline erosion remediation. \nThis is an outstanding bill. It will increase jobs and income, \nobviously, in the Gulf Coast States. It will help Alabama, Mississippi, \nand Louisiana, and Florida, but also the whole country. What is most \nimportant is that for the whole country this will increase the \naffordability of energy. It will increase our reliability of having \nenergy in every State in our Union.\n  This bill will not harm our environment. I would remind my colleagues \nthat hundreds of deepwater oil rigs were in the paths of Hurricane \nKatrina and Rita, and although these rigs were shut down and disabled \nby the roaring winds and the rising seas, not one of them released oil \ninto the Gulf of Mexico. So this is a good record of performance that \nshould alleviate any concerns about environmental safety.\n\n  I believe so strongly in this measure and this program that I want my \nown Commonwealth of Virginia to participate in it. This is why I am \noffering an amendment. And I will continue in the months and years \nahead to allow not only the Gulf of Mexico States to share in revenues, \nand to permit those folks to have the deepwater exploration, but I want \nto permit and allow the people of Virginia to explore for oil and/or \nnatural gas 50 miles off of our coastline and no closer than 25 miles \nfrom any neighboring State.\n  It would be a completely voluntary arrangement. My amendment allows \ndeepwater exploration if that is the will of the people of Virginia. It \nsimply gives the people an option. It gives the people a choice. And I \nsincerely believe the people of Virginia will choose to allow deepwater \nexploration once they are conversant with the facts and the \nopportunities. In fact, the General Assembly of Virginia, 2 years in a \nrow, has passed legislation, with bipartisan support, to allow \ndeepwater Outer Continental Shelf exploration far off the coast of \nVirginia.\n  Here are the facts. In the far part of the eastern seaboard, 45 miles \noff of our coast, Cuba is exploring for natural gas. Then in Canada, \noff the Grand Banks and the Maritime Provinces, they are exploring for \noil and natural gas.\n  Now, for the U.S. area, and near Virginia, according to the Minerals \nManagement Service, there are 1.23 billion barrels of oil and 11.68 \ntrillion cubic feet of natural gas along the Mid-Atlantic Outer \nContinental Shelf. This remarkable, significant amount of energy is \njust sitting there, waiting for us to use it. Yet Federal law prevents \nthe people of Virginia and America from using it.\n  Now, the gasoline prices are surging at over $3 per gallon. It is, to \nme, unbelievable and irresponsible to continue this obstructionist, \ndetrimental restriction and regulation on Virginia and other States.\n  In my amendment, I have ensured that the people of Virginia are able \nto reap the benefits of any successful deepwater exploration far off \nour Virginia coast. Using Senator Domenici's legislation as a model, I \nhave established that 37.5 percent of revenues would be allocated to \nVirginia. I recommend that half of these revenues would go to much \nneeded transportation projects in Virginia. It could be for the third \ncrossing down in Hampton Roads or for the widening of a variety of \ninterstates across our Commonwealth. That would get half of the \nrevenue.\n\n[[Page S8433]]\n\n  A quarter of the revenue would go to reducing instate tuition at our \nVirginia colleges, and another quarter of the revenues would go to the \ncoastal communities which are the counties on the eastern shore of \nNorthampton and Accomack and to Virginia Beach, which they may want to \nuse for shoreline or beach, sand replenishment.\n  Now, how much money are we talking here? Experts estimate that it \ncould be nearly $3 billion over a period of time. That's right, $3 \nbillion--all paid into Virginia's treasury, benefiting all Virginians, \nwhether it is in education, whether it is for the shoreline, or \nimproving our transportation.\n  Now, if Senators from other States think to themselves: I wouldn't \nwant to have those jobs and those billions of dollars for my State, I \nwould only say to them: Fine. That is your choice. I respect that \nchoice. But please allow us in Virginia to make a choice as well, a \nchoice that helps us and does not hurt any of the other States at all.\n  We did not get into this energy dependence challenge and predicament \novernight, and we are not going to get out of it overnight. This \nlegislation is a vitally important aspect of bolstering our energy \nsecurity for generations to come. I support it, and I strongly advocate \nits swift passage because it is a long stride forward toward our \nultimate American goal of America's energy independence. And for the \nfuture, I encourage my colleagues to support what I consider to be my \nfair, commonsense approach to empower the people of Virginia to explore \nfor oil and/or natural gas in the deep water off our Outer Continental \nShelf, if they so choose to do so.\n  This expanded proposal is consistent with the principles of \nfederalism and free choice, and it respects the will of the people. It \nis a win-win situation for jobs, competitiveness, and, most \nimportantly, it will incentivize and encourage the people of the States \nto join in with our national mission of energy independence.\n  I hope the underlying bill passes, of course. And I look forward--I \nsee the chairman is here. I commend him for his outstanding work in a \nbipartisan manner. And I see Senator Landrieu here from Louisiana as \nwell. This is a long stride forward. But please understand, Mr. \nChairman, that I am going to continue fighting for Virginia. It is good \nfor Virginia. It is also good for America because we need to have \nAmerica independent from foreign sources of energy, particularly that \nfrom the Middle East. I say to the Senator, thank you for your \nleadership.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I intend to support cloture on S. 3711, the \nGulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006, and will vote for final \npassage. I am voting for cloture and for final passage because I \nbelieve we need to move forward to open up more areas for natural gas \nexploration to address the increasingly tight natural gas supply in the \nU.S. and its resulting high prices, but to do so in a way that protects \nour environment.\n  Over the past 6 years, the tight natural gas supply and increasing \ncosts of natural gas has had a significant impact on consumers and \nparticularly on the U.S. manufacturing sector, which depends on natural \ngas as both a fuel source and a feedstock and raw material. With U.S. \nnatural gas prices the highest in the industrialized world, many \ncompanies have made decisions to move their manufacturing operations \noffshore. More than 2 million manufacturing jobs have been lost to \noverseas operations in the last 5 years, and I believe we need to take \nreasonable efforts to bring down the cost of natural gas in the U.S.\n  I agree with many of my colleagues that this compromise on offshore \noil and gas exploration represents what is achievable in the Senate, \nand I urge the leadership on both sides to resist strongly any efforts \nby the House to broaden the scope of this legislation. If the bill \ncomes back from conference with the House of Representatives without \nthe Senate limits and environmental protections, I will not support the \nfinal product worked out by the conferees. Senator Reid's letter to \nSenator Nelson is very reassuring in that regard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I believe I have 15 minutes at this \npoint.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized. There is no time \nlimit.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me say, before the distinguished \nSenator from Virginia leaves the floor, here is how I see the situation \nin terms of coastal waters and the tremendous resources that are along \nthe coast today, including the Senator's State. I see us on the verge \nof making the first breakthrough in 25 years. If this breakthrough \noccurs and this bill passes and this bill gets signed, the breakthrough \nis that your State and your people--openly and bright--might want it, \ntoo. In fact, you have been talking about that.\n\n  The point I am making is, we are doing this right. Let us get this \none done, as you have said, and you certainly have not said we should \nnot. I don't imply that. But the right thing for the country, in fact, \nof these prolonged moratoria is to pass 181 before us because it is \nbig. It is real. It is right. It is now. It will happen and it will \nhurt no one. Besides, you will see bids to open with short periods of \ntime saying: We will drill. You will see companies announcing what they \nare going to do. That will be the stimulus. I am not a football expert, \nbut it is sort of like if the goal is to maximize, eventually, over \ntime, the coastal production of America from a venue of stagnation, if \nthat is the goal--and I am not there yet, but if that is the goal--what \nyou do is you make the first 10 yards right now. This is the first 10 \nyards. This is the breakthrough.\n  Now you are going to see it, and you can say: Man, we can make it. \nThen your State will come, and other States will come. So I am very \npleased we chose to limit it to the four States plus Florida and to \nthis big piece called 181, plus 181 south, which you have lauded here \ntoday.\n  I will close by telling you something that you can now tell your \npeople when this bill passes. On the day of the vote, for those who \ndon't think this is a good bill, I want to remind them, and you can \nremind them, that it was just announced that natural gas had its \nbiggest gain this year. Bloomberg announced that natural gas rallied to \nits biggest gain this year in the U.S. on a record-breaking heat wave, \nand the prices went up. So right now we are celebrating something very \nnegative, that the supply is not sufficient. And with the excess heat, \nthe price went up. What we want to tell them is, pass this bill. Start \nusing these resources. Put them in our inventory, right? Get our \nbusinesspeople out there investing to drill, and we will have natural \ngas coming from 181, this big piece of real estate, energy laden, 6 \ntrillion cubic feet on this one piece, enough for 6 million homes for \n15 years, 1.2 billion barrels of oil on just this one piece. Get \nstarted, right? That is why we are going to do it.\n  I think we have the votes. But if you know anybody who is not for it, \nI say to the Senator, you tell them we celebrated the wrong thing today \nbecause we have been doing things wrong. It is time to do it right. \nThat is what I think, and that is what this bill is. You are on the \nright track, and I commend you. This bill will get us started. I hope \nyou understand that.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I am certain.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We can't do it all at once. I am so pleased we picked \nthe right one. And with the help of that man sitting in the chair, the \nPresiding Officer today--we call him ``President'' today, but he is \nactually a Senator--with his help, because he had a little guts, he \ndecided to talk to his people instead of echoing. He went out there and \ntalked and said: Let's do something. They agreed to this, after years \nof dilly-dallying, right? We are doing something for the country. The \nPresiding Officer, Mel Martinez, the junior Senator, is part of this \nthree or four or five people who led this actual attack on this \nmoratorium. Moratorium has something to do with death. That is what the \nmoratorium was, death for us, this crazy idea that these resources \nshould be locked up when you could drill for them and not hurt anybody. \nIt is finally going out the window, little by little, with this bill. \nTwo windows going out. We will see how it works. The public is going to \nsay: Boy, it works. And then some more windows will go out later. And \nthat is what you are talking about.\n\n[[Page S8434]]\n\n  Thank you so much.\n  Mr. ALLEN. If I may, Mr. President----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield to the Senator. I have the floor.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I would say to the chairman of the Energy Committee, I \nwanted to get on that committee in this session because I really do \nbelieve energy independence, energy security is the most important \nissue facing our country. The Senator has provided great leadership, \nworking with a variety of different forces, and getting things done on \na bipartisan basis. I agree that Senator Martinez was absolutely \ncrucial in this bipartisan effort. I would hope, though, that you \nrecognize that while I am introducing this amendment, I know my \ncolleague, Senator Warner, has a different sort of amendment, trying to \nget to the same point. I hope I can count on you, and I hope the \nAmerican people can count on you to work in a bipartisan fashion in the \nfuture, whether this year or future years, to allow the people of \nVirginia, if they so desire, to explore off our coasts and use this as \na model in sharing revenues with the States because I think sharing of \nrevenues with the States will be an incentive for States to help the \nnational mission of energy independence and not allow that good energy \nto stay there fallow in deep water off our Outer Continental Shelves.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  In response to what the junior Senator from Virginia just said, \nobviously, this bill sets not only the precedent of getting rid of the \nmoratorium for deep water drilling off the coast of Florida, but it \nalso sets a precedent of revenue sharing with the coastal States that \nsurround the activity. That is what the Senator is talking about. \nObviously, the Senator from New Mexico favors that. I don't have to \nanswer his question specifically. I favor that. I took a gamble and \nsaid: I am one to do that. I started off saying, I think I can get it \ndone. I think we can get it done without it. That is where I started, \nright, I ask the Senator from Louisiana? I reported a bill out, found \nout we probably would get nothing. I am not sure of that, but probably \nthe country would get nothing, the coastal States would get nothing, \nthe Treasury would get nothing, the coastal repair would get nothing. \nAnd we would be right back here telling the public: We can't do \nanything.\n  So when the coastal States and the Senator from Florida started \nnegotiating with us about the coastal States and about Florida's linear \nprotections, distance protections, I had to move from no coastal \nrevenues. I am very pleased with the way it turned out because I \nbelieve over the long run we have by at least 10, maybe 20 years, \naccelerated the timeframe for coastal exploration. I am not saying \nforever because I think sooner or later reality had to set in. I think \nwe are just pushing reality here and pushing hard, saying: OK, we are \ngoing to share, but we are going to get the resources.\n  We might be ready soon to have hearings in the committee, have other \nbills, move in other directions. But for right now, this is the best \nbill to clear the Senate.\n\n  We have this terrible 60-vote threshold in this place. You are aware \nof that. It is no longer a majoritarian place. There are 60 votes for \neverything. You ask for a motion for a pin to drop, and somebody says: \nI am going to filibuster. Right? You have to have 60 votes. Appointment \nof conferees is filibustered now. Somebody like Senator Byrd will say: \nSenator Domenici, don't think that is new. That was around forever. Of \ncourse, it was. But it wasn't used very much.\n  But you know that is being used now. A motion to appoint conferees on \na bill is now an acceptable measure on which to have a filibuster. The \npoint is, this is no turkey shoot, passing a bill in the Senate. You \ndon't just have to sharpen up and hit one; you have to get 60 votes. \nThat is why it is so important you know how to put it together. That is \nwhy we did this. That is why some people, looking down on this bill, \nwondering how far can you go--you know where that is coming from--how \nfar we can go and still get something passed--have to understand, the \n60-vote threshold probably, if we make it tonight, and even if we break \nit, the point is, it is fragile. You fool around with it and change it \nand you could go back down to 59, 58, and be dead again.\n  So if you want some energy for America, not big time, not like a \nwhole new country has been invented, we still have a lot of coast left, \na lot of other places left, but this is a big one. If you want this, \nyou have to remember, you have to get 60 votes. We have got to get 60 \nvotes here tonight. We have got to get 60 votes later on. And we better \nnot be thinking too far ahead of our nose or we will find out we don't \nhave the votes.\n  So I want to close by reminding everybody that the price of natural \ngas increased by a record amount. The public can note that. They might \nbe thinking: Why didn't you do something about it? We want to tell them \nwe are trying tonight to do something about it. We have a ways to go, \nright? We have to get it passed, and we have to get it past the House. \nBut we are trying to do something about this report that says the price \nwent up the highest amount. We are trying to do something about it. We \ndon't guarantee anything, but we guarantee you that we are going to \nhelp if we add 6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas to the inventory of \nnatural gas for Americans from this piece of real estate off the coast \nof Florida, off the coast of Louisiana that belongs to the people, that \nhad a moratorium on it, that had a death wish on it: You can't do \nanything with it.\n  We are taking that off, and that is why it is important.\n  It is also important that everybody knows it is not easy to do \nbecause in the Senate you need 60 votes. No, you don't, people told me \nthe other day. What is the matter with you, Senator? Fifty-one votes \nwill do that.\n  I said: Well, we changed business in the Senate. Almost everything is \na filibuster. I just explained that to you. This bill was filibustered. \nNo question. So we have this fancy-named thing called cloture. That \nmeans a request that the filibuster be restrained. We are going to vote \non that. Do you want to throw out the filibuster tonight? That is what \nthe vote is going to be about. But that is the 60 votes. People should \nknow that, and they should know that about our bill, whomever it is. \nThis is tough sledding. Don't be thinking that we could change it \nhelter-skelter. And if they are wondering why we have been tough on \namendments, just remember with us, who knows what amendments would do \nto this bill.\n  It is a good bill like it is. Sorry to fellow Senators who want to \noffer amendments for a week. I am sorry. I wish you could preside, Mr. \nPresident, over wonderful debates, about 20 amendments or 30 on this \nbill. I hope we don't have to because I hope we close it up with the \ncloture vote, a couple of hours after that, maybe tomorrow, vote on \nfinal passage, send this bill to conference, and then take a little \nwhile with the House and have this same message to them: 60-vote \nproblem in the Senate. Can't send them any old thing or we will get \nnothing.\n  I think my friend from Louisiana knows that. She is here. She knows \nwhat I am going through. I mean, she can comment on that. She does. It \nis not easy to get this through, if you are worrying about adding \nthings to it or changing it.\n  I see the Senator would like to speak.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Of course.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The Senator is absolutely correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 15 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute for the \nchairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The Senator is on to a very excellent point. I was \nwondering if he could remind those listening, getting ready for the \nvote, one of the reasons the debate was restricted is so that we could \nmove on this very important piece of legislation. But if the Senator \nwould remind those of the good things that were done in last year's \nEnergy bill on conservation so that we didn't need a broad debate, we \ndid so many good things, as the Senator will recall, in the last Energy \nbill to conserve, promote renewables. The Senator is well aware of the \nmany things since he led that fight.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is absolutely correct. I have been \nreferring to\n\n[[Page S8435]]\n\nthe Chair and the Presiding Officer in one way because it was the \nSenator from Florida, talking to him as the Senator from Florida. He \nhas taken a seat as a Senator. Another Senator from the committee, \nSenator Lamar Alexander, has taken the Presiding Officer's seat.\n  (Mr. ALEXANDER assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The question fits right in with all four. Lamar \nAlexander is on the Committee of Energy and Natural Resources, as is \nthe Senator from Florida. A big participant is the Senator from \nTennessee. I am looking at the Senator who took on the issue of natural \ngas, the Senator from Tennessee. We knew we could not do this on that \nbill, so we put it off. We did 10 or 15 major things that are still \nhaving an impact on America--everything from seeing to it that all \npossibilities for the alternative of shale being turned into oil be \ngiven a chance. It might happen. We promoted coal to gas, coal to \nliquid. The only thing keeping that from happening is the uncertainty \nof investment because the price of $70 is not certain. If we can \naddress that issue, we will fix that, too. Ethanol came out of that \nbill. The whole idea of hybrid automobiles came out of that bill. \nScores of that are in the area of conservation, which were promoted \neven before I was chairman; they are on that bill and are done. So this \nis a followup for some supply. That is why it is important that we get \nit done.\n  I thank the Senator for the question. There are many other things we \ncould list. I thank the Senate for yielding me additional time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I think we are going to vote around \n5:30. I may need 10 minutes to speak, and others may follow suit. I \nwanted to follow up on what Chairman Domenici said, as a member of the \nEnergy Committee--and, Mr. President, you serve so ably on that \ncommittee, as does the Senator from Florida--to say exactly that point.\n  Some people have been critical of this debate, questioning why it is \nso limited. The answer is because almost everything was included in \nlast year's Energy bill, which we debated for 10 years--a lot of \ndebate, over weeks and months, over a 10-year period. This part was the \npart that was left out--actually increasing the supply of gas. As the \nSenator from New Mexico said earlier, today is probably a propitious \nday to be debating this because the price went up over a dollar.\n  Earlier today, the manufacturing association, the agricultural \ninterests, and the paper and pulp industry shared a press conference. \nThe equivalent price of gas to oil, when gas went up earlier to $15--it \nis now today at $8, yesterday at $7. But at $15, which is what our \nindustry folks pay, and residents pay as well--that high price of gas--\nit was the equivalent of a $7-per-gallon price of gasoline at the pump. \nSo if you are thinking, because all of us know when we fill our tank up \nhow expensive that $2.89 or $3.10 or $3.25 is--can you imagine the \nshock of going to the pump and having it say $7.50 a gallon? Imagine \nthat. That is how high the price of gas got this year in the United \nStates of America.\n  So the reason our farmers are supporting this bill, the reason rural \ncommunities are supporting this bill, the reason the manufacturing \nindustries are supporting this bill, the reason the chemical \nassociation is supporting this bill, and many environmental groups as \nwell, is because we must find more domestic supply to reduce the price \nof natural gas.\n  We are going to also have to import, unfortunately, more liquefied \nnatural gas. I say ``unfortunately,'' although my State benefits from \nthose imports. I can honestly say that I really belong to the group of \nSenators who believe we can be energy independent, and we should. This \nbill is the piece that didn't get done in the last energy bill, and it \nmust get done before we begin writing another comprehensive energy \nbill, which we can and will do because there is always room for \nimprovement.\n  I wanted to answer the critics about why just focus on this. It \nwasn't done in the last bill, so it needs to get done today. Why the \ngulf coast? Because the gulf coast Senators came together, working with \nSenator Domenici, and figured out our neighborhood. We live in the \nneighborhood of the gulf coast. Five States share the gulf; four of us \ndrill and one doesn't. Maybe that one will one day, but who knows? That \nis for the State of Florida to decide. We will defer that debate. \nTexas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama came together and decided we \nwanted to stay in the business despite the fact that there have been \ndifficulties to our coast. We believe in drilling and strengthening \nAmerica's domestic reserves. We want to continue to serve the coast, \nbut we can and will not any longer do it for free.\n  My critics say: Well, Senator, you are not thinking about all the \njobs you get and about the taxes. I am thinking about the jobs created, \nand we are grateful. I am thinking about the taxes we get from onshore \ndrilling. But I am also thinking about the $150 billion in royalties \nthat have been paid by the offshore industry to the Federal Government, \nof which Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama got zero.\n  When I think about our beaches, our coasts, our marshes, our great \nfishing places, and our beautiful marshland, it is compelling that we \nwould enter into a smarter partnership for the future than the one we \nfailed, for many reasons, to enter into in the past. So I am proud to \nhave argued and helped with our gulf coast Senators to negotiate a good \ndeal, a square deal for the gulf coast, and a good deal for the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I also repeat that the country needs the gas now. The gulf coast \nneeds the revenues now, the country needs the jobs now, and the \ncompanies in the industry need the competitive edge now. Today, again, \nat that press conference earlier, it was shocking to see how many \nmanufacturing jobs have been lost. When the price of natural gas for \nour manufacturing sector exceeds the price of labor, we have a serious \nproblem. That problem is getting addressed at 5:30 today when the \nSenate votes to open, for the first time, almost 8.3 million new acres \nof rich natural gas and send a positive signal to the markets and to \nthe industry that we are serious again about finding resources right \nhere.\n  Fifth, the companies in these industries need to gain a competitive \nedge. The States will get a reliable partner in conservation. Mr. \nPresident, you have done more to spearhead that debate since you came \nto the Senate. You did it as Governor of Tennessee, as a Secretary for \nour country. You have been a leader in conservation. I have spoken many \ntimes about the coast and wetlands. I am not quite as passionate or \narticulate as you, but I share your enthusiasm for the fact that this \nNation is a great nation of the outdoors. It separates America from our \nEuropean neighbors. It sets us apart from places like Japan. We have \ngreat open spaces. It is the character of America, as I have heard you \nsay many times.\n  If we don't work harder to preserve those open spaces, they will not \nbe there because they just don't happen; they are dreamed about, \nnurtured, and created, and not by words, not by wishes, but by money \nthat buys and sets aside land. I know we cannot do it in every place \nand for the Federal part, but for the States, for our 50 Governors who \nare looking to the Federal Government to be a good partner and want to \nwork with nonprofit organizations to expand conservation, I say to my \ncolleagues that this bill finds balance.\n  We tried to do this in 1965 when some great Senators, such as Scoop \nJackson from Washington and others, created the Land and Water \nConservation Fund--the first time ever that the Federal Government \nsaid: Let's create a fund to help the States. It wasn't much of one. \nYou could barely see this little dot. It was probably $10 million for \nall the States. That is just pennies. But it was a beginning. We went \nup to $75 million and back down to $50 million, and we kept trying, \nthrough the budgets, to get a little bit of money set aside for our \nparks and bike paths and soccer fields where our kids play. I am not \njust talking about suburban areas, I am talking about urban areas, such \nas small city parks in New Orleans or the large Central Park in New \nYork. We did a pretty good job over time, and we have fallen off the \nwagon, if you will. It is time to get back up in the saddle and fund \nthe Land and Water Conservation. That is what this bill does.\n\n[[Page S8436]]\n\n  To some undecided Democrats who are thinking: What should I do, \nplease consider that the country needs the gas, manufacturing needs \ntheir competitive edge back, the gulf coast could certainly use the \nrevenues, the country needs the jobs, and the States need a reliable, \nsteady stream of revenue for the Land and Water Conservation Fund that \nour Governors, legislators, mayors, county commissioners, and parish \nofficials in Louisiana can certainly count on to help. It is down to \n$40 million, one of the lowest levels it has been.\n  Under this bill, it will go up $450 million a year. Not right away, \nbut over time it will go up to its full authorized funding. We are \ngoing to do what we can between now and the time the bill gets to the \nHouse to make these adjustments in these early years to get these \nnumbers up. We will see. We cannot make any promises because there is a \nlot to be done. The idea is to pass this bill today and get something \nto the President's desk that he can sign.\n  I thank the administration for supporting the framework of the Senate \nbill, for Secretary Kempthorne's visit to Louisiana and Mississippi, to \nthe gulf coast. I thank all Senators who have come down--almost all of \nthem now have come before the anniversary of Katrina--and seen \nfirsthand the great needs America's only energy coast has.\n  I want to show a final picture of the gulf coast because this is what \nI have shown so many times when I have come to the Senate floor. This \nis America's only energy coast. I am not making this up. This is a USGS \nsatellite view of the Gulf of Mexico. You see the great boot of \nLouisiana, the mouth of the Mississippi River here, Mobile Bay, \nGalveston, and the great expanse of the Texas coast. This is America's \nenergy coast. All of these are pipelines that are out into the gulf. \nThere is no way to get oil and gas from this part of the gulf unless \nyou connect it to someplace on land. Whether it is Port Fourchon, \nVenice, Buras, Gulfport, Pass Christian, Morgan City, Beaumont, \nCameron--all of these towns and communities support this industry.\n  When I see people come to the Chamber and say this doesn't belong to \nthe States, this belongs to the Federal Government, I am not even \nmaking the argument; I know this belongs to the Federal Government. \nWhat I am saying is the Federal Government could not access what it \nowns without a right-of-way through the States of Alabama, Mississippi, \nLouisiana, and Texas. It is as simple as that. You can own all the \nvaluable land you want; if you cannot access it, it is as if you don't \nown it. That is what we are talking about, sharing these revenues to \nprotect this great coastline. We most certainly need every penny we can \nget to build these levees to protect these people so we can keep the \nlights on in the Chamber.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Alexander and Senator Hagel be \nadded as cosponsors to S. 3711.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I yield back the time in the event there \nare any other Senators wishing to speak for or against the measure.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that it be equally divided \nbetween the two sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in a few minutes we will be voting on S. \n3711, which is the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006. I urge \nall Senators to oppose cloture on this bill which is the vote that will \noccur at 5:30. Last week, I outlined my reasons for my strong \nopposition to the bill. The bill is not good energy policy and, in my \nview, it is even worse fiscal policy.\n  Turning first to Energy, S. 3711 actually expands areas that are \nunder moratorium off the coast of Florida. It also sets a precedent for \nimposing a new long-term congressional moratorium. The chart behind me \nhas been referred to by many on both sides of this debate. This chart \ndepicts the area, which is in yellow, that will be locked up under S. \n3711 until the year 2022. For the first time, as I can determine, \nCongress will be enacting a multiple-year moratorium--not a moratorium \nfor just 1 year, which we have done many times in the past but, rather, \na moratorium until 2022.\n  In addition, Congress will be placing parts of this area under \nmoratorium that have never been under a moratorium before.\n  The bottom line is that in return for access to an additional 2.76 \ntrillion cubic feet of natural gas, the bill puts almost 10 times as \nmuch natural gas--that is 21.83 trillion cubic feet--off limits until \n2022. Again, that is all of the area colored in yellow.\n  This is certainly not my idea of how we should be addressing our \nNation's energy needs.\n  In addition, the claims of the natural gas that will be produced \nunder the bill are exaggerated. The sponsors of the bill claim that \n5.83 trillion cubic feet of natural gas will be produced. However, over \nhalf of that natural gas will be leased next year and produced anyway \nunder the Department of the Interior's proposed plan. The actual amount \nof additional natural gas made available because of this bill is 2.76 \ntrillion cubic feet.\n  Last year, the Congress enacted the far-reaching Energy Policy Act of \n2005. The legislation addressed energy efficiency and energy \nproduction, nuclear energy, renewable energy, energy technologies, and \nenergy taxes. We made progress, but there is much more work to be done. \nThat is why I am deeply disappointed that the only energy legislation \nthat the Senate is likely to consider this year is S. 3711, which I do \nnot believe takes us in the right direction.\n  I am also disappointed that the right of Senators to offer amendments \naddressing other important aspects of energy policy will be cut off if \ncloture is invoked. There were amendments to S. 3711 filed by my \ncolleagues that address important unfinished business on the topic of \nenergy policy. Prominent among these are amendments to improve \nefficiency in our use of oil and gas. But there are also other \nmeritorious energy amendments which my colleagues will not be able to \noffer if cloture is invoked today.\n  I turn now to the enormous adverse fiscal impacts of S. 3711. The \nbill would divert from the Federal Treasury 37.5 percent of revenues \nfrom the new sale areas to the four States--Texas, Louisiana, \nMississippi, and Alabama. Starting in 2017, this percentage is applied \nto new leases in existing areas of the Gulf of Mexico that are open to \nproduction.\n  To put it simply, we are not talking about diverting revenues from \nthe new lease sale area. Ultimately, S. 3711, by its language, would \ndivert revenues from the entire Gulf of Mexico.\n  This is chart No. 2. The area that is highlighted is the area in the \nwestern gulf and the middle gulf which are open to production, and the \nrevenue from new production in those areas would begin to be diverted \nto the four States I mentioned beginning in 2017.\n  As any Senator can see, this includes the entire western and central \nGulf of Mexico and also, of course, the newly opened lease sale 181 and \nlease sale 181 south areas.\n  Even with S. 3711's so-called cap on revenues paid to the States for \nthe period from 2016 to 2055, the amount flowing to the four Gulf \nStates that would otherwise go to the Federal Treasury would be \nsomewhere between $28.5 billion and $30.5 billion. Estimated losses to \nthe Treasury balloon beginning at that later date of 2056, with annual \nlosses between $12.5 billion and $15 billion starting that year.\n  There is no policy justification for diverting these Outer \nContinental Shelf revenues to the coastal States. The resources of the \nOuter Continental Shelf belong to the entire Nation. The Supreme Court \nruled that offshore lands were and always have been owned by the United \nStates as a feature of national sovereignty. In 1953, Congress passed \nthe Submerged Lands Act which granted coastal States title to submerged \nlands to within 3 miles of their coast. This action by Congress several \ndecades ago settled any issue of State equities.\n  Finally, there has been much discussion as to whether passage of S. \n3711\n\n[[Page S8437]]\n\nwill lead us to a conference on the House-passed bill, which is H.R. \n4761. I understand that the minority leader has made a commitment that \nwe will not accept any version of this legislation other than that \nwhich is before the Senate today. In my view, he is right to take that \nstance because the House-passed bill would take us down a road to even \ngreater fiscal irresponsibility. The administration has warned that the \nHouse-passed bill would cost hundreds of billions of dollars.\n  In addition, the House bill contains many other far-reaching and \nextreme provisions that do not lead to the type of balanced energy \npolicy that is in the best interest of our Nation.\n  For these reasons, Mr. President, I again urge my colleagues to \noppose the motion to invoke cloture.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thank you so much for your courtesy--and \nmy colleagues. I wanted to be heard on this bill. I haven't spoken on \nit. It is a bill that I call a drilling bill; I don't call it an energy \nbill. I rise to speak against it, and I am against it for three very \nsimple reasons.\n  First, I have no assurances--nor does Senator Feinstein--that the \nCalifornia coast will continue to be protected from new offshore oil \nand gas drilling. That protection is crucial to my State, to my State's \neconomy, and, of course, it is crucial to the promise that we made to \nour children and our grandchildren--that this coast will be forever \nprotected. It is one of God's greatest gifts to our State. Every \nhistory book that writes about California talks about the beauty of our \nState--and it starts with the ocean. We know if we lose that beauty it \nis irreplaceable.\n  I also wanted to make a point to my friends that in our State, \noffshore oil drilling is an issue that unites the vast majority of \nRepublicans and Democrats. They do not want to see it happen, whether \nit is our Governor or our Democratic candidate for Governor. They are \nin full agreement. This is an issue that unites California.\n  Clearly, we know that our economy is heavily reliant on tourism. It \nis reliant on fisheries. And offshore oil drilling threatens both of \nthose economic engines.\n  Second, this bill will drain billions of dollars from the Federal \nTreasury. That is indisputable. And it does nothing to help us meet the \ncritical goal of reducing America's dependence on oil. As a matter of \nfact, this bill deepens our dependence on oil.\n  Achieving real energy independence must be more than just a slogan. \nIn this unbalanced bill, we admit our addiction to oil. As a matter of \nfact, I heard many colleagues say we need more oil, that we need this \noil. But with this bill, we continue to feed this habit.\n  I personally believe there are places in this country where you can \ndrill off the coast. I respect Senator Landrieu very much, and I don't \nhave a problem if there is unanimity that there ought to be drilling \noff her state's coast. And I support her efforts to have some \nconservation fund to restore the area. But what are we getting on the \nother side? We are getting drilling, we are feeding the addiction to \noil. It seems to me we are getting nothing because we are not allowed \nto amend this bill with some forward-thinking amendments. We are \ngetting, for sure, a greater and greater deficit and a greater and \ngreater debt.\n  How would we better balance this bill? We should promote vehicle \ntechnologies that get better gas mileage. We can develop and \nincentivize the use of alternative fuels. We can encourage energy \nconservation.\n  We have seen countries such as Brazil just within a 10-year timeframe \nbecome independent of foreign oil--become energy independent. But guess \nwhat. Because the Republican leadership won't allow it, we cannot offer \nany amendments to alter this bill. It is either drilling and giving \nfour States a ton of money to reward them for that, causing the Federal \ndeficit to swell, or it is nothing.\n\n[[Page S8438]]\n\n  It is sad because this is a great country. It is a country of great \nideas. Yet the ideas on both sides of the aisle take a back seat to the \nsame old, same old, drill, drill, drill.\n  We can't drill our way out of this problem. As tempting as the mirage \nof a quick fix might be, we must not endanger the California coast with \nnew drilling. And that is what will happen if this bill is merged with \nthe House drilling bill.\n  If the House would take the Senate bill, then I would breathe a sigh \nof relief for my State--and the west coast and the east coast can also \nbreathe a sigh of relief. But we don't have any assurances that the \nPombo bill, which will open up the door to drilling in the most \nbeautiful areas, will not become part of this bill.\n  Let me tell you that Californians--again, across party lines--\nrejected coastal drilling long ago. Even in the days when our State was \na red State, we rejected offshore oil drilling across party lines.\n  It was because we had a devastating Santa Barbara rig blowout that \ncontaminated our ocean waters and beaches almost 40 years ago. The \nmemories of that are still ever present. The memories of that also \nbecame a warning sign that we want to preserve our precious coast.\n  The people of California decided that the potential benefits of \nfuture offshore oil and gas development were not worth the risk of \ndestroying our priceless coastal treasures and our most important \ntourist industry that draws millions and millions to our coast.\n  I ask anyone listening to this debate: Is there a time when you visit \nCalifornia that you don't go to the coast? Everyone comes to our coast. \nWhat you do there is observe the wonder of an unspoiled coastline. \nThere are certain areas where we do have drilling. But for many years \nwe have kept the moratorium in place. When you go to our coastline, \nfrom the very far north of the State, down to the south, what you see \nis God's beauty. When you come to our State and you stay in our \nbeautiful hotels and our bed and breakfasts and go to our restaurants, \noften having a view of our ocean, you can't help but come away in awe \nthat this is a gift that has been given to us, and a gift that we must \npreserve. It brings dollars to our State.\n  This is one of those times when it is the right thing to do \neconomically to keep that coast beautiful. It is the right thing to do \nspiritually. And, it is the right thing to do environmentally. The \nCalifornia State legislature understands it. In 1994 they passed a law \nthat permanently prohibits oil and gas exploration in our State's \nwaters. I thank them for that. We learned the lesson that drilling is \ndangerous. We learned it the hard way.\n\n  The Senate bill, if it is merged with the House bill, could be \ndisastrous for the California environment and economy. We know it is \ndisastrous for the Federal Treasury. By the year 2017, four States in \nour Nation would be entitled to $590 million per year; by 2022, $1.2 \nbillion per year. These States will get part of the Federal Treasury. \nWe cannot afford this kind of imbalanced fiscal policy at a time when \nthe Federal deficit is expected to be $300 billion this year and the \nnational debt is over $8.4 trillion and growing.\n  I think back to the year that President Clinton left office. The \nbudget projections were that we were going to be debt free. Since my \nfriends on the other side have taken control, deficits are back in full \nbloom. The debt is back and this bill adds to the debt and the deficit. \nHow could we possibly do that today? Sadly, we are not only doing it \nwith the energy bill, we are doing it in another bill I will talk about \nin a minute.\n  How about this? No amendments allowed to this bill. What is the other \nside afraid of? We might have an amendment that will pass? We might \nhave an amendment that increases fuel economy for our automobiles? We \nmight have an amendment that makes sure we have flex-fuel vehicles? We \nmight have an amendment pass that invests in cellulosic ethanol so we \ncan have more farmers get into this act and produce ethanol from \nproducts other than corn? That would not use up as much energy to \nproduce.\n  Americans are paying $3 per gallon at the pump. By the way, in my \nState, in San Diego, I saw gas at over $4 for full serve. Talk about \nsticker shock, picture that one. There is not one thing in this bill \nabout going after the gougers. What are they afraid of on the other \nside of the aisle? That we will go after the people who are essentially \nholding us up at the pump every single day?\n  They say the gas prices are going through the roof because of unrest \nin the Middle East and Nigeria and companies are simply passing along \nhigher costs. If that were true, it would be one thing. It isn't true. \nHow do we know?\n  While the American people are suffering, the oil companies are raking \nin record profits. If this were simply about passing along higher \ncosts, the oil companies' profits would be flat.\n  I used to be an economics major. It is pretty basic. If you are \npassing along costs, your profits are flat. But if you are passing \nalong costs plus a huge increase in profit, your profits are up.\n  Yes, Senator Cantwell, who had a great provision to go after the \ngougers, was not allowed to offer it as an amendment.\n  Oil executives prosper. We have seen them, by the way, come before \nour committee. Senator Cantwell and I tried to swear them in. The \nRepublican chairman would not allow us to swear in the oil company \nexecutives. I found that to be a bit disgraceful. So they were not \nunder oath. By the way, they did not tell the truth, either. The fact \nis, transportation fuel costs for families have doubled since the Bush \nadministration has taken office. Yet we cannot offer an amendment to go \nafter the oil companies because the Republicans, who run the House, who \nrun the Senate, and run the White House, do not want the oil companies \nto face the music. Pretty simple.\n  I thought we were a country of, ``by and for the people.'' It turns \nout we are a country of, ``by and for the oil companies.'' You do not \nlearn that in your textbooks.\n  We have to do better. Democrats have written a bill called the Clean \nEDGE Act that would require increases in flex-fuel vehicle production, \nthat would make price gouging a Federal crime, would provide incentives \nfor manufacturing hybrid cars, and would set minimum fuel economy \nstandards for tires.\n  Why do you need standards for tires? Efficient tires on cars and \nkeeping them inflated to the proper pressure improve mileage and would \ncut oil consumption by 160 million barrels per year. But we cannot \noffer an amendment. No, we cannot offer an amendment. They are \nprotecting the oil companies. Why are we surprised? The President is an \noil man. The Vice President is an oil man.\n  My Democratic colleagues and I have worked with Republicans to raise \nCAFE standards. That is the corporate average fuel economy. That is \nwhat CAFE is. The Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act would raise CAFE \nstandards for all vehicles, including SUVs, from 25 miles per gallon to \n35 by 2017. This is a bill written by my colleagues, Senator Feinstein \nand Senator Snowe, but they cannot offer their amendment. Why? Because \nthe Republicans want to protect the oil companies as the price for gas \ngoes up.\n  By closing the SUV loophole, we could save the equivalent of one \nAlaska National Wildlife Refuge every 7 years. We do not have to drill \nour way out of this crisis in the God-given wild places. We just need \nto be a little smarter. We can do it.\n  I had amendments I would have offered that would have said the \nFederal Government has to purchase the most fuel-efficient vehicles \navailable. It is kind of a no-brainer, but I cannot offer it. The \nPresident could issue an Executive Order today requiring that. He won't \ndo that because he supports the oil companies, folks. Follow it, all of \nit; it leads back to that one point.\n  The average fuel economy of the Federal fleet was an abysmal 21.4 \nmiles per gallon. I have had, for many years, a hybrid car. The new \nmodel, if it is driven properly, gets over 50 miles per gallon. Surely, \nwe can do better than 21.4 miles a gallon.\n  I would have offered an amendment to promote research for cellulosic \nethanol, a type of fuel produced by agricultural waste. Promoting this \ninnovative fuel will reduce our dependence on oil and provide our \nNation's farmers with new income sources. No, I could not offer it \nbecause they are protecting the oil companies. It all comes back to \nthat.\n\n[[Page S8439]]\n\n  With no amendments, we have a narrow drilling bill that busts the \nbudget. We had an opportunity to work together across the aisle and \ncome up with a comprehensive energy bill. But instead, we are going to \nprotect the oil companies.\n  So we have more of the same failed policies that, in the end, could, \nin fact, endanger all of our coasts.\n  Once again, we call on the Republican leadership to start standing up \nfor an energy policy for this country; not a narrow drilling bill that \nbusts the Federal budget but an energy policy that will save the budget \nof the American people and help our economy by being on the cutting \nedge of these technologies.\n  If a country such as Brazil can do it, aren't we a little embarrassed \nthat we can't? We are so far behind, it is extraordinary. I guess when \nyou run the Senate for the oil companies, that is what you get at the \nend of the day.\n  I find it incredible that this Republican Congress that is supposed \nto care about fiscal responsibility has thrown fiscal responsibility \nout the window.\n  You have this bill that will drain the Treasury of over $1 billion a \nyear over time. Then we have this grand compromise in the House headed \nour way that is going to make changes in the tax laws that impact the \ntop 8,200 wealthiest families in America. It will cut their taxes and, \nagain, rob the Treasury of billions of dollars. Guess what they say. \nThey didn't care too much about that.\n  Let me tell the truth about what is headed our way, folks. The \nmoderates on the House side went over to the leadership and said--these \nare the Republicans--we need to vote on the minimum wage because we may \nlose our seats. We are looking crass and cold because we have never had \nthe ability to vote for the minimum wage because you never let us get \nit through. So we need to pass a minimum wage increase.\n  The leadership said: We have not done that in 10 years. We are not \nabout to do it now. But maybe we could figure out a way to twist that \naround and cut back on that minimum wage increase and let those people \nat the bottom of the ladder struggle a bit longer while we give tax \nbreaks to the wealthiest 8,200 families. But we will send it over to \nthe Senate, and if they vote no because they decide they do not want to \nbust the budget, they will look bad because they have been calling for \nan increase in the minimum wage.\n  A long time ago when I was a girl, there was a great man who went up \nagainst Senator Joe McCarthy. He said to him: Have you no shame? We \nought to bring out those words again. I say to my friends, have you no \nshame? People who work at the minimum wage have not had a raise in \nalmost 10 years. You, Senators, have had a raise almost every year. How \nabout tens of thousands of dollars of raises?\n  Finally, because you are caught between a rock and a hard place, you \ndecide to pass an increase in the minimum wage, but you do it over 3 \nyears. I never heard any Senator say: I will take my raise over 3 \nyears. Never, and we get thousands of dollars in 1 year. I never had a \ncolleague come over from the other side of the aisle against raising \nthe minimum wage, saying: We will take our raise in 3 years. We will \nwait 3 years for another increase. No, we get our cost-of-living \nadjustment, while minimum wage workers are going to wait 3 years.\n  By the way, for some the House bill will be a pay cut. Some States, \nsuch as my State, where employers cannot reduce the state minimum wage \npaid just because a worker receives tips, will now be allowed to cut \nthat worker's wages.\n  Have you no shame? Anyone in this Senate live on $10,000 or $11,000 a \nyear? Do you think if you work your fingers to the bone you should be \nstuck at that level for 10 long years, while people at the top, like \nus--and, by the way, we are not at the very top, but we are at the top \n1 percent or so--we get our cost-of-living adjustments every single \nyear.\n  I have so much respect for working people. I have tried every year \nsince I have been here to give them a pay raise. I want to give them a \npay raise where they can hold their head high and support their \nfamilies, not tell them they have to wait 3 years to get their full \nincrease after being held to $5.15 an hour for 10 years.\n  By the way, there are many Republicans who do not believe in any \nminimum wage. There are some I have heard who have been here 20 years \nand have voted against it every time. So if they had their way the \nminimum wage would be $2.25 an hour. I am waiting for the Republicans \nto come up and tell me they want to take their cost-of-living \nadjustment over 3 years. Then I am waiting for them to say, if they \nhave a spouse who works: If my spouse gets a little extra money, I will \ngive back some of my raise--as they have done with their tip policy.\n  I say to those at the very top of the income ladder, the billionaires \nout there: You are not asking for this. The truth is, many of us here \nare very willing to say, on the estate tax, that the exemption should \nbe lifted. We have said that. I am on an amendment to do that. Because \nit is true that the price of houses has gone up, and we do not want to \nhave this estate tax be an onerous burden to anyone--not to a family, \nnot to a farmer--and we can work it out. But what is coming to us in \nthis ``minimum wage train'' is a lot more than an increase in the \nminimum wage. It is a cruel hoax because it does not give minimum wage \nworkers that raise in a year--after they have waited for 10 years.\n  And for those workers that receive tips, it may actually decrease \ntheir wages if they live in one of six states, including California, \nthat doesn't reduce the minimum wage employers must pay because they \nget tips. And, of course, it is coupled with this big gift to the \nrichest families of America, which means, at the end of the day, \nmillions--hundreds of millions--and eventually billions of dollars will \nbe drained from the Federal Treasury. And the very people who claim to \nbe fiscally responsible are at it again, adding to the deficit, adding \nto the debt.\n  This is really a time for people to stand up and be counted. This is \nreally a time to speak the truth. This is a tough time in the world. \nAll of us are heartsick about what is going on in the world, and we all \npray for an end to the fighting, not only in Lebanon and in Israel but \nin Iraq where things are deteriorating every single day. Hard times. In \nthe middle of these hard times, is this the time to say to the \nwealthiest 8,200 families: ``We are worried about you''?\n  And we will have less money for our troops and we will have less \nmoney for our kids. This Senate and this Congress has underfunded the \nNo Child Left Behind Act. Oh, everyone said this was the greatest thing \nsince sliced bread. And I voted for it. I really thought George Bush \nand my Republican friends would fully fund it. I wrote the afterschool \nsection there. We have a million kids on waiting lists. We cannot take \nthem. Funding for that program has been frozen for years now. This \nPresident signed the largest increase in student loan costs ever and \nthe biggest cuts in education ever, but they are going to give a big \ntax break to the richest 8,200 families. I do not get it. I do not \nthink the American people get it. We are going to find out pretty soon.\n  We have an energy bill that Leader Frist would not let us amend. He \nis not letting us offer any amendments to slow our oil addiction, to go \nafter the oil companies, to create a bold, new energy policy, get us on \nthe path of energy independence. And then, with Democrats calling for \nan increase in the minimum wage for 10 years, they give it to us over a \n3-year period, when they take their raises to the bank. It is an \noutrage. Have they no shame? Have they no shame? I do not know. I do \nnot know.\n  I always say here, sometimes I feel like Alice in Wonderland, and I \nfeel that way today. But my voice will be raised on these issues. And \nthe American people will be the judge if these are the kinds of \npriorities they want: a drilling bill, no energy independence, no \nantigouging legislation; a minimum wage increase, long overdue, that \ntakes away money from some minimum wage earners; and two budget-busting \nbills--this one and the one that has the estate tax cut--that are going \nto add billions and billions to our debt. By the way, in closing, we \nshould know who carries that debt: foreign countries, folks. They pick \nup the bonds. If they decide to take their money and go home, we are \nleft in a mess.\n\n[[Page S8440]]\n\n  So I hope the American people are listening in on these debates. I \nlook forward to discussing these matters as they come up before the \nSenate.\n  I thank my colleague very much for his patience.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose S. 3711, which \nwill allow drilling in the gulf and create a new revenue-sharing scheme \nto provide additional resources for the Gulf States.\n  Let me first say that I am not opposed to drilling in the gulf. In \nfact, in 2001, I voted to open a portion of the gulf, known as lease \nsale 181, to drilling. That vote was a codification of the agreement \nbetween former President Clinton and the former Governor of Florida, \nLawton Chiles. Yet the agreement was repudiated after President Bush \ncame into office and reduced the amount of acreage that could be \ndrilled in the Gulf of Mexico at the request of Florida's Governor Jeb \nBush.\n  In fact, I rise today in opposition to this bill not because it opens \nup areas of the Gulf to drilling, but because it protects the west \ncoast of Florida from drilling until 2022--10 years beyond the current \nPresidential moratorium, while providing no additional protections for \nCalifornia's coast.\n  California should be accorded the same protection as Florida gets in \nthis bill.\n  An oilspill would scar our coastline, costing billions of dollars and \ndestroying vulnerable marine ecosystems.\n  In addition, a healthy coast is vital to California's economy and our \nquality of life. Our State's Ocean-dependent industries are estimated \nto generate $17 billion of revenue each year.\n  That is why Californians continue to be nearly united in their \nopposition to drilling off the coast. Today, 64 percent of Californians \noppose drilling, and the number of Californians opposing drilling off \nour coast has only grown.\n  The opposition to drilling off of California's coast dates back more \nthan 30 years. In 1972, California voters passed a citizen-initiated \nproposition which created the California Coastal Zone Conservation \nCommission, charged with developing a statewide plan for protecting the \nState's coastal resources. In the years that have followed, 17 cities \nand 9 counties have passed voter-approved ordinances opposing oil \ndrilling.\n  In 1994, the California Legislature passed a bill that prohibited the \nextraction of oil and gas in State waters. Every year since the passage \nof this law, the State legislature has passed joint resolutions \nopposing oil drilling off the California coast.\n  The Governor, the California Resources Secretary, the Secretary of \nCalifornia Environmental Protection Agency, and the Lieutenant \nGovernor, have all been on record supporting the moratorium on offshore \noil and gas leasing activities off the coast of California.\n  Resources Secretary Mike Chrisman, who is also the chairman of the \nCalifornia Ocean Protection Council, has in fact stated:\n\n       Any pending federal legislation regarding Outer Continental \n     Shelf (OCS) oil and gas leasing must retain all protections \n     from the Congressional leasing moratorium and should seek to \n     make these protections permanent.\n\n  Governor Schwarzenegger has sent a letter to every Senator expressing \nhis ``opposition to any measure that would weaken the national oil and \ngas leasing moratorium that has been protecting the California coast \nfor the last 25 years.''\n  I will ask that the Governor's letter be printed in the Record.\n  This bill cannot be viewed in a vacuum. Last month, the House of \nRepresentatives passed a bill that would lift the current moratoria \nthat exists for the Pacific and Atlantic coasts.\n  Congressman Pombo, a key sponsor of the House bill, has said that the \nHouse will not accept the Senate bill. Congressman Barton, chairman of \nthe House Energy and Commerce Committee, said on Wednesday, July 26, \nthat ``we would certainly encourage--the Senate--to go broader'' than \nallowing drilling in the gulf.\n  Without a concrete commitment from the House leaders that they will \ntake up the Senate bill and pass it without amendment, I cannot support \nthis bill.\n  I would also like to express my disappointment that we have been \ndenied an opportunity to offer amendments to this bill.\n  First, I believe we need a vote on an amendment I have cosponsored, \nauthored by Senator Menendez, which would extend the moratoria for the \nPacific and Atlantic coasts through 2022. For California, this would \nextend the Federal moratorium by 10 years as it is set to expire in \n2012.\n  This amendment would provide the same protections to California as \nthe underlying bill does for Florida. In so doing, the amendment would \nreliably protect the California coast by enacting a long-term \nlegislative moratorium.\n  But we will not be allowed to consider this, or any other amendments \nthat would promote energy efficiency and new energy technologies.\n  With oil prices at $75 per barrel, and natural gas almost $7 per \nmillion Btus, we need real fixes to our energy problems.\n  Unfortunately, the underlying bill is not going to fix this nation's \nenergy problems.\n  I have also filed an amendment, with the bipartisan support of \nSenators Snowe, Durbin, Chafee, Inouye, Collins, Cantwell, Lautenberg, \nBoxer, Menendez, Lieberman, and Reed to increase fuel economy standards \nby 10 miles per gallon in 10 years.\n  Not only is this technologically feasible to do today, the proposal \nwould also save more oil in just over 1 year than the underlying bill \nwill generate.\n  Specifically, this amendment would save 2.5 million barrels of oil \nper day by 2025, the same amount of oil we currently import from the \nPersian Gulf every day.\n  That translates into 912.5 million barrels of oil per year, or just \nless than the 1.25 billion barrels that the underlying bill would \ngenerate.\n  Increasing fuel economy standards would also prevent 420 million \nmetric tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere, or the \nequivalent of taking 90 million cars--or 75 million cars and light \ntrucks--off the road in 1 year.\n  Perhaps most importantly, though, the bill would save consumers as \nmuch as $2,500 over the life of a vehicle.\n  So if we are serious about bringing down the cost of gasoline at the \npump, this amendment would be considered and adopted by the Senate.\n  And if we want to have a real impact on natural gas prices, we would \nbe promoting energy efficiency.\n  California has proven that energy efficiency works--through the most \naggressive energy efficiency policies in the Nation, the State has kept \nits per capita energy use flat while the rest of the Nation's energy \nuse has increased by 50 percent.\n  That is why Senator Snowe and I wanted to offer an amendment on tax \nincentives for consumers to install the most energy efficient \ntechnologies in both residential and commercial buildings.\n  While proponents of the underlying bill say that lease sale 181 and \n181 south will provide 5.83 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, our \namendment would save 7 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. In other \nwords, we can save more natural gas through the Snowe-Feinstein energy \nefficiency tax incentive package than from lease sale 181 and 181 south \ncombined.\n  I also have significant fiscal concerns with the underlying bill.\n  While I commend Senator Landrieu for shepherding a proposal through \nthe Senate that will generously benefit her State, I have concerns \nabout the cost of the proposal.\n  According to estimates, the bill will cost the Treasury approximately \n$20 billion from fiscal year 2007 through fiscal year 2055.\n  This bill creates a new permanent Federal entitlement for just four \nStates that could cost the Federal Treasury $12-15 billion per year in \n2056 and every year thereafter.\n  At a time this Nation is facing a mounting national debt of $8.4 \ntrillion and a crushing Federal deficit of $300 billion, we should not \nbe creating a new entitlement program for four States that could cost \nus hundreds of billions of dollars over the next century.\n  We are already struggling to meet our long-term commitments and face \na looming entitlement crisis as baby boomers retire, straining the \nalready overextended Social Security and Medicare systems.\n  For all these reasons, I am going to vote no on cloture and no on the \nbill.\n\n[[Page S8441]]\n\n  Before I close, though, Mr. President, I would like to say that \nSenator Landrieu has been a tireless advocate for her constituents. I \nhad hoped to support her in her efforts to restore coastal Louisiana.\n  Unfortunately, though, given the potential for a bill to come back \nthat would threaten California's coast, I must vote against this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Governors letter to which I referred \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger,\n\n                                                    July 12, 2006.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing each member of the \n     United States Senate to express my extreme disappointment \n     about the recent action taken by the House of Representatives \n     to approve the Deep Ocean Energy Resources Act (DOER).\n       I have repeatedly expressed my opposition to any measure \n     that would weaken the national oil and gas leasing moratorium \n     that has been protecting the California coast for the last 25 \n     years. When I ran for Governor, I promised the people of \n     California that I would do everything in my power to oppose \n     efforts to weaken federal protections against offshore oil \n     drilling. The DOER would be the beginning of the end of these \n     protections that we have enjoyed for the last 25 years. In \n     fulfilling my promise to all Californians I continue to \n     oppose this bill in the strongest terms.\n       I have been asked to consider new amendments to the bill, \n     but I can tell you that certain things are not negotiable. \n     Our coast is not for sale and no amount of promises of money \n     or other ``incentives'' will alter my position on that. \n     California has the most aggressive energy-efficiency measures \n     in the nation. Because of our efforts, California's per \n     capita energy use has remained nearly flat, while nationwide \n     energy use has increased by nearly 50 percent.\n       Let us change this debate and start talking about a \n     comprehensive energy policy that incorporates the full range \n     of energy efficiency measures and alternative energy sources \n     that can keep this nation running strong now and for \n     generations to come.\n       I urge you to oppose the Deep Ocean Energy Resources Act \n     and to also oppose any amendments intended to make this bill \n     appear acceptable to the American people. Absent an amendment \n     that would uphold the current moratorium in perpetuity this \n     bill is an unacceptable approach and no amount of tinkering \n     will fix it.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\n\n                    land and water conservation fund\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I commend the chairman of the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources for his leadership in moving this bill \nto the floor. Is it his understanding that the conservation and outdoor \nrecreation royalty established by his legislation has tremendous value \nfor the stateside program of the Land and Water Conservation Fund over \nthe long term?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, the Senator from Tennessee is correct. Those who \nwant to make sure our citizens have access to the great American \noutdoors have long advocated the principle that some of the funds from \noffshore oil and gas drilling should become a royalty for conservation \nand outdoor recreation, providing a reliable and permanent stream of \nfunding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. This basic concept \nwas proposed in 1962 by the Outdoor Recreation Resources Review \nCommission--also known as the Rockefeller Commission--and it was also a \nprimary recommendation of President Reagan's Commission on Americans \nOutdoors in 1986. This legislation is an important first step in the \nright direction, one that has been 40 years in the making.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I join the Senator from Tennessee in expressing my \nappreciation for Chairman Domenici's leadership, and I wish to thank \nboth of my colleagues for working with me on providing this permanent \nfunding stream for the LWCF stateside grant program. This program \nsupports the state and local parks and recreation projects that improve \nthe quality of all Americans' lives, and enables American families to \nenjoy our precious natural resource of open spaces.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Would the Senator from New Mexico clarify whether this \nconservation and outdoor recreation royalty would prevent additional \nappropriations for the Land and Water Conservation Fund stateside \nprogram?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No, it would not. The LWCF stateside program will \ncontinue to be eligible to receive funding in the appropriations \nprocess just as it is currently. The mandatory funding stream \nestablished under this bill would not replace appropriated funding, and \ndoes nothing to disadvantage the program in the appropriations process.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. The Senator from New Mexico makes a critical point. The \nprojected revenues for the LWCF stateside program under this bill are \nimportant, but they are not sufficient to keep that program, which has \ncontributed to the improvement of 98 percent of the counties in the \nUnited States since 1964, strong and vital. And I know that all of us \naim to bolster the LWCF stateside grant program, and to achieve the \nlevel of support envisioned by Congress's authorization. So we must \nsupplement the revenues directed to LWCF under this bill with \nmeaningful annual appropriations. I have spoken to the majority leader \nabout this issue as well, and he has assured me that he shares my \nconcerns. I look forward to working with him and with all of my \ncolleagues on this issue in the years ahead.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Would the Senator from New Mexico support an \nappropriation of $100 million in fiscal year 2007 for stateside LWCF?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I was pleased that the Senate Committee on \nAppropriations included $30 million for the stateside program in the \nfiscal year 2007 Interior and Related Agencies appropriations bill. \nThis was a significant improvement over the President's budget request \nand the House Interior bill, both of which zeroed out stateside for the \nsecond straight year. Still, there is room for improvement. I would \nshare the Senator's interest in adding to the stateside funding in the \nSenate committee mark if appropriate offsets can be found. In fiscal \nyear 2007, zero revenues will be allocated to stateside LWCF from this \nconservation royalty because it will take time for the new areas to be \nbrought on line and begin producing. So we will need to appropriate \nfunding in fiscal year 2007 to fill that gap.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. That would certainly be in the interest of all \nAmericans. Of course, we commit to working together to support LWCF \nwith supplementary appropriations beyond the next fiscal year as well. \nOnly constant vigilance and steady support will ensure that the \nprovision providing a permanent stream of funding for LWCF in the bill \nbefore us acts as it was intended--as a strong and growing core, but \nnot the totality, of support for this vital program.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from New Mexico, and look forward \nto working with him to ensure adequate funding for the Land and Water \nConservation Fund.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I would also like to thank Chairman Domenici, as well as \nSenators Alexander and Salazar, for confirming that the LWCF funds \nprovided by this legislation are intended as additional funds to \nsupplement the program, not a replacement for full funding through the \nnormal appropriations process. I would also note that over 50 senators \nsigned the Collins-Salazar-Alexander letter in support of $100 million \nin funding for LWCF-stateside in fiscal year 2007. As evidenced by this \nsupport, this program is absolutely vital to communities throughout the \nNation. Almost every county in the Nation has taken advantage of this \nprogram to conserve open spaces or build playgrounds, ballparks, and \ntrails. I sincerely hope the Senate will restore this historic level of \nfunding through the appropriations process, in addition to those funds \nthat will be made available under this bill.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                       Securing Our Energy Future\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about America's \nenergy crisis, and I am glad to see that my friend, Majority Leader \nFrist, is on the floor to discuss this issue with me.\n  High natural gas prices continue to be a terrible burden for \nMinnesota's families and businesses. High natural gas prices had a \nsevere impact on Minnesotans last winter--I am sure many of my \ncolleagues remember the push that I, along with Senators Snowe and \nCollins, made early this year for emergency LIHEAP assistance--\nassistance the majority leader helped us deliver. Moreover, I don't \nneed to remind my farm State colleagues of the severe\n\n[[Page S8442]]\n\nimpact high natural gas prices have had on their input costs, straining \neven the most efficient farms.\n  Whether high natural gas prices or $3 gas at the pump, high energy \ncosts take a toll on all Americans, which is why I will vote in favor \nof the Gulf of Mexico energy bill that will provide 1.26 billion \nbarrels of oil and 5.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Yet I \nbelieve this bill is only a piece of the larger energy mission America \nmust accept.\n  Clearly, Americans feel the strain of high energy costs at home, in \nthe car, and at work, but all must realize our foreign oil dependence \nthreatens our very economy and national security.\n  I would like to ask the majority leader about the importance of fuel \nindependence to our national and economic security and the need to \nbuild upon the Gulf of Mexico energy bill by considering, on this \nfloor, additional energy proposals that will help to secure our energy \nfuture.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank my friend, the Senator from Minnesota, for his \nquestion because I truly believe energy security is one of the great \nchallenges this Congress must continue to address.\n  As we all know, America is dangerously dependent on foreign sources \nof energy--much of it coming from countries with unstable governments \nor with interests contrary to those of the United States. And this \ndisparity will only increase if we do not take action to increase the \namount of American energy that we use here in America. The bill before \nus today, the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, will do just that. As \nmy friend from Minnesota mentioned, it will reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil and natural gas by opening more than 8 million acres in the \nGulf of Mexico to domestic exploration. The area opened up under this \nbill is estimated to contain 1.26 billion barrels of oil and 5.8 \ntrillion cubic feet of natural gas.\n  However, as I said on the floor last week, while this bill is a \ncritical step toward addressing the energy challenges we face, it is \nonly a first step. There is more that we can--and must--do to break \nwhat the President called our ``addiction'' to oil. We must diversify \nour energy resources, increase the use of renewables and alternative \nsources such as ethanol and biodiesel, clean coal technology, and \nnuclear power, and we must take steps to reduce consumption by \nconsumers. Finally, we must do more to encourage the development of the \ninnovative new technologies that will wean us off of foreign oil in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. Leader, I appreciate those comments. Some people \ndismiss such an ambitious goal as reducing our growing dependence on \nforeign oil, but I recall a time when the Moon was also once out of \nreach. We all know the power of America's innovative, relentless spirit \nwhen called to an objective, no matter how formative.\n  I am particularly pleased the majority leader supports an aggressive, \nmultifaceted energy strategy that includes renewable fuels and energy \nconservation. As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I know we \ncannot afford to rely on oil imports that are subject to the whims of \nHugo Chavez in Venezuela or the political stability of Nigeria. The \nfact is that countries rated by Freedom House as ``not free'' produce \nmore than two-thirds of the world's oil and have nearly 80 percent of \nthe proven reserves.\n  I believe the imperative is clear: America must free itself from its \noil dependence, and I believe the solution is also clear: renewable \nenergy and energy conservation. The Vehicle Fuel Choices for American \nSecurity Act that I have coauthored and now has 27 cosponsors lays out \nan ambitious plan for saving 2.5 million barrels of oil per day in 10 \nyears, roughly the amount of oil we currently import from the Middle \nEast, through renewables and energy conservation. Further, the bill \nwill promote E85 fueling infrastructure and speed the development of \ncellulosic ethanol, while investing in the development of efficient \nvehicle technologies and assisting auto manufacturers' transition to \nfuel-efficient vehicle production.\n  Last week, chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources committee, \nand my good friend, Pete Domenici expressed on the floor his affinity \nfor the ideas in this bill, and a portion of the bill has already \nreceived a hearing in the Energy Committee. Mr. Leader, will you work \nwith me to develop an energy package that boosts our renewable fuel \nproduction and energy conservation?\n  Mr. FRIST. I will tell my good friend from Minnesota that I do not \nconsider the Gulf of Mexico energy bill to be the last word on energy \npolicy this year. I am well aware of your proposals promoting \nrenewables and energy conservation, and I look forward to working with \nthe Senator and Chairman Domenici on many of these important ideas in \nthe months ahead.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his support and \nleadership on energy issues. I believe America faces a great threat in \nforeign oil dependence, but more importantly, I believe in Americans' \nability to accomplish the impossible. I know if Congress will put forth \na vision and provide the tools to accomplish that vision, Americans can \nbreak our addition to foreign oil.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I think there is no doubt, given the \nenergy situation in the world and in the United States, that there is a \nneed for the United States to work toward energy independence and to \nhave additional exploration, development, and production activities \nwhere they can be done in an environmentally safe way.\n  I believe that, all factors considered, S. 3711 is, on balance, at a \nclose question, worthy of enactment. But I think it would have been \nvastly preferable had the leader not filled the tree so as to prevent \nfurther amendments so that the Senate could have undertaken a broader \nexamination of energy issues, done more than just authorize further \nexploration but instead taken positive steps on other important lines.\n  For example, I filed an amendment numbered 4741, which would have \nmade very significant changes in the antitrust laws in the United \nStates, which would have had a significant impact on reducing our \ndependence on OPEC oil and would have promoted competition in the oil \nindustry by taking a firm stand against anticompetitive mergers.\n  The oil and gas industry has seen over 2,600 mergers since the 1990s, \nincluding transactions involving the largest oil companies in the \nnation, like Conoco's merger with Phillips, Chevron's merger with and \nTexaco, Exxon's merger with Mobil, Ultramar Diamond Shamrock's merger \nwith Valero, and many others which will be specified in a statement I \nwill append at the conclusion of these extemporaneous remarks.\n  My amendment would have required the Government Accountability Office \nto study whether remedies ordered by the antitrust enforcement agencies \nto ensure that mergers do not substantially lessen competition have \nbeen adequate. Once the study was completed, the antitrust enforcement \nagencies would then be required to consider whether any additional \nremedies are necessary.\n  The amendment would have required the Federal Trade Commission and \nthe Justice Department to consider whether current merger laws are \nadequate, given the particular problems that exist in the oil and gas \nmarkets. The thrust is to determine whether we need to change the \nClayton Act to make it tougher to get massive mergers in these markets \napproved.\n  I know there are those who contend that the mergers provide \nefficiencies. But I think it is virtually incontrovertible that these \nmergers lessen competition. When you have Exxon and Mobil and the other \noil companies merging, there simply is less competition. This amendment \nstops short of amending the Clayton Act, but does require a study to \nsee if the Clayton Act ought to be changed.\n  This provision was included in S. 2557, the Oil and Gas Industry \nAntitrust Act of 2006, which was taken up by the Judiciary Committee, \nwhich I chair. We had two hearings and a markup and the Committee \nreported it to the floor. So, this was an ideal occasion to consider \nthis legislation--as\n\n[[Page S8443]]\n\npart of the debate over an overall energy policy aimed at lessening \ndependence upon foreign oil.\n  A second part of S. 2557 provided that OPEC would be subject to our \nantitrust laws. It is obvious that OPEC is a cartel that fixes output \nand prices for oil, an arrangement that would violate our antitrust \nlaws. However, they are currently exempt. By statute, we could bring \nthem under our antitrust laws. It would have made a lot of sense to do \nthat, especially at a time when we are considering the legislation now \npending, S. 3711.\n  In addition, I believe it would have been very beneficial to our \nnational energy policy to have considered an amendment offered by \nSenator Bingaman, No. 4692, which provides for oil conservation. \nSenator Bingaman and I have cosponsored legislation in the past which \nwould have lessened the amount of oil projected to be consumed in the \nUnited States under an oil conservation system. When we are considering \nS. 3711 and we are considering the basic issues as to how to achieve \nenergy independence for the United States, and provide security for the \nUnited States, there are other avenues that this legislation should \nhave explored. However, we were prevented from doing so by the \nprocedures adopted by the Republican leadership, which precluded \nadditional amendments. I think that is contrary to the public interest, \nand I expressed that view to the leadership.\n  I thought we ought to have an opportunity to consider additional ways \nof achieving energy independence. Once the so-called tree is filled, \nyou cannot offer any further amendments, so that I could not offer \namendment No. 4741, which is the legislation reported out of the \nJudiciary Committee under the caption S. 2557, the Oil and Gas Industry \nAntitrust Act of 2006, nor could we take up the amendment offered by \nSenator Bingaman on oil conservation. I think that is most unfortunate. \nOnce the tree is filled and these amendments cannot be offered, there \nis no alternative but to move for cloture, move to complete action on \nthe bill so that we can take up other important matters to come before \nthe Senate which are awaiting action on the docket.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my remarks be printed \nin the Record\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nFloor Statment Offering S. 2557, the Oil and Gas Industry Antitrust Act \nof 2006 as an Amendment to S. 3711, the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security \n                              Act of 2006\n\n       Mr. President, I seek recognition to speak on my amendment \n     that I have filed to S. 3711, The Gulf of Mexico Energy \n     Security Act of 2006. My amendment was reported by the \n     Judiciary Committee earlier this year as a stand-alone bill, \n     S. 2557, The Oil and Gas Industry Antitrust Act of 2006. My \n     amendment fits in well with the goals of S. 3711 because it \n     is aimed at ensuring that the oil and gas industry is \n     responding to the forces of supply and demand, not market \n     manipulation.\n       Over the years, the oil and gas industry in the United \n     States has become significantly more concentrated. Over 2,600 \n     mergers have occurred in the industry since the 1990s, \n     including transactions involving the largest oil and gas \n     companies in the nation.\n       As recently as March, the Department of Justice approved \n     Conoco-Phillips' acquisition of Burlington Resources, a \n     merger that created the Nation's largest natural gas company \n     and the third largest oil company.\n       The Federal Trade Commission also recently approved \n     Occidental's acquisition of Vintage Petroleum, a transaction \n     that would create the fifth largest U.S. oil company.\n       Last summer, the FTC approved Chevron's acquisition of \n     Unocoal and Valero's acquisition of Premcor. The latter \n     transaction created the Nation's largest refiner.\n       In 2002, Valero acquired Ultramar Diamond Shamrock and \n     Phillips merged with Conoco.\n       In 2001, Chevron bought Texaco and Ultramar Diamond \n     Shamrock acquired Total.\n       The year 2000 saw the merger of British petroleum and ARCO.\n       The largest transaction occurred in 1999 when Exxon merged \n     with Mobil.\n       Other transactions have included British petroleum's \n     acquisition of Amoco, Marathon's joint venture with Ashland \n     Petroleum and another joint venture that combined the \n     refining assets of Shell and Texaco.\n       As an industry becomes more concentrated, the remaining \n     competitors are able to exercise market power and prices \n     inevitably rise. Market power is a particular problem in the \n     petroleum industry because consumers are generally unable to \n     respond to rising prices. While some conservation is \n     possible, consumers still must get to work and, as prices \n     rise, homeowners generally do not stop heating their homes. \n     As a result, even moderate increases in concentration can \n     provide oil and gas companies with substantial market power.\n       The Judiciary Committee held two hearings on the issue of \n     concentration in the oil and gas industry earlier this year. \n     The Committee heard considerable testimony indicating that \n     concentration and market power could impact prices. At one of \n     the hearings, Joseph Alioto, an attorney who is currently \n     challenging the Shell/Texaco transaction that I just \n     mentioned, testified that after the transaction, Shell and \n     Texaco increased the price of Texaco gasoline, which had \n     traditionally been lower than the price for Shell gasoline. \n     Later, the companies raised prices for both brands of \n     gasoline--by 50 to 70 percent in some areas. In another \n     example, an FTC investigation uncovered internal \n     communications indicating that one major oil company had \n     exported Alaskan oil to East Asia in an effort to reduce \n     supply and raise prices on the West Coast. That company \n     clearly knew that it had the ability to exercise market power \n     in West Coast markets.\n       My amendment would require the Government Accountability \n     Office to study whether remedies ordered by the antitrust \n     enforcement agencies to ensure that mergers do not \n     substantially lessen competition have been adequate. Once the \n     study is complete, the antitrust enforcement agencies must \n     consider whether any additional remedies are necessary. My \n     amendment also requires the FTC and Justice Department to \n     consider whether current merger laws are adequate given the \n     particular problems that exist in oil and gas markets.\n       During its hearings, the Judiciary Committee also heard \n     testimony from the oil companies. They argued that the market \n     for crude oil is a ``world market'' and they could not \n     possibly affect the price. This contention may be true. \n     Pretty much everyone knows that the ``big boys'' in the world \n     oil market are the members of OPEC. They openly exercise \n     their market power in the world market for oil. OPEC is a \n     cartel engaged in limiting the supply, and in doing that, \n     fixing the price of oil. Cartels violate U.S. antitrust laws. \n     They violate Section 1 of the Sherman Act, which prohibits \n     agreements in restraint of trade.\n       Since OPEC members sell their product to the United States, \n     they would normally be subject to U.S. antitrust laws. \n     However, certain judge-made laws prevent the Justice \n     Department from prosecuting OPEC members for fixing the price \n     of oil. My amendment would eliminate those laws and allow the \n     Justice Department to pursue price fixing by OPEC members. As \n     I said at the outset, my amendment ensures that petroleum \n     markets are responding to the laws of the supply and demand, \n     not the manipulation of a few countries, or a few companies, \n     or a few corporate executives.\n       While the U.S. companies may not control the world market \n     for crude oil, the market for refined products is different. \n     At the level of production where crude oil is turned into \n     gasoline and heating oil and other refined products, the \n     major U.S. oil companies do exercise market power. At the \n     Judiciary Committee's hearing, Severin Borenstein, who is a \n     Professor of Business and Public Policy at Berkeley and holds \n     a Ph.D. in economics from M.I.T., testified that ``market \n     power in the refining industry is becoming a serious \n     problem.''\n       Significant anecdotal evidence exists that the major oil \n     companies exercise market power in refined product markets. \n     For example, during an investigation involving gasoline \n     price spikes in the Midwest, the FTC concluded that at \n     least one firm had excess supplies--and capacity to \n     produce even more--but had limited the amount that it sold \n     in order to keep prices high. My amendment would address \n     some of this conduct by clarifying that it is unlawful for \n     oil and gas companies to divert, export or refuse to sell \n     existing supplies with the intention of raising prices or \n     creating a shortage.\n       Increased concentration not only conveys market power, it \n     makes conspiracy easier. At the hearings conducted by the \n     Judiciary Committee, David Boies, the antitrust litigator \n     that prosecuted Microsoft for the Justice Department, \n     testified about evidence that British Petroleum and Exxon \n     have conspired to limit the supply of Alaskan natural gas \n     that is sold. Boies testified that Exxon and British \n     Petroleum had ``decided between themselves that they would \n     prefer to withhold this gas and maintain artificially high \n     natural gas prices throughout the U.S.''\n       Current antitrust laws prohibit such conduct, but collusion \n     is not always so straightforward. Simply put, if there are \n     few enough competitors in a market, each competitor knows \n     that if it lowers its prices, other competitors will notice \n     and lower theirs. As a result, a competitor does not have the \n     normal incentive to sell more by lowering its prices. Such \n     conduct frequently results when competitors can easily share \n     information with each other. In other words, actual \n     conspiracy may not be needed. As Tom Greene, the Senior \n     Assistant Attorney General for California testified, ``[T]he \n     more concentrated the industry, the less explicit the \n     communications that are required to organize prices and limit \n     production.''\n       U.S. oil companies appear to have several mechanisms by \n     which they are able to share market information. The \n     Judiciary Committee came to no conclusions as to whether the \n     sharing of information among U.S. oil companies is truly a \n     problem, so my amendment directs the Federal Trade Commission \n     to study the Issue.\n\n[[Page S8444]]\n\n       As I have said, my amendment will help ensure that the oil \n     and gas industry is responding to the forces of supply and \n     demand, not market manipulation. I understand that we are not \n     able to vote on amendments to S. 3711, but I urge my \n     colleagues to suppose the Oil and Gas Industry Antitrust Act \n     of 2006 at such time as it receives a vote.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, I rise because this week is going to be \nenormously important for the American people and also enormously \nimportant in terms of deciding what kind of country we are. Over the \nperiod of these last 4 months, I have had the opportunity, the \nresponsibility given by the Senate, to serve on the pension conference \nwith a number of our colleagues on our side, and a number of our \ncolleagues on the other side. That conference was chaired by our friend \nand the chairman of our human resource committee, Senator Enzi. He did \na splendid job.\n  It took 4\\1/2\\ months to effectively wind up that conference. There \nare certainly provisions that are included in the conference that I \nwould not have included. We were meeting as late as 1 o'clock in the \nmorning last Thursday night in order to conclude the conference itself.\n  As would happen in a situation like that, I think there were gaps in \nthe final recommendations which I wish we had addressed, but we will \nhave an opportunity to deal with those issues later this week. It will \nbe enormously important.\n  I am in strong support of the pensions legislation. But, also, later \nthis week we are going to consider legislation that is coming over from \nthe House of Representatives on the estate tax. Attached to that estate \ntax--it is not a new issue for this body--attached in the House of \nRepresentatives has been an increase in the minimum wage, with which I \nhave been involved over a long period of time. Actually, since I came \nto the Senate, I have been involved in increasing the minimum wage, \nchampioning that with many others. Years ago we had Republicans and \nDemocrats who supported the increase in the minimum wage. Now \nunfortunately--fortunately, in the last vote that we had on the minimum \nwage, we did have eight Republicans who supported it. We have a clear \nmajority in the Senate for an increase in the minimum wage.\n  The American people overwhelmingly support an increase in the minimum \nwage. It has not been increased in the last 9 years and over a \ncorresponding period of time we here in the Senate have increased our \nown pay more than $30,000. We increased our own pay more than $30,000 \nduring that same period of time, but the Senate has refused to address \nan increase in the minimum wage for the American workers who are at the \nlowest rung of the economic ladder.\n  Most Americans believe a job ought to get you out of poverty. But \nthose on the other side believe if you have a minimum wage job, you \nought to remain in poverty. That is a very big, very major difference.\n  What we have seen across the country, however, is sort of a wildfire \nof support for increases in the minimum wage. We have had a number of \nStates that have offered the minimum wage increase on the State \nballots. We have seen increases in Florida, increases in Nevada. In \nmore recent times we have seen increases in Arkansas, the home of Wal-\nMart, and increases in North Carolina. The campaigns for increases in \nthe minimum wage are alive and well in many different States across the \ncountry, and they are going to be successful in a number of States. It \nreminds us how the American people feel. They feel we should have an \nincrease in the minimum wage.\n  What has happened now is our Republican leadership in the House of \nRepresentatives has added an increase in the minimum wage to an estate \ntax cut for the wealthiest individuals in this country. That is what \nthey did, thinking if they put these together maybe those of us who \nbelieve in an increase in the minimum wage will go ahead and support \nthis because we are so committed to the rise in the minimum wage.\n  No one in this body is more committed to an increase in the minimum \nwage than am I, but I am going to fight this fraudulent--I think \narrogant--decision by the Republican leadership, disdaining, \neffectively, and dishonoring hard-working Americans by going about with \nthis gimmick of adding an increase to the minimum wage to legislation \non the estate tax.\n  If you look at who is for the increase in the minimum wage, you will \nsee only 22 percent of Americans support the repeal of the estate tax, \nand 86 percent of Americans support raising the minimum wage. Why, I \nwonder. It is fair enough to say to whom the benefits are going to go \nif we consider a piece of legislation. That is a fair enough rule. Who \nis going to benefit and who is going to lose out? If you look at the \nestate tax, you will see there will be 8,200 of the richest heirs in \nthe country. Some have called this the Paris Hilton tax giveaway; 8,200 \nof the richest heirs will receive a tax giveaway close to $1.4 million \nper estate. The total cost will be $753 billion for the first 10 years \nof full implementation, according to the Center of Budget and Policy.\n  We are talking about a very modest increase in the minimum wage, to \n$7.25. But what will happen to those individuals? As long as they are \nstill below the poverty line they are going to be eligible for a number \nof the programs that we have out there that have been built in to try \nto help and assist hard-working Americans who are being hard pressed \nbecause they don't have adequate income. What we have seen in the most \nrecent 5 years is cuts in Medicaid, cuts in food stamps, cuts in \nveterans programs, and cuts in unemployment insurance. That has been \nthe record in the past, and that will be the record in terms of the \nfuture, trying to make up for that $753 billion. These are the \nprograms, Medicaid programs that, by and large, look after children, \nlong-term care for the elderly, the Food Stamp Program--again, for \nthose who are in very serious need.\n  That is really what we are faced with. What have we seen over the \nperiod of these last few years? Let's look at what has been happening \nto our fellow Americans. We have seen an increase in the total number \nof Americans living in poverty that has increased by 5.4 million in the \nUnited States of America in the last 4 years that there has been no \nincrease in the minimum wage. What does the Republican Senate want to \nhave us do? Have another tax cut for the largest fortunes in this \ncountry.\n  What has happened in terms of children over the period of the last 4 \nyears? We have seen a dramatic increase in the number of children who \nare living in poverty. There are 1.4 million more children living in \npoverty. There has been no increase in the minimum wage.\n  The list goes on. If you look at what has happened to the purchasing \npower of the minimum wage, it has actually gone down some 21 percent. \nYet the spread between the most wealthy individuals and the most needy \nindividuals has never been more dramatic in the history of this \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S8445]]\n\n  We have an opportunity--we will have--to try to do something, \nhopefully, about an increase in the minimum wage. If it were here \nbefore the Senate, there is a majority of the Members of the Senate who \nsupport an increase in the minimum wage. But we are not given that \nopportunity. We are not given that opportunity to just vote on that \nissue and then vote separately in terms of the increase in the estate \ntax. No, no; we are not given the opportunity to do that. Republicans \nsay you have to take both or you don't get an increase in the minimum \nwage.\n  That is a contemptuous attitude--not toward those of us who are for \nthe increase but for those workers, men and women of dignity. They work \nhard, work long, work in our schools, work to look after our senior \ncitizens, work to clean the great buildings of American commerce--men \nand women of dignity, and you are saying they can't have what ought to \nbe a right in the richest country of this world: If you work hard and \nplay by the rules, you and your family should not live in poverty.\n  Oh, no. They say: No, you have it wrong over there for an increase in \nthe minimum wage, unless we are going to provide another tax benefit \nfor the most wealthy individuals in the country--then you can have an \nincrease. That is a contemptuous attitude.\n  Beyond that, what this proposal contains is an ingenious proposal, \nsuggested by the restaurant association. They say: People who work for \ntips in the restaurants, they often make $5.25 an hour. They often make \nthat in tips. So why are we required to pay them? They were able to \npersuade Republicans--this is strictly a Republican proposal--to say: \nIf they are going to receive tips, you are only required to pay $2.13 \nan hour. The rest can be made up in tips. That person still effectively \ngets the minimum wage. But the restaurant doesn't have to pay that. Do \nyou hear me? They don't have to pay the worker the $5.15 an hour.\n  A number of States said that is not fair; that is not really fair. We \nhave, now, seven States that say to the restaurants: You have to pay \nthe full tally. It says minimum wage of $5.15 an hour, you have to pay \nthe $5.15 an hour. The States have said it. Seven States have said \nthat. About 30 States have done somewhat in between, but seven States \nhave said: You have to pay the whole thing.\n  The Congress has said an increase in the minimum wage--a tip is a \ntip. That goes with the territory. I wonder how many Americans, when \nthey go into the restaurant and they are thinking about being served, \ntry to figure out--I wonder, should I give this person $1 or $2 because \nthey really are only getting $2.13 an hour paid by the restaurant. Of \ncourse they don't. If the service is good they give them something to \nshow their appreciation for it.\n  What have our Republican friends said? We don't like the fact that \nStates have made that judgment, that decision. We know more than the \nseven States that said you have to pay the full fare. We in the Senate \nof the United States are saying you don't know what is necessary in \nyour State, about paying an adequate sum to those workers. So we, the \nCongress, are going to tell you, the State, and tell your workers, that \nwe, the Republicans in the Senate and the House of Representatives, are \ngoing to say we are going to tell you that you only can pay $2.13.\n  I hope we don't hear any more about the one big solution to all of \nthe problems back home. How many times do we listen to a large \nsolution, a single solution for all the problems back home? How many \ntimes do we hear: Let the States make a judgment and decision in order \nto protect their workers?\n  Here the States have made a judgment, here the States have made a \ndecision, and the Republican Party says: We know better. We know \nbetter. We know how to save our constituency a little more money, for \nthem, and a little less for the workers. A wonderful, Republican, \ningenious concept tied on to this proposal.\n  At another time, and we will have more time, we will have a chance to \nget into this in greater detail. I will just conclude.\n  I note, as I gave the figures about the number of families who are \nliving in poverty, and also the number of children in poverty, there \nhas been a different story in one of our neighboring countries. The \nsecond strongest economy in Europe is England. No. 1 is Germany, No. 2 \nis England. Their minimum wage is going to nearly $10 in October--\n$9.83. They have increased it now over the last 5 years. Do you want to \nknow something? They have taken 1.8 million children out of poverty \nwith their increase. And they have a strong economy and a more fair \neconomy.\n  But not here. Nine years, eight pay increases for Members of the \nSenate over 9 years, and we have not been willing to give an increase \nin the minimum wage. No, if you want that increase, you vote to give \nthe wealthiest individuals another bouquet, another bouquet. How \ncontemptuous can it be?\n  At another time later in this debate--I know we have limited time. \nThere are others who want to speak on the underlying bill. I look \nforward to addressing the Senate in greater detail on this issue and \nalso on the pension issue, which is going to be extremely important.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/31/senate-section/article/S8445-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SERVICES FOR ENDING LONG-TERM HOMELESSNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions--HELP--Committee, I rise to express my \nsupport for the Services for Ending Long-Term Homelessness Act, S. 709, \nas introduced by Senator Mike DeWine.\n  Many low-income housing advocates in Utah have asked me to cosponsor \nthis important legislation because it establishes a grant program, run \nby the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, \nSAMHSA, for services to end chronic homelessness. In Utah alone, there \nare approximately 1,900 chronically homeless individuals whose lives \nare in a constant state of peril because they are repeatedly homeless \nfor long periods of time. They usually have one or more disabilities, \nand often cycle between homeless shelters, the streets, mental health \nfacilities, emergency rooms, hospitals, and jails. The public cost for \ntheir continued care is extremely high, and their medical outcomes are \ngenerally very poor.\n  I believe that ending chronic homelessness requires housing with \nsupportive services, and policies which prevent high-risk individuals \nfrom returning to the streets. Based on several estimates, including an \nestimate published in the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental \nHealth Report, it will take approximately 150,000 units of supportive \nhousing and over 10 years to end long-term homelessness. S. 709 would \nauthorize funding for a flexible array of services in permanent \nsupportive housing, focused on helping people move toward recovery and \nself sufficiency.\n  Although I support the bill and its intent, I am very concerned about \nits cost. Throughout my Senate career, I have fought hard for fiscal \ndiscipline. Although the cost of the bill has not been estimated by the \nCongressional Budget Office, everyone agrees that the issues and \nassociated costs are complex.\n  S. 709 provides accountability, has mechanisms for controlling costs, \nand mechanisms for maximizing cost savings. For example, the bill \nprioritizes accountability and cost control through a required \ncompetitive process. In an effort to save on overall public spending, \nthe bill gives priority to applicants who serve individuals who have \nproven to be more expensive to the public health system and to law \nenforcement. Additionally, S. 709 requires that the grantee match the \nFederal funds received, and the match requirement increases over time. \nIt is important to note that the amount of funding an applicant \nreceives cannot rise above the rate of inflation. Finally, the bill \nensures accountability by requiring grantees to report on their \nperformance. This effort is to ensure that chronic homelessness is \nbeing reduced, thus reducing costly mental health and substance abuse \nproblems, and increasing education and employment.\n  Mr. President, I support strongly the goals of this bill and I \nbelieve our continued economic expansion and improving Federal budget \nwill enable us to fully implement the objectives of this bill and end \nhomelessness in this country forever.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/31/senate-section/article/S8446-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8446]]\n                      IRAQ RECONSTRUCTION FAILURES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we learned this past week of the latest \nexample of the colossal waste, fraud and abuse in the administration's \nreconstruction program in Iraq.\n  Documented in the Special Inspector General's report released last \nFriday is the fiasco of the Basra Children's Hospital, yet another \ncasualty on the long list of U.S.-financed infrastructure projects in \nIraq to face cost overruns, mismanagement, delays and potential \ncancellation.\n  Back in 2003, Congress allocated $50 million for the construction of \na 94-bed state-of-the-art children's cancer treatment hospital in \nsouthern Iraq. Despite repeated calls from humanitarian organizations \nand experts at the United States Agency for International Development \nto instead work with the Iraqis to rebuild their primary health system, \nthe Bush administration promoted this high-profile, glitzy project \nchampioned by the White House.\n  Nearly 3 years later, due to gross mismanagement, the hospital is \nonly 35 percent complete, out of money and teetering on the verge of \ncollapse. The cost overruns are so significant that the project will \ncost between $120 and $160 million to complete and is not expected to \nbe finished until December 2007, over a year later than planned. \nMeanwhile, Iraqis continue to suffer from low quality and poor access \nto basic health services.\n  USAID is at fault for not properly accounting for all the costs of \nconstructing the hospital and should have consulted with Congress when \nthey knew about cost overruns and scheduling delays. But press reports \nhave ignored the fact that from the beginning, USAID wisely opposed \nthis costly, misguided infrastructure project in a dangerous and \ncorrupt environment, knowing of the likelihood that these problems \ncould arise.\n  Bechtel, the lead government contractor for the Basra Hospital \nproject and the same contractor for the flawed Boston Big Dig tunnel \nproject, has once again been dismissed from a large-scale project due \nto incompetence. Sadly, this is not the first nor is it likely to be \nthe last instance of waste, fraud and abuse in the reconstruction of \nIraq under the negligent leadership of the Bush administration.\n  The Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction \nhas been the watchdog for the billions of dollars appropriated for Iraq \nreconstruction programs and operations. The creation of the office was \ninitially opposed by the White House and by some in Congress who would \nprefer that the appalling blunders of the Iraq reconstruction program \nnot be exposed to the light of day.\n  By all accounts, the Special Inspector General has done an excellent \njob under difficult and dangerous conditions by uncovering numerous \ninstances of waste and fraud and there are dozens of investigations and \nprosecutions under way.\n  The picture provided by the Special Inspector General is in stark \ncontrast to the rhetoric coming from the administration that \nreconstruction is moving forward at a rapid pace. Thanks to the \npersistent leadership of Senator Feingold, and with support from \nSenators Warner and Levin, we were able to include a Feingold-Leahy \nAmendment to the Senate version of the fiscal year 2007 Defense \nauthorization bill to extend the life of the Special Inspector General \nfor Iraq Reconstruction and ensure continued and necessary audits of \nthe very programs the Special Inspector General was created to oversee. \nIt is crucial that this provision be retained in the final version of \nthe bill.\n  Mr. President, the tragedy of the Basra Children's Hospital project \nspeaks volumes about this administration's Iraq policy. It is a legacy \nof arrogance, squander and incompetence. Just throw money at the \nproblem and hope for the best. Use expensive American contractors \nrather than Iraqis who are unemployed or underemployed and could do the \nwork for a fraction of the cost. And then try to shut down the office \nthat exposes the waste. It is shocking, it is tragic and it is \ninexcusable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/31/senate-section/article/S8446-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8446-S8448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMERICAN LEADERSHIP\n\n  Mr. HAGEL.

Brookings has been at the center of every important \n     policy debate in this country for 90 years. Thank you to \n     Strobe Talbot, Carlos Pascual, and all the men and women of \n     Brookings for your continued contributions to our national \n     debate. I see Martin Indyk and Ken Pollack in the audience. \n     Thank you for the fine work you do with the Saban Center for \n     Middle East Policy.\n       As we recognize the 90th Anniversary of the Brookings \n     Institution, it is instructive to reflect back on the world \n     of 1916 when Brookings was born . . . then known as the \n     Institute for Government Research. In 1916, the world was in \n     a period of wrenching and bloody transition. War raged in \n     Europe. It was a war triggered by a series of tragic \n     misjudgements stemming from decades-old resentments and \n     shifting European alliances. It was a war fueled by the \n     Industrial Revolution . . . the most deadly war the world had \n     ever known. Within one year, the United States would shake-\n     off its historic isolationism and engage in its first global \n     conflict.\n       The Treaty of Versailles brought an end to the fighting, \n     but it did not bring resolution. The United States retreated \n     from a position of world leadership and back into its shell \n     of irresponsible isolationism . . . the world economy \n     collapsed, and lingering global resentments continued to \n     heighten. Roughly twenty years later, harsh post-war \n     reparations and arrogant nationalism gave rise to an even \n     deadlier period of global transition: World War II.\n       America's leaders following World War II learned from the \n     failed and dangerous polices of the first half of the 20th \n     century. After World War II, the United States became the \n     indispensable global leader. Along with our allies, we \n     created organizations of global interests and common purpose \n     like the United Nations, the General Agreement on Tariffs and \n     Trade (now the World Trade Organization), NATO, the World \n     Bank, the International Monetary Fund and dozens of other \n     multilateral institutions. Leaders like Truman, Marshall, \n     Acheson, Hull, Vandenberg and Eisenhower led in the \n     rebuilding of Europe and Japan.\n       Ninety years after the creation of the Brookings \n     Institution, we live in a different world . . . but once \n     again a world in transition. The lessons learned after World \n     War II still apply. American leadership is still \n     indispensable in the world . . . and the institutions and \n     alliances formed after World War II are as vital today as \n     when they were formed.\n       For decades, the United States used its power and influence \n     to help forge international consensus on vital issues. \n     America's leadership inspired the trust and confidence of a \n     generation of governments and nations around the world . . . \n     because we pursued common actions that reflected common \n     interests with our allies . . . because we remained committed \n     to global engagement . . . and because we exercised our power \n     with restraint. We made mistakes. It was imperfect. There \n     were differences with our allies. But despite the \n     imperfections and shortcomings, the United States and its \n     allies contributed to world stability and the spread of \n     freedom and prosperity.\n       Today, the world and America are in deep trouble. In a \n     speech before the Council on Foreign Relations last November, \n     I warned that the world's trust and confidence in America's \n     purpose has seriously eroded. America is increasingly not \n     seen as the well-spring of consensus that for decades helped \n     create alliances and coalitions grounded in common objectives \n     and common interests.\n       This is in contrast to a very troubling trend toward \n     isolationism that is emerging in America today--a trend that \n     was reflected in this week's New York Times/CBS News poll of \n     Americans about our country's role in the world. This trend \n     is a looming concern that may not be obvious but is manifest \n     across seemingly unconnected events and issues. We must avoid \n     the trap of limiting our power by allowing ourselves to \n     become isolated in the world. America must not allow itself \n     to become isolated through mindless isolationist remedies to \n     difficult and complicated problems.\n       In the 1930s, the threat of Adolph Hitler's Nazi Germany \n     was not taken seriously. Most did not recognize this threat \n     until World War II was upon them. But there was a voice \n     sounding an alarm. Throughout the 1930s, Winston Churchill \n     urged his countrymen and Europe to see the world through the \n     clear lens of reality--not through the blurred lens of \n     misplaced hope. On October 3, 1938, the House of Commons \n     debated the Munich Agreement that Prime Minister Chamberlain \n     had negotiated with Hitler. Many saw this agreement as the \n     assurance of peace with Germany. Churchill disagreed. He \n     said:\n       ``Can we blind ourselves to the great change which has \n     taken place in the military situation, and to the dangers we \n     have to meet? This is only the beginning of the reckoning. \n     This is only the first sip, the first foretaste of a bitter \n     cup which will be proffered to us year by year unless by a \n     supreme\n\n[[Page S8447]]\n\n     recovery of moral health and martial vigour, we arise again \n     and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.''\n       Today, there is no such threat to world order. Global \n     threats today are less defined than Hitler. However, the \n     challenges are more insidious, more difficult to comprehend \n     and identify, yet more interrelated, more dynamic, and more \n     dangerous. In the 21st century, we are confronted by a \n     universe of challenges, threats, and opportunities unlike any \n     that we have ever known. The margins of error for \n     miscalculation are less than ever before. Dramatic shifts in \n     security, stability and prosperity can occur in weeks or even \n     days.\n       On April 16, 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower delivered \n     a speech before the American Society of Newspaper Editors \n     that we now know as the ``Chance for Peace'' speech. In the \n     aftermath of the death and destruction of World War II and \n     the ongoing war in Korea, the world then was confronted with \n     the threat of the Soviet Union and communism. A different \n     time. A different generation. Yet, Eisenhower's words and \n     wisdom still ring true today. He said,\n       ``No nation's security and well-being can be lastingly \n     achieved in isolation but only in effective cooperation with \n     fellow-nations.''\n       Just as Eisenhower said in 1953, America's security, \n     prosperity and freedom cannot be separated from the dangers, \n     challenges, and opportunities abroad. There are no national \n     boundaries from terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction, pandemic disease, environmental degradation, and \n     despair. No nation, unilaterally, possesses the power to \n     defeat the threats of the 21st century. A global society \n     underpinned by a global economy is our world today. The \n     world's problems and dangers are interconnected. Nowhere are \n     these realities clearer than in the Middle East.\n       The Middle East is a region in crisis. A continuous and \n     escalating volley of violence has the potential for wider \n     regional and global conflict. Centuries-old religious, ethnic \n     and tribal hatreds and tensions are being manipulated by \n     Islamic extremists for their own unholy purpose. The Middle \n     East is today as combustible and complex as it has ever been. \n     More than fifty percent of the world's proven oil and natural \n     gas reserves reside in this troubled land . . . at a time \n     when the world's six and a half billion people rely on these \n     resources in an interconnected world economy. Uncertain \n     popular support for regime legitimacy continues to weaken \n     governments of the Middle East. Economic stagnation, \n     persistent unemployment, deepening despair and wider unrest \n     enhance the ability of terrorists to recruit and succeed. An \n     Iran with nuclear weapons raises the specter of broader \n     proliferation and a fundamental strategic realignment in the \n     region, creating more regional instability.\n       America's approach to the Middle East must be consistent \n     and sustained, and must understand the history, interests and \n     perspectives of our regional friends and allies.\n       The United States will remain committed to defending \n     Israel. Our relationship with Israel is a special and \n     historic one. But, it need not and cannot be at the expense \n     of our Arab and Muslim relationships. That is an \n     irresponsible and dangerous false choice. Achieving a lasting \n     resolution to the Arab-Israeli conflict is as much in \n     Israel's interest as any other country in the world.\n       Unending war will continually drain Israel of its human \n     capital, resources, and energy as it fights for its survival. \n     The United States and Israel must understand that it is not \n     in their long-term interests to allow themselves to become \n     isolated in the Middle East and the world. Neither can allow \n     themselves to drift into an ``us against the world'' global \n     optic or zero-sum game. That would marginalize America's \n     global leadership, trust and influence, further isolate \n     Israel, and prove to be disastrous for both countries as well \n     as the region.\n       It is in Israel's interest, as much as ours, that the \n     United States be seen by all states in the Middle East as \n     fair. This is the currency of trust.\n       Israel, Lebanon and the Palestinian territories have \n     experienced devastating violence in the last couple of weeks. \n     The world has rightly condemned the despicable actions of \n     Hezbollah and Hamas terrorists who attacked Israel and \n     kidnapped Israeli soldiers. Israel has the undeniable right \n     to defend itself against aggression. This is the right of all \n     states.\n       Hezbollah is a threat to Israel, to Lebanon and to all who \n     strive for lasting peace in the Middle East. This threat must \n     be dealt with, as Israel's military operations continue to \n     weaken Hezbollah's capacity for violence.\n       However, military action alone will not destroy Hezbollah \n     or Hamas. Extended military action will tear apart Lebanon, \n     destroy its economy and infrastructure, create a humanitarian \n     disaster, further weaken Lebanon's fragile democratic \n     government, strengthen popular Muslim and Arab support for \n     Hezbollah, and deepen hatred of Israel across the Middle \n     East. The pursuit of tactical military victories at the \n     expense of the core strategic objective of Arab-Israeli peace \n     is a hollow victory. The war against Hezbollah and Hamas will \n     not be won on the battlefield.\n       To achieve a strategic shift in the conditions for Middle \n     East peace, the United States must use the global \n     condemnation of terrorist acts as the basis for substantive \n     change. For a lasting and popularly supported resolution, \n     only a strong Lebanese government and army, backed by the \n     international community, can rid Lebanon of these corrosive \n     militias and terrorist organizations.\n       President Bush and Secretary Rice must become and remain \n     deeply engaged in the Middle East. Only U.S. leadership can \n     build a consensus of purpose among our regional and \n     international partners.\n       The Rome meeting of the Lebanon core group this week must \n     be the beginning of a very intensive diplomatic process--at \n     the highest levels--with the objective of ending the military \n     conflict, securing the Israel-Lebanon border, and \n     invigorating the political track. To lead and sustain U.S. \n     engagement, the President should appoint a statesman of \n     global stature, experience and ability to serve as his \n     personal envoy to the region who would report directly to him \n     and be empowered with the authority to speak and act for the \n     President. Former Secretaries of State Baker and Powell fit \n     this profile.\n       America must listen carefully to its friends and partners \n     in the region. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and others--\n     countries that understand the Middle East far better than \n     we do--must commit to help resolve today's crisis and be \n     active partners in helping build a mechanism to move \n     toward realizing the already agreed-upon two-state \n     solution.\n       A robust international force deployed along the Israel-\n     Lebanon border will be required to facilitate a steady \n     deployment of a strengthened Lebanese Army into southern \n     Lebanon to eventually assume responsibility for security and \n     the rule of law. The UN Security Council should negotiate a \n     new binding resolution that strengthens its demands to disarm \n     militias and to remove Syrian influence from Lebanon that \n     were made in UN Security Council Resolution 1559, and commits \n     the international community to help Lebanon re-build its \n     country.\n       The core of all challenges in the Middle East remains the \n     underlying Arab-Israeli conflict. The failure to address this \n     root cause will allow Hezbollah, Hamas and other terrorists \n     to continue to sustain popular Muslim and Arab support, \n     continuing to undermine America's standing in the region, and \n     the governments of Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and others--\n     whose support is critical for any Middle East resolution.\n       The United States should engage our Middle East and \n     international partners to revive the Beirut Declaration, or \n     some version of it, proposed by King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia \n     and adopted unanimously by the Arab League in March 2002. In \n     this historic initiative, the Arab world recognized Israel's \n     right to exist and sought to establish a path toward a two-\n     state solution and broader Arab-Israeli peace. Even though \n     Israel could not accept it as written, it represented a very \n     significant ``starting point'' document initiated by Arab \n     countries. Today, we need a new Beirut Declaration-type \n     initiative. We squandered the last one.\n       The concept and intent of the 2002 Beirut Declaration is as \n     relevant today as it was in 2002. An Arab-initiated Beirut-\n     type declaration would re-invest regional Arab states with a \n     stake in achieving progress toward Israeli-Palestinian peace. \n     This type of initiative would offer a positive alternative \n     vision for Arab populations to the ideology and goals of \n     Islamic militants. The United States must explore this \n     approach as part of its diplomatic engagement in the Middle \n     East.\n       Lasting peace in the Middle East, and stability and \n     security for Israel will come only from a regionally-oriented \n     political settlement.\n       Former American Middle East Envoy Dennis Ross once observed \n     that in the Middle East a process is necessary because \n     process absorbs events . . . without a process, events become \n     crises. He was right. Look at where we are today in the \n     Middle East with no process. Crisis diplomacy is no \n     substitute for sustained, day-to-day engagement.\n       America's approach to Syria and Iran is inextricably tied \n     to Middle East peace. Whether or not they were directly \n     involved in the latest Hezbollah and Hamas aggression in \n     Israel, both countries exert influence in the region in ways \n     that undermine stability and security. As we work with our \n     friends and allies to deny Syria and Iran any opportunity to \n     further corrode the situation in Lebanon and the Palestinian \n     territories, both Damascus and Tehran must hear from America \n     directly.\n       As John McLaughlin, the former Deputy Director of Central \n     Intelligence recently wrote in the Washington Post,\n       ``Even superpowers have to talk to bad guys. The absence of \n     a diplomatic relationship with Iran and the deterioration of \n     the one with Syria--two countries that bear enormous \n     responsibility for the current crisis--leave the United \n     States with fewer options and levers than might otherwise \n     have been the case. Distasteful as it might have been to have \n     or to maintain open and normal relations with such states, \n     the absence of such relations ensures that we will have more \n     blind spots than we can afford and that we will have to deal \n     through surrogates on issues of vital importance to the \n     United States. We will have to get over the notion that \n     talking to bad guys somehow rewards them or is a sign of \n     weakness. As a superpower, we ought to be able to communicate \n     in a way that signals our strength and self-confidence.''\n       Ultimately, the United States will need to engage Iran and \n     Syria with an agenda open to all areas of agreement and \n     disagreement. For this dialogue to have any meaning or \n     possible lasting relevance, it should encompass the full \n     agenda of issues.\n\n[[Page S8448]]\n\n       There is very little good news coming out of Iraq today. \n     Increasingly vicious sectarian violence continues to propel \n     Iraq toward civil war. The U.S. announcement this week to \n     send additional U.S. troops and military police back into \n     Baghdad reverses last month's decision to have Iraqi \n     forces take the lead in Baghdad . . . and represents a \n     dramatic set back for the U.S and the Iraqi Government. \n     The Iraqi Government has limited ability to enforce the \n     rule of law in Iraq, especially in Baghdad. Green Zone \n     politics appear to have little bearing or relation to the \n     realities of the rest of Iraq.\n       The Iraqis will continue to face difficult choices over the \n     future of their country. The day-to-day responsibilities of \n     governing and security will soon have to be assumed by \n     Iraqis. As I said in November, this is not about setting a \n     timeline. This is about understanding the implications of the \n     forces of reality. This reality is being determined by \n     Iraqis--not Americans. America is bogged down in Iraq and \n     this is limiting our diplomatic and military options. The \n     longer America remains in Iraq in its current capacity, the \n     deeper the damage to our force structure--particularly the \n     U.S. Army. And it will continue to place more limitations on \n     an already dangerously over-extended force structure that \n     will further limit our options and public support.\n       The Cold War, while dangerous, created a fairly stable and \n     mostly predictable world order. That is no longer the case \n     today. The challenges of the 21st century will be more \n     complex and represent a world of greater degrees of nuance, \n     uncertainty and uncontrollables than those of the last 60 \n     years. America's policy choices will be more complicated than \n     ever before.\n       We must be clear in our principles and interests, with \n     friends and foes alike. But framing the world in \n     ``absolutes'' constrains our ability to build coalitions and \n     alliances, alienates our friends and partners, and results in \n     our own isolation. No country will view its interests as \n     coinciding exactly with ours; nor will countries simply \n     subsume their national interests to maintain relations with \n     America. U.S. policies that are premised on such assumptions \n     will be flawed, with little likelihood for success, and \n     ultimately work against our national interests.\n       In pursuing our objectives, America must always be mindful \n     of the risks of sudden change and the dangers of unintended \n     consequences. Rarely will America succeed if its actions seek \n     to impose its objectives on others, or achieve change and \n     reform through power alone. America is always strongest when \n     it acts in concert with friends and allies. This approach has \n     enhanced our power and magnified our influence. The Middle \n     East and other regions of the world have been left behind and \n     not experienced the political and economic reform that many \n     other regions have enjoyed in the last 60 years.\n       The Middle East crisis represents a moment of great danger, \n     but it is also an opportunity. Crisis focuses the minds of \n     leaders and the attention of nations. The Middle East need \n     not be a region forever captive to the fire of war and \n     historical hatred. It will and can avoid this fate if the \n     United States pursues sustained and engaged leadership worthy \n     of our history, purpose, and power. America cannot fix every \n     problem in the world--nor should it try. But we must get the \n     big issues and important relationships right and concentrate \n     on those. We know that without engaged and active American \n     leadership the world is more dangerous.\n       When President Franklin Delano Roosevelt delivered his \n     State of the Union Address on January 6, 1945, he counseled \n     the United States and the world to look beyond the immediate \n     horror of war to the challenges and opportunities that lay \n     ahead. Roosevelt understood the requirements of U.S. \n     leadership and the essence of alliances and partnerships. He \n     said:\n       ``We must not let those differences divide us and blind us \n     to our more important common and continuing interests in \n     winning the war and building the peace. International \n     cooperation on which enduring peace must be based is not a \n     one-way street. Nations like individuals do not always see \n     alike or think alike, and international cooperation and \n     progress are not helped by any nation assuming that it has a \n     monopoly of wisdom or of virtue.''\n       Over the last 60 years since Roosevelt's remarks, the \n     United States has been a force for peace and prosperity in \n     the world. Decades of investment in geopolitical security, \n     economic stability, political freedom, innovation and \n     productivity have resulted in a 21st century of both \n     cooperation and competition. This is a defining time for 21 \n     st Century American leadership. With enlightened American \n     leadership this century offers the world the prospects of \n     unprecedented global peace, prosperity and security . . . \n     ifwe are wise enough to sense the moment, engage the world \n     and share a nobility of purpose with all mankind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/31/senate-section/article/S8448-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, recently the Senate approved the fiscal \nyear 2007 Homeland Security appropriations bill. As a member of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee, I voted in favor of this measure.\n  The bill allocates a total of $32.8 billion in discretionary spending \nfor the Department of Homeland Security. This funding will increase the \ncurrent number of detention beds and Border Patrol agents, and during \nfloor consideration, the Senate supported additional funding for border \ninfrastructure upgrades and port security.\n  While this funding will help secure our borders and protect our \nhomeland, President Bush's continued insistence on maintaining tax \nbreaks for the extremely wealthy has made it incredibly difficult to \nfund important first responder grant programs.\n  The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program provides critical \nfunding to our local fire departments for training, equipment, and \nfacility improvements. In his fiscal year 2007 budget request, \nPresident Bush recommended only $293 million for this important \nprogram--a dramatic reduction from the previous fiscal year's funding \nlevel of $545 million. If this request had been enacted, it would have \nundermined the efforts of local fire departments in meeting their \ntraining and equipment needs.\n  As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I was pleased the \ncommittee provided $680 million for firefighter assistance grants, of \nwhich $127.5 million will be allocated for the Staffing for Adequate \nFire and Emergency Response Firefighters, SAFER, Act grant program. \nThese grants help communities hire firefighters, and in turn, local \ngovernments are responsible for providing funds to match a portion of \neach grant. Regrettably, President Bush requested no funding for this \nimportant program. As a result, the money appropriated by the Senate \nwill go a long way toward helping our first responders.\n  Finally, first responders also rely upon the Emergency Management \nPerformance Grant Program. This program provides funding to State and \nlocal governments for all-hazards emergency management including \nnatural disasters, accidents, or terrorist threats. Unfortunately, the \nPresident requested only $170 million for this program in his fiscal \nyear 2007 budget proposal--$15 million less than what Congress \nappropriated the previous year. As a member of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, we restored this important funding and \nrecommended $205 million for this program.\n  In a post-September 11 world, we must make homeland security one of \nour top priorities. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, \nI will continue my efforts to ensure that our first responders have the \nresources and tools necessary to respond to threats against our \nhomeland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/31/senate-section/article/S8448-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8448-S8449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       RETIREMENT OF GLORIA TOSI\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Gloria \nCataneo Tosi, president of the American Maritime Congress, on her \nupcoming retirement. The American Maritime Congress is a research and \neducational organization in Washington, DC, whose membership comprises \nship owners and operators having U.S.-flag vessels in both the domestic \nand international trades. All of the American Maritime Congress's \nmember companies have labor agreements with the Marine Engineers \nBeneficial Association.\n  Mrs. Tosi has been with the American Maritime Congress since 1981 and \nhas served as its chief executive officer for the past 15 years. She is \na well-known maritime advocate in the Washington, DC community, \nincluding the Propeller Club of the United States. In particular, she \noften plays a lead industry role on issues affecting the operation of, \nand cargo opportunities for, U.S.-flag shipping.\n  While many people think of the U.S. maritime industry as only a \ncommercial interest, it is actually a vital element of our Nation's \ndefense. The Department of Defense could not execute its military \nstrategies and deploy its forces worldwide without the help of U.S. \nshipyards, ports, shipping lines, and maritime workers. As president of \nthe American Maritime Congress, Mrs. Tosi worked closely with the \nNational Defense Transportation Association to ensure the maritime \nindustry remained aligned with the Department of Defense's \nrequirements.\n  Mrs. Tosi is a native of Baltimore, MD, whose family was active in \nthe maritime industry. She came to Washington, DC, in 1969 to join the \nstaff of\n\n[[Page S8449]]\n\nHelen Delich Bentley, who had been named by President Nixon to chair \nthe Federal Maritime Commission. I served with Helen in the House of \nRepresentatives and know her to be an ardent supporter of the U.S. \nMerchant Marine and the Port of Baltimore. Mrs. Tosi remained at the \nFederal Maritime Commission for nearly 6 years, which means she gained \ninvaluable experience and insight into the maritime industry at the \nnational level. Upon leaving the Federal Maritime Commission, Mrs. Tosi \nwas employed by the International Longshoremen's Association as the \nunion's director of governmental affairs from 1976-1981. In 1981, she \njoined her current organization as its legislative and corporate \naffairs director. In time, her expertise and leadership qualities were \nrecognized and she was selected to be the organization's president. \nThis marks her 25th year with the American Maritime Congress.\n  I have known Gloria for many years. There has not been a significant \npiece of maritime legislation that has been considered by the Congress \nduring the past dozen or so years that has not benefitted from her \ncounsel. From the Maritime Security Act of 1995, to the Ocean Shipping \nReform Act of 1998, to the Maritime Security Act of 2003, and including \nmany provisions included in other laws, she helped ensure that the U.S. \nmaritime industry's concerns were addressed. Equally important, she \nensured that the industry's concerns were understood when legislation \nwas proposed that would have had a negative impact on the industry.\n  Gloria is trusted as an honest voice for all of America's maritime \nworld. She has devoted her professional life to enhancing the American \nfleet, improving its business opportunities, and establishing a better \nregulatory regime under which to operate the fleet.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a \ncommunity in North Dakota that recently celebrated its 125th \nanniversary. On July 14-16, the residents of Grandin gathered to \ncelebrate their community's history and founding.\n  Grandin, set in the fertile Red River Valley, is a thriving community \nin southeastern North Dakota. Grandin was also home to American painter \nand artist, Clyfford Still. Still, who used rich, vibrant colors and \nimagery, is just one of the many great talents that the small \ncommunities of rural America have produced to enrich our culture.\n  The citizens of Grandin take pride in their quiet and comfortable \ncommunity that still welcomes guests with a friendly smile and wave. \nGrandin had an exciting anniversary that included an all-school \nreunion, parade, tractor pull, dinner, and street dance.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join in me congratulating Grandin, \nND, and its residents on their first 125 years and wishing them well \nthrough the next century. By honoring Grandin and all the other \nhistoric small towns of North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering \nfrontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places such as \nGrandin that have helped to shape this country into what it is today, \nwhich is why this fine community is deserving of our recognition.\n  Grandin has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/31/senate-section/article/S8449-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING BILL HANCOCK\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the memory and \nwork of Mr. Bill Hancock, a constituent of mine who led a most selfless \nand compassionate life. Several weeks ago, Bill lost his long struggle \nwith AIDS. The story of his life demonstrates just how much progress we \nhave made in our efforts to stem the tide of this disease, and how much \nwork remains to be done before we find a cure.\n  Bill led a very rich and full life--one that should fill his family \nand friends with a sense of overwhelming pride. While he accomplished \nmuch, I am most moved by his tireless work to improve the lives of \nthose who suffered from the very illness he had. Many of us might have \ngiven up if we found ourselves in Bill's position--choosing to allow a \nset of unfortunate circumstances to stagnate our lives. Instead, Bill \nfully realized his life's purpose through his sincere dedication to \nsupporting and advancing the needs of the HIV/AIDS community.\n  Since the early days of the AIDS epidemic, Bill was involved in \nbuilding the grassroots momentum needed to generate a national response \nto the public health crisis that was emerging in many of America's \ncities. His own health problems led him to Our House of Portland for \nhospice care and with the support he received there, he was able to \nbegin to manage the symptoms of his illness. Amazingly, he was the very \nfirst resident of Our House to leave alive. I believe this is a clear \ntestament to the tenacity of Bill's character.\n  Shortly after leaving Our House, Bill returned--not as a patient but \nas a member of its fundraising board and as a personal care assistant. \nHis compassion prompted him to reciprocate the care he was provided by \nbecoming a caregiver himself. His involvement in HIV/AIDS advocacy only \ngrew from that point. He became the chair of the Multnomah County \nCommunity Health Council and the Citizen's Advisory Board to the local \nhealth department. He also served on Multnomah County's Citizen's \nBudget Advisory Committee and the board of the Tri-County Safety Net \nEnterprise.\n  In addition to his service in local government, Bill represented the \nneeds of those living with HIV/AIDS as public policy coordinator for \nthe Cascade AIDS Project. Cascade AIDS is Oregon's leading provider of \ncommunity-based medical and social services, offering access to health \ncare, temporary housing, career assistance, and education and \nprevention programs. My staff had the pleasure of working closely with \nBill to more effectively coordinate State and Federal resources aimed \nat supporting individuals with HIV/AIDS. He truly served the members of \nOregon's HIV/AIDS community with dignity and compassion.\n  On marking the occasion of Bill Hancock's passing, I can't help but \nask myself what more we as public servants can do to prevent the \nuntimely death of individuals living with HIV/AIDS. The Federal \nGovernment has made great progress in the battle against this horrific \nepidemic, but there is much more we can do. It is essential that we \nmove forward with reauthorizing the Ryan White CARE Act and \nappropriately funding the medical and social support programs that help \nindividuals lead more full and productive lives. It would be a \ntestament to Bill's life's work and dedication if we could do our part \nto help address the medical and social needs of the HIV/AIDS community. \nBill never gave up, and neither should we.\n  In closing, I would like to offer my condolences to the family, \nfriends, and fellow advocates whom Bill touched with his compassion and \nlove of life. They have much to be proud of, and I hope their memories \nwill be filled with the many great accomplishments he achieved as a \ndedicated community servant.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/31/senate-section/article/S8449-3", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under authority of the order of the Senate of July 28, 2006, the \nSecretary of the Senate, on July 31, 2006, received a message from the \nHouse of Representatives announcing that the House has passed the \nfollowing bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 4.

A bill to designate Lebanon under section 244(b) of the \nImmigration and Naturalization Act to permit nationals of Lebanon to be \ngranted temporary protected status in the United States; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Lebanese \nTemporary Protected Status Act of 2006.\n  I thank Senator John Sununu, a Republican from New Hampshire, and \nSenator Russ Feingold, a Democrat from Wisconsin, for joining me as \noriginal cosponsors of this bipartisan legislation.\n  I come to the floor today with a heavy heart. The attacks by the \nterrorist organization Hezbollah against the State of Israel have led \nto ongoing hostilities in the Middle East. The hostilities have already \ncost many innocent Israeli and Lebanese lives, but yesterday was a \nparticularly tragic day. This morning, as I woke up in Springfield, IL, \nand pulled up the local newspapers. There on the front page of the \nChicago Tribune was a heartbreaking photograph of a Lebanese aid worker \ncarrying the lifeless body of a child out of the rubble from the events \nof yesterday. Over 50 innocent Lebanese civilians, including dozens of \nchildren, perished in the southern Lebanese town of Qana.\n  I join my colleagues and all Americans in offering my heartfelt \ncondolences to Prime Minister Siniora and to the people of Lebanon on \nthe loss of these innocent lives. The victims and their families are in \nour thoughts and prayers.\n  Lives have been lost on both sides of the border, but we know it is \nparticularly dangerous at this moment in Lebanon.\n  In reflecting on the deaths of hundreds of innocent civilians in \nrecent weeks, Lebanese Prime Minister Fuad Siniora asked:\n\n       Is the value of human life less in Lebanon than that of \n     citizens elsewhere? Are we children of a lesser God?\n\n  The Lebanese people are not children of a lesser God. We are all \nchildren of the same God and we are all equal in God's eyes. \nChristians, Jews, and Muslims--we are all children of Abraham. We mourn \nthe loss of every innocent life lost in the Israeli-Arab conflict, \nwhether Israeli, Palestinian, or Lebanese.\n  Enacting the Lebanese Temporary Protected Status Act of 2006 is a \nmodest, but important, step that will help alleviate the suffering of \ninnocent Lebanese people. This legislation would make Lebanese \nnationals who are currently residing in the United States eligible for \ntemporary protected status for an initial 12-month period.\n  Temporary protected status allows nationals of another country who \nare visiting the United States to remain here temporarily if returning \nto their country would pose a serious threat to their personal safety. \nTragically, Lebanon faces just such a situation today.\n\n[[Page S8454]]\n\n  There is an ongoing urgent humanitarian crisis in Lebanon. The United \nNations estimates that 700,000 people have been displaced from their \nhomes, almost 20 percent of the population of that nation. According to \nCatholic Relief Services:\n\n       Many of those who have been displaced have taken refuge in \n     mosques, churches and schools. The stocks of basic food and \n     relief items, including much needed medicines, are dwindling.\n\n  The U.N. said:\n\n       There has been widespread damage to infrastructure with \n     hospitals, schools, roads, bridges, fuel storage depots, \n     airports and seaports sustaining damage. This, of course, has \n     severe implications on the ability to deliver humanitarian \n     assistance to those most in need. In addition, prices of even \n     basic necessities have skyrocketed.\n\n  U.N. emergency relief coordinator Jan Egeland has called the crisis, \n``The hour of greatest need for the Lebanese people.''\n  Think of the images of thousands of frightened Americans trying \ndesperately to escape the violence in Lebanon. Thankfully, many who \nhave sought to escape have managed to do so. Unfortunately, unknown \nnumbers of Americans still remain trapped.\n  Many Americans traveled to Lebanon this summer to spend time with \nrelatives. This bipartisan bill would assist Lebanese who have traveled \nto the United States for similar reasons. They might have come here to \nvisit family, to study, or to work. Now they face the prospect of being \ntold they must return to this war zone. If conditions in Lebanon are so \nunsafe that we were forced to evacuate American citizens, innocent \nLebanese who are visiting in the United States should be permitted to \nremain here until conditions in Lebanon improve.\n  Granting temporary protected status to Lebanese nationals who are \ncurrently in the United States is consistent with America's national \ninterest.\n  At this delicate moment in relations between the United States and \nthe Middle East, giving temporary protected status to Lebanon will send \na positive signal about United States concern for the suffering of \ninnocent Lebanese civilians.\n  Granting temporary protected status would also assist the fragile \nLebanese Government by delaying the return of thousands of people who \nmight be unable to return to their homes and would find themselves \narriving back in their country only to become refugees.\n  The efforts of Prime Minister Siniora and millions of other Lebanese \nto build a sovereign and democratic Lebanon deserve the respect and \ncontinued support of the United States. Granting temporary protected \nstatus to Lebanese citizens now in the United States would take the \npressure off their Government as it struggles to meet its many new \nchallenges.\n  This would not be the first time we have done this. The United States \nextended temporary protected status to the people of Lebanon from March \n1991 to March 1993. Before Congress created temporary protected status \nin 1990, we granted something called extended voluntary departure to \nprovide blanket relief from deportation to Lebanese nationals during \nthe height of the Lebanese civil war.\n  Granting this type of relief will not endanger our security. The \nGovernment can deny or withdraw temporary protected status from any \nindividual who might do harm to our Nation. Individuals convicted of \nserious crimes who are a threat to national security, such as suspected \nmembers of Hezbollah, are automatically ineligible for this status. The \nDepartment of Homeland Security may withdraw temporary protected status \nany time it finds an individual poses any threat to our country. So it \nisn't a blank check.\n  Nor is temporary protected status a backdoor to U.S. citizenship. \nAliens who are granted this status are not eligible to become legal \npermanent residents in this country.\n  Granting this temporary protected status to Lebanon is consistent \nwith American values. The people of Lebanon face a grave humanitarian \ncrisis and we have a tradition in this country of providing safe haven \nto people in such circumstances.\n  We must all work to a resolution to the current hostilities that \ncreates lasting peace and security for both Israel and for Lebanon. In \nthe meantime, let us provide a safe haven to Lebanese who are already \nwithin the United States while we strive for these larger goals.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Lebanese Temporary Protected \nStatus Act of 2006.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3765\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

An alien returning to the \n     United States in accordance with such an authorization shall \n     be given the same treatment as any other returning alien \n     provided temporary protected status under section 244 of such \n     Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/31/senate-section/article/S8454-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8454-S8455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 545--RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF WILL \n                             KEITH KELLOGG\n\n  Ms. STABENOW (herself, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Chambliss, and Mr. Levin) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the committee \non the Judiciary:\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.
