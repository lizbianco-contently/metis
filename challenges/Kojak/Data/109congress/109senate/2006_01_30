The Senate is available for morning \nbusiness.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, last Thursday I submitted a statement \nexpressing my concerns with the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to the \nUnited States Supreme Court.\n  I am here today to reiterate these concerns as we move toward a final \nvote on this nomination.\n  There is no higher legal body in the United States than the Supreme \nCourt. It is the final authority on the meaning of laws and the \nConstitution.\n  A Supreme Court Justice could serve for the life of the nominee, so \nthe consequences of confirming a Supreme Court Justice can span \ndecades.\n  The confirmation of a Supreme Court Justice is one of the most \nimportant votes a Senator will take.\n  With that in mind, after careful consideration, I have concluded I \ncannot support Judge Alito's nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  My first step in evaluating a nominee is to consider whether he or \nshe is appropriately qualified and capable of handling the \nresponsibilities of a Justice.\n  Looking over Judge Alito's qualifications, it is clear this minimum \nstandard has been met. However, there are additional factors in \nconsidering a judicial nominee.\n  One such factor is the judicial philosophy of the nominee. Many of my \ncolleagues argue this should have no part in the Senate's \ndeliberations.\n  However, if judicial philosophy helps determine who the President \nchooses, the Senate should also be allowed to consider this factor when \ndeciding whether to approve or disapprove the nominee.\n  This information is critical to retain the balance of power that the \nFramers of our Constitution envisioned.\n  In addition to the individual's judicial philosophy, we must also \nconsider the cumulative effect that approving a nominee will have on \nthe Supreme Court.\n\n[[Page S260]]\n\n  In the recent past, Republican Presidents have made 15 of the last 17 \nnominations to the Supreme Court.\n  The Republican stamp on the current Court is undeniable, and clearly \nthe prospects of the Court becoming more moderate in the near future \nare unlikely.\n  Upon this backdrop, I have evaluated the decisions and writings of \nJudge Alito, closely watched the nomination hearing in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, and listened to the statements of many colleagues \non his nomination.\n  I have come away from this review with a number of concerns.\n  First, Judge Alito did not provide complete answers on many important \ntopics the way now Chief Justice Roberts did during his nomination \nhearing. These included many critical issues such as: Is Roe settled \nlaw? What are the limits of the executive branch's power?\n  Second, Judge Alito failed to distance himself from the radical views \nhe expressed in his earlier writings on the supremacy of executive \npower.\n  Third, Judge Alito's record includes troubling decisions on vital \nissues such as search and seizure, reproductive rights, the power of \nCongress, civil rights, and affirmative action.\n  Because of these facts, I have concluded that the addition of Judge \nAlito to the Supreme Court would unacceptably shift the balance of the \nCourt on many critical questions facing our county, such as:\n  Are there limits on the power of the presidency?\n  Can the Congress regulate the activities of the states?\n  How expansive is the right to privacy?\n  What deference should be given to legislative acts of the Congress?\n  How the Court addresses these questions goes to the heart of what we \nstand for as a country, which is why this nomination is so important.\n  While many of my colleagues will disagree with my assessment of Judge \nAlito, this will be a lifetime appointment and a lifetime is too long \nto be wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/30/senate-section/article/S260-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S260-S318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF SAMUEL A.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session and resume consideration of \nCalendar No. 490, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Samuel A. \nAlito, Jr., of New Jersey, to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme \nCourt of the United States.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nfrom 10 to 11 shall be under the control of the Democratic side.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today at 4:30, Members of this body will \nbe casting an extremely important vote, the implications of which are \ngoing to be felt not only in the next several months but for a great \nnumber of years, not only for this generation but for the next \ngeneration and the following. It is on a nomination for the Supreme \nCourt of the United States and whether we are going to move ahead and \nhave a final vote tomorrow.\n  There is nothing more important than the votes we cast on nominations \nto the Supreme Court, except sending young Americans to war. The \nimplications of this vote are far reaching. As one who has followed the \ncourts of this country as they moved us to a fairer and more just \nnation, this nomination has enormous consequences and importance. I \ndoubt if we will cast another such vote, unless it would be for a \nSupreme Court nominee, any time in the near future.\n  I remember the beginning of the great march towards progress this \nNation made with the Fifth Circuit in the 1950s, the great heroes, \nJudge Wisdom, Judge Tuttle, Judge Johnson, and many others who awakened \nthe Nation to its greatness in terms of having America be America by \nknocking down walls of discrimination and prejudice. Our Founding \nFathers didn't get it right on that as we know. They effectively wrote \nslavery into the Constitution. We fought a Civil War that didn't \nresolve it or solve it. Though, obviously, with President Lincoln and \nother extraordinary leaders, we began to move the process forward to \nknock down the walls of discrimination.\n  It was really as a result of the extraordinary leadership of Dr. \nKing, his allies and associates in the late 1950s, that America began \nto think about what this country was all about, recognizing the stains \nof discrimination. We had the beginning of the movement to knock down \nthe walls of discrimination in the Public Accommodation Act of 1964, \nthe Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Civil Rights Act of 1967, housing in \n1968, title XIV in 1973. In 1965, we knocked down the walls of \ndiscrimination in our immigration laws, the national origin quota \nsystem. The Asian-Pacific triangle discriminated against Asians. The \nnational origin quota system discriminated against groups of countries.\n  We have made enormous progress, not that laws themselves are going to \nsolve these problems. We had laws that were passed, supported by \nDemocrats and Republicans during this time, and we became a fairer and \nmore just nation. Still there are important areas we have to move \ntoward to complete the march. The stains of discrimination are still \nout there, not nearly as obvious as they were in the earlier part of \nthe last century, but they are still out there. They are evident. All \nof us at one time or another still see them. It is not limited to a \nregion of the Nation. It exists in my part of the country as well.\n  The question is, Are we moving forward to knock down the walls of \ndiscrimination? That has always been a pretty basic test for me in \nterms of reaching a judgment on the Supreme Court.\n  I remember the case of Tennessee v. Lane that was decided not long \nago. It involved a woman in a wheelchair, a single mom with two \nchildren, trained as a court reporter. The State was Tennessee. About \n60 percent of all the courtrooms in Tennessee for some reason are on \nthe second floor. The question involved the Americans with Disabilities \nAct. I welcomed the opportunity to work closely with my colleague from \nIowa, Senator Harkin, on that program. By the time we came to the \nfloor, we had bipartisan support for that legislation. President Bush 1 \nindicated it was the piece of legislation of which he was most proud. \nIt wasn't always easy in terms of dealing with the disabled.\n  I can remember when we had 4 million children who were kept in \nclosets rather than being able to go to school. We had bipartisanship \non the IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and we \nmade enormous progress during that time.\n  Then we had Tennessee v. Lane. The question was whether that \ncourthouse was going to make reasonable accommodations to let that \nsingle mother, who was trained as a court reporter, avoid being carried \nup a flight of stairs, avoid being carried into the ladies room, avoid \nother humiliating circumstances because of her disability, was that \ncourthouse going to have to make those reasonable accommodations.\n  Four Justices on the Supreme Court said no, no, we don't have to make \nthose accommodations. But five said yes. Sandra Day O'Connor said yes \non that and they made those accommodations. That mother was able to \ngain entrance into the courthouse and has had a successful career. She \nappeared before our committee with tears in her eyes. If that decision \nhad gone 5 to 4 the other way, all 50 States would have had to have \npassed disability rights acts--not the Americans With Disability Act, \nbut a Massachusetts disabilities act, or Connecticut, or Rhode Island. \nBut we had the Americans With Disabilities Act, so 42 million fellow \ncitizens with physical and mental disabilities are now part of the \nAmerican family today. Just as we have knocked down the walls of \ndiscrimination on race, religion, ethnicity, and gender, we have done \nso with disability. We have also made some progress in terms of gay and \nlesbian issues as well.\n  We have made this march toward progress. The question is whether we\n\n[[Page S261]]\n\nare going to have a justice who believes in that march of progress, or \nwhether we are going to have somebody who is going to be a roadblock in \nthat march toward progress. I express my opposition to Judge Alito \nbecause I think he is the wrong judge at the wrong time on the wrong \ncourt. I don't believe he is going to be part of the whole movement and \nmarch toward progress in this country. It is a delicate balance. We \nhave seen at times in American history where Executives have led the \nway in making this a fairer country and where Congress has led the way \nand, certainly, we have seen that with Executive power in terms of the \nadoption of the Medicare Programs and Medicaid. We had Presidential \nleadership for a while in the early sixties, and finally we passed \nthose. As a result, we are a fairer country. Ask our elderly people if \nwe didn't have the Medicare or the Social Security programs where we \nwould be as a nation. That is the issue.\n  I accepted the challenge of Judge Alito, who said, let's read my \ncases. I am reminded of the fact that to understand a nominee, one has \nto read their dissenting opinions. Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Robert Bork \nagreed 91 percent of the time. Isn't that extraordinary about two \nindividuals with dramatically different judicial philosophies? They \nagreed 91 percent of the time. Where you found their differences were \nin their dissents.\n  That is where I looked with regard to this nominee. That is why I \ncame to the conclusion this nominee was not going to be friendly to the \naverage worker, friendly on women's rights, friendly on the issues of \nrace, friendly on the issues of the environment, and would no doubt be \nwilling to accede to a more expansive Executive power.\n  I remember the time when the President announced the nomination of \nJudge Alito. It was in the early morning. I happened to be up in \nMassachusetts and I knew the announcement would be made. I didn't know \nJudge Alito. Certainly the representation was that there is a wide open \nkind of net that has been spread out across the country to try to find \nthe very best in our Nation who would be a good nominee. I have voted \nfor seven Republican nominees for the Supreme Court. We have had a \ngreat many of those nominees who were virtually unanimous in this \nbody--Democrats and Republicans voting together for nominees--and that \nis what I think all of us were hoping for. We had seen the fiasco that \nhad taken place with Harriet Miers. We saw groups in this country that \nwere prepared to exercise a veto. We have seen groups in our Nation \nthat were prepared to exercise a litmus test. We have seen groups that \nhave said absolutely, no, we are not going to have Harriet Miers. These \nare the same groups that indicated for so long that nominees are \nentitled to a vote up or down.\n  We ought to be able to look at a nominee's judicial philosophy and \nall the rest. All of those issues went right out the window when \nHarriet Miers was nominated. The reason was because Harriet Miers \ndidn't pass a litmus test. Now we have Judge Alito. Before the \nannouncement ended, we see this extraordinary wave of favorability that \nhas come over in terms of support for this nominee. I wonder how people \ncould be so opposed to Harriet Miers and, as soon as Judge Alito was \nannounced, how they could be so overwhelmingly for him. What did they \nknow? Who knew?\n  One of the things I think of is what our Founding Fathers wanted. \nWhat did the Constitution say on this issue? The Founding Fathers, in \ndebating the Constitution, considered the issue of appointment of \njudges four different times. On three occasions they gave all the \nauthority to this body here, the Senate, to recommend and appoint. The \nlast important decision at the Constitutional Convention--10 days \nbefore the end--was to share the power, with the Executive having the \npower to appoint and the Senate having the power to give advice and \nconsent. You cannot read the debates, which I have read, and not \nunderstand that it was a shared responsibility--not this idea that the \nSenate is supposed to be a rubberstamp. I know it suits their \ninterests, but our Founding Fathers wanted the shared responsibility. \nRemember the checks and balances, the essential aspect of the \nConstitution of the United States? When they give authority and power \nin one place, they give authority and power to the other--the Commander \nin Chief, Executive, making of war; with the Congress, the power of the \npurse, and the rest of the issues we all are familiar with.\n  This is a shared responsibility, and we in this Senate have a very \nimportant constitutional obligation to review the recommendation. The \nreal question for us now when we have a nominee is to find out--not for \nourselves, but as instruments for the American people--what the beliefs \nof this nominee are; what are the real beliefs are of the nominee for \nthe Supreme Court of the United States; do we have the assurances that \nthis individual is the best of the best. We have seen that. President \nReagan gave us Sandra Day O'Connor, who was the best of the best. The \nlist went on. We have had extraordinary jurists in the past.\n  We approached this to try to find out these things on the Judiciary \nCommittee. We have a pretty good sense that the executive branch knows \nthe philosophy of this nominee. They have made the recommendation and \nobviously they have inquired of this nominee, so they know where he is.\n  I was absolutely startled this morning when I picked up the New York \nTimes and saw in Mr. Kirkpatrick's article on the front page exactly \nhow this nominee was selected, who selected him, and what the process \nwas. All during this period of time, that was something those of us on \nJudiciary Committee had no mind of. Maybe our friends on the other side \nknew about it. But this is on the front page of the New York Times: \nPaving the Way For Alito Began In Reagan Era.\n  It goes on extensively, continuing on page A18. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             In Alito, G.O.P. Reaps Harvest Planted in '82\n\n                       (By David D. Kirkpatrick)\n\n       Last February, as rumors swirled about the failing health \n     of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, a team of conservative \n     grass-roots organizers, public relations specialists and \n     legal strategists met to prepare a battle plan to ensure any \n     vacancies were filled by likeminded jurists.\n       The team recruited conservative lawyers to study the \n     records of 18 potential nominees including Judges John G. \n     Roberts Jr. and Samuel A. Alito Jr.--and trained more than \n     three dozen lawyers across the country to respond to news \n     reports on the president's eventual pick.\n       ``We boxed them in,'' one lawyer present during the \n     strategy meetings said with pride in an interview over the \n     weekend. This lawyer and others present who described the \n     meeting were granted anonymity because the meetings were \n     confidential and because the team had told its allies not to \n     exult publicly until the confirmation vote was cast.\n       Now, on the eve of what is expected to be the Senate \n     confirmation of Judge Alito to the Supreme Court, coming four \n     months after Chief Justice Roberts was installed, those \n     planners stand on the brink of a watershed for the \n     conservative movement.\n       In 1982, the year after Mr. Alito first joined the Reagan \n     administration, that movement was little more than the \n     handful of legal scholars who gathered at Yale for the first \n     meeting of the Federalist Society, a newly formed \n     conservative legal group.\n       Judge Alito's ascent to join Chief Justice Roberts on the \n     court ``would have been beyond our best expectations,'' said \n     Spencer Abraham, one of the society's founders, a former \n     Secretary of Energy under President Bush and now the chairman \n     of the Committee for Justice, one of many conservative \n     organizations set up to support judicial nominees.\n       He added, ``I don't think we would have put a lot of money \n     on it in a friendly wager.''\n       Judge Alito's confirmation is also the culmination of a \n     disciplined campaign begun by the Reagan administration to \n     seed the lower federal judiciary with like-minded jurists who \n     could reorient the federal courts toward a view of the \n     Constitution much closer to its 18th-century authors' intent, \n     including a much less expansive view of its application to \n     individual rights and federal power. It was a philosophy \n     promulgated by Edwin Meese III, attorney general in the \n     Reagan administration, that became the gospel of the \n     Federalist Society and the nascent conservative legal \n     movement.\n       Both Mr. Roberts and Mr. Alito were among the cadre of \n     young conservative lawyers attracted to the Reagan \n     administration's Justice Department. And both advanced to the \n     pool of promising young jurists whom strategists like C. \n     Boyden Gray, White House counsel in the first Bush \n     administration and an adviser to the current White House, \n     sought to place throughout the federal judiciary to groom for \n     the highest court.\n       ``It is a Reagan personnel officer's dream come true,'' \n     said Douglas W. Kmiec, a law\n\n[[Page S262]]\n\n     professor at Pepperdine University who worked with Mr. Alito \n     and Mr. Roberts in the Reagan administration. ``It is a \n     graduation. These individuals have been in study and \n     preparation for these roles all their professional lives.''\n       As each progressed in legal stature, others were laying the \n     infrastructure of the movement. After the 1987 defeat of the \n     Supreme Court nomination of Judge Robert H. Bork \n     conservatives vowed to build a counterweight to the liberal \n     forces that had mobilized to stop him.\n       With grants from major conservative donors like the John M. \n     Olin Foundation, the Federalist Society functioned as a kind \n     of shadow conservative bar association, planting chapters in \n     law schools around the country that served as a pipeline to \n     prestigious judicial clerkships.\n       During their narrow and politically costly victory in the \n     1991 confirmation of Justice Clarence Thomas, the Federalist \n     Society lawyers forged new ties with the increasingly \n     sophisticated network of grass-roots conservative Christian \n     groups like Focus on the Family in Colorado Springs and the \n     American Family Association in Tupelo, Miss. Many \n     conservative Christian pastors and broadcasters had railed \n     for decades against Supreme Court decisions that outlawed \n     school prayer and endorsed abortion rights.\n       During the Clinton administration, Federalist Society \n     members and allies had come to dominate the membership and \n     staff of the Judiciary Committee, which turned back many of \n     the administration's nominees. ``There was a Republican \n     majority of the Senate, and it tempered the nature of the \n     nominations being made,'' said Mr. Abraham, the Federalist \n     Society founder who was a senator on the Judiciary Committee \n     at the time.\n       By 2000, the decades of organizing and battles had fueled a \n     deep demand in the Republican base for change on the court. \n     Mr. Bush tapped into that demand by promising to name jurists \n     in the mold of conservative Justices Thomas and Scalia.\n       When Mr. Bush named Harriet E. Miers, the White House \n     counsel, as the successor to Justice O'Connor, he faced a \n     revolt from his conservative base, which complained about her \n     dearth of qualifications and ideological bona fides.\n       ``It was a striking example of the grass roots having \n     strong opinions that ran counter to the party leaders about \n     what was attainable,'' said Stephen G. Calabresi, a law \n     professor at Northwestern University and another founding \n     member of the Federalist Society.\n       But in October, when President Bush withdrew Ms. Miers's \n     nomination and named Judge Alito, the same network quickly \n     mobilized behind him.\n       Conservatives had begun planning for a nomination fight as \n     long ago as that February meeting, which was led by Leonard \n     A. Leo, executive vice president of the Federalist Society \n     and informal adviser to the White House, Mr. Meese and Mr. \n     Gray.\n       They laid out a two-part strategy to roll out behind \n     whomever the president picked, people present said. The plan: \n     first, extol the nonpartisan legal credentials of the \n     nominee, steering the debate away from the nominee's possible \n     influence over hot-button issues. Second, attack the liberal \n     groups they expected to oppose any Bush nominee.\n       The team worked through a newly formed group, the Judicial \n     Confirmation Network, to coordinate grass-roots pressure on \n     Democratic senators from conservative states. And they stayed \n     in constant contact with scores of conservative groups around \n     the country to brief them about potential nominees and to \n     make sure they all stuck to the same message. They fine-tuned \n     their strategy for Judge Alito when he was nominated in \n     October by recruiting Italian-American groups to protest the \n     use of the nickname ``Scalito,'' which would have linked him \n     to the conservative Justice Antonin Scalia.\n       In November, some Democrats believed they had a chance to \n     defeat the nomination after the disclosure of a 1985 \n     memorandum Judge Alito wrote in the Reagan administration \n     about his conservative legal views on abortion, affirmative \n     action and other subjects.\n       ``It was a done deal,'' one of the Democratic staff members \n     of the Senate Judiciary Committee said, speaking on the \n     condition of anonymity because the staff is forbidden to talk \n     publicly about internal meetings. ``This was the most \n     evidence we have ever had about a Supreme Court nominee's \n     true beliefs.''\n       Mr. Leo and other lawyers supporting Judge Alito were \n     inclined to shrug off the memorandum, which described views \n     that were typical in their circles, people involved in the \n     effort said. But executives at Creative Response Concepts, \n     the team's public relations firm, quickly convinced them it \n     was ``a big deal'' that could become the centerpiece of the \n     Democrats' attacks, one of the people said.\n       ``The call came in right away,'' said Jay Sekulow, chief \n     counsel of the American Center for Law and Justice and \n     another lawyer on the Alito team.\n       Responding to Mr. Alito's 1985 statement that he disagreed \n     strongly with the abortion-rights precedents, for example, \n     ``The answer was, `Of course he was opposed to abortion,' '' \n     Mr. Sekulow said. ``He worked for the Reagan administration, \n     he was a lawyer representing a client, and it may well have \n     reflected his personal beliefs. But look what he has done as \n     judge.''\n       His supporters deluged news organizations with phone calls, \n     press releases and lawyers to interview, all noting that on \n     the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, \n     Judge Alito had voted to uphold and to strike down abortion \n     restrictions.\n       Democrats contended that those arguments were irrelevant \n     because on the lower court Judge Alito was bound by Supreme \n     Court precedent, whereas as a justice he could vote to \n     overturn any precedents with which he disagreed.\n       By last week it was clear that the judge had enough votes \n     to win confirmation. And the last gasp of resistance came in \n     a Democratic caucus meeting on Wednesday when Senator Edward \n     M. Kennedy, joined by Senator John Kerry, both of \n     Massachusetts, unsuccessfully tried to persuade the party to \n     organize a filibuster.\n       No one defended Judge Alito or argued that he did not \n     warrant opposition, Mr. Kennedy said in an interview. \n     Instead, opponents of the filibuster argued about the \n     political cost of being accused of obstructionism by \n     conservatives.\n       Still, on the brink of this victory, some in the \n     conservative movement say the battle over the court has just \n     begun. Justice O'Connor was the swing vote on many issues, \n     but replacing her with a more dependable conservative would \n     bring that faction of the court at most to four justices, not \n     five, and thus not enough to truly reshape the court or \n     overturn precedents like those upholding abortion rights.\n       ``It has been a long time coming,'' Judge Bork said, ``but \n     more needs to be done.''\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, America is listening to the President. He \nsaid: We are going to get the very best nominee we possibly can. That \nis one side of the story. Most of us certainly believed it. Well, this \nis the story. This may be accurate and it may not be. I think it is \nvery difficult to read this story and not certainly find a very \npowerful ring of truth in it:\n\n       Last February, as rumors swirled about the failing health \n     of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, a team of conservative \n     grassroots organizers, public relations specialists, and \n     legal strategists met to prepare a battle plan to ensure any \n     vacancies were filled by like-minded jurists.\n\n  So the right wing had a plan. They knew what the thinking of the \nnominee was. The article continues:\n\n       The team recruited conservative lawyers to study the \n     records of 18 potential nominees--including Judges John G. \n     Roberts and Samuel A. Alito--and trained more than three \n     dozen lawyers across the country to respond to news reports \n     on the President's eventual pick.\n\n  So members of the right wing are going to make the pick and we see \naround the country where dozens of lawyers are going to respond to the \nnews reports. It continues:\n\n       ``We boxed them in'' . . .\n\n  Boxed whom in? They boxed in the American people. That is what they \nare saying proudly--``we boxed them in,'' one lawyer present during the \nstrategy meetings said with pride in an interview over the weekend.\n  Boxed whom in? This is a nomination for the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States. This is supposed to represent all of the people, all \nAmericans. No, no, they boxed them in, a lawyer present at the strategy \nmeeting said with pride.\n  This lawyer and others present who described the meeting were granted \nanonymity because the meetings were confidential and because the team \nhad told its allies not to exult publicly until the confirmation vote \nwas cast.\n  There it is. They can hardly wait. Although I was surprised that--and \nthis would be my 23rd Supreme Court nominee--the nominee was up in the \nCapitol last week thanking Senators for their support and receiving \ncongratulations prior to the time we even vote on him.\n  It has been debated for less than a week on the floor of the Senate. \nTwenty-five Senators from our side have spoken. Only half of our caucus \nhad a chance to speak. They will not speak now if we cut it off. They \nhave not had a chance to talk. Again, the article says:\n\n       . . . The team had told its allies not to exult publicly \n     until the confirmation vote was cast.\n\n  Then they will pop the champagne and say we pulled one over on you. \nAnd it continues:\n\n       They laid out a two-part strategy to roll out behind \n     whomever the President picked, people present said. The plan: \n     first extol the nonpartisan legal credentials of the nominee \n     . . .\n\n  They don't even know who the nominee is going to be yet, but they \nhave the plan to extol the nonpartisan legal credentials.\n\n\n[[Page S263]]\n\n\n       . . . steering the debate away from the nominee's possible \n     influence over hot-button issues. Second, attack the liberal \n     groups they expect to oppose any Bush nominee.\n\n  There it is, that is the strategy. It is not that we are going to \nnominate the best possible nominee and that we are going to work with \nRepublicans and Democrats alike to make sure the American people \nunderstand how this nominee is going to protect your constitutional \nrights and liberties. That is what we thought. That is what has been \ndone at other times--not every time, but most of the time. That is what \nthe American people expect and what they are entitled to.\n  But, oh, no, this group is already saying we know how we are going to \nhandle this, whoever it is. We are going to exalt the assets of this \nnominee. The other thing is we are going to launch our attacks on other \npeople before the nominee is even out there. This is the confirmation \nprocess for the Supreme Court of the United States for a nominee who is \ngoing to make the decisions on your rights and liberties for the next \n30, 40 years? Attack them as soon as the nomination is out there. Exalt \nthe nominee's professional credentials. We don't know who it is, but \nyou better get them out there doing it, and we have our network wired \naround the country to make sure they are going to come out right on it. \nThis for the Supreme Court of the United States? This is what we are \nfinding out.\n  It continues:\n\n       Mr. Leo and other lawyers supporting Judge Alito were \n     inclined to shrug off the memorandum.\n\n  This is the 1985 memorandum of Judge Alito that he used in an \napplication for a job with the Justice Department. He was 35 years old. \nHe had argued 15 cases before the Supreme Court. He had a number of \nstatements in there that were provocative. I will come back to that.\n  This memorandum was provocative because it indicated that he was \nagainst a woman's right to choose, he was against reapportionment, \nwhich, of course, has had enormous importance in terms of ensuring \npeople's right to vote and have that vote counted in a meaningful way. \nThere was some concern whether this was going to have any impact. This \nwas his real, true view about the Constitution. This was a document \nwhich showed his real view about it, which would have been helpful to \nthe American people to at least understand what Judge Alito's views \nare.\n  Those lawyers supporting Alito said we will shrug off the memo:\n\n        . . . which described views which were typical in their \n     circles, people involved in the effort said. But the \n     Conservative Response Concepts, the team's public relations \n     firm, quickly convinced them it was ``a big deal'' that could \n     become the centerpiece of the Democrats' attacks, one of the \n     people said.\n\n  Creative Response Concepts. Who is this Creative Response Concepts? \nThe Creative Response Concepts, if you look them up on the Web, right \nabove the Alito confirmation hearings is the Swift Boat Veterans for \nTruth--Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, the ones who made the distortions \nand misrepresentations about my colleague and friend, John Kerry, and \nhis war record. They distorted and misrepresented it. They are now \nadvertising the Alito confirmation hearings. They say, Let us get in \nit, and into it they go.\n  The American people are entitled to listen to those who believe in \nthe nominee, and to listen to those on the other side. No, we are \ngetting our message right through a PR firm, Creative Response \nConcepts. We are getting our truth right through them. The American \npeople are going to understand his views of constitutional rights and \nliberties from Creative Response Concepts. When we finish doing the \nSwift Boat Veterans for Truth, we have the Alito nomination right here. \nThis is what the American people are entitled to?\n\n       The team's public relations firm quickly convinced them it \n     was ``a big deal'' that could become the centerpiece of the \n     Democrats' attack, one of the people said.\n\n  The article continues.\n  This has been a difficult process to make a judgment and be fair to \nthe nominee and also carry forward our responsibilities. But when we \nhave the kind of action on the outside and the failure to be responsive \non the inside, in terms of his response to questions, this is a \ndisservice to the American people.\n  This has been a longstanding campaign. It has been a stealth \ncampaign. I daresay that is not what the Founding Fathers intended, \nthat is not what they expected, and the American people deserve a great \ndeal better.\n  I hope people will have the chance to read the whole article. I am \nnot going to go through it now. I have given the essence of it. It is \nvery clear how this nominee was selected, why he was selected, and how \nthat campaign for him was conducted.\n  As the American people are trying to make a judgment on this through \ntheir elected representatives today and tomorrow, all we are asking for \nis an opportunity to have the kind of full discussion and full debate \nthat we ought to and that Members of the Senate who have not had a \nchance to speak have an opportunity. It is not asking too much.\n  I have been in the Senate when we really had filibusters. The idea \nthat we are here on a Monday and this came to the Senate last Wednesday \nand the opposition is saying, Oh, well, this is delaying the work of \nthe Senate--what is more important to the Senate than a vote for a \nJustice of the Supreme Court of the United States? What is more \nimportant? This is the issue, this is the time, this is the nominee, \nand we find out how we have been treated.\n  This body deserves better, and the American people deserve better. \nThat is what this vote is this afternoon. That is what it is about. \nLet's really find out. Let's have a chance to go through these cases \nand this nominee.\n  We know that the right wing now has its campaign in full gear. Their \nmission is to cover up the truth. So we do need a full debate to bring \nout the truth on Judge Alito's record. What is wrong with debate? Are \nthey afraid of what Americans would do if they really heard the full \nrecord? That is what the issue is, and that is why people are entitled \nto the time.\n  I was in my State for a few hours on Friday. The people of my State \nwere talking to me, in the few hours I was there, about the \nprescription drug bill that they just cannot navigate. There are 35 \ndifferent drug plans from which to choose. There are situations where \nif an individual signs up for a particular program--it is interesting, \nthe plan itself can change the premiums and the formularies, but the \nperson cannot get off that plan. Once they are in it, they are in it. \nOr if they do get off the plan, they pay an extraordinary penalty to \nget onto another. The plan can change deductibles and copays. They are \nvery troubled elderly people.\n  There are heart wrenching stories. People up there care about the \ncost of their heating oil going right through the roof. People care \nabout that in my State. People are absolutely in disbelief over how a \npart of America in New Orleans, Mississippi, and Alabama can be left \nout and left behind. They are continually pained by the continued loss \nof sons and daughters from my State and from across the country in the \nIraq war with really no end in sight. They are bothered by all of this. \nThey are bothered by the whole issue of lobbying and lobbying \ncorruption.\n\n  They are working hard because the middle class is having a more and \nmore difficult time just trying to make ends meet. They are finding \nthat prescription drugs have gone up, heating has gone up, education \nhas gone up, gas has gone up, and their wages have not gone up. It has \nbeen 9 years since we increased the minimum wage. Seven times we have \nincreased our own pay, by $30,000, but we cannot afford to increase the \nminimum wage by a dollar.\n  Hard-working people are hurting in my State of Massachusetts. Today, \nthey are wondering whether tonight they are going to have food on the \ntable. Now we are asking them to shift their focus to Judge Alito. \nJudge Alito--how is that going to affect what my family is faced with? \nIt will affect a great deal your children and your children's \nchildren's future.\n  Here are some of the issues Supreme Court decisions affect:\n  Supreme Court decisions affect the ability of Americans to be safe in \ntheir homes from irresponsible search and seizures and other government \nintrusions. We had those cases come up in the hearings. I will come \nback and spend some time on them. It is difficult to believe.\n  Supreme Court decisions affect whether the rights of employees can be\n\n[[Page S264]]\n\nprotected in the workplace. If you are a worker, you should be \nconcerned about this nominee.\n  They affect whether families can obtain needed medical care under \nhealth insurance policies. Decisions on health care, whether they are \nunder ERISA, often go to the Supreme Court.\n  Decisions affect whether people will actually receive retirement \nbenefits they were promised. There was $8 billion lost in the last 5 \nyears; 700 retirement programs lost, $8 billion, where workers actually \npaid in. Who is going to protect their rights? Is it going to be the \npowerful companies, powerful interests, special interests, or are we \ngoing to have a judge who is going to be looking out for the worker and \nthe worker's interest? It is a legitimate issue.\n  If you care about your health care, if you care about your \nretirement, if you care about your conditions of employment, this \nSupreme Court nominee is where you ought to be focused and where you \nought to give your attention.\n  Supreme Court decisions affect whether people will be free from \ndiscrimination, prejudice, and outright bigotry in their daily lives, \nwhether you are going to be told you are not going to get the job \nbecause of the color of your skin or because of your gender. There are \ncases we went through during the Judiciary Committee hearings about \nJudge Alito being insensitive in those areas. I will come back to them.\n  Do you hear me? Discrimination, prejudice, outright bigotry in their \ndaily lives. You are going to have to make sure you are going to have a \nSupreme Court that is going to be fighting for you.\n  The decisions affect whether Americans' most private medical \ndecisions will be a family matter or subject to government \ninterference. Terri Schiavo is a classic example. We have governmental \nsolutions to these issues, or should these matters be left to the \nindividuals who are closest to any patient--their families, their loved \nones, their priests, their ministers, their rabbis? We had a debate on \nthis issue. People can think that is a long way away from them, but \nthere is nobody in this body, nobody in this audience, nobody who is \nwatching who doesn't have a real concern for what is going to happen to \ntheir parents, to their loved ones, and whether we are going to be able \nto deal with that issue or whether the Supreme Court is going to say: \nWell, we think there are appropriate governmental kinds of roles in \nthis kind of a situation. We certainly saw where a majority of this \nbody legislatively felt the courts ought to become much more involved \nin that situation. They basically retreated on that position, although \nsome still defended it even in recent days.\n  The decisions affect whether a person with disabilities will have \naccess to public facilities and programs. I gave the example of \nTennessee v. Lane. That is a case that was decided in the last few \nyears about disability rights. Who among us doesn't have a member of \ntheir family who has some kind of challenges, either mental health \nchallenges or physical challenges? We have certainly seen it in our \nfamily, and when we get the chance to talk about disabilities and \ndisability rights in this body, it is always amazing--not amazing, it \nis always interesting to me that we give such little attention to those \nwho have mental health challenges and disability needs and we give such \nlittle attention and assistance to them.\n  ``Parity'' is the code word, whether we are going to treat people who \nhave mental health issues and those with disabilities the same as those \nwho have physical issues. We still haven't had it. I certainly hope, \nwith the leadership of Senator Domenici, certainly myself, Senator \nHarkin, and many other Members, that we will have a chance to vote on \nthat issue this year. It is long overdue.\n  Supreme Court decisions affect whether we will have reasonable \nenvironmental laws that keep our air and water clean. Care about the \nwater? Care about the air we have? Does that really make much of a \ndifference to us, Senator? Does it really make much difference to us? \nInteresting, we have doubled the number of deaths from asthma this year \nthan we had 5 years ago--doubled the deaths for children. I wonder why \nthat is. Do you know where they are? They are all in the States and \ncities and communities that, by and large, have inhaled the toxins and \nthe dioxins which have come, as a result of changes in the \nenvironmental laws, from major plants, carbon-producing plants in this \ncountry.\n  We had laws. I don't know what to tell a mother when she sees her \nchild having that intense reaction. I know, as a father of a chronic \nasthmatic, they live with it. The idea that people outgrow it--not in \nour family. We see the constant challenge that it is for any young \nperson as they grow to adulthood. Asthma is increasing, and there is no \nquestion about it. It is because of the pollution in the air.\n  Are we going to have a judge who will recognize what the Congress \nwanted to do, or someone who is going to say, Oh, no, we have a very \npowerful company down here that seems to have a reasonable argument--as \nwe saw with Judge Alito; I will come back to that case as well--so, \ntherefore, we are going to find for the company, and we are going to \nlet them continue to discharge pollutants into the lakes. Do we care \nabout the lakes? Do we care about the streams?\n  Mercury advisories apply to nearly a third of the area of America's \nlakes and 22 percent of the length of our rivers, and mercury pollution \nhas led 45 states to post fish consumption advisories. Where kids used \nto go out and fish and enjoy it, that is absolutely denied them for \nhealth reasons. With respect to expectant mothers, that is very real.\n  We in Congress pass laws, the President signs them, they go to the \ncourts for interpretation, and where will this nominee come out? Will \nhe come out for that mother who has a child who has asthma, or that \nparent seeing the pollution taking place in a lake nearby and whose \nchild has been affected by those kinds of poisons? Where is he going to \ncome out on the issues of discrimination in jobs, issues we have been \nfighting to eliminate under title VII of our civil rights laws and that \nstill are a problem.\n  We can go through those cases where this nominee fails to shape up. \nLet me just say this vote this afternoon will last for 15 or 20 \nminutes. But the implications of that vote, the implications for your \nlife, your children's lives and your grandchildren's lives, will \ncontinue for years to come. We have only one chance to get it right. \nThis is not a piece of legislation where you can go ahead and pass it \nand then say, oh, well, we got it wrong.\n  I think with respect to the prescription drug bill we will have to \ncome back and redo it. I think we should. We can come back and redo a \nprescription drug bill. Americans are entitled to that. Seniors are \nentitled to it. We got it wrong when, effectively, the conference was \nhijacked by the drug companies and the HMOs. There were extraordinary \npayoffs. It was written up in the Washington Post last week about the \npayoff--it was $46 billion to the HMOs back in 2003, now it is $67 \nbillion.\n  People who go to the HMOs are 8 percent healthier, and they got a 7-\npercent inflator, a 15-percent advantage. I thought Republicans used to \nsay the private sector was more efficient; that we can do it more \neffectively than the Government so we don't need extra help. No, they \nwant all the extras, 15 percent more, so it comes to $46 billion more. \nYou are asking why people in my State are paying higher copays and \npremiums and all the rest? It is because we have these kinds of \npayouts.\n  We can come back and deal with those. People can deal with those in \nthe elections next fall. I understand that. You win or lose and we come \nback to it, but not on the Supreme Court of the United States. You get \none time, one chance, one vote to get it right. There are no second \ntimes. That is what all of this is really about in this debate we will \nhave for the course of the day and this afternoon.\n  As I say, I don't know what is more important that we are going to \ndeal with. I gave examples of the range of different issues that come \nbefore the Supreme Court. I doubt if there is anybody who is listening \nto this or watching this who is not affected by at least one or two of \nthose different kinds of issues over the course of their lifetime--in \nterms of their work, their retirement, their pay, in terms of \ndiscrimination, in terms of environmental\n\n[[Page S265]]\n\nissues and women's privacy issues, which are so at risk at this \nparticular time with this nominee. All of those issues are out there. \nAll we are saying is, don't we think we ought to try to get it right? \nDon't we think we ought to have the chance to lay this out just a \nlittle more?\n  In every one of those examples I gave, in those nine different \ntitles, there are cases on which Judge Alito has ruled. He has taken a \nposition. In many of those cases he has taken the position in strong \nopposition to other judges appointed by Republicans. Judge Rendell \ntalked about Gestapo-like tactics that were used when marshals came in \non a civil action. There was no crime committed. It was a civil action \nin order to repossess a farm in bankruptcy to be sold at public \nauction. People had worked their whole lives for this small farm in \nPennsylvania, and the marshals came in, they seized it, and grabbed \nthese individuals who had committed no crime. There was no attempt to \nrun. There was no attempt to hide. There was no attempt to evade. And \nwe have Judge Rendell talking about Gestapo-like tactics by those \nmarshals. Whether they were Gestapo-like or they were not Gestapo-like \ncertainly ought to be decided by the jury. I think most of us would \nagree with that, would we not?\n  Judge Alito said: No, no, we are not going to let that go to the \njury. They were just performing their own responsibilities. I am not \ngoing to let that go to the jury.\n  Other judges, on issues about whether there is discrimination in \nemployment--including some Republican judges who sat with Judge Alito \nand said if we follow Judge Alito's reasoning and rationale we would \neffectively--``eviscerate'' is the word that was used--title VII, title \nVII being the provisions we passed in the 1964 act to make sure we were \nnot going to discriminate in employment.\n  The list goes on. It is not just myself or others who have expressed \nopposition. We have the very distinguished Cass Sunstein of the \nUniversity of Chicago who has done a review of Judge Alito's cases and \nsaid that 84 percent of the time Judge Alito decided for the powerful \nor the entrenched interests or the government. Cass Sunstein said that.\n\n  Knight Ridder, that is not a Democratic organ. That is not Democrat \nmembers of the committee. They have a whole group who analyzed his \nopinions independently. The Knight Ridder newspaper chain reached the \nsame decision.\n  The Yale study group--gifted, talented students and professors up \nthere at Yale University--did a study about Judge Alito's dissents and \nopinions and came to the same conclusion. If you are looking for \nsomeone who is going to protect the workers, if you are looking for \nsomeone who is going to protect men and women of color, if you are \nlooking for somebody who is going to protect children, if you are \nlooking for someone who is going to protect the privacy issues of \nwomen, this is not your candidate.\n  Those are the conclusions of a broad range of different groups who \nhave studied this. It was a broad range. They are not just Democrats, \nnot partisan. Knight Ridder is not partisan. Cass Sunstein is basically \nin the middle. Some will say this afternoon, oh, well, you can always \nfind a few cases. It is not just a few. These are the overwhelming \nnumber of studies. Even the Washington Post study, in terms of the \nnumber of victories that people of color had or the workers had over \nthe existing power system, reaches the same conclusion.\n  It seems to me we ought at least to have the opportunity to make sure \nthe American people understand this. It takes time. It took some time \nfor the American people to understand what was really happening in \nIraq. It took some time. They understand now, but it took time. People \nare working hard. They are busy with their jobs and their families, and \nthey are trying to do what is right and play by the rules. It takes \nsome time for them to understand how this nominee is going to affect \ntheir lives and their well-being in the future. But there is nothing \nmore important. There is nothing more important here in the Senate. \nThere is nothing more important in the unfinished business of the \nSenate.\n  Just pick up the calendar and look at the unfinished business of the \nSenate. Nothing comes close to it. If you said right behind this is the \nDefense appropriations bill, this is going to delay a decision on armor \nand support for our troops, I would say, fine, let's let that go \nthrough. Maybe we will find time after that for Judge Alito. But that \nis not here. What are we doing after this? We are doing asbestos \nissues. That is entirely different. We have real questions on that, \nwhether there is going to be adequate funding for those people who have \nbeen sickest and all the rest. We have to have a full debate on that \nissue. But there is no reason in the world we cannot take the time and \ncan't have the debate on this issue, which is incalculably more \nimportant to the lives and well-being of Americans.\n  There are sufficient questions across the front pages of America's \nnewspapers today that raise very serious issues and questions about \nthis whole process that ought to cause our colleagues, friends, \nassociates, the Members of this body, some pause. Let's try to think. \nLet's try to get it right. I say let's try to get it right. We will \nhave an opportunity to do that this afternoon at 4:30.\n  Mr. President, I believe my time is just about up.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority has an additional 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in one reference to Judge Rendell and \nalso Judge Chertoff on the two cases I referenced, it was Judge Rendell \nwho described the tactics of the marshals brandishing shotguns as \n``Gestapo-like'' and Judge Chertoff who criticized Judge Alito's \nposition in an equally bad case, Doe v. Groody, which involved the \nstrip-search of the 10-year-old girl. I ask the Record reflect that \nchange.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Under the previous order, the time from 11 to 12 will be under the \ncontrol of the majority side, and then debate will continue to \nalternate on an hourly basis until 4 p.m.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to talk a \nlittle bit about the judge issue that is before us. I have not done so \nuntil now. I have watched this debate with interest because I think it \nis one of the most important things we do.\n  The system, of course, is for the President to nominate and for the \nSenate to confirm or reject. So that is really one of the important \nissues before us.\n  I must confess I have been a little surprised at the system we have \ngone through. It has been strung out for a very long time and seems to \nme perhaps it has gone on longer than necessary, but nevertheless that \nis where we are. I was very pleased to learn it is not partisan, not \npolitical. I was a little surprised to hear that. But nevertheless I do \nthink it is important.\n  I have not practiced law, but I certainly understand in our system \nthe Supreme Court is one of the three elements of our Government and is \na very important one. And so it is important that we deal with it. I \njust would like to say that it seems to me, as I have listened and as I \nhave paid as much attention as I could to Judge Alito's hearings, I am \ncertainly impressed. I am impressed with his qualifications and his \nexperience. I would think surely one of the most important elements of \nthe question of confirmation is experience, someone who has the \nqualifications, someone who has had the background. Certainly Judge \nAlito has that--Princeton University, Harvard Law School, Army Reserve, \nDOJ legal counsel, U.S. attorney, unanimously confirmed in New Jersey, \ncircuit court judge Third Circuit, unanimously confirmed. He has argued \n12 cases before the Supreme Court. Many attorneys, of course, have not \nhad this kind of distinguished opportunity. I would guess\n\n[[Page S266]]\n\nfor the most part many of the candidates for the Supreme Court have not \nhad that kind of experience. He has had some 15 years with the Third \nCircuit, some 35,000 votes. So the background is there.\n\n  I think one of the things, certainly, that is a part of the \nconfirmation and the confirmation hearing and what we need to \nunderstand is the positions that these various candidates take, and I \nwould like to just share a few quotations, responses that the judge \ngave to questions that were asked.\n  In terms of believing in the Constitution and that it protects rights \nfor all, under all circumstances, in times of peace or war, the judge \nsaid:\n\n       Our Constitution applies in times of peace and in times of \n     war, and it protects the rights of Americans under all \n     circumstances. It is particularly important that we adhere to \n     the Bill of Rights in times of war and in times of national \n     crisis, because that's when there's the greatest temptation \n     to depart from them.\n\n  It seems to me that is very clear and one that has been talked about \na good deal currently.\n  Another question was: Do you believe anyone, the President, the \nCongress, the courts, rise above the law? The candidate said:\n\n       No person in this country is above the law. And that \n     includes the President and it includes the Supreme Court. \n     Everyone has to follow the law, and that means the \n     Constitution of the United States and it means the laws that \n     are enacted under the Constitution of the United States.\n\n  Again, I think that is a very basic premise. We are all treated \nequally under the law. ``Under the law,'' that is the key.\n  I, as we do, go to schools quite often, and having spent some time on \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, I often tell students that one of the \nsignificant differences about our country and most of the rest of the \nworld is we have laws under which everyone is treated equally. I think \nthat is one of the keys, and that response, it seems to me, is a great \none.\n  He was asked would he base decisions on the Constitution and the rule \nof law, not shifting public opinion. He said:\n\n       The Court should make its decisions based on the \n     Constitution and the law. It should not sway in the wind of \n     public opinion at any time.\n\n  Certainly, that is a very important element as well. He was asked \nabout his personal views and how that would affect his decisions. He \nsaid:\n\n       I would approach the question with an open mind, and I \n     would listen to the arguments that were made.\n       When someone becomes a judge, you really have to put aside \n     the things that you did as a lawyer at prior points in your \n     legal career and think about legal issues the way a judge \n     thinks about legal issues.\n\n  When asked about upholding the high standards of integrity and \nethics, he said:\n\n       I did what I've tried to do throughout my career as a \n     judge, and that is to go beyond the letter of the ethics \n     rules and to avoid any situation where there might be an \n     ethical question raised.\n\n  It seems to me those are the kinds of responses that make you feel \ncomfortable with the candidate. So I am very pleased that apparently we \nare going toward the end. Certainly, it is time to get down toward the \nend. There is no reason to continue to drag this out. We know what we \nneed to know, it is there, and it is time to do it.\n  So I think throughout the process the candidate has answered the \nquestions to the best of his ability. Unfortunately, many of the \nquestioners spent more time giving speeches and circumventing the \nprocess than asking relevant questions, but that is part of the \nprocess.\n  I must confess I am getting a little concerned about the Senate \nconfirmation process. We ought to take another look at our role and not \ndeviate from that role for other unrelated reasons. So I hope Members \nhave not taken us down the path of setting a bad precedent, and I am \nsure that is not the case. I am looking forward to completing this \nprocess starting this afternoon and completing it tomorrow. I think we \nhave before us a great opportunity to confirm one of the most capable \npersons that we could have on our Supreme Court.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I was here in the Chamber in the role of \nPresiding Officer during the presentation of the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts in which he referred to a story in this morning's New \nYork Times with respect to public relations activity aimed at \nsupporting Judge Alito. He was quite outraged at what he had read in \nthe New York Times and talked about how improper it was for a public \nrelations firm or any group of lawyers to gather together and mount a \ncampaign on behalf of this nominee; that that should be left to the \nSenate and that there should be no outside interference in this \nprocess.\n  The New York Times had focused on the activities that had been in \nfavor of the nominee, and the Senator from Massachusetts found that \nobjectionable.\n  As I listened to him, I could not help but think of the actions that \nwent forward in opposition to this nominee by groups of lawyers who \ngathered together to get their ammunition ready in the public arena, by \npublic relations firms that were hired to oppose the nominee.\n  I remember the story in the Washington Post when John Roberts was \nproposed where they described those groups that were opposed to the \nPresident gathering with their press releases to attack the nominee, \nwho were forced to strip out the name of the person they thought the \nnominee would be and put in John Roberts' name so that they could issue \nthe press releases as soon as the name was made public. They had \nprepared their ammunition to attack the President's nominee before they \nknew who he was, and they were embarrassed by the fact that they had \nguessed wrong. But they did not change a single word of their attack \nonce they knew that the actual nominee was someone different than they \nhad anticipated.\n  My only comments to the Senator from Massachusetts would be that if \nhe decries the work that was done in favor of a nominee by outside \nlawyer groups and public relations firms, he should join with some of \nthe rest of us and say that the same criticism applies to those who \nwere prepared to savage the nominee, whomever he might have been.\n  If the Senator from Massachusetts will have a conversation with Ralph \nNeas and the People for the American Way and say to them, Back off, let \nthe nominee be made known, let his views or her views be made known, \nhave a clear evaluation of where they stand before you start your \npublic relations attack, then I will turn to the groups on the right \nand say the same thing: You back off. Let the nominee be known. Let the \nviews be examined before you mount your public relations campaign.\n  But we saw what happened when people in support of a Republican \nPresident's nominee back off and allow the field to be dominated by \nthose who are on the attack. Out of that first experience of seeing \nattack after attack after attack into an empty field, we have created a \nnew word in the English language. It is a verb, to ``Bork.'' The \nnominee was Robert Bork. I had my problems with Robert Bork. I am not \nsure how I would have voted, having heard his record. But I do know \nthat the record was distorted and the opportunity to hear his record \nwas changed by virtue of the groups that were all prepared to savage \nhim, to attack his personality, to destroy any careful analysis of his \nrecord. He was ``Borked.'' And we heard that other people would be \n``Borked'' by this same savage attack from the left.\n  So I have sympathy with the Senator from Massachusetts when he \ncomplains about the groups on the right that were marshaled in advance \nof the nomination to defend the nominee. But I say to him they were \nmarshaled to defend the nominee because they saw what happened when \nsuch previous activity was not carried forward. With the way in which \nthe Chief Justice, John Roberts, moved through here, with both sides \nhaving their say but ultimately the public demonstrating a sense of \nrevulsion about this whole ``Borking''\n\n[[Page S267]]\n\nprocess, and now with Judge Alito moving forward in a manner far more \ndignified than we have seen in the past, I hope ``Borking'' would \nbecome a historic artifact and would disappear and that groups on the \nfar left and the far right would finally realize that the Senate is not \nmoved by these kinds of tactics; that the ads that are run, television \nads attacking the nominee boomerang.\n  We have seen some of these groups that have attacked Judge Alito have \nhad to have their ads taken down because they were false, they were \nattacked by the media generally for the severity and the falsity of \ntheir position. ``Borking'' does not work anymore. And I hope that both \nsides would recognize that the Senate has demonstrated a level of \ncivility and intelligence in this situation that says we will not be \nmoved by those who raise large sums of money, who run television ads in \nour home States savaging the nominee. We will be focused on what \nhappens in the hearings. We will be focused on the actual record. We \nwill not allow this to turn into an electoral circus.\n  That was done in the case of Judge Bork. It was not done \nsuccessfully, although it was attempted with Chief Justice Roberts.\n  It is not working now with Judge Alito. I hope people on both sides \nwill then abandon those tactics, I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I assume the order of business is to \nspeak on the Alito nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I choose to do that.\n  I support the nomination of Samuel Alito. Judge Alito, as we heard in \nour hearings, and so far in most of the debate on the floor, is a \nperson who is a dedicated public servant, who practices what he \npreaches: integrity, modesty, judicial restraint, and a devotion to the \nlaw and to the Constitution. He understands a judge should not have a \npersonal agenda or be an activist on the bench but should make \ndecisions as they should be decided--do it in an impartial manner, do \nit with an open mind, and do it with appropriate restraint and, of \ncourse, in accordance with the laws and the Constitution.\n  Listening to a lot of my colleagues on the committee, and last week, \nI am extremely disappointed that we are looking now at an attempt by \nSenators--and they are all on the other side of the aisle--to delay and \nfilibuster this nominee. It is too bad Majority Leader Frist had to \ntake the extreme position of filing cloture on this very important \nnomination. No Supreme Court nomination has ever been defeated by \nfilibuster if a majority of the Senators stood ready to confirm that \nnominee. Now, that certainly is not the case here because we already \nknow a bipartisan majority of Senators will vote to confirm Judge Alito \nif we get to that point tomorrow at 11 o'clock. We also know we have \nhad plenty of time to debate this nomination. It is unfortunate that \ncertain Senators will vote against this nominee because they think \ndoing so is a good political issue for them. These Senators are \napplying a very different standard to what has been the history and the \ntradition in the Senate of considering Supreme Court nominees. The \nposition being taken by these Senators is that Judge Alito ought to \nsomehow share Justice O'Connor's judicial philosophy in order for him \nto fill that seat where she has been for the last 25 years.\n  That sort of thinking is totally at odds with what the Constitution \nrequires, but more importantly than what the Constitution requires, \nwhat has been the Senate's tradition in the last 225 years, and that is \nthat Judge Alito does not have to be Justice O'Connor's judicial \nphilosophy soulmate to deserve confirmation by this Senate. Because the \nSupreme Court does not have seats reserved for one philosophy or \nanother. That kind of reasoning is completely antithetical to the \nproper role of the judiciary in our system of Government.\n  My colleagues on the other side, then, have it all wrong. There has \nnever been an issue of ideological balance on the Court. If that were \nthe case, do you think President Ford would have nominated Justice \nStevens or President Bush 1 would have nominated Justice Souter--two \nRepublican appointees who have turned out to be the most liberal \nmembers on the Court appointed by Republicans? Those Presidents did not \nthink in terms of ideological balance.\n  The Senate's tradition, then, has not been to confirm individuals to \nthe Supreme Court who promote special interests or represent certain \ncauses. The Senate has never understood its role to maintain any \nperceived ideological balance on the Court. To the contrary, the \nSenate's tradition has been to confirm individuals who are well \nqualified to interpret and to apply the law and who understand the \nproper role of the judiciary to dispense justice.\n  Recent history, of course, is proof of that because in my years in \nthe Senate, but as recently as 10, 12 years ago, when Ruth Bader \nGinsburg was before the Senate, we gave overwhelming confirmation to \nher--a former general counsel of the very liberal group, the ACLU. She \nreplaced a conservative Justice, Byron White, on the Court at that \ntime. The Senate confirmed Justice Ginsburg. Why? Because President \nClinton won an election, campaigning on the basis of the kind of people \nhe was going to nominate, and President Clinton did that. That is what \nthe Constitution says the role of the President, the role of the Senate \nis.\n  Now, some of my colleagues have said elections have results and the \nConstitution says the President gets to nominate Supreme Court \ncandidates. Of course, Justice Ginsburg, whether you agree with her or \nnot, had the requisite qualifications to serve on the Court.\n  Right after her, Justice Breyer came to the Supreme Court, a liberal \nas well, appointed by President Clinton. But the Senate confirmed that \nJustice by a big vote. The President made his choice, sent it to the \nSenate, the Senate found him qualified, and he was confirmed on an up-\nor-down vote. No filibuster was ever talked about, and no one talked \nabout maintaining any ideological balance on the Court.\n  The Supreme Court, then and historically, is not the place to play \npolitics. The Court is supposed to be, and as far as I know is, free of \npolitics. But the Democrats and liberal outside interest groups want to \nchange the rules because they did not win at the ballot box. They want \nto implement their agenda from the Court. Of course, that is a \ndangerous path, making the Supreme Court a superlegislature. The \nConstitution does not presume that. Under our checks-and-balances \nsystem of Government, we do not want to go down that path. Going down \nthat path will create a standard that will seriously jeopardize the \nindependence of the judiciary and distort our system of Government, a \nsystem based upon the judiciary being the arbiter of the war that \noften--I should say continually goes on between the executive branch of \nGovernment and the legislative branch of Government.\n  Democrats want the Supreme Court to assume an expansive role well \nbeyond what was originally intended by the Constitution and its \nwriters. They want the Court to take on a role that is closer to the \nrole of the legislative branch, which is to make policy and bring about \nchanges in our society.\n  Now, this has consequences when you go down this road. It has brought \nabout the politicization of the judicial confirmation process that we \nhave seen evidenced, particularly on the Alito nomination, but also on \nthe Roberts nomination, or go back 3 years previous to the holding up \nof several circuit court nominees before this body through the threat \nof filibuster or not just the threat but the use of the filibuster.\n  Politicizing the judicial confirmation process is wrong. That is \nbecause when judges improperly assume the role of deciding essentially \npolitical questions rather than legal questions, the judicial \nconfirmation process devolves into one focused less on whether a \nnominee can impartially and appropriately implement law. Instead, it \nbecomes one\n\n[[Page S268]]\n\nmore focused on whether a nominee will implement a desired political \noutcome, and do it from the bench, regardless of the law and regardless \nof what the Constitution says.\n  Americans want what the Constitution writers have always called for: \njudges who will confine their job to interpreting the law as passed by \nlegislative bodies and the Constitution as written rather than having \nthe same group of men and women make policy and societal changes from \nthe bench. We need to reject firmly the notion that the Supreme Court \nshould be in the business of political decisionmaking or in the \nbusiness of politicians--you and I who were elected to the Senate.\n  The Constitution provides that the President nominates a Supreme \nCourt Justice and the Senate provides its advice and consent. Alexander \nHamilton wrote an awful lot about the role the judiciary was to play \nand what judges were supposed to do because he had to explain that in \nrelation to the ratification by the original 13 States. So he wrote \nseveral papers. But in Federalist 66, he wrote:\n\n       [I]t will be the office of the President to nominate, and, \n     with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint. There \n     will, of course, be no exertion of choice on the part of the \n     Senate. They may defeat one choice of the Executive, and \n     oblige him to make another; but they [meaning the Senate] \n     cannot themselves choose--they can only ratify or reject the \n     choice he may have made.\n\n  The way the Senate provides its advice and consent has been by a \nthorough Judiciary Committee evaluation, and then by an up-or-down vote \nin the full Senate. The Judiciary Committee has an important job \nbecause its members can ask in-depth questions of the nominee. The \ncommittee evaluates whether the nominee has the requisite judicial \ntemperament, intellect, and integrity. The committee also looks to see \nwhether a nominee understands the proper role of a Justice and respects \nthe rule of law and the words of the Constitution over any personal \nagenda because no Justice should be sitting on the Court who has a \npersonal agenda that he wants or she wants to carry out.\n  I have been a member of the Judiciary Committee for more than 25 \nyears and take this responsibility seriously, as do my colleagues. I \nthought Judge Alito did a very good job answering our questions and \nthat he was candid. No doubt he was thorough. As far as I am concerned, \nhe was very responsive.\n  Judge Alito understands the proper role of the judiciary is not to \nmake the law. He will strictly interpret the law as written and do his \nbest to remain faithful to the actual meaning of the Constitution. As \nJudge Alito said:\n\n       Judges don't have the authority to change the Constitution. \n     The whole theory of judicial review that we have, I think, is \n     contrary to that notion. The Constitution is an enduring \n     document and the Constitution doesn't change. It does contain \n     some important general principles that have to be applied to \n     new factual situations that come up. But in doing that, the \n     judiciary has to be very careful not to inject its own views \n     into the matter. It has to apply the principles that are in \n     the Constitution to the situations that come before the \n     judiciary.\n\n  To quote Judge Alito again:\n\n       A judge can't have any agenda. A judge can't have any \n     preferred outcome in any particular case. And a judge \n     certainly doesn't have a client. The judge's only \n     obligation--and it's a solemn obligation--is to the rule of \n     law, and what that means is that in every single case, the \n     judge has to do what the law requires.\n\n  Judge Alito also understands that the Constitution provides justice \nfor all, for everybody. He told the committee this:\n\n       No person in this country, no matter how high or powerful, \n     is above the law, and no person in this country is beneath \n     the law.\n\n  He said:\n\n       Our Constitution applies in times of peace and in times of \n     war, and it protects the rights of Americans under all \n     circumstances.\n\n  Judge Alito understands the importance of the independence of the \njudiciary in our system of checks and balances. We ought to be careful \nto make sure that we only approve judges who understand that. His \ncolleagues believe Judge Alito will be an independent judge who will \napply the law and the Constitution to every branch of Government and \nevery person because Judge Alito knows that no one, including the \nPresident, is above the law. When I said ``his colleagues,'' I meant \nthose colleagues who testified before our committee and have worked \nwith him for a long time on that circuit.\n  One of his colleagues, Judge Aldisert, testified:\n\n       Judicial independence is simply incompatible with political \n     loyalties, and Judge Alito's judicial record on our court \n     bears witness to this fundamental truth.\n\n  Former Judge Gibbons, who now represents clients against the Bush \nadministration over its treatment of detainees in Guantanamo, doesn't \nbelieve that Judge Alito will ``rubber-stamp'' any administration's \npolicy if it violates the law and Constitution. He said:\n\n       I'm confident, however, that as an able legal scholar and a \n     fairminded justice, he will give the arguments--legal and \n     factual--that may be presented on behalf of our clients \n     careful and thoughtful consideration, without any \n     predisposition in favor of the position of the executive \n     branch.\n\n  Yet Judge Alito's critics claim he is out of the mainstream. That is \nwhat the debate last week was all about from the other side, that he is \na judge with an agenda hostile to individual rights, civil rights, \nwomen, and the disabled. The truth is, Judge Alito's record has been \ndistorted and mischaracterized. First, a statistical analysis that some \ntry to use of how many times a certain kind of plaintiff wins or loses \nis not the way we dispense justice in America. It is a bad way to look \nat a judge's record. It is easy to manipulate and cherry pick cases to \nreach certain desired conclusions of why somebody should not be on the \nbench. But the bottom line is, who should win in a case depends on the \nfacts presented in that specific case and what the applicable law says. \nWhat is important to Judge Alito is that he rules on specific facts in \nthe case and the issue before the Court, in accordance with the law and \nthe Constitution.\n  As his colleagues attested, Judge Alito doesn't have a predisposed \noutcome in cases. He doesn't bow to special interests but sticks to the \nlaw regardless of whether the results are popular. That is precisely \nwhat good judges should do and what good judging is all about.\n  Moreover, when you consider all these accusations, look at what the \nABA said. They unanimously voted to award Judge Alito their highest \npossible rating, and that is, in their words, ``well qualified.'' A \npanel of Third Circuit Court judges--I already referred to two of \nthem--who worked with Judge Alito more than 15 years, in their \ntestimony had unqualified support for Judge Alito as they appeared \nbefore the committee. These colleagues didn't see Judge Alito to be an \nextremist, hostile to specific groups, or with having a personal \nagenda. They testified about Judge Alito's fairness, his impartiality \nwith respect to all plaintiffs.\n\n  Judge Lewis, one I have not quoted yet, described himself to the \ncommittee to be ``openly and unapologetically pro-choice'' and ``a \ncommitted human rights and civil rights activist.'' But yet a person \ncoming from this end of the legal continuum fully endorsed Judge Alito \nto the Supreme Court, testifying:\n\n       I cannot recall one instance during conference or during \n     any other experience that I had with Judge Alito, but in \n     particular during conference, when he exhibited anything \n     remotely resembling an ideological bent.\n\n  The testimony of Judge Lewis continues:\n\n       If I believed that Sam Alito might be hostile to civil \n     rights as a member of the United States Supreme Court, I \n     guarantee you that I would not be sitting here today . . . I \n     believe that Sam Alito will be the type of justice who will \n     listen with an open mind and will not have any agenda-driven \n     or result-oriented approach.\n\n  Justice Aldisert summarized these judges' testimony best on the day \nthey appeared before the committee when he said:\n\n       We who have heard his probing questions during oral \n     argument, we who would have been privy to his wise and \n     insightful comments in our private decisional conferences, we \n     who have observed at firsthand his impartial approach to \n     decision-making and his thoughtful judicial temperament and \n     know his carefully crafted opinions, we who are his \n     colleagues are convinced that he will also be a great \n     justice.\n\n  What other conclusion can you come to when you listen to people who \nhave been close to him for a long time? We had a lot of people who \nworked with him on the court, who were not judges, who also appeared \nfrom both political parties. How can you come to any conclusion other \nthan Judge Alito is going\n\n[[Page S269]]\n\nto do what Justices on the Supreme Court ought to do based upon his 15 \nyears on the circuit court, that he is fair and openminded and will \napproach cases without bias and without a personal agenda?\n  The people who know Judge Alito best believe, without reservation, he \nis a judge who follows the law and the Constitution without a preset \noutcome in mind. They believe he is a man of great integrity, modesty, \nintellect, and insight. They believe he is a fair and openminded judge, \ncommitted to doing what is right rather than committed to implementing \na personal agenda.\n  After hearing all that, some of my colleagues ought to be ashamed of \nthe blue smoke they are making out of this nomination or the ghosts \nthey are putting up to scare us. Judge Alito will carry out the \nresponsibilities that a Justice on the Supreme Court should, and he \nwill do it in a principled, fair, and effective manner.\n  If Members have any doubt where I stand, I will cast my vote in \nsupport of Samuel Alito. This highly qualified nominee deserves to be \nconfirmed to the Supreme Court. I hope my colleagues will see that as \nwell and vote accordingly, particularly on a very tough vote because of \nthe extraordinary majority it takes to also vote to end a filibuster, \nthe first filibuster of the 110 nominees to the Supreme Court. \nHopefully, we will never see another extraconstitutional action taken \nby our colleagues on the floor of the Senate with such a filibuster \nonce again. Vote to end the filibuster late this afternoon and then \nvote to confirm Judge Alito tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, this is an incredibly important time in \nour Nation's history. This is the second Supreme Court nominee to come \nbefore the Senate in the past 6 months. We are truly at a time where we \nare making decisions that will affect our children, our grandchildren, \nand an entire generation of people. Sandra Day O'Connor, the first \nwoman Justice, and often the critical deciding vote, is retiring, as we \nknow. The nominee who will replace her will have the power to change \nthe direction of the Court and, as I indicated, touch people's lives, \naffect people's lives and opportunities for a generation.\n  I take this constitutional responsibility very seriously, as I know \nmy colleagues do. I have closely studied Judge Alito's written \nopinions, his testimony, as well as the hearing transcript. I commend \nSenators Specter and Leahy for conducting the hearings in a respectful \nand bipartisan manner. The Constitution grants all Americans, as we \nknow, the same rights and liberties and freedoms under the law, which \nis why it is so important that we get this right. These are the sacred \nvalues upon which the United States was founded--not just words, but \nthey are values, they are beliefs, they are the motivation for us as \nwe, together, fight for the things we want for our families and work \nhard every day as Americans to make sure this democratic process works \nfor everybody. We count on the Supreme Court to protect these \nconstitutional rights at all times, whether the majority agrees or \nwhether it is popular. Every American has the same rights under our \nConstitution.\n  Judge Alito's nomination comes at a time when we face new \ncontroversies over governmental intrusion into people's private lives, \nfrom secret wiretaps conducted without a warrant or the knowledge of \nthe FISA Court, to attempt to subpoena millions of Internet searches at \nrandom from companies such as Google. One of the most important \nresponsibilities of the Supreme Court is to serve as a check on \nexcessive Government intrusion into people's lives.\n  In light of where we are today and the issues that this Court will \nface, it is even more important to have a Justice who will stand up for \nAmericans.\n  Unfortunately, Judge Alito's record is clear and deeply troubling. \nWhen one looks at his writings, his court opinions from over 15 years \non the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, and when one looks at the \nhearing transcripts, there is a clear and consistent record of siding \nwith the government, siding with other powerful interests at the \nexpense of American citizens.\n  In case after case, whether it is about job discrimination, pensions, \nillegal searches, or privacy issues, he has been an activist judge who \nhas tilted the scales against the little guy. Often, he has been \ncriticized by his colleagues as trying to legislate from the bench in \norder to reach the result he desires.\n  His views are way outside the mainstream, especially in his dissent \nopinions. There are numerous cases where Judge Alito was the only \ndissenter, which means he felt strongly enough about his personal views \nthat he objected to what the other 10 judges supported and wrote his \nown separate opinion on an issue. These dissents give insight into what \nI believe is an extreme ideology on the most basic of American \nfreedoms, liberties, and rights.\n  Because of his extreme record and after much deliberation, I \nconcluded that Judge Alito is the wrong choice to replace Sandra Day \nO'Connor on the U.S. Supreme Court. He may well, as we know, be the \ndeciding vote on issues that affect our children and grandchildren and \nan entire generation.\n  His record on workers' protections is outside the mainstream. Our \nmanufacturers are struggling in Michigan, as well as across the \ncountry, and every day we see announcements of plant closings and \nfilings of bankruptcy. Michigan families are worried. They are worried \nthat they will not have a job tomorrow. They are worried that they are \ngoing to lose their pensions and their health care benefits for \nthemselves and their families. We in Michigan need a Supreme Court \nnominee who will stand with us, stand with Michigan's workers and \nfamilies, and Judge Alito is not that nominee.\n  In Belcufine v. Aloe, a company in bankruptcy did not give its \nemployees the retirement benefits and vacation time they earned before \nthe bankruptcy. Under Pennsylvania law, corporate officers are \npersonally liable for nonpayment of wages and benefits. The employees \nsued, and Judge Alito sided with the company, saying that the law did \nnot apply once a company filed for bankruptcy. Not only did he side \nwith the CEOs at the expense of their workers' hard-earned wages and \npensions, but he legislated from the bench to get the result he wanted.\n  Judge Greenberg, a Reagan appointee, wrote a strong dissent accusing \nJudge Alito of trying to rewrite the Pennsylvania law, stating:\n\n       [W]e are judges, not legislators, and it is beyond our \n     power to rewrite the [law] so as to create a bankruptcy \n     exception in favor of statutory employers merely because we \n     believe it would be good for business to do so.\n\n  Again, a colleague indicating that, in fact, Judge Alito was writing \nlaw instead of just interpreting the law.\n  In another case addressing pension benefits, the plaintiff had worked \nin jobs covered by the Teamsters pension fund from 1960 to 1971, had a \n7-year break in service, and then worked under the fund again from 1978 \nuntil his retirement. The majority on the court held that both periods \nof employment would be counted when you are calculating his pension \nbenefits, regardless of the break in service. If you are working and \nthen you need to take a break, whether it is illness, caring for a \nloved one--regardless of the circumstance--if you come back to work \nunder the pension system, you work until retirement, all of the years \nyou worked hard should be counted toward your pension.\n  Judge Alito dissented, arguing that the first period of employment, a \ntotal of 11 years of hard work, should not count, essentially cutting \nthe workers' pension benefits. If his dissent had prevailed--and thank \ngoodness it did not--workers across this country would have their \npensions cut, even if they worked 30 years in one job, if there was a \ngap in their employment. That is not right. If you work hard for 30 \nyears, you should get the entire pension you paid in and you have \nearned.\n  The majority once again admonished Judge Alito for ignoring the plain \nlanguage of the law and trying to legislate from the bench, reminding \nhim that:\n\n       Changes in legislation is a task for Congress and if our \n     interpretation of what Congress has said so plainly is now \n     disfavored, it\n\n[[Page S270]]\n\n     is for Congress to cure. We do not sit here as a policy-\n     making or a legislative body.\n\n  Judge Alito has had a clear and consistent record when it comes to \nsiding with corporate interests over working Americans and, in many of \nthese cases, he has been out of step with the majority of the court. He \ndissented on a case to pay reporters overtime pay under the Fair Labor \nStandards Act. He dissented from a majority opinion that found a \ncompany in violation of Federal mining safety standards on a site where \nthey were removing materials from a refuse heap and sending them to \npowerplants to be processed into electricity. These are laws that exist \nto protect working Americans, to protect their health and their safety. \nThe recent tragedies in West Virginia have reminded us of how important \nthis is, but Judge Alito argued that the safety standards did not apply \nto this site.\n  The same is true for workplace discrimination cases. Time and again, \nhe has voted to make it more difficult for victims of discrimination to \nget their day in court as Americans.\n  In Sheridan v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours, a hotel employee sued, \nclaiming sex discrimination. Over the years, she was promoted from a \npart-time waitress to a supervisory position. She received \ncommendations and bonuses for her work. But after she complained about \nsexual harassment, she was demoted, and her work environment got worse \nand worse.\n  The trial court dismissed the case, and by a vote of 10 to 1, the \nThird Circuit reversed, saying she had produced enough evidence to \nwarrant a jury trial of her peers. Judge Alito was the lone dissenter, \narguing that she had not presented enough proof and that her case \nshould be dismissed. When you are outnumbered 10 to 1, you really are \noutside the mainstream.\n  In another dissent, Judge Alito voted to deny a mentally retarded \nyoung man the chance to challenge severe abuse and sexual harassment. \nIn his very first job out of high school, he had suffered vicious \nsexual harassment. He was held down in front of a group of workers, \nsubjected to sexual touching, and he feared he would be raped. Judge \nAlito would have denied him a trial, not because the facts were \ndisputed but because he felt that the brief was not well written.\n  Judge Alito even joined an opinion preventing veterans from suing the \nFederal Government for failing to enforce a law which requires agencies \nto have plans in place to help veterans gain employment.\n  The Supreme Court is the ultimate check on Presidential overreaching. \nHowever, when he was at the Justice Department, Judge Alito advised to \nexpand Presidential power and argued that ``the President's \nunderstanding of a bill should be just as important as that of \nCongress.'' So, in other words, passing a bill for us is not enough; \nequal standing is what the President believes it says or wants it to \nsay or his opinion on what it says.\n  He recommended that when the President signs a bill passed by \nCongress, he should issue a signing statement announcing his \ninterpretation of the law in order to influence the court's \ninterpretation, essentially creating a backdoor line-item veto.\n  Why is this important? I had one particular case recently which I \nwill share with you, Mr. President. Last fall, Senator Vitter from \nLouisiana and I included an amendment in the 2006 Commerce-Justice-\nState appropriations bill to prevent the pharmaceutical industry from \ntaking advantage of the President's trade promotion authority to insert \nlanguage that prevents prescription drug importation.\n  A majority of us in the Senate and in the House believes that we \nshould be able to safely bring retail prescription drugs back into our \ncountry for our citizens at a much reduced price. There was also a \nnearly identical provision put in the House bill, and in the final \nbill, we basically were saying you can't use trade agreements to stop a \npolicy that is supported by Congress and use it as a backdoor way to \nstop the reimportation of less expensive prescription drugs for \ncitizens.\n\n  Even though this was in the final bill that came to the President's \ndesk, in his signing statement, the President stated that this section \nwas ``advisory.'' We passed a law--bipartisan, House, Senate--and it \ngoes to the President's desk. He signs it but states that this section \nis advisory and basically backdoor-vetoed this new law. The President \ncan't pick and choose which provisions of a law he will enact when he \nsigns a new law when it is passed by this Congress.\n  These views of Presidential power are troubling enough, but Judge \nAlito's record on the bench only reinforces his unwavering support for \nthe government's position in case after case. Whether it is the \nPresident of the United States or a low-level official, he has \nsupported the government's position at the expense of Americans' \nliberties and rights.\n  One of the most important issues we face today is personal privacy \nand freedom. We are having this debate in the Senate right now with the \nPATRIOT Act reauthorization, and we see it in the news reports with the \nJustice Department seeking unprecedented amounts of information on what \nAmericans look up on the Internet.\n  When has the government gone too far? It is a question we face in the \nSenate, and the Supreme Court will have to eventually answer. \nUnfortunately, in cases involving privacy, security, and protection \nfrom unjustified search and seizures, Judge Alito has consistently \nsided with the government interests.\n  As an Assistant Solicitor General in the Reagan administration, Judge \nAlito authored a memo on whether the Justice Department should file a \nfriend-of-the-Court brief in Tennessee v. Garner, a Supreme Court case \non the constitutionality of a Tennessee law which allowed police to \nshoot a fleeing suspect, even when the shooting was intended only to \nprevent the suspect from escaping and not to protect the officer or the \npublic from harm.\n  In this case, a 15-year-old boy broke into a house and stole $10 \nworth of money and jewelry. The police arrived while the boy was in the \nprocess of running away. They ordered him to stop. He did not stop. And \ndespite the fact they could see he was unarmed, the officer shot him in \nthe back of the head and killed him. The officer did not shoot this \nunarmed 15-year-old because he was a danger to others but to keep him \nfrom escaping.\n  The Sixth Circuit found that this law was unconstitutional, but in \nhis memo, Judge Alito argued that the case was ``wrongly decided'' and \nthat this was an issue that should be left to the State legislatures.\n  The Justice Department did not file a brief in this case, and the \nSupreme Court ultimately rejected Judge Alito's position and found the \nlaw unconstitutional, writing:\n\n       It is no doubt unfortunate when a suspect who is in sight \n     escapes, but the fact that police arrive late or are a little \n     slower afoot does not always justify killing the suspect. A \n     police officer may not seize an unarmed, nondangerous suspect \n     by shooting him dead.\n\n  In Doe v. Groody, Judge Alito dissented from a majority opinion \nwritten by now Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff to uphold \nthe strip search of a 10-year-old girl and her mother, even though \nneither was a criminal suspect, presented any risk or was named in the \nsearch warrant.\n  The search warrant specifically limited the search of persons to the \nsuspect, John Doe, but when police arrived, they only found Jane Doe \nand her 10-year-old daughter inside the house. They took the mother and \nthe little girl to another room and strip-searched them, having them \nlift their shirts, drop their pants, and turn around.\n  Judge Chertoff held that the warrant clearly limited police authority \nto the search of John Doe and not all occupants in the house. Judge \nAlito dissented, accusing the majority of a ``technical'' and \n``legalistic'' reading of the warrant. The warrant was clear, but Judge \nAlito argued for a broad departure from what was actually written in \nthe warrant in a way that would favor governmental intrusion.\n  I hear my colleagues from across the aisle saying over and over again \nthat they want judges who will follow the law and not legislate from \nthe bench. Judge Alito ignored the plain language of a search warrant \nin order to allow the strip search of a 10-year-old girl. How is this \nnot legislating from the bench?\n  Judge Chertoff certainly thought so. He criticized Judge Alito's view \nas threatening to turn the requirement of a search warrant into \n``little more than the cliche rubberstamp.''\n\n[[Page S271]]\n\n  In another case deeply concerning to me, a family of dairy farmers \nwas being forced off their farm by a bankruptcy court. This was in \nPennsylvania. It could easily have been in Michigan or anyplace else in \nthe Midwest. When they refused to leave their farm, seven U.S. marshals \nand a State trooper arrived at their home to evict them by pointing \nshotguns and semiautomatic rifles at the family. The marshals grabbed a \nfamily friend who was also at the house and used him as a human shield. \nThey put a gun to the man's back, led him into another house on the \nproperty, and told him: If anything goes wrong in here, you are going \nto be the first to go down.\n  The family sued, arguing that the marshals used excessive force. \nJudge Alito wrote an opinion saying it was reasonable for marshals, \ncarrying out an unresisted civil eviction notice, to point shotguns and \nsemiautomatic rifles at a family sitting in their living room. These \npeople were not criminals. They were not dangerous. They were dairy \nfarmers who had lost their home and their livelihood because of a \nbankruptcy.\n  Judge Alito also argued that putting a gun to the man's back and \nusing him as a human shield was not an unreasonable search under the \nfourth amendment because the marshals never told him that he wasn't \nfree to leave.\n  A fellow judge on the court dissented and called the marshals' \nconduct ``Gestapo-like'' since seven marshals had detained and \nterrorized the family and friends and ransacked a home while carrying \nout an unresisted civil eviction. But Judge Alito's decision made sure \nthe family never got a trial.\n  In another dissent, Judge Alito again would have allowed the invasive \nsearch of a mother and her teenage son based on a broad reading of a \nwarrant. Mrs. Baker and her three children arrived at the home of her \noldest son for dinner in the middle of a drug raid by police. The \nwarrant was limited to the search of her son's home, but when Mrs. \nBaker and her three children started walking up to the house, the \npolice threatened them with guns, handcuffed them, and dumped Mrs. \nBaker's purse out onto the ground. They then took her teenage son into \nthe house and searched him. Judge Alito once again dissented to keep a \njury from hearing whether the police acted unlawfully by handcuffing, \nholding at gunpoint, and searching a mother and her teenage children \nwho by happenstance walked up to visit the home of a family member.\n  This disregard for the personal privacy and freedom of Americans \nextends to the decision on a woman's right to choose, which affects \nevery woman in this country. In Planned Parenthood v. Casey, Judge \nAlito voted in dissent to uphold a law requiring a woman to notify her \nhusband before exercising her constitutional right to obtain an \nabortion. He argued that the spousal notification provision would only \nrestrict a small number of women and didn't substantially limit access \nto an abortion, even though the women affected may face physical abuse \nas a result of this requirement. The Supreme Court, including Judge \nO'Connor, affirmed that the spousal notification provision was \nunconstitutional, rejecting Alito's argument, comparing it to \nantiquated 18th century laws that said that women had no legal \nexistence separate from their husbands.\n  Justice O'Connor eloquently summarized the problem with Judge Alito's \nposition, writing, ``women do not lose their constitutionally protected \nliberty when they marry.''\n  These cases are not isolated instances. They are part of a long and \nconsistent record of siding with powerful interests over Americans--\npeople who have had their rights violated, people who have been \ninjured, people who have lost their pensions, people who have been \nvictimized and are asking the court to make things right, make things \nwhole, women in this country who want to know they are respected in \ntheir privacy and their most personal decisions, just like men.\n  For 15 years, Judge Alito has said no. A group of schoolchildren, \nages 6 to 8, were being sexually abused by their bus driver. Despite \nthe young age of the children and the fact that the driver had total \ncustody of them when they were on the bus, Judge Alito joined an \nopinion dismissing the case, arguing that the school superintendent did \nnot have a duty to make sure the children were protected because riding \nthe bus wasn't mandatory.\n  A disabled student had to drop out of medical school because of her \nsevere back pain that made it difficult for her to sit in classes for \nhours at a time. She had requested a special chair during class so she \ncould continue her studies and become a doctor. The school failed to \naccommodate her request, and the Third Circuit ruled that her case \nshould go forward, she should have her day in court. But Judge Alito \ndissented, arguing that the case should not go to trial; she should not \nget her day in court. The majority wrote that ``few if any \nRehabilitation Act cases would survive'' if Judge Alito's view \nprevailed.\n  A college student died at a varsity lacrosse practice. None of the \nteam's coaches were trained in CPR. The nearest phone was 200 yards \naway on the other side of a 8-foot fence, and there was no ambulance on \nthe field. The Third Circuit ruled to allow the case to move forward, \nfor the family to have their day in court. But once again, Judge Alito \nsaid no.\n  A worker suffered severe injuries after being thrown through the \nwindshield of a garbage truck after the brakes of the truck failed. He \nbrought a products liability lawsuit, arguing that the damaged \nhydraulic brake lines were a design defect. The Third Circuit ruled in \nfavor of the injured worker, but Judge Alito sided with the company.\n  When we take a step back and look at the entirety of Judge Alito's \nrecord, we see a systematic tilt toward powerful institutions and \nagainst the little guy; a long history of writing ideologically driven \ndissents that are not only out of step with the majority of his peers \non the Third Circuit but are way outside the mainstream of America.\n  Let me say in conclusion, whether it is a family losing their dairy \nfarm, workers losing their pensions, a mentally disabled young man who \nwas the victim of sexual harassment in the workplace, an unarmed 15-\nyear-old boy being shot dead in the back of the head, a strip search of \na 10-year-old girl, or the ability of a woman to make her own \nreproductive health decisions, Judge Alito has consistently said no to \nthe daily concerns of average Americans.\n  Now we are being asked not just to confirm a nominee who has spent 15 \nyears tipping the scales of justice against those Americans but to \nconfirm a judge who will replace Sandra Day O'Connor, a woman who was a \nconsensus builder, a uniter on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Based on this record, I cannot in good conscience cast my vote for \nSamuel Alito to be Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. The \nSupreme Court is the ultimate check on Presidential overreaching. And \nover and over again, we see this judge siding against Americans.\n  We can do better than this nominee at this critical time in American \nhistory, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting no on this \nnominee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, on countless nominations Democrats have \njoined Republicans and Republicans have joined Democrats to send a \njudicial nomination to the floor with a powerful, bipartisan vote. \nChief Justice Roberts came to the floor 13 to 5. Justice Breyer came to \nthe floor unanimously. Justice Ginsburg came to the floor unanimously. \nJustice Breyer won on the floor 87 to 9; Justice Ginsburg, 97 to 3; and \nChief Justice Roberts, 78 to 22.\n  But, in this case, Judge Alito comes to the floor in a straight party \nline, particularly divided vote. In a divided country, at a time of \nheightened partisan tensions, at a time of ideology often trumping \ncommon sense or broad public interest, the President has chosen to send \na Supreme Court nominee who comes directly out of a revolt by the \nideological wing of his party in order to satisfy their demand for \nideological orthodoxy.\n  Some people obviously delight in that. We have read about that today \nin the New York Times. And that is their right. But most don't. Most \ndon't think that is the way to pick a Supreme Court Justice. It doesn't \nmean it is good for the country, it doesn't mean it fills our current \nneeds, and it doesn't mean it is even the right thing to do.\n\n[[Page S272]]\n\n  As we approach this nominee, we can't forget that he was not the \nPresident's first choice. His first choice was Harriet Miers, and \nopposition to her nomination came not from Democrats but from the far \nright of the Republican Party. They challenged her ideological purity \nwith such conviction that the President capitulated to their demands \nand gave them Judge Alito instead--a nominee who they received with \ngleeful excitement.\n  Jerry Falwell ``applaud[ed]'' his appointment. Ed Whelan called it \n``a truly outstanding nomination.'' Rush Limbaugh called the nomination \n``fabulous.'' Ann Coulter and Pat Buchanan raved about how it would \nupset liberals. This rightwing reaction can only mean one thing: they \nknow what kinds of opinions Judge Alito will issue--opinions in line \nwith their extreme ideology.\n  All of this is to be contrasted with the standard set out by Justice \nPotter Stewart. He said:\n\n       The mark of a good judge is a judge whose opinions you can \n     read and . . . have no idea if the judge was a man or a \n     woman, Republican or Democrat, a Christian or Jew . . . You \n     just know that he or she was a good judge.\n\n  What he is saying is not really limited to the status of religion, \ngender, or politics, or any other trait by which we categorize people. \nHe is saying that a good judge through all their decisions shows no \ndiscernible pattern of identity that pigeonholes that judge except for \nthe purity of their legal reasoning, their genuinely open-minded \napproach to judging.\n  But in Judge Alito we do see patterns--patterns which demonstrate a \nbias towards the powerful, patterns which demonstrate a lack of \nskepticism towards government overreaching, and patterns which \ndemonstrate a hostility to the disadvantaged and the poor. This doesn't \nmean that Judge Alito never rules in favor of an individual suing the \ngovernment for an unlawful search or a minority suing a corporation for \nunlawful discrimination. But it does mean that in the overwhelming \nmajority of cases he has not. And this raises the question of whether \nhe approaches each case with an open mind or whether he comes with a \nbias that can only be overcome in the rarest of circumstances.\n  So why should the debate on Judge Samuel Alito continue now? Well, to \nbegin with, there hasn't been that much debate on this nomination in \nthe first place--a nomination of extraordinary consequence. It came to \nthe floor on Wednesday the 25th, and cloture was filed the very next \nday on Thursday. To this moment, not more than 25 Democratic Senators \nhave had a chance to speak. At this time, the Senate has spent a total \nof 25 hours on a nomination that will last a lifetime.\n  The direction our country will take for the next 30 years is being \nset now and this is the time for debate. This is the time when it \ncounts. Not after the Supreme Court has granted the executive the right \nto use torture, or to eavesdrop without warrants. Not after a woman's \nright to privacy has taken away. Is history going to care what we say \nafter the courthouse door is slammed in the faces of women, minorities, \nthe elderly, the disabled, and the poor? No. Except to wonder why we \ndidn't do more when we knew what was coming.\n  Obviously, I have heard some people try to argue that exercising our \nrights is ``obstructionist.'' But did people suggest it was \nobstructionism when the extreme rightwing of the Republican Party \nscuttled the nomination of Harriet Miers? How many times have we heard \nour colleagues come to the floor and demand that judicial nominees get \nan up-or-down vote? She never got an up or down vote. She never even \ngot a hearing. Yet a minority in the Republican Party was able to stop \na nominee that they considered unfit for the Supreme Court.\n  It is hardly obstructionist to use, as the former chair of the \nJudiciary Committee Senator Hatch described it, ``one of the few tools \nthat the minority has to protect itself and those the minority \nrepresents.'' That is exactly what we are doing here. That is why we \nhave the Senate and the rules we live by. We are protecting basic \nrights and freedoms that are important to every American: privacy, \nequality, and justice.\n  It is important to remember that the rights we are expressing concern \nabout didn't come easily. Access to the court house, civil rights, \nprivacy rights, voting rights, antidiscrimination laws--all of these \nwere hard fought for. They came with bloodshed and loss of life. Their \nachievement required courage and determination. None of these basic \nrights were written into law without a fight, and still today it \nrequires constant vigilance to make sure they are enforced and \nmaintained. That commitment for vigilance is one of the characteristics \nthat should leap out in a Supreme Court nominee.\n  We should remember that even though the 13th, 14th, and 15th \namendments outlawed slavery, provided for equal protection under the \nlaw, guaranteed citizenship, and protected the right to vote for \nAfrican American Americans, the fact is the Federal Government took \nvery little action to enforce them until the 1960s. Few politicians \nwere willing to take a stand--to fight for the rights of African \nAmericans. Something besides grassroots pressure was ultimately needed \nto prompt the Congress into action. That something was the unanimous \nSupreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education.\n\n  Imagine if the Court had not enforced the equality guaranteed by the \n14th amendment. Imagine if it still had the ideological outlook it had \nwhen Plessy was decided. Or when Dredd Scott was decided. Two of the \nmost ideologically driven--and regrettable--decisions ever. Segregation \nwould still be a fact of life. African American children would be \nforced to attend their own schools, would be receiving an inferior and \ninadequate education. And, there would have been no catalyst to start \nthe civil rights movement.\n  So a vote for a Supreme Court nominee is in fact a vote for the \nrights and freedoms we care about and fight for. That is exactly what \nthis vote is.\n  There is no question in anyone's mind. Samuel Alito will have a \nprofound impact on the Supreme Court. This is a pivotal moment in \nhistory for the Court. You only need to look at his past opinions to \nknow that much.\n  Let me share with you the story of David D. Chittister. On February \n14, 1997, David requested sick leave from the Pennsylvania Department \nof Community and Economic Development, where he worked. He was granted \nleave, but approximately ten weeks later, his leave was revoked, and he \nwas fired. David knew that the Family Medical Leave Act guaranteed him \n12 weeks of sick leave. So he sued the Pennsylvania Department of \nCommunity and Economic Development for firing him during that time.\n  Put yourself in David's shoes. Imagine that you become sick. You \nbecome so sick that you are hospitalized, completely unable to work. \nThe only reason that you can afford your treatment is because you are \nstill employed. And above all you believe that you are protected by the \nFamily Medical Leave Act.\n  Now imagine that Judge Alito is on the Supreme Court. He is one of \nthe nine voices that gets to decide whether the Family Medical Leave \nAct is constitutional. And he votes the way he did on the Third \nCircuit, invalidating that part of the Family Medical Leave Act which \nguarantees an individual 12 weeks of sick leave and applies to you. You \nare out of luck as you face mounting medical bills without any source \nof income.\n  This is not hypothetical. That is the decision he made. Health care \nis a very real problem for many more Americans than ever. Many of us \nhave been pushing for a national approach to health care for years. Our \ncitizens can't get the sick leave they need to take care of themselves. \nThey cannot get adequate health insurance--coverage isn't what it \nshould be. The Family Medical Leave Act was a step in the right \ndirection to deal with family values and health needs. It made sure \nthat people could take the time they needed when they became seriously \nill without losing their income. It was enacted with overwhelming \nbipartisan support in a 71 to 27 vote. But if Judge Alito were on the \nSupreme Court and he follows his own precedent, it would no longer \nprotect State employees.\n  So I ask my colleagues who voted for the Family Medical Leave Act: \ndidn't we do exactly want we meant to do? Didn't we need to protect all \nworkers? So is it right, now, to put a person on\n\n[[Page S273]]\n\nthe Supreme Court who will undo the good that we did with that \nlegislation?\n  Take another example. Many of us have talked on the floor about how \nJudge Alito routinely defers to excessive government power. And how he \nis willing to overlook clear fourth amendment violations in the \nprocess. This may seem abstract to a lot of people right now, but \nlisten to the facts of this case.\n  A family of farmers, the Mellotts, fell on hard times. They had to \ndeclare bankruptcy and were ordered to leave their farm--like a lot of \nfarmers these days. They asked for permission to appeal and were \ndenied. They asked that the judge be disqualified and were denied. They \ndidn't accept the eviction order and refused to leave their farm. So \nthe marshals were sent to evict them.\n  When Bonnie Mellott answered the front door, a deputy marshal \nentered, pointed his gun ``right in her face,'' pushed her into a \nchair, and kept his gun aimed at her for the remainder of the eviction. \nAnother deputy entered, ``pumped a round into the barrel'' of his \nsawed-off shotgun, pointed it at Wilkie Mellott, and told him ``to sit \nstill, not move and to keep his mouth shut.'' When he did this, the \nmarshals knew Wilkie Mellott was recovering from heart surgery.\n  But that wasn't all. Another marshal ran into the kitchen where a \nguest was on the telephone with a local sheriff. He ``pumped'' his \nsemi-automatic gun, ``stuck it right in [her] face and . . . said: `Who \nare you talking to, hang up the phone.''' When she continued talking, \nthe marshal put his gun ``to the back of her head'' and repeated the \norder.\n  I won't go into further details, but you get the picture. Now \nobviously the Mellotts were in the wrong to stay in their farm. They \nwere ordered by the court to leave, and they should have. We all \nunderstand that.\n  But there is no fact in evidence suggesting that once the marshals \ngot in the house there was resistance--no facts suggesting there was \nneed for force or intimidation. Nothing justified running into a house, \nwaiving sawed-off shotguns and screaming at the occupants. These folks \nweren't criminals. They weren't armed. They weren't resisting arrest. \nYou know what, it is tough enough to get kicked off your property; it \nis another thing to be treated like a felon, absent cause, with pumped \nshotguns shoved in your face. Most reasonable people would conclude \nthat the government's actions were excessive. But Judge Alito did not, \nand he wrote the majority opinion for two of the three judges hearing \nthe case calling the law enforcement conduct reasonable. The dissenting \njudge disagreed. He said that once the marshals arrived and realized \nthat the Mellotts were neither armed nor dangerous, the use of force \nwas ``clearly not objectively reasonable.''\n  Where do you come out on this? Which view do you want on our Supreme \nCourt?\n  Let me also share another story this one about Beryl Bray. Beryl was \nan African-American female who worked her way up from a room attendant \nto a Housekeeping manager for Marriott Hotels in less than three years. \nWhen the position of Director of Services opened up, Beryl applied. A \nCaucasian woman got the job, and Beryl sued claiming discrimination.\n  Now, as a Housekeeping manager, Beryl probably did not make a lot of \nmoney. She probably used a lot of her resources to bring her \ndiscrimination claim. She wanted her day in court. If Judge Alito had \nhis way, she wouldn't have gotten it. Critical facts were in dispute. \nFacts which, if resolved as Beryl claimed they should be, would \nestablish a clear case of discrimination. As the lawyers here know, the \nfactual disputes should have been resolved by a jury of her peers. \nBeryl was entitled to her day in court. Judge Alito, however, did not \nagree. He would have resolved the facts on his own in favor of Marriott \nHotels. He would have ended the case then and there.\n  Or let's talk about Harold Glass. Mr. Glass worked at Philadelphia \nElectric Company, of PECO as it is known, for 23 years before he \nretired. While working full-time, Harold attended school to improve his \ncareer opportunities. Over the years, he earned two associate degrees, \na bachelor of science degree in industrial and management engineering \nand a bachelor of science degree in engineering.\n  In addition to his full-time work and continuing education, Harold \nwas a long-time activist on behalf of PECO employees. In 1968, he \nhelped organize the Black Grievance Committee to respond to problems of \nracial fairness, including inadequate representation of minorities by \nPECO's uncertified labor organization. He served as an officer. He \nrepresented employees in handling routine individual grievances before \nmanagement and negotiated with management about employee concerns. In \naddition, he took the lead in organizing witnesses in three legal \nactions against PECO concerning racially discriminatory employment \npractices.\n  Over the years, Harold applied for promotions to new positions, but \neach time he was rejected. In addition, he was not able to apply for \npositions he would have liked to have because they were never posted by \nthe company. This despite the fact that, in 23 years of employment with \nPECO, Harold received only one performance evaluation which was less \nthan fully satisfactory--when he was serving as a junior technical \nassistant. Harold claimed that racial harassment at that time from his \ncoworkers and a hostile work environment had affected his job. But the \ntrial judge did not allow him to demonstrate these facts.\n  On appeal, a divided three-judge panel reversed the trial judge's \ndecision. Two of Judge Alito's colleagues believed that Mr. Glass \nshould have been allowed to present the evidence of racial \ndiscrimination to the jury. Judge Alito, however, disagreed. He thought \nthat allowing Mr. Glass to tell his side of the story might cause \n``substantial unfair prejudice.'' He called the trial judge's refusal \nto allow Mr. Glass's evidence ``harmless.''\n  Harmless. Was it harmless to Mr. Glass? What do you think? Do you \nthink its harmless error to keep a discrimination plaintiff from \nshowing evidence of discrimination? I think most reasonable people \nwould disagree with Judge Alito.\n  I believe that is the problem here: Judge Alito has demonstrated a \npattern of looking at discrimination claims with a high degree of \nskepticism. In the dozens of employment discrimination cases involving \nrace that Judge Alito has participated in, he ruled in favor of African \nAmericans on the merits in only two instances. He has never authored a \nmajority opinion favoring African Americans in such cases. He has \ndissented from rulings of his colleagues in favor of African-American \nplaintiffs, and in doing so has required an unrealistic amount of \nevidence before he is willing to step in on behalf of wronged \nindividuals. He is not willing to give them the benefit of the doubt \neven to just let a jury decide their case.\n  This is an unacceptable view of the way our country works. Americans \nknow that what sets us apart from almost any other country is the right \nof any citizen no matter where they come from, what their lot in life \nis to have their day in court. That is what makes America special. This \nlittle guy can hold the big corporations accountable.\n  Our nation is defined by the great struggle of individuals to earn \nand protect their rights--particularly the disadvantaged. We have \nworked hard to ensure that no one is denied their civil rights. Judge \nAlito's track record casts serious doubt on his commitment to that \nstruggle. The legislation we pass protecting individuals against \ndiscrimination requires the courts to fully enforce it. And we just \ndon't keep faith with ourselves if we empower individuals to sue large \ncorporations who act unlawfully and then have the courts refuse to hold \nthem accountable.\n  Judge Alito's hostility to civil rights claims is not my observation \nalone. It is an observation shared by many people who have reviewed his \nrecord. Let's not forget that after reviewing more than 400 of Judge \nAlito's opinions, law professors at Yale Law School--Judge Alito's alma \nmatter--concluded that:\n\n       In the area of civil rights law, Judge Alito consistently \n     has used procedural and evidentiary standards to rule against \n     female, minority, age and disability claimants. . . Judge \n     Alito seems relatively willing to defer to the claims of \n     employers and the government, over those advancing civil \n     rights claims.\n\n  That is the opinion of those who have studied his record. Similarly, \nKnight-\n\n[[Page S274]]\n\nRidder concluded that Judge Alito ``has worked quietly but resolutely \nto weave a conservative legal agenda into the fabric of the nation's \nlaws'' and that he ``seldom-sided with . . . an employee alleging \ndiscrimination or consumers suing big business.''\n  Judge Alito may believe that it is his duty to keep these types of \ncases away from the jury. He may, and in fact probably does, believe \nthat he is doing the right thing. That is his right. But, it is my \nright to judge the facts of these cases and disagree. It is my right to \nsay that the record of his reaction to the same facts should not be \nelevated to the Supreme Court.\n\n  A fair amount has been said about Judge Alito's endorsement of the \nunitary executive theory. This is a complicated and somewhat abstract \ntheory of constitutional interpretation, but if it is ever endorsed by \na majority of the Court, it will have a significant practical impact on \nour everyday lives.\n  What it says is that the President alone is responsible for enforcing \nthe laws. At its most simplistic, it seems somewhat reasonable: \nCongress makes the laws, the President enforces the laws, and the \njudiciary interprets the laws. The theory, in fact, dates back to the \nadministration of Franklin Roosevelt, and it has been championed by \nliberal and conservative scholars and administrations as a way of \nasserting the President's ability to retain control over independent \nagencies. But, use of the theory in recent times has been changing.\n  During Judge Alito's tenure, the Reagan administration developed new \nuses for the theory. It was used to support claims of limitless \npresidential power in the area of foreign affairs--including the \nactions that became the Iran-contra affair. And, this view of \nPresidential power has been carried on by the current Bush \nadministration, claiming in Presidential signing statements, that the \nPresident can ignore antitorture legislation overwhelmingly passed here \nin Congress. Not only is the substance of that message incredible, but \nthe idea that the President can somehow alter congressional intent--the \nmeaning of legislation agreed upon by 100 Senators--with a single flick \nof a pen is absolutely ludicrous. It turns the meaning of legislative \nintent on its head.\n  In the hearings, Judge Alito attempted to downplay the significance \nof this theory by saying it did not address the scope of the power of \nthe executive branch, but rather, addressed the question of who \ncontrols the executive branch. Don't be fooled by that explanation. The \nunitary executive theory has everything to do with the scope of \nexecutive power.\n  In fact, even Stephen Calabresi, one of the fathers of the theory, \nhas stated that ``[t]he practical consequence of this theory is \ndramatic.'' It is just common sense that if the unitary executive \ntheory means that the President can ignore laws that Congress passes, \nit necessarily expands the scope of Presidential power--and reduces the \nscope of Congress.\n  Judge Alito had numerous opportunities in the hearings to define the \nlimits of the unitary executive, but he refused to answer my \ncolleagues' questions. He didn't answer when Senator Leahy asked him \nwhether it would be constitutional for the Congress to prohibit \nAmericans from using torture. He didn't answer when Senator Durbin \nasked whether he shared Justice Thomas's view that a wartime President \nhas inherent powers--beyond those explicitly given to Congress. He \ndidn't answer when Senator Feingold asked what, if any, limits there \nare on the President's power.\n  We all understand that under article II, the President has primary \nresponsibility for the conduct of foreign affairs. But, the idea that \nthe President can simply disregard existing law or redefine statutory \nlimits at will in the areas of foreign affairs, national security, and \nwar is a startling one. And it is one that I cannot accept.\n  We needed to know what limits Judge Alito would place on the \nexecutive branch. We needed him to go beyond simple recitations of \nSupreme Court case law. We needed to know what he actually thought.\n  Sadly, however, Judge Alito did not give us those answers. In fact, \nhe failed to give us answers on many questions of critical importance. \nHe refused to answer questions from Senator Leahy, Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Feingold, and Senator Biden on the question of the power of the \npresidency. He refused to answer questions from Senator Schumer, \nSenator Durbin, and Senator Feinstein on whether Roe v. Wade was \nsettled law--an answer that even Chief Justice Roberts was willing to \ngive. He refused to answer Senator Leahy's questions on court \nstripping; Senator Leahy's and Senator Feinstein's questions on \ncongressional power and the commerce clause; Senator Feingold's \nquestions on affirmative action and criminal law; Senator Schumer's \nquestions on immigration.\n\n  These are all questions about issues that routinely come before the \nCourt. Judge Alito had an obligation to answer them. He had an \nobligation to explain and clarify the positions he took in his \nspeeches, judicial opinions, and Justice Department memoranda. But he \ndid not.\n  Why are we supposed to think that is OK? Since when is it acceptable \nto secure a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court by hiding behind \na smokescreen of nonanswers?\n  I understand that, for many, voting for cloture on a judicial \nnomination is a very difficult decision, particularly on this Supreme \nCourt nominee. I also understand that, for some of you, a nomination \nmust be an ``extraordinary circumstance'' in order to justify that \nvote. I believe this nomination is an extraordinary circumstance. What \ncould possibly be more important than this?\n  This is a lifetime appointment to a Court where nine individuals \ndetermine what our Constitution protects and what our laws mean. Once \nJudge Alito is confirmed, we can never take back this vote. Not after \nhe prevents many Americans from having their discrimination cases heard \nby a jury. Not after he allows more government intrusions into our \nprivate lives. Not after he grants the President the power to ignore \nFederal law under the guise of protecting our national security. Not \nafter he shifts the ideological balance of the Court far to the right.\n  As I have said before, Judge Alito's nomination was a direct result \nof the rightwing's vehement attacks on Harriet Miers, an accomplished \nlawyer whose only failing was the absence of an ideologically bent \nrecord. The rightwing didn't wait for the next nominee. The rightwing \ndidn't leave any of the tools in their arsenal unused. The rightwing \nattacked with every option available to them to prevent Harriet Miers' \nconfirmation, secure in their conviction that it was the right thing \nfor them to do.\n  We believe no less. And we should do no less. We did allow the \nconfirmation of three of the most objectionable appellate court \nnominees. There was no talk of prolonged debate on Chief Justice \nRoberts. Now we are presented with a nominee whose record raises \nserious doubt about serious questions that will have a profound impact \non everyday lives of Americans. What on Earth are we waiting for?\n  Many on my side oppose this nomination. They say they understand the \nthreat he poses, but they argue that cloture is different. I don't \nbelieve it is. It is the only way that those of us in the minority have \na voice in this debate. It is the only way we can fully complete our \nconstitutional duty of advice and consent. It is the only way we can \nstop a confirmation that we feel certain will cause irreversible damage \nto our country.\n  I will oppose cloture on the nomination of Judge Alito. And, I \nsincerely hope my colleagues will join me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nnomination of Samuel A. Alito, Jr., to be an Associate Justice of the \nSupreme Court. We are familiar with Judge Alito's academic and \nprofessional qualifications. He graduated from Princeton and Yale Law \nSchool, where he served as editor of its prestigious Law Journal. He \nspent his life serving his country as a captain in the Army Reserve, as \nan assistant, and then as U.S. attorney in New Jersey, and for the past \n15 years as a distinguished judge on the Third Circuit Court of \nAppeals, to name a few of his qualifications with which we are all \nquite familiar at this point in the process.\n  Equally important is his deserved reputation for fairness and for \nintegrity and his measured approach to the\n\n[[Page S275]]\n\nlaw. The American Bar Association, hardly a bastion of conservatism, \nfound this out during its exhaustive review of its record. The ABA \nsolicited the views of 2,000 people, including 130 Federal judges and \nevery Supreme Court Justice. After that, the ABA awarded Judge Alito \nits highest rating, unanimously well qualified. What that means is that \nevery member of the committee of the ABA gave Judge Alito the highest \npossible mark. It is like getting straight A+'s on your report card.\n  Let me repeat that since some who are watching and listening have \nundoubtedly heard the attacks by Judge Alito's most vociferous \nopponents: The ABA, the largest professional association of lawyers in \nthe country, found Judge Alito to be unanimously well qualified for the \nSupreme Court. In the past, this rating was referred to by our friends \non the other side of the aisle as the gold standard.\n  More insightful than the ABA's rating is the testimonials of those \nwho know Judge Alito best, his colleagues and his coworkers. Although \nthey possess different political philosophies, Judge Alito's colleagues \nenthusiastically praise him as ``thoughtful, intelligent, and fair'' \nand a judge who ``has a great respect for precedent-setting \ndecisions.'' To most people, that sounds like the kind of Justice we \nwould want on the Supreme Court.\n  Judge Timothy Lewis served with Judge Alito for 7 years during which \nJudge Lewis typically voted with the court's liberal members. He \nrecounted how when he joined the Third Circuit in 1992 he consulted his \nmentor, the late Judge A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr., who was a Carter \nappointee, a former chief judge of the court and a scholar of U.S. \nracial history. According to Judge Lewis, Judge Higginbotham said:\n\n       Sam Alito is my favorite judge to sit with on this court. \n     He is a wonderful judge and a terrific human being. Sam Alito \n     is my kind of conservative. He is intellectually honest. He \n     doesn't have an agenda. He is not an ideologue.\n\n  That is the late Judge Leon Higginbotham. Judge Lewis added his own \nexperience bore out Judge Higginbotham's evaluation. Judge Lewis said \nSam Alito ``does not have an agenda'' and ``is not result-oriented. He \nis an honest conservative judge who believes in judicial restraint and \njudicial deference.'' He ``faithfully showed a deference and deep \nrespect for precedent.''\n  That is liberal Judge Lewis of the Third Circuit.\n  Another former chief judge of the Third Circuit, Edward Becker, \nsimilarly praised Judge Alito. Here is what he had to say:\n\n       I found him to be a guy who approached every case with an \n     open mind. I never found him to have an agenda. I suppose the \n     best example of this is in the area of criminal procedure. He \n     was a former U.S. attorney, but he never came to a case with \n     a bias in favor of the prosecution. If there was an error in \n     the trial, or a flawed search, he would vote to reverse.\n\n  Judge Becker noted that Judge Alito is ``very principled, very \nanalytical, never decides more than he has to in a case. He does \nbelieve in judicial restraint in the way he writes opinions, with no \nideological overtones.''\n  The Third Circuit current chief judge, Anthony Scirica, succinctly \nsaid:\n\n        . . . whatever quality you think a judge ought to have, \n     whether it's scholarship or an ability to deliberate, or \n     fairness or temperance, Sam has each one of these to the \n     highest degree.\n\n  That is the current chief judge of the Third Circuit.\n  These reflections, which include three former or current chief judges \nof the Third Circuit, are echoed by Judge Alito's former law clerks, \nmany of whom are self-described committed Democrats. Jeff Wasserstein \nclerked for Judge Alito in 1998. Here is what he had to say:\n\n       I am a Democrat who always votes Democratic, except when I \n     vote for a green candidate--but Judge Alito was not \n     interested in the ideology of his clerks. He didn't decide \n     cases based on ideology.\n\n  Mr. Wasserstein recounts how in one criminal case the defense \nattorney had submitted a sloppy brief while the prosecutor had \nsubmitted a neat, presentable brief. Mr. Wasserstein says that in his \nyouth and naivete he suggested to Judge Alito it would be easy to \ndecide the case for the Government. But Judge Alito stopped him ``cold \nby saying that was an unfair attitude to have before I had even read \nthe briefs carefully and conducted the necessary additional research \nneeded to ensure that the defendant had received a fair hearing.''\n  Mr. Wasserstein's simple anecdote illustrates how Judge Alito \napproaches each case fairly and with an open mind. He observes that \nJudge Alito has a ``restrained approach to the law.''\n  Another former law clerk, Kate Pringle, who worked for Senator Kerry, \nwhom we heard speak a few moments ago, for his Presidential campaign, \ndescribes herself as a left-leaning Democrat and a big fan of Judge \nAlito's. She rejects the notion that Judge Alito is an ideologue, \nstating he ``pays attention to the facts of the cases and applies the \nlaw in a careful way. He is a conservative in that sense. His opinions \ndon't demonstrate an ideological slant.''\n  That is Kate Pringle, law clerk of Judge Alito and Kerry supporter \nfor President in 2004.\n  In light of the accolades from those who know him best, in light of \nhis brilliant academic and professional achievement, in light of \nreceiving the highest possible rating by America's largest association \nof his peers, the ABA, I was hopeful the Senate would provide Judge \nAlito with a fair and dignified process. Sadly, this has not been the \ncase.\n  In the Senate we have known for over 200 years, a judicial nominee \nwith Judge Alito's character, ability, and achievement would command a \nlarge bipartisan majority of support. Now it appears Judge Alito will \nnot get that tomorrow. Why is that? It is because there has been a \nchange in the standards by which the Senate considers qualified \njudicial nominees. In my view, it has not been a change for the better.\n  According to the New York Times, in early 2001, some of our \nDemocratic colleagues attended a retreat where law professors such as \nLarry Tribe and Cass Sunstein implored them to ``change the ground \nrules'' with respect to how the Senate considered judicial nominees by \ninjecting a political ideology test into the confirmation process. Soon \nafter that meeting, some of our friends initiated a premeditated and \nsustained effort of serial filibusters of circuit court nominees. We \nsaw a lot them. Those most passionate for this tactic thereby wrote a \nnew and sad chapter into the pages of Senate history.\n  Like many Republicans and Democrats, I had hoped this sad chapter of \ntrying to deny judicial nominees a simple up-or-down vote would recede \ninto memory as a mere footnote in a long and proud history of the \nSenate. Unfortunately, today some are trying to revive it with the \nAlito nomination.\n  We stand today on the brink of a new and reckless effort by a few to \ndeny the rights of many to exercise our constitutional duty to advise \nand consent, to give this man the simple up-or-down vote he deserves. \nThe Senate should repudiate this tactic, and it will have an \nopportunity to do that at 4:30 this afternoon.\n  There is a role for the filibuster for legislative matters. Although \nI may disagree with its application in a particular legislative case, I \nneither deny the tactic nor begrudge it when a colleague employs that \ntactic when there is good reason to do so. I have done so on many \noccasions myself. I have not seen a good reason for employing it in the \ncontext of judicial nominations. Nor did any Senate prior to the last \nCongress find that tactic should be employed for judicial nominations.\n  It certainly is not warranted in the case of Judge Alito. He is \nclearly qualified. His friends, his peers, and, indeed, his entire life \nstory tell us so.\n  During his hearings and despite the best efforts of those opposed to \nhis nomination, he acquitted himself admirably. Over 18 hours of \ntestimony he was asked 677 questions and was able to answer 659 of \nthem--truly an impressive feat. In doing so, Judge Alito demonstrated \nan impressive command of the law and a model judicial temperament.\n  Now, while Judge Alito conducted himself with grace and dignity, \nunfortunately, some Senators did not. In fact, those who listened most \nattentively to the outside pressure groups, such as one whose top \nlobbyist declared ``you name it, we'll do it to defeat Judge Alito,'' \ncould have learned a thing or two about grace and dignity\n\n[[Page S276]]\n\nby watching Judge Alito perform in the face of the most absurd and \nbaseless charges.\n  Despite the repeated efforts to caricature Judge Alito, the public's \nsupport for him only increased. After the hearing, the only thing the \nAmerican public was concerned about with respect to Judge Alito was the \nsometimes shabby treatment he received.\n  With Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Republicans resisted \nplaying base politics and instead measured those two nominees by the \ntraditional confirmation standard of integrity and legal excellence and \nnot a political ideology standard. We did not grandstand on the \ncolorful--to put it delicately--statements Justice Ginsburg had made \ndecades before her nomination such as possibly abolishing Mother's Day \nand Father's Day and statements about purported constitutional rights \nto prostitution and polygamy, to name a few. Nor did Republicans seek \nto disqualify Judge Ginsburg from further judicial service because of \nher longstanding leadership of the ACLU and the controversial positions \nit often takes.\n  And Republicans did not succumb to the idea of a reckless filibuster \nto gain the approbation of a newspaper or an interest group.\n  If Republicans had wanted to demagogue and defeat the Ginsburg \nnomination, we could have done the things to Justice Ginsburg that have \nbeen done to Judge Alito. In fact, with her highly controversial \nwritings and advocacy for the ACLU, it would have been a lot easier to \ndo so, but we exercised self-restraint and self-discipline for the good \nof the country.\n  In conclusion, I implore my Democratic friends to consider that to \nengage in these tactics is neither fair nor right. If this \nhyperpoliticization of the judicial confirmation process continues, I \nfear in this moment we will have institutionalized this behavior, and \nsome day we will be hard pressed not to employ political tests and \ntactics against a Supreme Court nominee of a Democratic President. In \nthat case, no one--Republican or Democrat--will have won.\n  I urge my colleagues to desist in this tactic of turning the \nconfirmation process of a judge into the functional equivalent of a \npolitical campaign. It is shortsighted, and we will mourn the day this \ntactic became the norm.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hatch). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, the Committee on the Judiciary has \nrecommended that we consent to the President's nomination of Samuel A. \nAlito, Jr. as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United \nStates. I concur in that recommendation. I am convinced that Judge \nAlito will make an outstanding addition to the Supreme Court and will \nbe faithful to his judicial oath in neutrally applying the law without \nimposing his personal, political or ideological views to circumvent the \nlaw or the Constitution.\n  First, I wish to commend Chairman Specter and my former colleagues on \nthe Judiciary Committee--including the Presiding Officer--for \nconducting nomination hearings which established clearly Judge Alito's \nfitness to serve on the Nation's highest Court. I followed closely \nJudge Alito's responses to questions during the hearings. I was \nimpressed by his profound patience, sincerity, and dedication to the \nethical restraints which compel all nominees to refrain from \nprejudicing any matter which may come before the court. Many of my \ncolleagues have complained that Judge Alito ``did not answer some \nquestions.'' Their real complaint rather, is that they simply didn't \nlike his answers. Judge Alito quite properly declined, as have all \nprior nominees to the Court, to address in advance specific matters \nwhich may come before them. As Judge Alito stated:\n\n       If a judge or a judicial nominee announced before even \n     reading the briefs or getting the case or hearing the \n     argument what he or she thought about the ultimate legal \n     issue, all of that would be rendered meaningless, and people \n     would lose all their respect for the judicial system, and \n     with justification, because that's not the way in which \n     members of the judiciary are supposed to go about the work of \n     deciding cases.\n\n  That statement, and the time-honored concept which it embodies, is \nprofoundly important. Surely, those of my colleagues who have \ncriticized Judge Alito in this regard know better. Surely, they do not \nwant Justices on the Court to signal in advance how they will rule on \ncases. To the extent they do, they will be judged by the American \npeople as perverting our constitutional system itself.\n  Others have criticized Judge Alito because he may hold personal, \npolitical, or ideological views. We all hold personal views. But the \nrole of a judge, unlike that of a legislator, is to apply the law \nwithout respect to his or her personal, political, or ideological \nviews. Judge Alito has demonstrated not only his ability to do this \nduring 15 years of service as a judge on the United States Court of \nAppeals for the Third Circuit, but his commitment to this principle in \nresponding to questions during his confirmation hearings.\n  Fidelity to the Constitution and commitment to the rule of law \nwithout respect to one's personal views is, at the end of the day, the \nonly principle that provides legitimacy to the Federal judiciary--the \nonly unelected branch of our government. The unelected status of the \njudiciary was, correctly, viewed with particular suspicion by the \nFounders, lest that unique status permit judges to impose their own \nviews under the guise of judicial decisions, without direct \naccountability to the American people. In a letter to Spencer Roan, \nMarch 9, 1821, Jefferson stated:\n\n       The great object of my fear is the federal judiciary. That \n     body, like gravity, ever acting with noiseless foot and \n     unalarming advance, [is] gaining ground step by step. . . . \n     Let the eye of vigilance never be closed.\n\n  And so that vigilance now rests upon this body. Let us be vigilant in \ninsisting that justices of the Supreme Court, and all other Federal \njudges who are presented to us, are sufficiently committed to the rule \nof law.\n  As I noted during my remarks concerning the nomination of Chief \nJustice Roberts at a time when too many of those in the judicial branch \nhave sought to use their lifetime tenured position to advance their own \npersonal, ideological, or political preferences in deciding matters \nwhich come before them; at a time when too many within the legal, media \nand political elites have sought to recast the role of the judiciary \ninto a superlegislature, approving of, and even urging judges to \nsupplant their views for those of the elected representatives of the \nAmerican people--we should be reminded that such actions and such views \non the part of some are anticonstitutional and contrary to the rule of \nlaw itself.\n  Describing his own fidelity to the Constitution and to the rule of \nlaw, Judge Alito told the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n       A judge can't have an agenda. A judge can't have a \n     preferred outcome in any particular case. And a judge \n     certainly doesn't have a client. A judge's only obligation--\n     and it's a solemn obligation--is to the rule of law, and what \n     that means is that in every single case, the judge has to do \n     what the law requires.\n\n  The standard for rendering advice and consent, which I outlined in my \nstatement concerning Chief Justice Roberts, is the standard I will \napply to Judge Alito as well. That standard--demonstrated commitment to \nthe rule of law and fidelity to the Constitution--is amply met by \nSamuel A. Alito, Jr. I am pleased to support his nomination and will \ncertainly vote to confirm him as Associate Justice of the Supreme \nCourt. I urge my colleagues to do likewise.\n  Make no mistake about it. The American people do not want to see an \nobstructionist attitude in their legislative body. The American people \nare not benefited by an obstructionist attitude. An obstructionist \nattitude towards Judge Alito means not moving forward with affirming a \ncloture vote and then confirming Alito to be Associate Justice of the \nSupreme Court. The American people are best served by a bipartisan \nattitude in this body. I hope when the cloture vote is made at 4:30 we \nwill see not just the 60 votes needed to not allow a filibuster but \nthat we will see a strong bipartisan vote in support of moving ahead \nwith giving Judge Alito an up-or-down vote on the floor of the\n\n[[Page S277]]\n\nSenate. And tomorrow morning, when we consider the confirmation of \nJudge Alito, I certainly hope that once again we will see a strong \nbipartisan vote confirming Judge Alito as the next Associate Justice of \nthe Supreme Court.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from New \nMexico have allotted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority controls the time until 2 p.m.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield myself the time until 5 minutes of 2, and I ask \nunanimous consent that Senator Alexander and I be permitted to use 5 \nminutes of that time to speak to an unrelated subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Protecting America's Competitive Edge\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I rise to speak about a very \nimportant issue, the competitiveness of the United States and our \nfuture standard of living and whether we are going to develop the \nbrainpower in America to meet the challenges of the future.\n  I compliment two Senators who initiated this endeavor--Lamar \nAlexander of Tennessee and Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico. They asked me, \nas chairman of the Energy Committee, if they could pursue a study with \nrecommendations about how to achieve competitiveness. They did that. \nNow we have the results of that evaluation in a major report \nhereinafter to be called the Augustine report, named after Dr. \nAugustine, former president of Lockheed Martin. Many people know of him \nin many capacities. That report recommends 20 specific ideas to get \nAmerica back on the track of competitiveness in the world.\n  Today I want to tell Senators and the world that in a day of \nconfrontation and partisanship the implementation of that study is \nencapsulated in three bills. The bills now have 53 cosponsors. Of \nthose, 29 are Republicans, 24 are Democrats. The bills are S. 2197, S. \n2198, and S. 2199. Three Senators of the 23 have cosponsored only one \nportion.\n  At this early date, to have that many cosponsors is rather historic. \nThis means we are going to proceed with the legislation. I am going to \nyield some time now to the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, \nclosing by saying that the essence of this report says: America, \nproduce better brainpower in math, science, and physics; produce more \nengineers of all types; produce more research in basic science; cause \nbusiness to invest through tax credits--and do it as soon as possible. \nWithout this, the report says, we will perish.\n  Lastly, I want my friend from Tennessee to listen to just one fact. \nWe have at various times attempted to equate what we do with what we \nought to do. Jeffrey Immelt, CEO of GE, recently shocked a DC audience \nwith a troubling statistic. He said:\n\n       If you want good manufacturing jobs, one thing you could do \n     is educate more engineers. We had more sports exercise majors \n     graduate than electrical engineering majors last year.\n\n  Based on that statistic, he added:\n\n       If you want to be the massage capital of the world, you are \n     well on your way.\n\n  That is very interesting. With that, out of my time, I yield to the \nSenator from Tennessee 3 or 4 minutes to speak to this bill, which is \ncalled the PACE legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico. \nFirst, there is nothing more important, along with the war on terror, \nthan finding a way to keep our jobs from going to China, India, and \nother countries around the world. They have figured out how to increase \ntheir standard of living, and it has to do with brainpower.\n  What I want to say today is, first, I congratulate Senator Domenici, \nwithout whose leadership this would not have gotten to first base. He \nencouraged Senator Bingaman and I to go to work. He got our meeting \nwith the President. It was he who presided over our homework sessions \nwith the administration. It is he who has taken the leadership with \nSenator Bingaman on this bill to have 55 cosponsors prior to the \nPresident's speech tomorrow night. So I thank him first.\n  Second, I reiterate where this idea came from. It came not from \nSenators, not from lobbyists, nor from this or that clique. Senator \nBingaman and I asked the people who should know--the experts at the \nNational Academies--sthe answer to this question: exactly what do we \nneed to do to keep our advantage in science and technology over the \nnext 10 years so we can keep our jobs? They answered that question with \n20 specific recommendations involving kindergarten through the 12th \ngrade education, higher education, basic research, maintaining an \nentrepreneurial environment. These are ideas that many Senators on both \nsides of the aisle have advocated for several years, but the fact that \nthe National Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Medicine, and the \nNational Academy of Engineering joined together to say ``here is the \nblueprint'' is the reason this idea has gone so far. What it does is \nhelp keep our edge in science and technology.\n  I am looking forward to the President's remarks tomorrow night. It is \nmy hope that he makes the Augustine report and the whole idea of \nkeeping America on top and keeping our edge in science and technology a \nfocus of his speech and of his next 3 years.\n  So it is my privilege today to ask unanimous consent on behalf of \nSenators Domenici, Bingaman, and myself to add as cosponsors Senators \nLautenberg, Johnson, McConnell, Snowe, and now Senator Specter of \nPennsylvania, who have asked to be added to S. 2197, S. 2198, and S. \n2199 as cosponsors, as well as Senator Reed of Rhode Island who has \nasked to be added as a cosponsor of S. 2197, so that we now have 54 \ncosponsors of these important pieces of legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter \nfrom Senator Bingaman and myself, encouraged by Senator Domenici, to \nthe National Academy of Sciences on May 27, 2005, and a two-page \nsummary of the Domenici-Bingaman-Alexander-Mikulski legislation, which \nhas 54 cosponsors, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 27, 2005.\n     Dr. Bruce Alberts,\n     President, National Academy of Sciences,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Dr. Alberts: The Energy Subcommittee of the Senate \n     Energy and Natural Resources Committee has been given the \n     latitude by Chairman Pete Domenici to hold a series of \n     hearings to identify specific steps our government should \n     take to ensure the preeminence of America's scientific and \n     technological enterprise.\n       The National Academies could provide critical assistance in \n     this effort by assembling some of the best minds in the \n     scientific and technical community to identify the most \n     urgent challenges the United States faces in maintaining \n     leadership in key areas of science and technology. \n     Specifically, we would appreciate a report from the National \n     Academies by September 2005 that addresses the following:\n       Is it essential for the United States to be at the \n     forefront of research in broad areas of science and \n     engineering? How does this leadership translate into concrete \n     benefits as evidenced by the competitiveness of American \n     businesses and an ability to meet key goals such as \n     strengthening national security and homeland security, \n     improving health, protecting the environment, and reducing \n     dependence on imported oil?\n       What specific steps are needed to ensure that the United \n     States maintains its leadership in science and engineering to \n     enable us to successfully compete, prosper, and be secure in \n     the global community of the 21st century? How can we \n     determine whether total federal research investment is \n     adequate, whether it is properly balanced among research \n     disciplines (considering both traditional research areas and \n     new multidisciplinary fields such as nanotechnology), and \n     between basic and applied research?\n       How do we ensure that the United States remains at the \n     epicenter of the ongoing revolution in research and \n     innovation that is driving 21st century economies? How can we \n     assure investors that America is the preferred site for \n     investments in new or expanded businesses that create the \n     best jobs and provide the best services?\n       How can we ensure that critical discoveries across all the \n     scientific disciplines are predominantly American and \n     exploited first by firms producing and hiring in America? How \n     can we best encourage domestic firms to invest in invention \n     and innovation to meet new global competition and how can \n     public research investments best supplement these private \n     sector investments?\n       What specific steps are needed to develop a well-educated \n     workforce able to successfully embrace the rapid pace of \n     technological change?\n\n[[Page S278]]\n\n       Your answers to these questions will help Congress design \n     effective programs to ensure that America remains at the \n     forefront of scientific capability, thereby enhancing our \n     ability to shape and improve our nation's future.\n       We look forward to reviewing the results of your efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n     Lamar Alexander,\n       Chairman, Energy Subcommittee.\n     Jeff Bingaman,\n       Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            PACE Act: Protecting America's Competitive Edge\n\n       Focuses on keeping America's science and technology edge--\n     as much as 85 percent of our per capita growth in incomes \n     since World War II has come from science and technology.\n       Helps America continue to set the PACE in the competitive \n     world marketplace.\n       Keeps our brainpower edge by strengthening K-12 math and \n     science education, attracting bright college students to the \n     sciences and investing in basic research.\n       In a package of three bills, the PACE Act implements 20 \n     recommendations contained in an October report by the \n     National Academy of Science titled ``Rising Above the \n     Gathering Storm.''\n       Protecting America's Competitive Edge through Energy Act \n     (PACE-Energy): Increasing our investment in energy research \n     and in educating future American scientists.\n       Protecting America's Competitive Edge through Education and \n     Research (PACE-Education): Investing in current and future \n     math and science teachers and K-12 students, attracting \n     bright international students, and investing in non-energy \n     related basic research.\n       Protecting America's Competitive Edge through Tax \n     Incentives (PACE-Finance): Doubling the research & \n     development tax credit and allowing a credit for employee \n     education.\n\n\n                    Key Provisions of the PACE Acts\n\n     Strengthening the nation's traditional commitment to research\n       More research opportunities for scientists and engineers: \n     Increases basic research spending by up to 10 percent per \n     year for seven years at several federal agencies, including \n     the national laboratories. This investment would generate \n     hundreds, maybe thousands, of new inventions and high-tech \n     companies.\n       Targeted research grants for early career scientists and \n     engineers: Creates a special research fund for 200 \n     outstanding young researchers across the nation each year.\n       New federal funds to buy equipment and upgrade research \n     laboratories: Provides a special pool of funds for the \n     nation's research infrastructure to purchase updated research \n     equipment and upgrade lab capabilities.\n       A New Agency for Transformational Energy Research: \n     Establishes a new research agency within the Department of \n     Energy tasked with developing transformational energy \n     technologies that bridge the gap between scientific discovery \n     and new energy innovations. This agency would be patterned on \n     the management practices of a Pentagon research agency \n     (DARPA) that contributed to innovations like the Internet, \n     stealth technology and global positioning systems.\n       High-Risk, High-Payoff Research: Directs federal research \n     agencies to develop guidelines that allow eight percent of \n     R budgets to be devoted to high-risk, high-payoff research \n     which falls outside the peer review and budget allocation \n     process.\n     Improving K-12 Science/Math Education\n       Scholarships for Future Teachers of Math & Science: Each \n     year, up to 10,000 bright students would receive a 4-year \n     scholarship to earn a bachelor's degree in science, \n     engineering or math, while concurrently earning teacher \n     certification. In exchange for these scholarships, they would \n     be expected to serve for at least four years as a math or \n     science teacher.\n       Math & Science Teacher Training Programs: Funds part of the \n     costs for new math and science teacher training programs \n     based in math and science departments at universities across \n     the country. These programs will stress a solid content \n     knowledge of their subject while also providing the training \n     necessary for teacher certification.\n       Summer Academies for Teachers: National laboratories and \n     universities across the country would host 1-2 week academies \n     each summer for up to 50,000 math and science teachers so \n     they can get some hands-on experience and take back new, \n     improved ideas for energizing their students.\n       Advanced Placement Courses in Math & Science: The federal \n     government would provide funding to help establish non-profit \n     organizations to promote Advanced Placement (AP) classes in \n     math and science--tripling the number of students who could \n     join these college-preparatory programs that consistently \n     produce the highest achievers.\n       Specialty Math & Science High Schools: States would be \n     eligible to apply for a grant from the federal government to \n     help establish a new high school specializing in math and \n     science that students from across each state could attend.\n       Internships and Summer Programs for Middle and High School \n     Students: Provides unique internship and program \n     opportunities for middle and high school students at national \n     labs and other technology and scientific research facilities.\n     Increasing the Talent Pool by Improving Higher Education\n       Scholarships and Fellowships for Future Scientists: Each \n     year, up to 25,000 bright young Americans would receive a 4-\n     year competitive scholarship to earn a bachelor's degree in \n     science, engineering or math, so that our brightest students \n     pursue studies in these fields which are so critical to our \n     economic growth. Up to 5,000 students who have already earned \n     their bachelor's degree, would compete to receive graduate \n     research fellowships to cover education costs and provide a \n     stipend.\n       Attracting the Brightest Foreign Students to our \n     Universities: Provides an efficient student visa process for \n     bright foreign students to come here to study math, \n     technology, engineering and science and then to stay here--\n     contributing to our economic growth rather than being forced \n     by an outdated immigration system to go home and produce the \n     best new technology in India or China.\n     Growing our Economy by Providing Incentives for Innovation\n       Doubling the Research & Development Tax Credit to Encourage \n     Innovation: Doubles the current R tax credit and makes it \n     permanent--so companies conduct ground-breaking, job-\n     producing research here, rather than building new facilities \n     overseas.\n       Creating a Tax Credit to Encourage Employers to Invest in \n     Employees' Education: Establishes a new tax credit to cover \n     costs from providing continuing education to employees--so \n     employees can learn cutting-edge skills.\n       Development of Science Parks: Supports the development of \n     science parks through infrastructure planning grants and loan \n     guarantees so that U.S. science parks are competitive with \n     those throughout Asia.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me say what a privilege it is today \nto speak once again to the nomination of a Supreme Court Justice and to \nthe advice and consent function of the Senate.\n  I came here in 1972, so there have been a lot of men and women \nnominated to the Supreme Court of the United States. In my time here, I \nhave voted to confirm them all. I based my vote, first, on the fact \nthat the President of the United States recommended them and second, on \nwhether they were qualified. I determined whether they were qualified \nbased upon outside evaluations and personal observations of those who \nknew, trained and taught that particular nominee. For example, I found \nJustices Ginsburg and Breyer, who were confirmed 96-to-3 and 87-to-9, \nto be qualified. In my opinion, neither of those judges, based upon the \nway the Senate is doing things these days, would have come close to \ngetting those kinds of votes. As a matter of fact, for those who \nthreaten filibuster, I believe there is a serious question.\n  If filibusters would have been the rule of the day, at least one of \nthose nominees might very well have been filibustered, and the \nfilibuster might have been successful. But that wasn't the way things \nwere done.\n  Qualification was the question upon which we based our decisions; \nthat has changed. Rancor has taken the place of reason. Partisanship \nhas taken the place of responsibility and fairness. At every step of \nthe process with this nominee, the American people have seen what a \nconfirmation process can turn into if it is not vested and fair, but is \ninstead full of what can be considered as almost hatred, almost fire \nand brimstone. Our colleagues have focused on the negatives of \neverything, however small or irrelevant. Currently, the trend is not to \ndo what we have done, which has resulted in some great judges, but \nrather to be fed by the flames of partisan special interests that want \nassurances--they want guarantees.\n  I personally believe this is a dangerous course, and I hope and pray \nthat this will be the last time we follow such procedure. But I doubt \nthat it will be, although I believe such actions are wrong. Rejecting \nthe judicial philosophy tests being urged by some is absolutely \nimperative.\n  When we apply the appropriate test of qualification, there is no \ndoubt that Judge Alito is qualified. He is qualified to be a Supreme \nCourt Justice. The American public realizes this and that is why they \noverwhelmingly indicate that we should get on with this and vote. It is \nclear that there has been no nominee--and the occupant of the chair has \nseen many--that has spread before the eyes of the Congress and the \npublic more about themselves, their record, their philosophy, their \nvote,\n\n[[Page S279]]\n\ntheir rationale, and their ethics than this man.\n  The President, indeed, took a big chance with this nomination because \nto have that much of a record and have a vote and all that goes with it \nhere was, indeed, a giant risk. But it paid off because Judge Alito is \nwhat he purported to be--a scholarly, terrific judge, who is without \nany question, distinguished.\n  My second point concerns ``guarantees.'' I believe some members of \nthe Judiciary Committee questioned this judge in an effort to get some \nguarantees about how he would vote. It is amazing to consider some of \nthe Supreme Court Justices who have been approved by the Senate based \non their testimony and their record, which were presumed to be \ncommitments or guarantees as to how they would vote. We can look back \nto Justice Warren from California as well as two or three members of \nthe Court right now. Those who voted for such judges could have, \nindeed, thought they were getting guarantees, and it has turned out not \nto be the case. Those judges' philosophy, their votes, and everything \nelse has been different on the Court than what they appeared to be \nguaranteeing during the confirmation process.\n  There are no guarantees. Those who are making this a partisan fight \nwon't say: We don't have any guarantees, on Roe v. Wade and many other \nissues, that Judge Alito will vote the way we want him to--they won't \nsay they are doing that. They will use other words like ``I am \nbothered,'' but that is really their argument.\n  Now, as to the cloture vote this afternoon--we are going to do that. \nI have never had to make that vote in 34 years--on 11 Supreme Court \nnominees. I never had to make that vote. Why? Because this Senate has \nnot used the filibuster on Supreme Court Justices. Some people say, oh, \nyes we have, or, yes, we almost did. But we did not, and we surely \ndidn't when a majority was for the man or woman. That is the case here.\n  To have to take this route, I believe the process is headed in the \nwrong direction. To require cloture is not the way to do it. It is not \nin tune with the history of the Senate. It contradicts the significance \nof this body as a fair-minded, deliberative body. I regret to say that \nwith no particular people in mind. If the shoe fits, fine. If it fits \nno one, fine. But this has turned into nothing more than a political \nwar. Those who are going to vote to continue debate, many of them know \nthat this man is as qualified as anyone we are going to get. He is as \nassured to make as good of decisions on behalf of the American people \nas anyone we are going to get. And he is equally as assured to vote \ndifferent than many of us who will vote for or against him expect. Of \nthat, I have no doubt.\n  I regret that it has taken us so long to confirm Judge Alito. I \nregret that it has turned into the spectacle that it has. But perhaps \ntoday we will invoke cloture, change things from where they are to \nwhere they should be, and with an up-or-down vote tomorrow, this \ndeserving, honest, well-informed, good man will be confirmed.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Presiding Officer knows that I don't \nalways agree with him or he with me, but in response to the Senator \nfrom New Mexico about the process here, the Presiding Officer was \nexemplary in how Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg were chosen to be \nmembers of the Supreme Court. There have been books written about it \nand chapters of books written about it.\n  The Presiding Officer, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, in \ncommunication with President Clinton, said: I don't like this person, \nthis person, this person. And so there was a process set up, nonpublic \nin nature, where the chairman of the Judiciary Committee conferred with \nthe President and his people and waded through lots of names that, in \nthe judgment of the distinguished Senator from Utah, were not \nappropriate. Now we have two Members on the Supreme Court whom I think \nhave distinguished themselves.\n  I wish we could have a procedure like that in the future. I think, I \nrepeat, it was exemplary. That is the way things used to be done. I \nwould hope in the future that the President's men and women would be \nwilling to meet with their counterparts in the Senate and come up with \na procedure that is somewhat along the lines of the distinguished \nSenator from Utah. I would hope that would be the case.\n  The hearings of Ginsburg and Breyer were short and directly to the \npoint. I hope in the future we can do more of that. I extend my \napplause and congratulations to the Senator from Utah. No matter what \nhappens in the future regarding the long career of the Senator from \nUtah in the Senate, this, as far as I am concerned, will be an \nimportant chapter in his public service.\n\n\n               The President's State of the Union Message\n\n  Mr. President, tomorrow night, the President of the United States \nwill come to the Capitol and deliver his fifth State of the Union \nAddress. This is an important moment for the President and for the \ncountry. Some say, reading the op-eds over the last week or so, this \nmay be the most difficult speech the President will ever give.\n  The President comes to the Capitol in the midst of also what some \nwrite about as the greatest culture of corruption since Watergate. \nPublic trust has dropped significantly in this culture in Washington, \nand I need not run through all the problems, but I will run through \nsome of them.\n  The majority leader in the House of Representatives was convicted \nthree times of ethics violations. They even went so far as to change \nthe rules so he could stay in his position after having been indicted. \nThey changed the rules back because the hue and cry of the American \npeople was so intense.\n  For the first time in 135 years, someone is indicted working in the \nWhite House. Mr. Safavian, appointed by the President to handle \nGovernment contracting--hundreds of billions of dollars a year--is led \naway from his office in handcuffs as a result of his dealings with Jack \nAbramoff and others.\n  So I think in his speech, the President is obligated to the American \npeople to show that he is committed to restoring the bonds of trust and \nrepairing the damage done by this corruption.\n  Americans know the country can do better today, and after the year we \nhad, a year of trying to privatize Social Security, Katrina, failures \nin Iraq, Terri Schiavo, and a heavy heart I have, Mr. President, as a \nresult of how a good woman was--I would not say destroyed because she \nwas not; she is stronger than that. But Harriet Miers, how she was \ntreated is unbelievable. A good woman was treated so poorly, and the \npeople who tried to destroy her are the ones being rewarded now with \nthe Alito nomination. Then, of course, this past year we had Medicare \nprescription drugs come into being, which is a puzzle that no one can \nfigure out.\n  So the American people, after this year we have had, simply will no \nlonger be able to blindly accept the President's promises and give him \nthe benefit of the doubt.\n  Americans will be looking past his rhetoric tomorrow night and taking \na hard look at the results he intends to deliver. The President's State \nof the Union Message is a credibility test. Will he acknowledge the \nreal state of our Union and offer to take our country down a path that \nunites us and makes us stronger, or will he give us more of the same \nempty promises and partisanship that has weakened our country and \ndivided Americans for the last 5 years?\n  If he takes the first approach, together, Democrats and Republicans \ncan build a stronger America. If he gives us more of the same empty \npromises and Orwellian doublespeak, we know he intends to spend 2006 \nputting his political fortunes ahead of America's fortunes. We need a \nfresh start, and I hope President Bush realizes that tomorrow night.\n  There is much more at stake in his speech than poll numbers. Empty \npromises will no longer work. We need a credible roadmap for our \nfuture, and we need the President to tell us how together we can \nachieve the better America we all deserve.\n\n  Our first signal that the President intends to move our country \nforward will come in his assessment of the state of our Union. It is \nnot credible for the President to suggest the state of the Union is as \nstrong as it should be. The fact is, America can do much better. From \nhealth care to national security,\n\n[[Page S280]]\n\nthis Republican corruption in Washington has taken its toll on our \ncountry. We can see it in the state of our Union.\n  What is the state of our Union? The state of our Union is that we are \nless safe in this world than we were 4\\1/2\\ years ago because the White \nHouse has decided protecting its political power is more important than \nprotecting the American people.\n  We are the wealthiest Nation in the history of the world. Shouldn't \nwe be the healthiest? Frankly, we are not because this administration \ndecided to take care of the big pharmaceutical companies, the drug \ncompanies, the HMOs, managed care, instead of 46 million uninsured.\n  We have a national debt climbing past $8 trillion. I have a letter I \nreceived a short time ago from the Secretary of the Treasury saying the \ndebt is at $8.2 trillion and we need to raise it more. Over $9 trillion \nis what they are asking because the President squandered the strongest \neconomy in the history of this country with reckless spending and \nirresponsible tax breaks for special interests and multimillionaires.\n  We have an addiction to foreign oil that has climbed steadily over \nthe last 4 years and doubled the price of heat for our homes and gas \nfor our cars because the Vice President let big oil companies write our \nenergy policy. And we have too many middle-class families living \nliterally on the financial cliff. All statistics show the rich are \ngetting richer, the poor are getting poorer, and the middle class is \nsqueezing smaller and smaller all the time.\n  The economic policies of this administration over 5 years has placed \nthe needs of the wealthy and well connected ahead of working Americans.\n  If President Bush is committed to making America stronger, he will \nacknowledge these facts Tuesday night. He will admit the steep price \nAmericans have paid for this corruption, and he will proceed to tell us \nhow he can make our country stronger.\n  Our second clue that the President is committed to moving America \nforward will come in his remarks about national security. Tomorrow \nnight, it is not credible for the President to tell us he has done all \nhe can to keep Americans safe for the last 5 years. We know that \nbecause we have had vote after vote on the Senate floor to take care of \nour chemical plants, our nuclear power facilities, to check the cargo \ncoming into this country, what is in the belly of that airplane in the \ncargo, and vote after vote, on a strictly party-line basis, we have \nlost.\n  For all of this tough talk, President Bush's policies have made \nAmerica less safe. His failed record speaks for itself.\n  Osama bin Laden, the man who attacked us on 9/11, remains on the \nloose because, in his rush to invade Iraq, the President took his eye \noff the ball when we had him cornered in a place called Tora Bora, \nAfghanistan.\n  As a result, he is gone. We don't know where he is, and he continues \nto threaten us today in his taunting, vicious, evil manner.\n  Then there is the President's ``axis of evil.'' Four years ago, the \nPresident declared Iraq, Iran, and North Korea an ``axis of evil'' \nwhose nuclear threats posed risk to the American people, and he was \nright. Well, mostly right. Instead of pursuing the correct policy to \nmake it safer, he invaded Iraq. Now two members of the ``axis of \nevil''--North Korea and Iran--are more dangerous, and after spending \nbillions of dollars and losing 2,300 American lives, we found out that \nthe third, Iraq, didn't pose a nuclear threat at all.\n  Then there is what this President has done to our military. Not only \nhas he failed to properly equip our troops for battle--we know the \nstories are all over the country about 80 percent of our people who \nhave been injured--that is 18,000 and 2,300 dead--80 percent of them \nwould have been hurt less, many lives would have been saved had they \nhad the body armor that was available.\n  According to the Pentagon's independent studies, the Pentagon is \nstretched--stretched in a manner, as indicated in the paper today, as \nhaving mass advancements in rank, which they have never done before, \nbecause they are trying to keep people in the military, among other \nthings. Our forces are stretched entirely too thin.\n  The President's poor planning and refusal to change course in Iraq \nhas made progress in 2006 harder to achieve. He has made it more \ndifficult to spread democracy around the world because he has been \nundermining it right here at home.\n  As Katrina made clear, he failed in the 4 years after 9/11 to prepare \nAmerica for the threats we face. New Orleans could have been anyplace \nin America. The difference with Katrina is we had warning it was \ncoming. But other threats, that won't be the case.\n  America can do better. Tomorrow night, the President needs to provide \na new way forward. Partisan attacks will only divide us. What we need \nis for the President to rally the country around our most important \ngoal: protecting our people and our way of life.\n  Democrats have always been willing to work with President Bush to \nmake America more secure. We know our national security policy is not \nthe place for political games. Democrats look forward to hearing how \nthe Commander in Chief will govern and hope we have seen the swagger \nand partisanship of the ``campaigner in chief'' for the last time.\n  Our third signal that President Bush understands what it will take to \nmake the State of the Union strong will come when he talks about health \ncare. Again, we are the wealthiest Nation in the history of the world. \nShouldn't we be the healthiest? We are not. Because of the President's \ninaction on health care over the last 5 years, America faces a health \ncare crisis of staggering proportions. There are 46 million Americans \nwith no health insurance and millions more who are underinsured.\n  The cost of health care premiums has doubled since 2001. \nManufacturing giants, such as Ford and General Motors, are laying off \ntens of thousands of people for lots of reasons, but one reason is \nhealth care costs have skyrocketed.\n  With a record such as that, it is not credible for the President to \nclaim he has a vision to make health care affordable. He needs to \npresent us new ideas that will move America forward, not trot out the \nsame tired old policies that serve special interests and not the \nAmerican people. Press reports, I fear, indicate we are in for the same \nold tired ideas. It is rumored that President Bush will again focus on \nsomething called health savings accounts.\n\n  This administration has taught me that what I learned in college \nstudying George Orwell has some validity today. We have Orwellian \ndoublespeak such as the Healthy Forests Initiative, one piece of \nlegislation that was for clearcutting of trees and other things to make \nour forests less healthy; our Clear Skies Initiative, which polluted \nthe skies; Leave No Child Behind, which is leaving children behind; and \nthe Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. Talk about Orwellian doublespeak; \nusing the President's own numbers, the Deficit Reduction Act increased \nthe deficit by $50 billion.\n  Now he comes up with Health Savings Accounts. That is classic Bush \ndoublespeak. It is not a credible solution to the health care crisis. \nThis plan will force most Americans to spend more on health care while \nmaking it less available to millions of others. HSAs are nothing more \nthan another giveaway to the same people the President has favored over \nhard-working Americans for the past 5 years. In fact, remember Social \nSecurity privatization? HSAs, or Health Savings Accounts, are a lot \nlike that. They do nothing to solve the real problem. They make the \nsituation worse for the American people and they create a financial \nwindfall for the President's friends: HMOs, insurance companies and, of \ncourse, Wall Street, that will set up all these accounts.\n  We do not need the President to offer more of the same on health \ncare. We saw with the President's Medicare prescription drug plan that \nhis policies too often put special interests ahead of the American \npeople. Ask any senior citizen today about how the Medicare plan has \nhelped them. Even if they could work a crossword puzzle out of the New \nYork Times on Sunday, which is the hardest, day after day after day, \nthey still couldn't solve the Medicare Program of President Bush. It is \nimpossible.\n  What we need is a new direction, one that puts families first. \nDemocrats believe that addressing the health care crisis is not just a \nmoral imperative, but it is also vital to our economic security and \nleadership in the world.\n\n[[Page S281]]\n\nEvery day we go without reform is another day America takes another \nstep backward from a position as global leader.\n  For our families, we must make health care affordable and accessible. \nFor our businesses, we must remove the burden of skyrocketing costs \nthat is holding our businesses, our economy, and our workers back in \nthe global marketplace.\n  Our fourth clue that the President knows what America needs will come \nin his remarks about the economy. After all we have seen in the past 5 \nyears, it will not be credible for the President to claim our economy \nis growing, that his plan to reduce his deficits--and I say his \ndeficits--is working, and that Congress is to blame for spending and \nbad decisions. The truth is, the fiscal nightmare we see today belongs \nto President Bush and President Bush alone.\n  I love to watch golf on TV. I know I am not like a lot of people, I \nshould be watching football or basketball or something. I love to watch \ngolf on TV. It is a game of chess. Yesterday, Tiger Woods--this guy is \nfantastic. He is seven strokes behind after the first day. He has a bad \nday yesterday and wins the tournament. He has a bad day and wins the \ntournament.\n  I mentioned records--he holds all kinds of records. That was the 47th \ntournament he won--quicker than anyone else, of course. He just turned \n30 years old. He won the Buick Open four times. That is what he won \nyesterday. He holds record after record. I mention these records \nbecause President Bush holds all the records. The highest deficit, he \nholds them all. There is not a close second. He has them all.\n  It is not a record the American people envy, such as that of Tiger \nWoods. His financial record has bankrupted this country. We are going \nto be asked in a couple of days to increase the deficit ceiling--over \n$8.2 trillion.\n  Here is another doublespeak Orwell would be proud of we are likely to \nhear tomorrow night. I am sure we are going to talk about the Bush \ncompetitive agenda. The President can talk all he wants about making \nAmerica competitive, but for 5 years he has done nothing to keep \nAmerica in the game. From what we have read in the press, this plan \nsounds like more empty rhetoric from a President who has spent 5 years \nslashing the funding we need to stay on the cutting edge. He shut the \ndoors to thousands of college students by supporting cuts in student \naid. He has allowed our country to fall further behind our trading \npartners. It is no accident what is happening in South America. \nPresident Reagan, President Clinton, and the first President Bush \nworked hard to democratize Central and South America. These countries \nare losing their democracy edge because we have so neglected them.\n  He has lavished billions on big oil instead of investing in American \ntechnology and know-how to make us more energy independent. We need to \nhear new economic ideas tomorrow night. The President needs to tell us \nhow he is going to begin paying down the debt, his debt, so our \nchildren and our grandchildren do not pay the price for his reckless \nfiscal record.\n\n  It is so startling to me that Republicans--when I started my \npolitical career, they were the ones concerned about deficits. They \nhave created them. They don't complain about them. It is stunning to \nme. The President has not vetoed a single spending bill. Of course, he \nhasn't vetoed anything, but why should he? We don't have separate \nbranches of Government while he is here; the Republican Congress does \nwhatever he wants. Maybe beginning the sixth year that will not be the \ncase.\n  We need the President to speak honestly about tax relief, about \nmiddle-class families and how they deal with these energy prices. The \ntruth about the Bush tax cuts is multimillionaires stand, with his \nnewest proposal, to get over $100,000 while the average working family \nwill receive pennies on that. The President's priorities are upside \ndown. It is time for him to join us and bring fairness to our Tax Code.\n  Democrats are ready to work with President Bush, but he needs to \ncommit to policies that put the needs of hard-working Americans first. \nOne final signal that President Bush is committed to making America \nstronger will come on the issue of reform. Because of connections to \nthe culture of corruption and stonewalling about Jack Abramoff, it is \nnot credible for President Bush to claim the moral high ground on \nvalues as an honest government. President Bush needs to set an example, \nif he is going to lead our country forward tomorrow night. He needs to \ncome clean about his connections to corruption, with Abramoff--as \nRepublicans have called for. Hagel, Thune--Republican Senators have \ncalled for this. Too many Republicans have shown in recent days that we \nare going to obscure the facts and move on.\n  There is legislation pending. We do not need a task force. We need \nSenators Lieberman and Collins to go ahead with the hearings and decide \nwhat needs to be done. Our legislation may not be perfect, but it is \nlegislation we need to start with.\n  It is Republicans who control the White House where men are willing \nto break the law and ignore America's best interests so they can \nprotect their political power. Safavian, Libby, Rove--it is Republicans \nwho control the Congress which sold its soul to special interests and a \nRepublican rightwing base, a base that has its sights set on stacking \nour courts with extremist judges. They have acknowledged that. It has \nbeen K Street, the so-called K Street Project, that has conspired with \nlawmakers to put the well connected first, going so far as having them \nnot hire Democrats to work as representatives.\n  We have a plan to reform Washington. We need to bring it to the \nSenate floor. We need to do that. President Bush has to join with us. \nAnything less, we will know the President has no interest in changing \nhis ways and making America stronger.\n  The President faces a tremendous test tomorrow night. It is up to him \nto prove to the American people he intends to denounce the culture of \ncorruption that has come to Washington since he arrived and change \ndirection in 2006. Democrats are ready to work with President Bush in \norder to move our country forward because we believe that together, \nAmerica can do better. So tomorrow night I hope President Bush will \njoin us in putting progress ahead of politics so we can have a State of \nthe Union that is as honest and strong as the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the \nPresident's nomination of Samuel A. Alito, Jr., to the Supreme Court of \nthe United States. I am pleased to have an opportunity to discuss this \nand to present reasons why my conclusion is going to be as it is.\n  It is no secret that Judge Alito is from my home State and I was \nhonored to introduce him to the Judiciary Committee. I talked with him \nprivately in my office. He is an accomplished jurist from a \ndistinguished family in New Jersey, and at that hearing our colleague \nfrom Pennsylvania, Chairman Arlen Specter, asked me if I was endorsing \nJudge Alito for this position and I told him I was just presenting \nevidence to the committee and I will let the record speak for itself. I \nwas not going to make any prejudgments. I wanted to hear from Judge \nAlito. I wanted to listen to his answers to my colleagues' questions.\n  This nomination, as all are when it comes to the Supreme Court, is an \nincredibly important moment for our Nation--particularly because Judge \nAlito has been nominated to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. \nJustice O'Connor, over the past 25 years, has proven she is not an \nideologically conservative Justice or a liberal Justice. She has not \nbrought an agenda to the Court. That is why Justice O'Connor has been \nsuch an important swing vote--because she always studied the facts and \nthe law and tried to apply them fairly.\n  I did not always agree with her. But, like many Americans, I knew she \ncame at these legal questions fairly and with an open mind. She showed \nrespect for precedent. She put the law above her personal beliefs. In \nmy view, it is critical that we replace Justice O'Connor with someone \nwho shares her openminded approach of looking at the law and the facts \nwith no political agenda. Even the mere threat of legal activism on \nthis Supreme Court threatens the future of this country and the rights \nof our children, our grandchildren, and other generations.\n\n[[Page S282]]\n\n  Many legal experts--judges, lawyers, professors--have contacted me \nregarding this nomination. Some supported him, some opposed him. Many \nof these experts tried to convince me one way or the other. But when I \nlistened to Judge Alito's hearings in the Judiciary Committee, I \nlistened with the faces of my grandchildren in my mind; with the \nthoughts of ordinary people who depend on the fairness of our society. \nI was applying Judge Alito's philosophy to the real problems of \neveryday people--in New Jersey and across the Nation.\n  I often hear many concerns from my constituents about how powerless \nthey feel in the face of insurance companies that are often indifferent \nto their plight, or as an employee unfairly treated in the workplace. \nWhat rights do everyday Americans have in the face of giant \ncorporations or unchecked Government power? At the hearing, it was \nclear that Judge Alito almost always lined up against the little guy \nand with the big corporations and Government. That is the side he came \nout on. In fact, the Knight-Ridder study of Judge Alito's rulings \nshowed that he ``seldom sided with . . . an employee alleging \ndiscrimination or consumers suing big business.''\n  The Washington Post analysis of all divided opinions on the Third \nCircuit involving Judge Alito found that he ``has sided against three \nof every four people who claim to have been victims of discrimination'' \nand ``routinely . . . defers to government officials and others in a \nposition of government authority.''\n  I don't think that is what our Founders wanted when they designed the \nConstitution.\n  I want to give two examples. In Bray v. Marriott, an African-American \nmotel worker in Park Ridge, NJ, alleged discrimination against her \nemployer. The Third Circuit ruled that she deserved her day in court \nbecause there was enough evidence of discrimination. But Judge Alito \ndissented, citing concerns about the cost of trials to employers. \nListen to that--citing concerns about the cost of trials to employers. \nI wonder if the Constitution makes any reference to that or does it say \neverybody should have equal rights when it comes to hearing their case \nin the courtroom?\n  The other judges in that case criticized Judge Alito's dissent, \nsaying that if it were law, then the employment discrimination laws \nwould have no real effect.\n  In another case, Sheridan v. Dupont, Judge Alito was the only judge \nof 11 judges who heard the case to find against a woman's claim of \ngender discrimination. Judge Alito stated that the alleged victim \nshould not even get a trial. That is absolutely contrary to what our \ncountry is about. This is a nation of laws. The other judges were so \ndistressed by Judge Alito's decision that they said ``the judicial \nsystem has little to gain by Judge Alito's approach.''\n  So if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court we ask ourselves the \nquestion: Will Judge Alito make it more difficult for the everyday \npeople to protect themselves and their families against the power of \nbig business and unchecked Government? Do they need the help? Is that \nwhat we are talking about when we enact laws here? I hope not.\n  Unfortunately, it appears almost certain.\n  Regarding individual rights, there was a very disturbing exchange in \nthe hearing involving the Constitutional right to reproductive choice.\n  Senator Durbin asked Judge Alito if he would agree with Chief Justice \nRoberts' statement that the right to choose is ``settled law.'' It \nseems to me that it was a ``no-brainer''--of course it is settled law. \nIt has been on the books for 33 years and upheld 38 times.\n  You don't have to go to law school to figure that one out.\n  But Judge Alito refused to say it was ``settled law.'' To me it was a \ntelling moment in the hearings.\n  I am not a lawyer, but I understand this: The right to choose is \nsettled law. That means that is the law as it is seen by Judge Roberts, \nChief Justice.\n  Judge Alito's refusal to acknowledge that the right to choose is \nsettled law indicates to me that, even before he sits on the Supreme \nCourt, he intends to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n  That is the interpretation I make from that.\n  For everyday New Jerseyans, especially our State's women, that would \nbe the realization of a nightmare. We do not want to turn back the \nclock on women's rights. Even if abortions become illegal, they will \nstill happen--but largely in unsafe conditions. It's a nightmare that I \ndo not want to risk happening.\n  Then there is the issue of abuse of power and the power of the \nPresidency.\n  Growing up in New Jersey, it is clear that our state is proud of our \nrole in the American War for Independence. More battles of the \nRevolutionary War were fought in New Jersey than in any other state. \nThe most famous image of that war is George Washington crossing the \nDelaware River at Trenton.\n  New Jersey is a state of immigrants. Many New Jerseyans came to \nAmerica to escape kings, despots and dictators. So we understand why we \nfought the War of Independence to get rid of King George.\n  America doesn't want a king or an ``imperial President.'' Neither \ndoes New Jersey. That's why we have three co-equal branches of \ngovernment.\n  So when Judge Alito talked about his theory of a ``unitary \nexecutive''--a President above the other two branches of government--I \nfound that very troubling.\n  The Father of our Nation, George Washington, warned the American \npeople about allowing a leader to claim too much power. In his farewell \naddress to the nation, Washington indicated his concern about the \nPresidency becoming too powerful.\n  He said we should avoid allowing:\n\n       the exercise of the powers of one department to encroach \n     upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate \n     the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to create, \n     whatever the form of government, a real despotism.\n\n  Those are Washington's words. But they have a real resonance today.\n  The current administration claims a power beyond the laws that \nCongress has set. It is an administration that believes it can spy on \nAmericans without a warrant, despite specific laws to the contrary. \nThese are the kinds of abuses that caused the citizens of New Jersey \nand the other American colonies to rise up against King George\n  We don't want a King. And we don't want to create a Supreme Court \nthat will crown this President--or any future President--Republican or \nDemocratic.\n  The question before us is not a generic question of whether Judge \nAlito is qualified for the Supreme Court. The real question is whether \nJudge Alito is the right person for this seat on the Supreme Court. The \nseat at issue is Sandra Day O'Connor's seat. It is a seat held by a \nmiddle of the road, balanced justice.\n  As I noted during my testimony introducing Judge Alito to the \nJudiciary Committee: he is a young man. If the Senate confirms him for \na lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court, he might serve for three \ndecades--or even longer. His decisions would affect not only our \nrights, but also the rights of our children, our grandchildren and \nother future generations.\n  That's why, after careful consideration and deliberation, I have \ndecided to vote no on the confirmation of Judge Alito. He is a good, \ndecent man--an ethical man. I do not think he subscribes to any bigoted \nviews. But I believe there is a grave risk that he carries a legal \nagenda with him, one that he will bring to the Supreme Court.\n  I don't think this is a black-and-white issue. I think it is a gray \nissue. If there is a gray issue, if there is doubt about where we are \ngoing to come out, I want to decide on protecting women's rights and \nprotecting ordinary people in fairness before a court of law.\n  While there will be law professors and others who will disagree with \nmy analysis, as I said before, I am more concerned about the effect of \nthis nomination on everyday people in New Jersey and across the \ncountry.\n  I am proud that there is a Federal courthouse in Newark that carries \nmy name. It was while I was absent from the Senate a while that that \nwas done. But I fought hard to get an inscription placed on the wall of \nthat courthouse. I wrote it. It reads:\n\n       The true measure of a democracy is its dispensation of \n     justice.\n\n  This Nation of laws has to continue to be just that, and people have \nto know that they are treated fairly and that their personal rights are \nprotected and that they can bring courses of action if their rights are \ndamaged.\n\n[[Page S283]]\n\n  I believe in that quote. It guides me today.\n  For the parents fighting an insurance company for access to health \ncare for their child, for the blue-collar worker facing harassment in \nthe workplace, for women who want government's hands off their bodies, \nfor everyday people, I will oppose this nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise, for the first time in this body, \nto speak on the nomination of Samuel Alito to serve on the Supreme \nCourt of the United States. No matter one's political persuasion, we \nall take pride in the honor that has been bestowed on a fellow New \nJerseyan.\n  Samuel Alito's story is one that rings familiar to so many New \nJerseyans, including myself. His parents came to this country in search \nof opportunity, and worked hard to build a better life for their \nchildren. The son of immigrants, Judge Alito's life is a story that \ndemonstrates the power of seizing opportunity and working hard.\n  Frankly, it is a story close to my own heart. I too, am the son of \nimmigrants who came to New Jersey to seek a better life and greater \nopportunity. Thanks to their hard work, and my own, I was the first in \nmy family to graduate from college and law school.\n  Yet home State pride is not a sufficient reason for supporting a \nnominee. For a Supreme Court appointment is a life-time appointment. \nWhen the Supreme Court decides, it is the law of the land and their \ndecisions affect the lives of millions of Americans. So, it's not where \nyou come from that matters, but where you will take the nation.\n  Sam Alito has served his entire legal career in public service, and \nfor that he is to be commended. His work as a prosecutor and as an \nappellate judge for the past 15 years has given him substantial \nexperience. In his hearings and his meeting with me, he demonstrated \nthat he has a keen intellect. Judged simply by that standard, Sam Alito \nis ready to serve.\n  But competence and intellect is the very least we should expect from \nsomeone seeking a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the \nland. Indeed, competence alone might be enough for a nominee for one of \na myriad of other appointments. But this is about the Supreme Court of \nthe United States. The Supreme Court, alone among our courts, has the \npower to revisit and reverse its previous decisions. So surely, we \nshould also demand that our justices fairly interpret the law, respect \njudicial precedent, and properly balance the rights of individuals and \nthe power of the state. Above all, we should demand that they check \ntheir personal beliefs at the door.\n  The seat that Judge Alito hopes to fill is one of great importance. \nJustice O'Connor has been the deciding vote in key cases protecting \nindividual rights and freedoms on a narrowly divided Court, and the \nstakes in selecting her replacement are high. I have not agreed with \nevery one of her decisions. But she has shown throughout her tenure a \nrespect for law over ideology and a commitment to deciding each case \nnot on the personal views she brought to the bench, but on the facts \nbefore her. When some on the court sought to inject an activist \npolitical philosophy into judicial decision-making and to turn back the \nclock on the liberties afforded the American people under the \nConstitution, it was Justice O'Connor who blocked their path.\n  I had hoped Judge Alito would clearly demonstrate that he shares the \ncommitment to protecting the individual rights and freedoms that \nJustice O'Connor so often cast the deciding vote to defend. Decades of \nprogress in protecting basic rights, including privacy, women's rights, \nand civil rights, are at stake with this nomination. The burden was on \nJudge Alito to be forthright and unambiguous in his answers.\n  Unfortunately, his testimony was not reassuring and his record makes \nclear what kind of justice Judge Alito would be. A justice who would \nvote to overturn a woman's right to choose, a justice who has time and \ntime again sided with corporations and against average Americans, a \njustice who would allow this administration to continue to stretch and \npotentially violate its legal and constitutional authority. Especially \nwith the challenges our Nation faces today and will face tomorrow, \nAmerica cannot afford that kind of justice.\n  We live in extraordinary times today. President Bush has sought the \naccumulation of unprecedented powers. He has asserted the authority to \nnot only torture detainees and indefinitely detain American citizens as \nenemy combatants, but to also conduct warrantless wiretapping of \nAmerican citizens.\n  At different times throughout our country's history, Presidents under \nthe cloak of Commander-in-Chief have exercised excessive authority that \nhas eroded individual rights and freedoms in the name of protecting the \nNation. Over 200 years ago, our Founding Fathers purposely established \nour Nation's government with three distinct coequal branches to help \nprevent this concentration and abuse of power. An independent \njudiciary, part of our country's long and proud history of checks and \nbalances, is the only thing that stands between the executive branch \nand these potential threats to our rule of law.\n  In 2004, the Supreme Court stood up for the rule of law when it found \nthat the President cannot ignore the Constitution and confine American \ncitizens indefinitely without the ability to challenge their \ndetentions. Decisions such as this, which recognize that our Nation's \nsecurity is enhanced rather than undermined by respect of the rule of \nlaw, are what has always made the United States the envy of people \naround the world.\n  The bias Judge Alito has shown in favor of the executive branch \nthreatens to undermine the freedoms that our judiciary has historically \nprotected. From his work as a government lawyer to a speech before the \nFederalist Society in 2000, he consistently favors the concentration of \nunprecedented power in the hands of the President, even endorsing the \nso-called ``unitary executive'' theory that even many conservatives \nview as being at the fringe of judicial philosophy. It virtually gives \nthe presidency exclusive powers that historically have belonged to \neither Congress or the courts. This theory is an activist theory, not a \ntheory that reflects mainstream American thinking or values. In fact, \nthe Supreme Court has largely rejected it.\n  Judge Alito has also backed granting absolute immunity to high-\nranking Government officials who authorized illegal, warrantless \nwiretaps of American citizens, which is another position the Supreme \nCourt has rejected. As far back as the Reagan administration, he has \nadvocated that the President issue signing statements in an effort to \nshape the meaning of legislation. President Bush has often used this \npractice, most tellingly in December when he claimed the administration \ncould ignore the new law banning torture whenever he sees fit. This \nundermines one of the coequal branches of our government, the people's \nelected representatives of the United States Congress.\n\n  Judge Alito has found against congressional authority when he argued \nin dissent in United States v. Rybar against a ban on machine guns that \nfive other appellate courts and the Third Circuit itself upheld. Judge \nAlito also authored the majority opinion in Chittister v. Department of \nCommunity and Economic Development, invalidating parts of the Family \nand Medical Leave Act for exceeding the bounds of congressional \nauthority--a position the Supreme Court subsequently rejected.\n  Several in-depth reviews show, Judge Alito's rulings, especially his \ndissents, consistently excuse actions taken by the executive branch \nthat infringe on the rights of average Americans. One study found that \n84 percent of Judge Alito's dissents favor the government over \nindividual rights. Another, the Alito Project at Yale Law School \nconducted a comprehensive analysis of the Judge's 15 years on the \nFederal bench. They found that ``Judge Alito has permitted individuals \nto be deprived of property or liberty without actual notice or a prior \nhearing.''\n  During his hearings and in my meeting with him, Judge Alito did \nnothing to distance himself from these positions; in fact, by refusing \nto candidly discuss where he stands on executive power, he only \nstrengthened my concerns about his views.\n  If it's not where you come from that matters, but where you will take \nthe\n\n[[Page S284]]\n\nnation, does a Supreme Court with Justice Alito take the nation forward \nor move our Nation back?\n  Back to a time when a President suspended the writ of habeas corpus; \nback to a time when a President ordered the internment of individuals \nbased upon their ethnicity; and back to a time when a President ordered \nthe unlawful breakins and wiretaps against his opponents.\n  Our next Supreme Court justice must be a check and balance against \nbroad Presidential powers that are inconsistent with our Constitution.\n  With respect to reproductive rights, Judge Alito told the members of \nthe Judiciary Committee that he would look at such cases with an ``open \nmind.'' However, he has, throughout his career, written that the \nConstitution does not protect a woman's right to choose, worked to \nincrementally limit and eventually overturn Roe v. Wade, so narrowly \ninterpreted the ``undue burden'' standard in one specific case as to \nbasically outlaw this right for an entire group of women, and refused \nto state whether Roe is ``settled law.''\n  When asked by Judiciary Committee Chairman Specter whether he \ncontinues to believe that the Constitution does not protect the right \nto choose, as he wrote in his 1985 job application at the Department of \nJustice, Judge Alito acknowledged that it was his view in 1985, but \nrefused to say whether or not he holds that view today. I found Judge \nAlito' s refusal to answer this question extremely troubling.\n  Later, as an Assistant Solicitor General, Judge Alito wrote a memo \noutlining a new legal strategy that the Reagan administration could use \nto ``advance the goals of bringing about the eventual overruling of Roe \nv. Wade and, in the meantime, of mitigating its effects.''\n  As a judge on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Alito alone \nconcluded that all of the Pennsylvania restrictions, including the \nspousal notification provision, should be upheld as constitutional in \nPlanned Parenthood v. Casey. Ultimately, the Supreme Court found 5-4 \nthat the spousal notification provision was unconstitutional. Justice \nO'Connor, who wrote the opinion, rejected Judge Alito's arguments and \nwrote that the spousal notification provision constituted an \nimpermissible ``undue burden'' on reproductive rights. She concluded by \nsaying ``Women do not lose their constitutionally protected liberty \nwhen they marry.''\n  During our meeting, when I asked Judge Alito, ``Do you believe Roe v. \nWade is the `settled law' of the land,'' he was unwilling to say that \nit is settled law. During the Judiciary Committee hearing, he said \nmultiple times in response to questions from three of my distinguished \ncolleagues on the Committee that the principle of stare decisis, or \nrespect for precedent, is not an ``inexorable command.'' While this is \nundoubtly the case, this language is exactly what Justice Rehnquist \nused in his dissent in Planned Parenthood v. Casey when arguing that \nRoe should be overturned. Justice Rehnquist wrote, ``In our view, \nauthentic principles of stare decisis do not require that any portion \nof the reasoning in Roe be kept intact. `Stare decisis is not . . . a \nuniversal, inexorable command.' ''\n  Because I was concerned that his approach to these issues is far \ndifferent than Justice O'Connor's, I gave Judge Alito every opportunity \nin our meeting to alleviate my concerns and those expressed by many New \nJerseyans. I regret that he did not do so.\n  If it's not where you come from that matters, but where you will take \nthe Nation, does a Supreme Court with Justice Alito take the nation \nforward or move our Nation back?\n  What does Morning in America look like after Judge Alito becomes a \nSupreme Court justice? Will it be an America where a woman's \nconstitutional right to privacy is not acknowledged? Will it be an \nAmerica where a woman does not have access to the best medical care? \nWill it be an America where women do not control their own bodies?\n  Our next Supreme Court justice must respect both the constitutional \nright to privacy and a woman's right to choose.\n  Our Nation's civil rights are needed to provide equal rights in \nemployment, voting, or disability, they are designed to eliminate \ndiscrimination from our society and to provide equal opportunity and \naccess. These laws are often the direct result of our country's civil \nrights movement.\n  Unfortunately, Judge Alito has consistently applied a narrow \ninterpretation of civil rights laws. Over his 15-year judicial career, \nhe has more often than not sided with corporations and against \nindividuals.\n  In five split decisions involving a claim of sex discrimination, \nJudge Alito has sided with the person accused of the sex discrimination \nevery time. In Sheridan v. E.I DuPont de Nemours, a woman brought a \ngender discrimination lawsuit after being denied a promotion. A jury \nruled in her favor, but the trial judge threw out the verdict. The full \ncomplement of the Third Circuit voted 10-1 to reverse the judge's \ndecision in this sex discrimination case and remand the case for \nreconsideration. Judge Alito wrote the lone dissent, arguing that the \ncase should be dismissed. If Judge Alito's view was the law of the \nland, virtually no woman who has been wrongfully denied a promotion \nbased upon her gender would have her day in court.\n  In the area of race discrimination, Judge Alito voted in dissent \nagainst the plaintiff in both split decisions cases. The Third Circuit \nheld that the plaintiff in Bray v. Marriot Hotels had shown enough \nevidence of possible racial discrimination to merit a trial before a \njury. As in Sheridan, Judge Alito dissented, saying that the plaintiff \nhad not produced enough evidence even to get to a trial of a jury of \ntheir peers. If Judge Alito's view was the law of the land, virtually \nno person of color would be able to pursue discrimination based on race \nin the courts of our nation.\n  From the bench, Judge Alito has participated in five split decisions \nin the area of disability rights law and he sided with the defendant \nfour out of the five times. In Nathanson v. Medical College of \nPennsylvania, relating to a college's knowledge of and response to the \ndisability needs of a student, the majority held that the facts \nrequired a jury to hear her claims. Judge Alito disagreed with the \nmajority, writing that Nathanson failed to prove that the college acted \nunreasonably in its responses to her requests for alternative seating \narrangements. If Judge Alito's view was the law of the land, virtually \nno disabled person denied alternative accommodations could seek relief \nfrom the court.\n  These are only symbolic of the many cases where Judge Alito would say \nno to the average American citizen.\n  If someone's daughter was seeking relief from discrimination based \nupon her gender, Judge Alito would say no. If an American of color was \nseeking relief from discrimination based upon their race, Judge Alito \nwould say no. If someone's handicapped son was seeking relief from \ndiscrimination based upon his disability, Judge Alito would say no. \nJudge Alito would make it virtually impossible for an individual to go \nto court when his or her rights were violated, and have their day of \njudgment.\n  If it's not where you come from that matters, but where you will take \nthe Nation, does a Supreme Court with Justice Alito take the Nation \nforward or move our Nation back?\n  Back to a time when there was not equal access to schools and \ngovernment programs, back to a time when employers could fire employees \nwithout just cause; and back to a time when all citizens were not \nguaranteed the right to vote.\n  Our next Supreme Court justice must truly subscribe to the \ninscription above the entrance to the United States Supreme Court--\n``Equal Justice under Law.''\n  The confirmation of a Supreme Court justice is one of the two most \nimportant responsibilities that a Senator has, in my view. The first is \na decision on war and peace, which is also about life and death. The \nother is deciding who will have a lifetime appointment to the Court \nthat decides the laws of the land.\n  Make no mistake about it, Judge Alito is a decent, accomplished, \nintelligent man. A man who is proud to call our shared State of New \nJersey home. But it is not enough to come from New Jersey--the test \nis--will you represent the values of New Jersey and this Nation on the \nhighest court in the land?\n  In New Jersey we value creating opportunity, we cherish the idea of \nindividual freedom and responsibility, and\n\n[[Page S285]]\n\nwe believe that justice is a force that should level the playing field \nbetween the individual and the powerful.\n  I have given careful consideration to this nomination, and I entered \nthe process with hopes of supporting Judge Alito. This is my first vote \nin this Senate, and I had hoped to cast it in support of this nominee, \nbut after reviewing his record, and his testimony before my fellow \nSenators, I cannot.\n  The question for me has been will he tilt the court in its ideology \nso far that he will place in jeopardy decades of progress in protecting \nindividual rights and freedoms. I am afraid that answer is yes. In good \nconscience, I regrettably cannot support his nomination for a lifetime \nappointment to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, on the question of the confirmation of Judge \nSamuel Alito, when you boil everything down and clear away all of the \nother issues, the most important thing each of us wants from a judge is \nfairness and impartiality. None of us would want to go into a courtroom \nand think our judge had already made up his mind before hearing our \ncase. Whether we are rich or poor, weak or strong, but especially if we \nare poor or weak, victim or defendant, we need to know we will get a \nfair trial.\n  We would not get a fair trial if we faced a judge who had already \nmade up his mind. Not only would the deck be stacked against us, we \nwould be dealt a losing hand if we had to face a judge with an agenda \ndifferent from our case. That is what justice means--impartial and \nobjective. That is the kind of judge we want hearing our case, and that \nis the kind of judge Sam Alito is.\n  Everything we have learned about Judge Alito, from his testimony \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee, his lengthy record of decided \ncases, to the testimonials of his colleagues and peers, tells us that \nJudge Alito will be a fair, impartial, and objective Justice.\n  Judge Alito has told us how he believes a judge cannot prejudge an \nissue, a judge cannot have an agenda, a judge cannot have a preferred \noutcome in any particular case.\n  I was so glad to see that during his confirmation hearing Judge Alito \nwould not allow himself to be forced into prejudging any cases. Now, \nmany tried. They went down their list of issues and asked whether Judge \nAlito agreed with their agenda. They wanted to know how he would rule \non one kind of case or another. They wanted him to decide cases before \nhe even heard them. That would not be justice, and that would not be \nJudge Alito.\n  Not only does Judge Alito know justice, Judge Alito knows democracy. \nDemocracy means that laws governing the people can only be made by \nthose elected by the people to make laws. He knows the Members of \nCongress are elected to make laws. The citizens of Missouri elected \ntheir Representatives and Senators to represent them in Congress, the \nlegislative body. I am honored to be one of those so chosen. Judge \nAlito is not.\n  The citizens of Missouri are not electing Judge Alito to make laws. \nJudge Alito knows he will not have the power to make laws. Judge Alito \nknows he is neither a Congressman nor a Senator who can pass his own \nlegislation from the bench. That is not the role of a judge.\n  Judge Alito knows he is not a politician advocating a program. That \nis not what a judge should do. He is not a politician responding to a \nstakeholder, carrying out the agenda of his constituency, whether it be \nNew Jersey or any other State in the Nation, taking the pulse of voters \nor watching the polls. That is not how to be a judge.\n  Judge Alito has told us he will look at the facts with an open mind \nand then apply the Constitution and the laws as written. He will not \nmake up the law when he wants, he will not change the law when he \nneeds.\n  Judge Alito also knows the law, as many of my colleagues on the \nSenate Judiciary Committee found out. At every stage of his life, he \nhas excelled at knowing and applying the law. As a law clerk to a \nFederal judge, Department of Justice official, Federal prosecutor, and \nnow a Federal appellate judge with 15 years experience on the bench, \nJudge Alito is one of the most qualified ever nominated for the Supreme \nCourt.\n\n  A very good friend of mine is an appellate judge, who in law school \nhad the pleasure of supervising a legal document written by Judge \nAlito. He told me Judge Alito had the finest legal, judicial mind he \nhad ever encountered. I trust his judgment.\n  Judge Alito's peers and colleagues all agree that Judge Alito is \nsupremely qualified for the Supreme Court. He comes highly recommended \nby his colleagues and members of the legal profession because of his \nlegal knowledge and experience. Even those who have worked with Judge \nAlito and disagree with him on the issues or the outcome of his rulings \nconsider him fair-minded and evenhanded.\n  In short, Judge Alito will make a great Supreme Court Justice. \nUnfortunately, and regrettably, the Senate's vote will not reflect \nthat. Perhaps it was a simpler time, less partisan, less subject to \npolitics, less subject to the whims of shifting constituencies and \npressure groups when we could overwhelmingly support those \noverwhelmingly qualified for the Court.\n  For example, both Justices Ginsburg and Scalia received unanimous or \nnear unanimous approval. One came from the left, nominated by a \nDemocratic President, and an advocate for the ACLU; another is a \nbrilliant legal mind, supported by the right. Partisan politics were \nput aside when we voted for these Supreme Court nominees.\n  Unfortunately, there are those who want to use Judge Alito as a \npolitical football. I, for one, believe very strongly our judges and \nour justice system should be above partisan politics. Justice deserve \nbetter than to have the nominees dragged through the political mud.\n  My focus is on the nominee himself and on his legal knowledge and \nexperience. In that regard, Judge Alito should be on the Supreme Court, \nand I will proudly vote to place him on the Supreme Court.\n  Every case he hears, he will approach with an open mind. Every case \nhe considers, he will apply the law and Constitution as written. Every \ncase he decides, he will check his personal feelings at the door and \nweigh the scales of justice.\n  We can expect, and should expect, nothing more from a Justice, and \njustice deserves nothing less.\n  I urge my colleagues to put aside partisan politics, to put aside \npressure from special interests, to vote to invoke cloture, and then to \nvote on a majority vote to confirm Justice Alito to the Supreme Court.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I have in my hand a number of endorsement \nletters that have been written, starting with the Grand Lodge of the \nFraternal Order of Police. I ask unanimous consent that these letters \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      Grand Lodge,\n\n\n                                    Fraternal Order of Police,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 18, 2005.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee to the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman and Senator Leahy: I am writing on behalf \n     of the membership of the Fraternal Order of Police to advise \n     you of our strong support for the nomination of Samuel A. \n     Alito, Jr. to be an Associate Justice on the United States \n     Supreme Court.\n       Judge Alito has a long and distinguished career as a public \n     servant, a practicing attorney, and a Federal jurist. He \n     currently serves as a justice on the U.S. Court of Appeals \n     for the Third Circuit, the very same Circuit where he began \n     his career as a law clerk for Judge Leonard I. Garth. Judge \n     Alito spent four years as an Assistant U.S. Attorney before \n     becoming an Assistant to the U.S. Solicitor General in 1981. \n     During his tenure with the Solicitor's office, he argued \n     thirteen cases before the United States Supreme Court, \n     winning twelve of them. In 1985, he served as Deputy \n     Assistant U.S. Attorney General before returning to his \n     native New Jersey to serve as U.S. Attorney in 1990. \n     Nominated by President George H.W. Bush to the Third Circuit, \n     the Senate confirmed him unanimously on a voice vote.\n       The F.O.P. believes that nominees for posts on the Federal \n     bench must meet two qualifications: a proven record of \n     success as a practicing attorney and the respect of the law \n     enforcement community. Judge Sam\n\n[[Page S286]]\n\n     Alito meets both of these important criteria. In his fifteen \n     years as a Federal judge, he has demonstrated respect for the \n     Consistution, for the rights of all Americans, for law, and \n     for law enforcement officers, who often find it very \n     difficult to successfully assert their rights as employees. \n     Judge Alito demonstrated his keen understanding of this in a \n     case brought by Muslim police officers in Newark, New Jersey \n     (Fraternal Order of Police Newark Lodge No. 12 v. City of \n     Newark, 1999). The Newark Police Department sought to force \n     these officers to shave their beards, which they wore in \n     accordance with their religious beliefs. Judge Alito ruled in \n     favor of the officers in this case, correctly noting that the \n     department's policy unconstitutionally infringed on their \n     civil rights under the First Amendment.\n       The F.O.P. is also very supportive of Judge Alito's \n     decision in a 1993 decision filed by a coal miner seeking \n     disability benefits under the Black Lung Benefits Act (Cort \n     v. Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs). Judge \n     Alito ruled in favor of a coal miner, holding that the \n     Benefits Review Board which denied the miner's claim had \n     misapplied the applicable law regarding disability. He \n     ordered that the case be remanded for an award of benefits, \n     instructing that the Board could not consider any other \n     grounds for denying benefits. Members of the F.O.P. and \n     survivor families who have been forced to appeal decisions \n     which denied benefits under workers' compensation laws or \n     programs like the Public Safety Officer Benefit (PSOB) know \n     first-hand just how important it is to have a jurist with a \n     working knowledge of applicable law and a strong \n     identification with the claimants as opposed to government \n     bureaucrats looking to keep costs down.\n       Judge Samuel A. Alito, Jr. has demonstrated that he will be \n     an outstanding addition to the Supreme Court, and that he has \n     rightfully earned his place beside the finest legal minds in \n     the nation. We are proud to support his nomination and, on \n     behalf of the more than 321,000 members of the Fraternal \n     Order of Police, I urge the Judiciary Committee to \n     expeditiously approve his nomination. Please do not hesitate \n     to contact me, or Executive Director Jim Pasco, through our \n     Washington office if we may be of any further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Chuck Canterbury,\n     National President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 November 9, 2005.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Frist, Minority Leader Reid, Chairman \n     Specter, and Ranking Member Leahy: We are former law clerks \n     of Judge Samuel A. Alito, Jr. We are writing to urge the \n     United States Senate to confirm Judge Alito as the next \n     Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.\n       Our party affiliations and views on policy matters span the \n     political spectrum. We have worked for members of Congress on \n     both sides of the aisle and have actively supported and \n     worked on behalf of Democratic, Republican and Independent \n     candidates. What unites us is our strong support for Judge \n     Alito and our deep belief that he will be an outstanding \n     Supreme Court Justice.\n       Judge Alito's qualifications are well known and beyond \n     dispute. Judge Alito graduated from Princeton University and \n     Yale Law School. Prior to his appointment to the bench, Judge \n     Alito had a distinguished legal career at the Department of \n     Justice, which culminated in his appointment as the U.S. \n     Attorney for the District of New Jersey. Judge Alito has \n     served on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third \n     Circuit for 15 years and has more judicial experience than \n     any Supreme Court nominee in more than 70 years. During his \n     time on the bench, Judge Alito has issued hundreds of \n     opinions, and his extraordinary intellect has contributed to \n     virtually every area of the law.\n       As law clerks, we had the privilege of working closely with \n     Judge Alito and saw firsthand how he reviewed cases, prepared \n     for argument, reached decisions, and drafted opinions. We \n     collectively were involved in thousands of cases, and it \n     never once appeared to us that Judge Alito had pre-judged a \n     case or ruled based on political ideology. To the contrary, \n     Judge Alito meticulously and diligently applied controlling \n     legal authority to the facts of each case after full and \n     careful consideration of all relevant legal arguments. It is \n     our uniform experience that Judge Alito was guided by his \n     profound respect for the Constitution and the limited role of \n     the judicial branch. Where the Supreme Court or the Third \n     Circuit had spoken on an issue, he applied that precedent \n     faithfully and fairly. Where Congress had spoken, he gave the \n     statute its commonsense reading, eschewing both rigid \n     interpretations that undermined the statute's clear purpose \n     and attempts by litigants to distort the statute's plain \n     language to advance policy goals not adopted by Congress. In \n     short, the only result that Judge Alito ever tried to reach \n     in a case was the result dictated by the applicable law and \n     the relevant facts.\n       Our admiration for Judge Alito extends far beyond his legal \n     acumen and commitment to principled judicial decision-making. \n     As law clerks, we experienced Judge Alito's willingness to \n     consider and debate all points of view. We witnessed the way \n     in which Judge Alito treated everyone he encountered--whether \n     an attorney at oral argument, a clerk, an intern, a member of \n     the court staff, or a fellow judge--with utmost courtesy and \n     respect. We were touched by his humility and decency. And we \n     saw his absolute devotion to his family.\n       In short, we urge that Judge Alito be confirmed as the next \n     Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.\n           Sincerely,\n       Signed by 51 former clerks.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    Edwards Angell\n\n\n                                           Palmer & Dodge LLP,\n\n                                  New York, NY, November 23, 2005.\n     Re Samuel A. Alito.\n\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee: I am \n     writing to express my enthusiastic and unqualified \n     recommendation that Samuel A. Alito be confirmed as an \n     Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.\n       I worked with Judge Alito in 1987. He was appointed United \n     States Attorney for the District of New Jersey. At that time \n     I was the Deputy Chief and Acting Chief of the Special \n     Prosecutions Unit. I continued in that capacity for \n     approximately eight months after Sam arrived at the U.S. \n     Attorney's Office. He was an exemplary U.S. Attorney. He was \n     also an exemplary boss. He was at all times knowledgeable, \n     thoughtful and supportive of me and the other lawyers in the \n     office. In his quiet and wryly humorous way, he demonstrated \n     wonderful leadership. It was clear that he was very conscious \n     of the responsibilities of that office and he fulfilled those \n     responsibilities admirably. I was very proud to work for Sam \n     Alito.\n       After leaving the U.S. Attorney's Office, I became a \n     private practitioner. I have had the pleasure of appearing as \n     an advocate before Judge Alito in the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the Third Circuit in a number of cases. It is a \n     pleasure to appear before Judge Alito due to his genial \n     demeanor and obvious professionalism. His opinions--even when \n     against my cause--were thoughtful, considerate, justifiable \n     and well written.\n       Judge Alito did not ask me to write this letter; I \n     volunteered. I am a lifelong Democrat. I am the President-\n     elect of a national women's bar association. I chair the \n     Corporate Integrity and White Collar Crime group at a \n     national law firm. I do not speak on behalf of either my law \n     firm or the women's bar association. I speak for myself only. \n     But by providing my credentials as an outspoken women's \n     rights advocate and liberal-minded criminal defense attorney, \n     I hope you will appreciate the significance of my unqualified \n     and enthusiastic recommendation of Sam Alito for the Supreme \n     Court.\n       Sam possesses the best qualities for judges. He is \n     thoughtful, brilliant, measured, serious, and conscious of \n     the awesome responsibilities imposed by his position. I \n     cannot think of better qualities for a Supreme Court Justice. \n     It is my fervent hope that politics will not prevent this \n     extraordinarily capable candidate from serving as Associate \n     Justice on the United States Supreme Court.\n       I will be happy to provide any further details or \n     information in any private or public forum.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n     Cathy Fleming.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  January 4, 2006.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n      Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman and Senator Leahy: We write in support of \n     the nomination of Judge Samuel A. Alito, Jr. to the United \n     States Supreme Court. Each of us has devoted a significant \n     portion of our legal practice or research to appellate \n     matters. Although we reflect a broad range of political, \n     policy and legal views, we all agree that Judge Alito should \n     be confirmed by the Senate. Judge Alito has a well-deserved \n     reputation as an outstanding jurist. He is, in every sense of \n     the term, a ``judge's judge.'' His opinions are fair, \n     thoughtful and rigorous. Those of us who have appeared before \n     Judge Alito appreciate his preparation for argument, his \n     temperament on the bench and the quality and incisiveness of \n     the questions he asks. Those of us who have worked with Judge \n     Alito respect his legal skills, his integrity and his \n     modesty. In short, Judge Alito has the attributes that we \n     believe are essential to being an outstanding Supreme Court \n     Justice and therefore should be confirmed. Thank you for \n     considering our views.\n           Sincerely,\n       Signed by 206 lawyers.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I also have in my other hand a series of \neditorials, starting with a Dallas Morning News editorial entitled \n``Confirm Alito.'' These are all editorials from newspapers around the \ncountry recommending that this body confirm Judge Alito. I ask \nunanimous consent that\n\n[[Page S287]]\n\nthese editorials be printed in the Record.\n       There being no objection, the material was ordered to be \n     printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Dallas Morning News, Jan. 14, 2006]\n\n            Confirm Alito: Nominee Deserves Senate's Backing\n\n       After hearing Samuel Alito testify this week, this \n     editorial board's assessment is that the appellate judge has \n     the intellectual breadth and legal depth to sit on the \n     Supreme Court. With few exceptions, he fielded Senate \n     Judiciary Committee questions with a ready grasp of case law \n     and nuance.\n       He also came across as quite reasonable. Just as Clinton \n     nominee Stephen Breyer struck senators as a mainstream \n     liberal, Mr. Alito resides within the 40-yard lines of \n     conservatism.\n       We offer this conclusion--and our recommendation of him--\n     after comparing his testimony with several questions we \n     raised Monday.\n       First, his embrace of judicial precedent was persuasive \n     enough to conclude he wouldn't rush to overturn Roe vs. Wade. \n     He didn't go as far as John Roberts in saying the abortion \n     rights case is settled law. But he repeatedly emphasized his \n     belief in building upon previous decisions.\n       True, factors could lead him--or any justice--to reconsider \n     a ruling, but they would be extraordinary ones. We'll sum it \n     up this way: Based upon his testimony, we'd feel very misled \n     and deeply disappointed if he joined in an overthrow of Roe.\n       Second, he allayed fears he wholly prefers presidential \n     power. He left wiggle room on issues such as where the \n     president can deploy troops without congressional authority. \n     But he didn't live up to his billing as a justice who'd make \n     light of checks and balances. Most notably, he agreed \n     presidents don't possess unlimited power, even during war.\n       Third, his objections to the ``one man, one vote'' doctrine \n     appeared mostly technical. For example, he wondered whether \n     it meant congressional districts should have an exactly equal \n     amount of voters each term. He unveiled no willingness to \n     undo the ruling that ensures fair voting weight for \n     minorities.\n       It was unsettling that some of the nominee's views appeared \n     different from earlier speeches or writings. A couple of \n     times, his answers had a disturbing then-and-now quality. But \n     Samuel Alito's testimony showed he could become a thoughtful \n     conservative justice. The Senate should give him that \n     opportunity.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Miami Herald, Jan. 24, 2006]\n\n                Qualified To Serve on the Supreme Court\n\n       There is little doubt that in the coming days the Senate \n     will confirm the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to replace \n     Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on the U.S. Supreme Court. He \n     deserves to be confirmed. This is not an assessment of his \n     judicial philosophy but of his undoubted qualifications for \n     the job. He has the intellectual heft, judicial temperament \n     and fealty to the U.S. Constitution that are prerequisites \n     for a Supreme Court justice. In 15 years on the federal \n     appellate bench, he has demonstrated a sure grasp of issues.\n       Critics have sought to paint Judge Alito as an ideologue \n     whose views are out of the judicial mainstream. In the past, \n     we have found this a reason to raise doubts about some of the \n     more extreme nominations for the federal appeals courts. \n     However, this is not a fair argument to raise against Judge \n     Alito.\n       According to statistics compiled by the Court of Appeals \n     for the Third Judicial Circuit, Judge Alito has dissented \n     only 16 times in the last six years, fewer times than some of \n     his colleagues. On civil-rights cases, his co-panelists \n     agreed with Judge Alito's votes and written opinions 94 \n     percent of the time. It is possible to take issue with some \n     of his views in those instances where he was in dissent, but \n     this isn't the record of a judge on the fringe of mainstream \n     judicial thinking.\n       During 18 hours of hearings--almost twice as long as the \n     interrogation of John Roberts--Judge Alito displayed a deep \n     understanding of the legal issues the court is likely to \n     confront and kept cool under fire. He did everything possible \n     to avoid saying how he would rule on some of the \n     controversial issues, but that is hardly surprising. \n     Unfortunately, given the divisiveness in Washington today too \n     much candor can prove fatal to a nominee.\n       In nominating Judge Alito, President Bush fulfilled a \n     campaign promise to appoint judges who shared the views of \n     Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia. Thus, he \n     delivered a candidate with sound credentials but a decidedly \n     conservative record that many find troubling.\n       This record includes a narrow view of abortion rights, \n     apparent support for the expansive powers of the presidency \n     in wartime and a narrow interpretation of the regulatory \n     authority of Congress. Judge Alito likely will help move the \n     court rightward, and some senators, no doubt, will find this \n     a compelling reason to vote against him.\n       No justice should be denied a seat on the court, however, \n     solely on the basis of judicial philosophy, particularly \n     someone of Judge Alito's proven ability and experience. The \n     best way for critics--Democrats, mostly--to prevail when it \n     comes to selecting federal judges is to prevail at the ballot \n     box.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          [From the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Jan. 15, 2006]\n\n               Supreme Court; Alito Deserves Confirmation\n\n       Samuel Alito should be confirmed to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n       And, barring any last-minute disqualifying revelations, the \n     first step toward that goal should be yes votes in the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee, including from Wisconsin's two senators, \n     both of whom sit on that committee.\n       Democrats are understandably concerned about specific red \n     flags in Alito's record but should nonetheless reject a \n     filibuster. Nor should they move, as it appeared likely late \n     last week they would, to delay the committee's vote. Both \n     would be antithetical to the democratic process in this \n     specific case.\n       That's because, though we would have preferred Alito to be \n     more open about his judicial philosophy, he did make one case \n     quite effectively. He is a conservative jurist. This is what \n     the electorate, albeit narrowly, indicated it wanted when it \n     reelected George W. Bush as president in 2004. There can be \n     no reasonable claim that voters did not know this to be a \n     likely consequence of their votes.\n       Yes, Alito's views peg him as closer to a constitutional \n     originalist than one with more expansive views of that \n     document, a view we prefer. But Alito is likely not the \n     wildeyed, knee-jerk ideologue his critics have depicted. \n     Instead, a broad view of his writings, rulings and character \n     indicate a judge capable of giving proper and due weight to \n     the law. Alito is scholarly, intelligent and eminently \n     qualified to sit on the bench, as attests his rating as such \n     by the American Bar Association.\n       This is not to say that there isn't a roll-of-the-dice \n     quality to this choice for the Supreme Court. But this is so \n     with most, if not all, judicial nominations. Just ask \n     Republicans, many of whom now have buyers' remorse over \n     Justices David Souter and Anthony Kennedy.\n       Alito's 1985 stance, writing as a lawyer within the Reagan \n     administration, that the Constitution does not support \n     abortion rights is troubling. Unlike John Roberts during his \n     recent chief justice confirmation hearings, Alito refused to \n     state that Roe vs. Wade is settled law. He did assert that it \n     is ``embedded in the culture'' and should be respected as \n     precedent.\n       A stronger statement would have been more reassuring, but \n     in a living, breathing Constitution, much, in fact, will not \n     be settled. Were it so, then Plessy vs. Ferguson, which the \n     Supreme Court used in 1896 to enable decades of segregation \n     under a separate but equal rule, could not have been undone \n     by the court in 1954.\n       Americans should take some comfort in Alito's \n     acknowledgment of a right to privacy in the Constitution. His \n     refusal to be pinned down more concretely on this point is \n     defensible given that the court will rule on abortion.\n       Similarly, the public should take some solace from his \n     contention that no president is above the law, given the \n     controversies sparked by several presidential actions in the \n     war on terrorism.\n       Wisconsin is fortunate to have two early votes on judicial \n     nominations. Democratic Sens. Herb Kohl and Russ Feingold are \n     both Judiciary Committee members. Both acquitted themselves \n     ably in questioning the nominee. And both should vote the \n     nominee out of committee.\n       Kohl properly probed on abortion and one-person, one-vote \n     and inquired about glowing Alito comments on Robert Bork, \n     denied a Supreme Court seat in 1987. Feingold asked necessary \n     questions on executive powers, Alito's ruling in a case \n     involving a mutual fund in which he invested and on the death \n     penalty. Together, they helped ensure the hearings were more \n     than a GOP lovefest for the nominee.\n       But Alito handled himself well in answering. If not as \n     forthcoming as would be ideal, he offered enough assurances \n     to warrant his confirmation. Democrats, however, are most \n     upset over what Alito didn't say rather than what he did. \n     This is not an entirely acceptable standard.\n       We're aware that this nomination carries a weighty \n     significance because the nominee will replace Justice Sandra \n     Day O'Connor, often a swing vote in a divided court. And \n     Alito is still an open book on important issues. But, again, \n     elections have consequences. Voters knew what these were, and \n     Alito is not demonstrably beyond the pale of the U.S. \n     mainstream.\n       Alito--and Roberts--could disappoint, of course, and renege \n     on their own claims of open-mindedness. If they do, they will \n     have betrayed a trust to the American people. But it is not \n     at all as assured as critics have contended that Alito or \n     Roberts will do this.\n       Confirm Alito. It's not risk-free, but it's the right thing \n     to do.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the Philadelphia Inquirer, Jan. 15, 2006]\n\n                          Confirm Judge Alito\n\n       The Senate should confirm Judge Samuel A. Alito Jr., \n     President Bush's nominee for the Supreme Court.\n       Alito, a member of the Philadelphia-based Third Circuit \n     Court of Appeals, demonstrated during three days of \n     questioning last week by the Senate Judiciary Committee that \n     he does not bring a precast agenda to the job.\n\n[[Page S288]]\n\n       He does bring a cast of mind that causes some legitimate \n     concern. But Alito showed he has the experience, modest \n     temperament, reverence for the law, and mastery of his \n     profession needed to serve on the high court.\n       A common complaint about confirmations has been that \n     nominees stonewall the committee. Alito tried to answer \n     nearly every question put to him. Democratic senators may not \n     have liked his responses, but Alito dodged very few \n     questions.\n       This endorsement is not enthusiastic. Alito is a more \n     conservative nominee than anyone concerned with the nation's \n     drift toward excessive executive power and disdain for civil \n     liberties would prefer.\n       But the Supreme Court should not be stocked with justices \n     all of the same political persuasion, left or right. As the \n     replacement for a valuable centrist, Sandra Day O'Connor, \n     Alito might very well move the court perceptibly to the \n     right. But his methodical, just-the-facts approach to the law \n     does not portend a shocking shift, and would not justify a \n     filibuster of his nomination.\n       Alito did fail to allay some important concerns. On \n     abortion, he rebuffed entreaties by Democrats to characterize \n     Roe v. Wade as ``settled law.'' Chairman Arlen Specter (R., \n     Pa.) commended Alito for discussing the issue in more depth \n     than did Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., but this extended \n     discourse was less than encouraging. Alito, who wrote in 1985 \n     that the Constitution doesn't guarantee the right to \n     abortion, would not say he feels differently today.\n       He pledged to ``keep an open mind'' on abortion cases. But \n     he also said Supreme Court precedent is not ``an inexorable \n     command.'' If Alito does consider the Constitution a living \n     document, as he testified, he should weigh carefully the \n     expressed desire of a majority of Americans to preserve \n     reproductive freedoms.\n       On the question of presidential power, concerns linger that \n     Alito would give undue deference to the executive branch. For \n     all President Bush's talk about ``strict constructionism,'' \n     his freewheeling notions about his powers would have appalled \n     many of the Constitution's framers, who deeply feared an \n     authoritarian executive.\n       At the hearings, Alito sought to temper the enthusiasm for \n     presidential prerogative he showed in earlier writings with \n     the statement that the president is not above the law. At \n     least he is on the record with this view now. Being on the \n     high court has been known to focus a justice's mind on the \n     value of the judiciary's constitutional role as a check on \n     the other two branches.\n       A distressing point was Alito's membership in the now-\n     defunct Concerned Alumni of Princeton, a group created in \n     1972 to oppose the admission of women and minorities to the \n     university. His protests that he knew little about the \n     group's agenda, even though he touted his membership on a \n     1985 application for a job in the Reagan administration, were \n     unpersuasive.\n       But the example of Alito's life must count for something, \n     and that example diminishes the significance of the Princeton \n     misstep. He is not a bigot. He has hired and promoted women \n     and minorities. Colleagues testify to his basic decency and \n     are mystified that he joined CAP. He has renounced the \n     group's goals.\n       Alito has admitted that his failure to recuse himself in \n     2002 from a case involving Vanguard mutual funds, in which \n     Alito had invested, was an ``oversight.'' It was a mistake, \n     even though the conflict of interest was not significant. \n     Investing in a mutual fund is not like owning stock in an \n     individual company. But Alito had pledged to bow out of cases \n     involving Vanguard, then didn't. That was wrong.\n       An analysis of Alito's written opinions shows his \n     overriding respect for authority: for the police, for the \n     government, for employers. Given all the recent evidence of \n     how those parties commit deeds that damage individuals, you'd \n     like the high court to take a more balanced view.\n       But Alito's cast of mind does not disqualify him. As \n     pragmatic Judge Edward Becker of the Third Circuit testified, \n     he and Alito disagreed only 27 times in 1,050 cases they \n     heard together. Alito is not in the mainstream of judicial \n     thought, but he is not too far to the right of it.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Salt Lake Tribune, Dec. 7, 2005]\n\n                      Judge Alito Is No Ideologue\n\n                      (By Jeffrey N. Wasserstein)\n\n       As a former clerk for Judge Samuel Alito, I can tell you he \n     is not the conservative ideologue portrayed in a recent \n     article by Knight Ridder reporters Stephen Henderson and \n     Howard Mintz (``Alito Opinions Reveal Pattern of \n     Conservatism'').\n       I am a registered Democrat who supports progressive causes. \n     (To my wife's consternation, I still can't bring myself to \n     take my ``Kerry for President'' bumper sticker off of my \n     car.) I clerked for Judge Alito from 1997 to 1998. \n     Notwithstanding my close work with Judge Alito, until I read \n     his 1985 Reagan job application statement, I could not tell \n     you what his politics were. When we worked on cases, we \n     reached the same result about 95 percent of the time. When we \n     disagreed, it was largely due to the fact that he is a lot \n     smarter than I am (indeed, than most people) and is far more \n     experienced.\n       It was my experience that Judge Alito was (and is) capable \n     of setting aside any personal biases he may have when he \n     judges. He is the consummate professional.\n       One example that I witnessed of Judge Alito's ability to \n     approach cases with an open mind occurred in the area of \n     criminal law, an area in which Judge Alito--a former federal \n     prosecutor--had particular expertise. One time, I was looking \n     at a set of legal briefs in a criminal appeal. The attorney \n     for the criminal defendant had submitted a sloppy brief, a \n     very slip-shod affair. The prosecuting attorney had submitted \n     a neat, presentable brief. I suggested (in my youth and \n     naivete) that this would be an easy case to decide for the \n     government.\n       Judge Alito stopped me cold by saying that that was an \n     unfair attitude to have before I had even read the briefs \n     carefully and conducted the necessary additional research \n     needed to ensure that the defendant received a fair hearing \n     before the court.\n       Perhaps not what one would expect from a conservative \n     ideologue (and former federal prosecutor), but it is \n     indicative of the way Judge Alito approaches each case with \n     an open mind, and it is a lesson I've never forgotten.\n       Another example, which reached a result that would seem \n     contrary to a conservative ideologue, was a case I worked on \n     with Judge Alito (U.S. v. Kithcart) in which Judge Alito \n     reversed a conviction of a black male, holding that an all-\n     points-bulletin for ``two black men in a black sports car'' \n     was insufficient probable cause to arrest the driver of the \n     car. Notwithstanding the driver's guilty plea, Judge Alito \n     reversed, finding that the initial arrest lacked probable \n     cause, stating, ``The mere fact that Kithcart is black and \n     the perpetrators had been described as two black males is \n     plainly insufficient.''\n       This is hardly the work of a conservative ideologue.\n       As a former clerk to Judge Alito, I can attest to Judge \n     Alito's deep and abiding respect for precedent and the \n     important role of stare decisis--the doctrine that settled \n     cases should not be continually revisited. Judge Alito has \n     served on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit for \n     15 years, and has compiled a distinguished record that \n     conclusively demonstrates respect for precedent.\n       The best indicator of how a justice may act on the Supreme \n     Court is the judicial record the justice had before elevation \n     to the court. In Judge Alito's case, one can clearly see a \n     restrained approach to the law, deferring to a prior court \n     decision even if he may have disagreed with its logic.\n       While a bald statement that ``the Constitution does not \n     protect a right to an abortion'' in a vacuum might be cause \n     for concern, Judge Alito's statement must be taken in \n     context. Sen. Diane Feinstein, D-Calif., said after her \n     meeting with Judge Alito that he explained that regardless of \n     his statement on the job application, ``I'm now a judge, I've \n     been on the Circuit Court for 15 years and it's very \n     different. I'm not an advocate, I don't give heed to my \n     personal views, what I do is interpret the law.'' Sen. Ted \n     Kennedy, D-Mass., also noted that Judge Alito said ``he had \n     indicated that he is an older person, that he has learned \n     more, that he thinks he is wiser person (and) that he's got a \n     better grasp and understanding about constitutional rights \n     and liberties.''\n       Given Judge Alito's respect for precedent and stare decisis \n     as demonstrated by actually adhering to precedent for 15 \n     years while on the Court of Appeals--even in cases that \n     reached results that would seem incorrect to a conservative--\n     and the open mind with which I saw him approach cases, \n     labeling Judge Alito an ``ideologue'' would be unfair and \n     distorts his record on the bench.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I support the nomination of Sam Alito to \nthe U.S. Supreme Court. The American people, in public opinion polls we \nhave seen reported in the newspapers, indicate they also want Judge \nAlito on the Supreme Court. Yet we are here today, after extended \ndebate, because there are a handful of Senators who are determined to \nstop Judge Alito's nomination from even receiving an up-or-down vote. \nHence, at 4:30 we will have a vote on cloture, whether to close debate. \nIt is my sincere hope that at least 60 Senators will vote to close \ndebate so tomorrow morning we can have that up-or-down vote that this \nnominee deserves and that the Constitution requires.\n  There really is no pretense that this tactic of delay for delay's \nsake is needed for extended debate. Judge Alito was nominated months \nago, and we have been debating this nomination without interruption \nsince last Wednesday. Not only has Judge Alito been investigated by the \nFBI but also by the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on \nthe Federal Judiciary. He has been investigated by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, on which I am proud to serve, and been through extended \ntelevised hearings. The fact is, even the minority leader, the Democrat \nleader, conceded ``[t]here's been adequate time for people to debate'' \nthis nomination.\n  So this is delay for delay's sake. Fortunately, there is no \nindication this delay tactic will succeed. Judge Alito's supporters in \nthis body are so numerous that everyone has conceded--even the \nminority, who is determined to try to filibuster this nomination, \nconcedes\n\n[[Page S289]]\n\nthe filibuster attempt is futile and this nominee will be confirmed.\n  So what could possibly be the motivation? The Senator from Missouri, \nwho just spoke before me, alluded to this. I think it is common \nknowledge that it really is outside interest groups that are putting, \nin some cases, irresistible pressure on Senators to oppose this \nnomination, even though they realize the delay and the potential \nfilibuster are futile. These are groups that have declared--and I \nquote, in one instance--``you name it, we'll do it'' to defeat Judge \nAlito. I am very sorry that some of my colleagues have fallen under the \nspell of some of these groups. In my view, it is wrong to place the \nwishes of these interest groups before the wishes of the American \npeople.\n  I think it is also a mistake to waste the valuable time of the \nSenate, time we could be using to address other real and urgent needs \nthat no doubt the President will address tomorrow night in his State of \nthe Union speech and which are well known to each of us here. We have \nmore important things to do than to stage events to facilitate \nfundraising by special interest groups. I urge all of my colleagues to \nstand up against the interest groups and to put the American people \nfirst by voting against the filibuster.\n  I also continue to be struck by the lengths some will go in order to \ndefeat this good man and good judge. This raises the question of \n``Why?'' Why do liberal special interest groups and their allies in \nthis body oppose Judge Alito so vehemently?\n  I believe, at bottom, the reason they oppose his nomination is \nbecause he has refused to do their bidding. After all, Judge Alito is a \njudge who believes in judicial restraint, who understands the \ndifferences between the roles judges and legislators--elected \nrepresentatives of the people--are to play in our government. He \nbelieves judges should respect the legislative choices made by the \nAmerican people through their representatives. And he believes, as I \ndo, judges have no warrant to impose their own beliefs on the rest of \nus under the guise of interpreting the Constitution.\n  It is sad but true that the prospect of a Supreme Court Justice who \nwill respect the legislative choices of the American people scares the \nliving daylights out of these interest groups and their allies. Why? \nBecause the legislative choices of the American people are not the \nlegislative choices of these interest groups.\n  There are some in this country who are entitled to their opinion but \nwhose views are so extreme they will never prevail at the ballot box. \nThe only way they could possibly hope to get their views enacted into \nlaw would be to circumvent the Democratic process and pack the courts \nwith judicial activists who will impose their views on the rest of us.\n  What are these views? Well, one organization I think makes the point. \nThe American Civil Liberties Union is one example. They represent child \npornographers because they believe that child pornography is free \nspeech. Yet at the same time, they litigate against schoolchildren who \nwant to recite the Pledge of Allegiance because it invokes ``one nation \nunder God.''\n  They believe the Constitution protects the right to end the life of a \npartially born child. Yet at the same time, they believe the \nConstitution does not protect marriage between only one man and one \nwoman.\n  They seem to believe that criminals have more rights than victims. \nAnd they believe that terrorists should receive special rights never \nbefore afforded to enemy combatants during a time of war.\n  This is the hard left's version of America. It is a place where \ncriminals and terrorists run free on technicalities, where \npornographers may speak but people of faith must keep quiet, where \ntraditional values are replaced by social experimentation.\n  The liberal special interest groups and those who agree with them in \nthis body to oppose Judge Alito do so because Judge Alito's America is \nnot the hard left's America.\n  What, then, is Judge Alito's America? Well, I found one of the best \nanswers to that question in, of all places, the New York Times. On \nJanuary 12, one of their columnists, David Brooks, wrote a column that \ncaptures perfectly the differences between Judge Alito's America and \nthe America envisioned by some on the hard left.\n  He wrote:\n\n       If he'd been born a little earlier, Sam Alito probably \n     would have been a Democrat. In the 1950s, the middle-class \n     and lower-middle-class whites in places like Trenton, N.J., \n     where Alito grew up, were the heart and soul of the \n     Democratic party.\n       But by the late 1960s, cultural politics replaced New Deal \n     politics, and liberal Democrats did their best to repel \n     Northern white ethnic voters. Big-city liberals launched \n     crusades against police brutality, portraying working class \n     cops as thuggish storm troopers for the establishment.\n       The liberals were doves; the ethnics were hawks. The \n     liberals had ``Question Authority'' bumper stickers; the \n     ethnics had been taught in school to respect authority. The \n     liberals thought that an unjust society caused poverty; the \n     ethnics believed in working their way out of poverty.\n       Sam Alito emerged from his middle-class neighborhood about \n     that time, made it to Princeton and found ``very privileged \n     people behaving irresponsibly.''\n       Alito wanted to learn; the richer liberals wanted to \n     strike. He wanted to join the ROTC; the liberal Princetonians \n     expelled that organization from campus. He was orderly and \n     respectful; they were disorderly and disrespectful.\n\n  Mr. Brooks continues:\n\n       If there is one lesson from the Alito hearings, it is that \n     the Democratic Party continues to repel [middle-class white] \n     voters just as vigorously as ever.\n       If you listened to the questions of [Republicans], you \n     heard [Senators] exercised by the terror drug dealers can \n     inflict on their neighborhoods. If you listened to the \n     [Democrats], you heard [Senators] exercised by the terror law \n     enforcement officials can inflict on a neighborhood.\n       If forced to choose, most Americans side with the party \n     that errs on the side of the cops, not the criminals.\n       If you listened to [Republicans], you heard [Senators] \n     alarmed by the threats posed by anti-American terrorists. If \n     you listened to [Democrats], you heard Senators alarmed by \n     the threats posed by American counterterrorists.\n       If forced to choose, most Americans want a party that will \n     fight aggressively against the terrorists, not the [NSA].\n\n  He concluded:\n\n       Alito is a paragon of the old-fashioned working-class \n     ethic. In a culture of self-aggrandizement, Alito is modest. \n     In a culture of self-exposure, Alito is reticent. In a \n     culture of made-for-TV sentimentalism, Alito refuses to \n     emote. In a culture that celebrates the rebel, or the \n     fashionable pseudorebel, Alito respects tradition, order and \n     authority.\n\n  I read a lengthy excerpt from Mr. Brooks' column because I could not \nhave said it better. This is Judge Alito's America. It is a place where \nif we err at all, we err on the side of the law, not on the side of \nthose who break the law, where we fight terrorists, not those who try \nto stop those terrorists, where we work hard to get ahead, where we are \nmore interested in getting the job done than getting credit for it. In \nother words, these are the middle-class traditional values of America, \nSam Alito's America, and, I believe, our America. They are now \napparently so foreign to many in the Democratic Party, particularly the \nliberal interest groups that seem to agitate for delay for delay's sake \nand to block an up-or-down vote on this nomination, that they will stop \nat nothing to oppose someone such as Judge Alito who embodies those \nvalues. You name it, whether smears, distortions or even denying the \ndecency of an up-or-down vote, and some will do it. Judge Alito's \ntreatment by this hard core of left-leaning groups and their supporters \nsays more about them than it does Judge Alito.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the Senate is about to vote on a motion to \ninvoke cloture on the nomination of Samuel Alito to be an Associate \nJustice of the U.S. Supreme Court. We should not even have to take this \nstep but should be voting instead on whether to consent to Judge \nAlito's appointment. But since we are being forced to take this \nunnecessary step, let me explain why I believe the case for both \ncloture and for confirmation is compelling.\n  Deliberation and debate are hallmarks of the Senate. Our tradition \nhas been that once a judicial nomination\n\n[[Page S290]]\n\nhas reached the Senate floor, we debate and then we vote on \nconfirmation. There is no need to revisit all of the arguments \nregarding judicial nomination filibusters. Suffice it to say that \nAmerican history contains but a single example of failing to invoke \ncloture on and then failing to confirm a Supreme Court nomination. The \n1968 nomination of Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice, however, bears no \nrelationship to the current situation.\n  First, while the Fortas nomination did not have majority support, the \nAlito nomination clearly does. Judge Alito enjoys majority bipartisan \nsupport. I realize his opponents are not happy that Judge Alito will be \nconfirmed; no one likes to lose. But the correct response to failure is \nto pick yourself up and try another day, not to rig the process to get \nyour way.\n  Second, opposition to cloture on the Fortas nomination was almost \nevenly bipartisan, with 23 Republicans and 19 Democrats. As we are \nabout to see, opposition to cloture on the Alito nomination will be \nentirely partisan. The most important reason why the Fortas cloture \nvote is no precedent for this one is that there had not yet been full \nand complete debate on the Fortas nomination when the vote ending \ndebate occurred. Senator Robert Griffin of Michigan stated clearly at \nthe time that not all Senators had had a chance to speak and that the \ndebate was being kept squarely on the many serious issues and concerns \nraised by the Fortas nomination. Senators were debating, not \nobstructing, the nomination.\n  The same cannot be said today. Those raising this last-minute call \nfor a filibuster have had a full and fair opportunity to air their \nviews about this nomination. Let us not forget that debate over a \nnomination, especially to the Supreme Court, begins as soon as the \nPresident announces his intention to nominate. The Judiciary Committee \nchairman, Senator Specter, accommodated Democrats and waited to hold \nthe hearing on the Alito nomination until January. In fact, the 70 days \nbetween announcement and hearing exceeded the average time for all of \nthe current Supreme Court Justices by more than 60 percent. \nNonetheless, committee Democrats insisted on delaying the nomination \nfor an extra week.\n  The nomination has now been on the floor for nearly a week. While the \nSenator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, says that Senators need still \nmore time to debate, I recall the long, repeated quorum calls last week \nwhen Senators who could have spoken chose not to do so. I agree with \nthe distinguished minority leader who last Thursday said that ``there \nhas been adequate time for people to debate. No one can complain in \nthis matter that there hasn't been sufficient time to talk about Judge \nAlito, pro or con.''\n  In fact, the last-ditch call for this filibuster came not from this \nfloor or even from this country. The Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKerry, called for this filibuster from Switzerland. There is a \ndifference between not having an opportunity to debate and not winning \nthat debate. Nothing is being short circuited here. This floor has been \nwide open for debate. No one can even suggest that the debate has not \nbeen a full and fair one.\n  To their credit, some of my Democratic colleagues who oppose the \nnomination itself have nonetheless said that this 11th-hour filibuster \nattempt is not in the best interest of the Senate.\n  The Senator from Illinois, Mr. Obama, said over the weekend that the \nbetter course for Democrats is to win elections and persuade on the \nmerits, rather than what he called overreliance on procedural maneuvers \nsuch as the filibuster. I agree.\n  We should not have to take this cloture vote today. It only further \npoliticizes and distorts an already damaged judicial confirmation \nprocess. Moving beyond that, it is clear that the case for Judge \nAlito's confirmation is compelling. Last week I outlined three reasons \nwhy Judge Alito should be confirmed. He is highly qualified. He is a \nman of character and integrity, and he understands and is committed to \nthe properly limited role of the judiciary, judges.\n  During the debate on this nomination, other Senators have explored \nthese matters as well, including the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn, \nwho preceded me here today. Senator Cornyn is a distinguished member of \nthe Judiciary Committee and a former State supreme court justice. His \nperspective and insight on judicial matters has been and is extremely \nvaluable.\n  I wish to explore one specific issue that relates to Judge Alito's \njudicial philosophy which, unfortunately, has been the subject of a \ndisinformation campaign by Judge Alito's opponents. That issue is Judge \nAlito's view on the role of precedent or prior judicial decisions in \ndeciding cases. Judges settle legal disputes by applying the law to the \nfacts in the cases that come before them. The law that judges apply to \nsettle legal disputes comes in two basic forms.\n  There is the written law itself in the form of constitutional \nprovisions, statutes, or regulations. Then there are past decisions in \nwhich the courts have addressed the same issue. The Latin phrase for \nfollowing precedent or prior decisions is ``stare decisis,'' which \nmeans ``let the decision stand.'' Mr. President, every judge believes \nin the doctrine of stare decisis. Every judge believes that prior \ndecisions play an important role in judicial decisionmaking. That \nincludes Judge Alito.\n  As I will explain, Judge Alito's views on precedent are sound, \ntraditional, and principled. When the Judiciary Committee hearing on \nthis nomination opened, I outlined several rules which should guide the \nconfirmation process. The first was that we should take parts or \nelements of Judge Alito's record on their own terms, in their own \ncontext for what they really are. That certainly applies to Judge \nAlito's views regarding the issue of precedent.\n  Rather than acknowledging what Judge Alito's views actually are, \nhowever, some of his opponents have created a caricature of those \nviews, which serves their political purposes but which misleads our \nfellow citizens about both Judge Alito's record and this very important \nissue.\n  Let me start with Judge Alito's own words. No one expresses his view \nof precedent better than he does. On January 11, 2006, Judge Alito \noffered this summary of his views:\n\n       I have said that stare decisis is a very important legal \n     doctrine and that there is a general presumption that \n     decisions of the Court will not be overruled. There needs to \n     be a special justification for doing so, but it is not an \n     inexorable command.\n\n  This view has several elements.\n  First, Judge Alito says plainly that stare decisis is a very \nimportant legal concept and doctrine. He described why he thinks \nprecedent is so important. One of his points stood out, and I believe \nit is worth highlighting. Let me just refer to that point. He said:\n\n       I think the doctrine of stare decisis is a very important \n     doctrine . . . [I]t limits the power of the judiciary . . . \n     it's not an inexorable command, but it is a general \n     presumption that courts are going to follow prior precedent.\n\n  Precedent is an important element of judicial restraint. In contrast \nto the grandiose picture painted by some on the other side of the \naisle, the judiciary doesn't exist to right all wrongs, correct all \nerrors, heal social wounds, and otherwise usher in an age of domestic \ntranquility. Judges have a specific role to play, but, like legislators \nand the executive, they must stay in their proper place.\n  Judge Alito believes that giving precedent an important role in \ndeciding cases limits the power of the judiciary. If his opponents \nbelieve instead that judges should have unlimited power and may \ndisregard precedent at will, let them try to persuade the American \npeople.\n  Let me refer again to Judge Alito's summary of his views on \nprecedent. In addition to stare decisis being an important legal \ndoctrine, Judge Alito also said that there is a general presumption \nthat decisions of the Court will not be overruled. If that presumption \ndid not exist, there would be little point in paying attention to prior \ndecisions at all. In fact, it is that presumption which makes precedent \nuseful in limiting the power of the judiciary.\n  Judge Alito also said that overruling a prior decision requires a \nspecial justification. Some of Judge Alito's opponents suggest that he \nhas taken a careless or reckless attitude toward the precedents of the \ncourt on which he now sits. I assume that, by this suggestion, they \nwant people to believe that\n\n[[Page S291]]\n\nJudge Alito would play fast and loose with Supreme Court precedent once \nhe joins the Court. The suggestion is certainly false.\n  Judge Alito has voted to overrule his own court's precedents only \nfour times in the 15 years on the U.S. Court of Appeals--only four \ntimes. In each of those cases, in which all of the judges in the \ncircuit participated, he was in the majority, and in two of them the \ndecision was unanimous. Judge Alito has demonstrated his view that \njudges should not heedlessly overrule past decisions.\n  As he explained it, the factors helping judges to handle precedents, \nincluding ones to overrule or reaffirm them, include when a past \ndecision has actually been challenged and the Court has decided to \nretain it. This would, of course, not include cases in which the \nvalidity of a prior decision was neither challenged nor decided. It is, \nafter all, another fundamental principle of judicial restraint, which \nJudge Alito also endorsed, that courts should not decide constitutional \nquestions unless absolutely necessary. That would include deciding \nwhether prior decisions, especially on constitutional issues, should be \noverruled or reaffirmed.\n  Obviously, a court does not decide an issue unless it actually \naddresses and decides it, and a court cannot be said to reaffirm or \nuphold a prior decision unless it actually addresses or decides that \nissue.\n  That said, a court strengthens the presumption that a precedent will \nbe followed when the court actually does reaffirm such a decision. At \nthe same time, Judge Alito has said that adhering to prior decisions is \nnot an inexorable command. Those are not his words. As he pointed out \nat his hearing, the Supreme Court has repeatedly used that language, \nholding over and over again that adherence to precedent is not an \ninexorable command.\n  This only makes sense. While following prior decisions is a \npresumption, it is a rebuttable presumption. Here is where Judge \nAlito's opponents cry foul the loudest and where they expose their real \nagenda.\n  Many of Judge Alito's opponents do not really care about legal \ndoctrines; they only care about political agendas. For them, the \npolitical ends justify the judicial means, and so-called principles are \ninfinitely flexible so long as the political goal is achieved. They do \nnot care about precedents in general; they only care about certain \nprecedents in particular.\n  While Judge Alito has presented a thoughtful, principled approach to \nhandling any prior decision, his opponents have but one simple, hard, \npolitical rule: get your hands off the precedents we want to keep. \nTheir rule seems to be stare decisis for me but not for thee. Reaffirm \ndecisions we like; overrule ones we oppose. This one-way ratchet is \nsimply a device for getting the courts to do the political heavy \nlifting and preserving particularly the Supreme Court's role as \npolicymaker in chief.\n  The real issue for Judge Alito's opponents is not that he rules too \noften for this group or that group, as if judges are supposed to make \nthe numbers satisfy some political interest group rather than \nfaithfully apply the law. It is not really about theories such as what \nhas been called the unitary executive, which to Judge Alito apparently \nmeans nothing more unusual than that the head of the executive branch \nshould be able to control and lead the executive branch. It is not \nabout guilt-by-association tactics--accusations of affiliation with \ngroups wanting to preserve Princeton's all-male tradition made by \nSenators belonging to all-male clubs.\n  No, Mr. President, this is about abortion. That is the be-all and \nend-all issue of those who oppose Judge Alito. I admit there may be an \nexception or two over there, but I really believe it comes down to \nthat. That is what is driving this, and that is what the outside \nspecial interests, the leftwing groups, are using to drive them. The \n800-pound precedent in the room is Roe v. Wade. That is the decision \nJudge Alito's opponents want left alone at all costs.\n  Many Senators and leftwing interest groups have demanded to know \nwhether Judge Alito, if confirmed, would ever vote to overrule Roe v. \nWade. I applaud their creativity in getting as close as possible to \ndirectly asking him that question. For most of Judge Alito's opponents, \nwhether Roe v. Wade was correctly decided doesn't matter. Whether it \nwas a legitimate interpretation of the Constitution does not matter. \nNo, abortion advocates take a fluidly flexible approach to precedent, \nat least until they get the one they want. Then they become the most \nrigid and doctrinaire defenders of precedent, insisting on keeping what \nthey have. This all seems like a judicial version of ``heads I win, \ntails you lose.''\n  Mr. President, I am glad to say that Judge Alito follows principle \nrather than politics on the bench. Can you imagine if the attitude of \nhis opponents regarding this one precedent, Roe v. Wade, actually \nprevailed across the board? What if adherence to prior decisions was \nactually an inexorable command? What if the Supreme Court's \ninterpretation of the Constitution, once on the books, could never be \nchanged? If the doctrine of stare decisis were an inexorable command, \ndecisions such as Dred Scott v. Sanford and Plessy v. Ferguson would \nstill be on the books.\n  Judge Alito put it:\n\n       I don't think anybody would want a rule in the area of \n     constitutional law that . . . said that a constitutional \n     decision once handed down can never be overruled.\n\n  The judiciary must be guided by principles, not by politics. The \nSupreme Court has repeatedly said that the role of precedent is \nactually the weakest in cases involving the Constitution for a very \nsimple reason. When the Supreme Court construes one of our statutes \nincorrectly, we can correct that error in short order. When the Supreme \nCourt interprets the Constitution incorrectly, correction comes only \nthrough the cumbersome constitutional amendment process or the Court's \nwillingness to review its past decisions.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of Supreme Court decisions \naffirming the principle that precedent is weakest in constitutional \ncases be printed in the Record.\n       There being no objection, the material was ordered t9 be \n     printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n            Stare Decisis Is Weakest in Constitutional Cases\n\n       Agostini v.

Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808,828 (1991))--Justice O'Connor.\n       ``As we have often noted, `[s]tare decisis is not an \n     inexorable command, . . .' That policy is at its weakest when \n     we interpret the Constitution because our interpretation can \n     be altered only by constitutional amendment or by overruling \n     our prior decisions.''\n       Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808,828 (1991) (quoting \n     Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U.S. 196,119 (1940) and Burnet v. \n     Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U.S. 393,407 (1932))--Chief \n     Justice Rehnquist.\n       ``Stare decisis is not an inexorable command; rather, it \n     `is a principle of policy and not a mechanical formula of \n     adherence to the latest decision.' This is particularly true \n     in constitutional cases, because in such cases `correction \n     through legislative action is practically impossible.' ''\n       Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. 957,965 (1991)--Justice \n     Scalia.\n       ``We have long recognized, of course, that the doctrine of \n     stare decisis is less rigid in its application to \n     constitutional precedents.''\n       Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U.S. 530,543 (1962)--Justice \n     Harlan.\n       ``. . . this Court's considered practice not to apply stare \n     decisis as rigidly in constitutional as in nonconstitutional \n     cases. . . .''\n       New York v. United States, 326 U.S. 572 (1946)--Justice \n     Frankfurter.\n       ``But throughout the history of the Court stare decisis has \n     had only a limited application in the field of constitutional \n     law.

Allwright, 321 U.S. 649,665 (1944)--Justice Reed.\n       ``In constitutional questions, where correction depends \n     upon amendment and not upon legislative action, this Court \n     throughout its history has freely exercised its power to \n     reexamine the basis of its constitutional decisions.''\n       St. Joseph Stock Yards Co. v. United States, 98 U.S. 38,94 \n     (1936)--Justices Stone and Cardozo, concurring in the result.\n       ``The doctrine of stare decisis . . . has only a limited \n     application in the field of constitutional law.''\n       Burnet v.

Mr. President, in some of these cases, the Justice whom \nJudge Alito would replace, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, is the one \nrepeating this principle.\n  Let me return once again to how Judge Alito summarized his own view\n\n[[Page S292]]\n\nof precedent. It is a very important legal doctrine that serves to \nlimit judicial power. There is a general presumption that past \ndecisions will not be overruled, but this is not an inexorable command.\n  Judge Alito takes a sound, traditional, principled view of the role \nof precedent in judicial decisionmaking, and I hope my colleagues will \nconsider Judge Alito's view for what it actually is.\n  In closing, let me say that the debate over this nomination has been \ngoing on for about 3 months. It has been long and vigorous, both inside \nthe Senate and across the country. I wish to note some of the opinions \noutside of this body on the nomination before us.\n  Some of my colleagues on other side of the aisle are fond of quoting \nliberal law professor Cass Sunstein's statistical analysis about which \nsides have won or lost in different categories of cases before Judge \nAlito. They have often said it is in his dissent that we may find his \ntrue judicial philosophy. I wonder whether they will credit Professor \nSunstein's conclusions about Judge Alito's dissents, published last \nNovember in the Washington Post.\n  Here is what he said on the contrary:\n\n       None of Alito's opinions is reckless or irresponsible or \n     even especially far-reaching. His disagreement is unfailingly \n     respectful. His dissents are lawyerly rather than bombastic. \n     He does not berate his colleagues . . . Nor has Alito \n     proclaimed an ambitious or controversial theory of \n     interpretation. He avoids abstractions.\n\n  That was November 1, 2005.\n  Here is the conclusion of New York Newsday, which is titled \n``Qualifications'':\n\n       Samuel Alito is a modest, decent man and an accomplished \n     jurist, well within the country's conservative mainstream. On \n     that basis he should be confirmed. But the Nation will need \n     him to be a strong guardian of the constitutional rights and \n     protections that make this country special.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that three other editorials from the \nWashington Post, Chicago Tribune, and the Newark Star-Ledger be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered, to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 15, 2006]\n\n                          Confirm Samuel Alito\n\n       The Senate's decision concerning the confirmation of Samuel \n     A. Alito Jr. is harder than the case last year of now--Chief \n     Justice John G. Roberts Jr. Judge Alito's record raises \n     concerns across a range of areas. His replacement of Justice \n     Sandra Day O'Connor could alter--for the worse, from our \n     point of view--the Supreme Court's delicate balance in \n     important areas of constitutional law. He would not have been \n     our pick for the high court. Yet Judge Alito should be \n     confirmed, both because of his positive qualities as an \n     appellate judge and because of the dangerous precedent his \n     rejection would set.\n       Though some attacks on him by Democratic senators and \n     liberal interest groups have misrepresented his \n     jurisprudence, Judge Alito's record is troubling in areas. \n     His generally laudable tendency to defer to elected \n     representatives at the state and federal levels sometimes \n     goes too far--giving rise to concerns that he will prove too \n     tolerant of claims of executive power in the war on terror. \n     He has tended at times to read civil rights statutes and \n     precedents too narrowly. He has shown excessive tolerance for \n     aggressive police and prosecutorial tactics. There is reason \n     to worry that he would curtail abortion rights. And his \n     approach to the balance of power between the federal \n     government and the states, while murky, seems unpromising. \n     Judge Alito's record is complicated, and one can therefore \n     argue against imputing to him any of these tendencies. Yet he \n     is undeniably a conservative whose presence on the Supreme \n     Court is likely to produce more conservative results than we \n     would like to see.\n       Which is, of course, just what President Bush promised \n     concerning his judicial appointments. A Supreme Court \n     nomination isn't a forum to refight a presidential election. \n     The president's choice is due deference--the same deference \n     that Democratic senators would expect a Republican Senate to \n     accord the well-qualified nominee of a Democratic president.\n       And Judge Alito is superbly qualified. His record on the \n     bench is that of a thoughtful conservative, not a raging \n     ideologue. He pays careful attention to the record and \n     doesn't reach for the political outcomes he desires. His \n     colleagues of all stripes speak highly of him. His integrity, \n     notwithstanding efforts to smear him, remains unimpeached.\n       Humility is called for when predicting how a Supreme Court \n     nominee will vote on key issues, or even what those issues \n     will be, given how people and issues evolve. But it's fair to \n     guess that Judge Alito will favor a judiciary that exercises \n     restraint and does not substitute its judgment for that of \n     the political branches in areas of their competence. That's \n     not all bad. The Supreme Court sports a great range of \n     ideological diversity but less disagreement about the scope \n     of proper judicial power. The institutional self-discipline \n     and modesty that both Judge Alito and Chief Justice Roberts \n     profess could do the court good if taken seriously and \n     applied apolitically.\n       Supreme Court confirmations have never been free of \n     politics, but neither has their history generally been one of \n     party-line votes or of ideology as the determinative factor. \n     To go down that road is to believe that there exists a \n     Democratic law and a Republican law--which is repugnant to \n     the ideal of the rule of law. However one reasonably defines \n     the ``mainstream'' of contemporary jurisprudence, Judge \n     Alito's work lies within it. While we harbor some anxiety \n     about the direction he may push the court, we would be more \n     alarmed at the long-term implications of denying him a seat. \n     No president should be denied the prerogative of putting a \n     person as qualified as Judge Alito on the Supreme Court.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, Jan. 15, 2006]\n\n                          Confirm Judge Alito\n\n       Having survived the hazing ritual known as a Senate \n     Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing, Judge Samuel Alito \n     Jr. has demonstrated that he should be confirmed for the \n     Supreme Court.\n       He had largely done so before the hearing. His record on \n     the bench is strong. The American Bar Association determined \n     he is highly qualified. But he had to go through the process \n     of proving that he could remain calm through every contorted \n     attempt by senators to challenge his character and fitness. \n     He has done so.\n       So what did we learn from the hearing?\n       That Alito will not prejudge matters before the court, \n     despite the Democrats' fervent demand that he declare \n     abortion is a matter beyond judicial review. (Good judges, he \n     pointedly said, ``are always open to the possibility of \n     changing their minds based on the next brief that they read \n     or the next argument that's made by an attorney who's \n     appearing before them or a comment that is made by a \n     colleague ... when the judges privately discuss the case.'')\n       That Alito finds repugnant the views of a long departed, \n     long forgotten Princeton organization to which he, \n     apparently, had the slimmest of connections.\n       That he believes judges should rule on the law, not make \n     law.\n       If Democrats on the Judiciary Committee hoped to expose him \n     as a right-wing ideologue, they failed. They did manage, as \n     they did last year in the confirmation hearings for Chief \n     Justice John G. Roberts Jr., to show how pious, preening and \n     pompous they can be.\n       Alito probably won't get many Democratic votes, even though \n     he deserves their support. We'll go through the ritual of \n     opposition senators declaring that, after careful \n     deliberation, they cannot vote for this nominee. They've \n     already laid the foundation, as the lawyers say; several \n     Democrats have announced that after more than 18 hours of \n     testimony they still have doubts about his ``credibility.''\n       A week of hearings. Fifteen years of judicial opinions, all \n     available for review. But in all that, Alito's opponents have \n     failed to unearth anything damaging--or even to elicit an \n     intemperate remark from the judge, though they did succeed in \n     making his wife cry. It's a wonder anyone is willing to \n     endure this process.\n       The special-interest campaigns will thunder on for a few \n     more days. Some Democrats on the committee have demanded the \n     vote be postponed while they ponder their next moves, \n     including a possible filibuster. What a terribly destructive \n     move that would be.\n       Alito's integrity, professional competence and judicial \n     temperament ``are of the highest standing.'' That was the \n     judgment of the American Bar Association, reached after \n     interviewing 300 people who know Alito and evaluating 350 of \n     his written opinions and dozens of unpublished opinions, oral \n     arguments and memos.\n       He ``sees majesty in the law, respects it, and remains a \n     dedicated student of it to this day.'' That, too, was the \n     judgment of the ABA.\n       Alito is, as his colleague, federal Appellate Judge Edward \n     R. Becker, testified, ``a real judge deciding each case on \n     the facts and the law, not on his personal views, whatever \n     they may be.''\n       He deserves every senator's vote.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Newark Star-Ledger, Jan. 17, 2006]\n\n                       Confirm Alito to the Court\n\n       The Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on Supreme Court \n     nominee Samuel Alito Jr. have been a remarkable tutorial--not \n     in the law but in just how low partisan politics have sunk.\n       Democrats have painted Alito as someone ready to turn back \n     the clock 50 years on civil, reproductive and workers' \n     rights. They have attempted to draw a public portrait of \n     Alito, sometimes relying on half-truths, that those who know \n     him best barely recognize. Republicans responded to this \n     onslaught with a slew of softball questions designed not to \n     elicit information but to present the nominee in the best \n     possible light.\n       Neither side has served the public particularly well.\n       For their part, Senate Judiciary Committee members \n     interjected a level of senatorial logorrhea that was \n     stunning, droning on and on about matters that had nothing to\n\n[[Page S293]]\n\n     do with Alito's fitness to serve on the nation's highest \n     court.\n       Despite the spectacle of the hearings, we are convinced \n     Alito, a New Jerseyan who sits on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court \n     of Appeals, is eminently qualified to serve as an associate \n     justice of the U.S. Supreme Court and should be confirmed by \n     the committee and ultimately by the full Senate, and, yes, \n     with the support of New Jersey's two Democratic senators.\n       Our support is not an uncritical ode to homegrown talent. \n     It is based, in part, on the respect and praise Alito has \n     garnered from those who have worked with him throughout his \n     distinguished legal and judicial career. Democrats and \n     Republicans, conservatives and liberals, many of whom, \n     perhaps, philosophically disagree with Alito, have \n     consistently maintained he is well-suited for the court.\n       We think they make a compelling case.\n       Among those who speak highly of him are Rutgers Law School \n     Associate Dean Ronald Chen, an outspoken liberal who was just \n     named by Gov.-elect Jon Corzine to be public advocate; \n     retired Chief Judge John Gibbons of the 3rd Circuit Court of \n     Appeals, who since leaving the bench has worked aggressively \n     to eliminate the death penalty; well-known Democratic lawyer \n     Douglas Eakeley, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton \n     to the board of directors of the Legal Services Corp.; \n     Democratic criminal defense attorney Joseph Hayden and former \n     Attorney General Robert Del Tufo, who served in Democrat Jim \n     Florio's cabinet and worked with Alito in the U.S. Attorney's \n     Office.\n       None of these folks had to stand up for Alito, but they \n     did.\n       Similarly, the judges who sit with Alito on the 3rd Circuit \n     in Philadelphia came forth in an unprecedented show of \n     support, insisting he was not an ideologue, had scrupulously \n     adhered to precedent and had shown no signs of hostility \n     toward a particular class of cases or litigants.\n       The American Bar Association declared Alito ``well-\n     qualified''--the highest approval rating given by the ABA.\n       This is not to say we like everything we heard from Alito \n     in the hearings.\n       Given our strong and long-standing support for abortion \n     rights, we worry that Alito's refusal to describe Roe vs. \n     Wade as settled law could mean he'll be inclined to take \n     positions that chip away at a woman's right to abortion. At a \n     time when questions are being raised about the abuse of \n     presidential power in the war on terror, we're discomforted \n     by Alito's expansive view of presidential authority.\n       The hard truth is that selecting nominees for the Supreme \n     Court is a presidential choice. And it is reasonable and \n     appropriate for a president to pick someone who reflects his \n     values. During the 2004 presidential race, candidate George \n     Bush made no bones about his intention, if given a chance, to \n     select conservatives.\n       Some Democrats have argued against that standard. They've \n     said nominees have to reflect a political ``mainstream.'' But \n     if that were the case, Clinton's nomination of Ruth Bader \n     Ginsberg would never have been confirmed by a 96-3 vote. \n     Republicans overwhelmingly supported Ginsberg, even though \n     she is the very picture of a left-wing ideologue. She was \n     general counsel of the American Civil Liberties Union and \n     directed the ACLU's Women's Rights Project, arguing numerous \n     controversial abortion rights cases.\n       Alito is a conservative, but he is not an ideologue. He has \n     demonstrated that he has the intellect and temperament to \n     serve the nation well.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I also note that the attorneys general of \n20 States, Democrats and Republicans, have signed a letter urging this \nbody to confirm Judge Alito. I am proud that Mark Shurtleff, attorney \ngeneral of my home State of Utah, is among them. They write:\n\n       Judge Alito represents the best of the Federal bench and we \n     believe he will be an excellent Supreme Court justice.\n\n  I agree, and I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed into \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                  January 6, 2006.\n     Re Judicial confirmation of Judge Samuel A. Alito, Jr., to \n         the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Frist, Minority Leader Reid, Chairman \n     Specter, and Ranking Member Leahy: We, the undersigned \n     Attorneys General of our respective states, are writing in \n     support of the confirmation of Judge Samuel A. Alito, Jr., to \n     serve as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the \n     United States.\n       We are confident that Judge Alito will bring to the Court \n     not only years of legal experience and judicial temperament, \n     but also modesty and great personal character.\n       We reflect diverse views and constituencies and are united \n     in our belief that Judge Alito will be an outstanding Supreme \n     Court Justice and should be confirmed by the United States \n     Senate.\n       As the Senate prepares for the confirmation process of \n     Judge Alito, it is important to look beyond partisan politics \n     and ideology and focus on the judicial experience of this \n     extremely well qualified nominee. Judge Alito has served the \n     United States as an Assistant to the Solicitor General, as a \n     United States Attorney, and for the past 15 years, as a Judge \n     on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       Judge Alito's record on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals \n     demonstrates judicial restraint. He has proven that he seeks \n     to apply the law and does not legislate from the bench. Judge \n     Alito's judgments while on the bench have relied on legal \n     precedent and current law, and he has a long-standing \n     reputation for being both tough and fair. In short, Judge \n     Alito represents the best of the federal bench and we believe \n     he will be an excellent Supreme Court Justice.\n       We urge the Senate to hold an up or down vote and confirm \n     Judge Alito.\n           Sincerely,\n         John W. Suthers, Attorney General of Colorado; Troy King, \n           Attorney General of Alabama; Charlie Crist, Attorney \n           General of Florida; Lawrence Wasden, Attorney General \n           of Idaho; Tom Corbett, Attorney General of \n           Pennsylvania; David W. Marquez, Attorney General of \n           Alaska; Mark J. Bennett, Attorney General of Hawaii; \n           Stephen Carter, Attorney General of Indiana; Phill \n           Kline, Attorney General of Kansas; Jon Bruning, \n           Attorney General of Nebraska.\n         Wayne Stenehjem, Attorney General of North Dakota; Henry \n           McMaster, Attorney General of South Carolina; Lawrence \n           Long, Attorney General of South Dakota; Judith Williams \n           Jagdmann, Attorney General of Virginia; Michael A. Cox, \n           Attorney General of Michigan; George Chanos, Attorney \n           General of Nevada; Jim Petro, Attorney General of Ohio; \n           Greg Abbott, Attorney General of Texas; Mark Shurtleff, \n           Attorney General of Utah; Rob McKenna, Attorney General \n           of Washington.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the votes we take today and tomorrow give \nus an important opportunity. The Los Angeles Times editorial of January \n15, 2006, got it right, saying that trying to derail this nomination by \nfilibuster rather than on the merits is wrong.\n  I urge my colleagues to preserve this body's tradition by rejecting \nthis desperate filibuster attempt, and then in a vote tomorrow, I urge \nmy colleagues to honor the judiciary's important but limited role in \nour system of government by confirming this qualified and honorable man \nto the Supreme Court of the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is time for the debate on the \nnomination of Judge Alito to end. It is time for the Senate to act on \nthe President's nomination of Samuel Alito to serve as a Justice on the \nU.S. Supreme Court.\n  We have had ample time to review this nomination. The Judiciary \nCommittee has conducted a thorough review of Judge Alito's background \nand qualifications. Senator Specter, as chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, ensured that all the questions that should be asked of this \nnominee were asked and answered.\n  The Judiciary Committee thoroughly reviewed the story of Judge \nAlito's life and questioned him on a wide range of issues. In the \nprocess, Judge Alito demonstrated his ability, intelligence, and his \nfitness to serve as a Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  In almost 3 months of intense scrutiny and over 18 hours of personal \ntestimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Judge Alito provided \nclear and candid answers to all the questions that were asked.\n  All Senators have had an opportunity to meet with Judge Alito, to \nreview the opinions he has written, to read the articles he has written \nin law reviews and other publications, to become familiar--as familiar \nas anyone can--with his thinking, his judicial philosophy, his past \nperformance as a judge, as a solicitor, as a lawyer in private \npractice, as a student in law school, and as a fellow judge. Judge \nAlito has more judicial experience than any Supreme Court nominee in \nover 70 years.\n  In my opinion, the most impressive and persuasive testimony at the \nhearings in the committee came from the panel of judges with whom he \nserved on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. They testified before the \ncommittee\n\n[[Page S294]]\n\nand discussed the way Judge Alito approached questions before that \ncourt, the way he acted during deliberations among other members of the \ncourt about the decision that should be reached in each case, and \ngenerally the way he went about discharging the enormously important \nduties he had as a member of that court. And despite differences in \npolitics and viewpoints and backgrounds among some of the judges with \nhim, they were all enthusiastically supporting his confirmation for \nservice on the Supreme Court.\n  Judge Alito has earned the respect of those who know him best--his \ncolleagues on the Federal courts, as well as his current and former law \nclerks, and the members of the bar who have appeared before him in \ncourt. He is widely respected for his even temperament, his integrity, \nhis sound legal judgment, and his respect and courtesy for others.\n  I am confident Judge Alito will serve with great distinction as a \nJustice on the Supreme Court. I think reciting Judge Alito's own words \nis the best way for me to conclude my remarks. He said:\n\n       Fifteen years ago, when I was sworn in as a judge of the \n     Court of Appeals, I took an oath. I put my hand on the Bible, \n     and I swore that I would administer justice without respect \n     to persons, that I would do equal right to the poor and the \n     rich, and that I would carry out my duties under the \n     Constitution and the laws of the United States. And that is \n     what I have tried to do to the very best of my ability for \n     the past 15 years. And if I am confirmed, I pledge to you \n     that that is what I would do on the Supreme Court.\n\n  It is time to end this debate. It is time to confirm the President's \nnomination of Judge Samuel Alito.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I know there are a number of people who \nwish to speak on Judge Alito. I want to add a few comments of my own on \nthis nomination. If I may inquire of the Chair, is there time that \nneeds to be yielded?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may speak up until 4 o'clock.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I sat in on the hearings for Judge Alito. I personally \ninterviewed Judge Alito. I talked with him in my office. I sat through \nthe hearings and was able to question him in the Judiciary Committee. I \nam on the Judiciary Committee, so I sat through those hearings to hear \nhis testimony. I feel as if we had a good chance to take the measure of \nthe man, and he is outstanding. I believe he is going to be an \noutstanding jurist.\n  He answered hundreds of questions, more than I believe any prior \nnominee has answered in the history of the Republic. He answered them \ndeftly. He answered them with an encyclopedic knowledge of the law. It \nwas amazing to me to see that he did not have a note in front of him \nthe whole time, and if you asked him any constitutional question on any \ncase at any time in the history of the Republic, he would say here are \nthe facts of that case, here is how the law was decided, this case is \nstill in question or it isn't. He is a brilliant jurist. He \nwasn't particularly good on international law, and I was particularly \nglad to hear he wasn't good on law, on what would happen in other \ncountries.\n\n  He has a long history on the bench which I think is important. For a \nseries of years now, only so-called stealth candidates could be \napproved. Judge Alito is a man with years of experience on the Third \nCircuit Court of Appeals. He has written a number of opinions that we \ncould dissect them and see. People were looking into his background, \ntrying to determine does he lean this way or that way, but he has \nhundreds of published opinions, and through them we can see which way \nhe leans.\n  He is a known commodity--well known, well respected, and well \nregarded across the board. I do think where he is going to contribute \nto the country, the Republic, is in the areas of religious freedom and \nfree expression. This has not gotten much play at all in the media or \nin much of the hearings, but it is one of the areas he has written the \nmost extensively on and in which he is a legal scholar.\n  He believes in a robust public square, a public square where we can \ncelebrate faith, and where faith can be presented. He believes in this \nfor all faiths and faith traditions. You see that in cases where he has \nruled in favor of menorah candles being put forward, Christmas trees, \nand Muslim police officers being able to dress appropriately to their \nreligion and still be able to be police officers.\n  He believes in a separation of church and state, but he also believes \nthis is a country full of people of faith and that they should, under \nthe free expression clause, be allowed to express and to live that \nfaith and to be able to show it. I think he is very clear and \nthoughtful.\n  If there is an area of the law that needs clarity, it is this because \nwe have rules and tests all over the country. I think he is going to \ncontribute in this area. This is one of the areas that did not get much \nreview, it did not get much comment, but I think he is going to make a \nclear impression, and I think he is going to make a very helpful \nimpression for this Nation whose motto, as the Chair looks at it, is \n``In God We Trust.''\n  There is a reason for that. This is a nation of faith. It is one we \nseek to celebrate, not have an imprimatur from the state saying this is \nthe religion or that is the religion, but rather saying we want you all \nto be here, have your own faith, be able to celebrate it, and be able \nto bring it forward in this Nation. I think he is going to contribute \ngreatly in this particular category.\n  The area of abortion got the most review, and it is unknown how he \nwould rule in the case of Roe v. Wade or anything along that line. He \ndid not state an opinion one way or the other. It is an area of open \ncase law. It is an area, in my opinion, that is not in the \nConstitution. There is no constitutional right for a woman to abort her \nchild. I believe it to be a matter that should be decided by bodies \nsuch as this, or in States around the country.\n  I remind my colleagues, as they all know, if Roe v. Wade or any \nportion of it were overturned, the issue goes back to the States. That \nis the group, that is the body that resolves this issue. It is not \nsomething where the ruling automatically shuts everything down. What \nhappens is it goes back and California decides its rules and New York, \nFlorida, Kansas, Minnesota, and other States decide theirs.\n  I don't see what is so untrustworthy about States resolving this \nissue. They did prior to 1973, and we didn't have near the level of \nconflict or difficulty in this country on those laws when the States \nwere resolving these issues.\n  I strongly doubt all the States would resolve them the same. I doubt \na State in a certain part of the country would be identical to another \none. Yet I do think it would reflect the will of the people. But we do \nnot know how Judge Alito he will rule on this issue. The Democrats \ndon't know, the Republicans don't know, I don't know. This is an issue \nI care deeply about, and we don't know. That is probably as it should \nbe because it is an area of active case law and one that is going to \ncome in front of us.\n  The other area he was challenged so much on was Executive rights and \nprivileges. I believe this man will be very clear in standing up to the \nexecutive branch when the executive branch needs to be held in check. I \nhave no doubt at all about that.\n  One area we talked about that has not again gotten much review, but \nneeds a lot, is the area of judicial restraint. We need a judiciary \nthat will restrain itself. There are three separate branches of \nGovernment, each having a sphere and not to overlap the other. The \njudiciary has not restrained itself in the past. Judge Alito, along \nwith John Roberts, previously coming before the committee and this \nbody, both spoke significantly and clearly about the need for judicial \nrestraint. I believe if we don't start seeing a judiciary that shows \nsome restraint and says it is not an all-powerful judiciary in every \narea, it cannot appropriate money, that is left to the Congress, that \nwe will start to see these bodies remove judicial review by the \nCongress, as is allowed in the Constitution. It is not an area that has \nbeen used much, but I think we are going to start seeing it used much\n\n[[Page S295]]\n\nmore, if the judiciary does not show some level of restraint. This has \nbeen expressed by both John Roberts and Samuel Alito.\n  I believe Judge Alito will be an outstanding jurist if we are able to \nget cloture in this body to end debate, to get the 60 votes necessary \nto end debate. He is one of the most qualified individuals we have had. \nHis is a beautiful story of immigrant parents coming to the United \nStates and working hard to get a good education.\n  He is one of sterling character. Probably one of the saddest chapters \nthat has taken place is the challenge to his character, which is \nnothing short of sterling. This is a gentleman who has worked all his \nlife to uphold the traditions of his family, to make his family proud \nand see his dad pleased that his son stood for right against wrong.\n  At the end of the day, I believe he will exercise justice and \nrighteousness, doing both what is just and what is right. That is what \nwe need in this country, a country that is both just and right.\n  In the greatest traditions of this Nation, we need to do what is \nright, and we need to be just to the strong, to the weak, to those who \ncannot speak for themselves. We need to stand up and speak for their \nrights even if they cannot speak for their own.\n  I support the nomination and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 4 p.m. \nhaving arrived, the Democratic leader or his designee shall be \nrecognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield myself 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I have heard a lot of my colleagues rely on \nthe ABA's determination that Judge Alito is ``well qualified'' as a \nreason--sometimes as reason enough--to vote for his confirmation. But \nthere is a reason why an ABA ranking alone is not all that is required \nto be confirmed to the bench, let alone the highest Court in the land.\n  With a decision as fundamental--as irrevocable--and as important to \nthe American people as the confirmation of a Supreme Court Justice, it \nis important we tell the Americans the full story about the ABA and \nthose rankings.\n  When making its determination, the ABA considers analytical skills. \nThey consider knowledge of the law. They consider integrity, \nprofessional competence, and judicial temperament. But United States \nSenators must consider more than these criteria.\n  What the ABA does not look at is the balance of the Supreme Court. \nWhat they do not look at is ideology. What they do not look at is \njudicial activism. What they do not look at is the consequences of a \njudge's ideologically driven decisions for those who have been wronged \nand who just want to get their day in court. No matter how smart he may \nbe, no matter how cleverly his opinions may be written, no matter how \nskillfully he manipulates the law, their standards don't consider the \nimpact of his decisions on average Americans. In short, they don't \nmeasure what will happen to average Americans if Judge Alito becomes \nJustice Alito. That is our job.\n  None of these measurements consider whether Judge Alito routinely \ncuts off access to justice for the most disadvantaged Americans--those \nthat need it the most. They don't ask whether he consistently excuses \nexcessive government force when it intrudes into the privacy of \nindividuals. They don't consider that the only statement he has ever \nmade about a woman's right to privacy is that she doesn't have one.\n  These are things that we must consider here in the United States \nSenate. These are things that are on the line in this vote this \nafternoon. And these are the things that I believe most Americans want \nus to consider. We have to consider whether a judge we confirm to a \nlifetime appointment to the Supreme Court will undermine the laws that \nwe have already passed that benefit millions of Americans, like the \nFamily Medical Leave Act. We have to consider whether Judge Alito will \nplace barriers in the way of addressing discrimination, whether he will \nserve as an effective check on the abuse of executive power, whether he \nwill roll back women's privacy rights or whether he will enforce the \nrights and liberties that generations of Americans have fought and bled \nand even died to protect. None of the rights we are talking about came \neasily in this country. There were always those in positions of power \nwho fought back and resisted. What we need in a Justice is somebody who \nis sensitive to that history. Senator after Senator has described \nspecific cases and the way in which Judge Alito has had a negative \nimpact in these areas--often standing alone, in dissent against \nmainstream beliefs.\n  This long record is a record that gave the extreme right wing cause \nfor public celebration with his nomination. That just about tells you \nwhat you need to know. The vote today is whether we will take a stand \nagainst ideological courtpacking.\n  Nothing can erase Judge Alito's record. We all know what we are \ngetting. No one will be able to say, in 5 to 10 years, that they are \nsurprised by the decisions Judge Alito makes from the bench. People who \nbelieve in privacy rights, who fight for the rights of the most \ndisadvantaged, who believe in balancing the power between the President \nand Congress need to take a stand now.\n  I understand that, for many, voting for cloture on a judicial \nnomination is a very difficult decision, particularly on this Supreme \nCourt nominee. I also understand that, for some, a nomination must be \nan ``extraordinary circumstance'' in order to justify that vote. Well, \nI believe this nomination is an extraordinary circumstance. What could \npossibly be more important than this--an entire shift in the direction \nof the Court?\n  This is a lifetime appointment to a Court where nine individuals \ndetermine what our Constitution protects and what our laws mean. Once \nJudge Alito is confirmed, we can never take back this vote. Not after \nhe prevents many Americans from having their discrimination cases heard \nby a jury. Not after he allows more government intrusions into our \nprivate lives. Not after he grants the President the power to ignore \nFederal law rather than protecting our system of checks and balances. \nThese questions do not arise out of speculation. They do not arise out \nof mere statement. They arise out of the record the judge has carved \nfor himself.\n  These issues and the threat that Judge Alito's nomination poses to \nthe balance that the Supreme Court has upheld in all the years that \nJustice O'Connor has served there--all of this constitutes an \n``extraordinary circumstance.''\n  I understand that many Senators oppose this nomination, and I believe \nthe vote tomorrow will indicate that if we are not successful today. \nThey say that they understand the threat Judge Alito poses, but they \nargue that somehow a vote to extend debate, when there have been a mere \n30 hours or so of debate, is different. I do not believe it is. I \nbelieve it is the only way that those of us in the minority have a real \nvoice in the selection of this Justice or any Justice. It is the only \nway we can fully complete our constitutional duty of advice and \nconsent. It is the only way we can be a voice for those Americans who \ndo not have a voice today. It is the only way we can stop a \nconfirmation that we feel will certainly cause irreversible harm to the \nprinciples and values that make a real difference in the lives of \naverage Americans. It is the only way we can keep faith with our \nbelief, and the Constitution's promise, of equal justice. That is a \nposition that we can and we should defend anywhere, at any time.\n  I thank those who have stood to be counted in this effort and who \nwill continue to take a stand with their vote. I particularly thank my \nsenior colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy.\n  I think the remainder of the time Senator Kennedy will use.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have 7\\1/2\\ minutes, am I correct in that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will yield myself 7 minutes.\n  First of all, I thank my friend, Senator Kerry, for his strong \ncommitment on this issue and his eloquence, passion, and support of \nthis position. This is a time in the Senate that a battle needs to be \nfought. This vote that we are casting with regard to Judge Alito is \ngoing to have echoes for years and years to come. It is going to be a \ndefining vote about the Constitution of the\n\n[[Page S296]]\n\nUnited States, about our protections of our rights and our liberties in \nthe Constitution of the United States.\n  People in my State at this particular time are concerned about the \ndifficulties they are having with prescription drugs. They are \nconcerned about the problems they are having in paying their oil bills. \nThey are concerned about their problems in paying for the education of \ntheir children. They are troubled by what they see as a result of \nKatrina. They are bothered by what they hear about the corruption in \nWashington and are deeply troubled by what is happening in Iraq. They \nhave not had a chance to focus on what is the meaning of this vote in \nthe Senate this afternoon.\n  But all you have to do is look back into history. Look back into the \nhistory of the judiciary. Look back to the history of the Fifth Circuit \nthat was making the decisions in the 1950s. Look at the record of \nJustice Wisdom, Judge Tuttle, Judge Johnson of Alabama and the courage \nthey demonstrated that said at last we are going to break down the \nwalls of discrimination in this country that have gripped this Nation \nfor 200 years. Our Founding Fathers failed the test when they wrote \nslavery into the Constitution. Abraham Lincoln pointed the way, and we \npassed the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments and had a Civil War, but we \ndid not resolve this issue. It was only until the courage of members \nof--what branch of Government? Not the Congress. Not the Senate. Not \nthe executive. The judiciary, the Fifth Circuit. We are talking now \nabout the Supreme Court, but they are the ones who changed this country \ninevitably with what we call the march toward progress, the march \ntoward knocking down the walls of discrimination that permitted us to \npass the 1964 Civil Rights Act in public accommodations, so people \nwhose skin was not White could go into restaurants and hotels--public \naccommodations; the 1965 act for voting, voting rights; the 1968 act on \npublic accommodations; the 1973 act to say that women are going to be \ntreated equally; the Americans with Disabilities Act that say the \ndisabled are going to be part of the American family. All of that is \nthe march to progress. My friends, the one organization, the one \ninstitution that protects it is the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  Too much blood has been shed in those battles, too much sweat, too \nmany tears, to put at risk that march for progress. And that is what we \nare doing with this nominee. He failed to demonstrate before the \nJudiciary Committee that he was committed to the continued march toward \nprogress. He doesn't have to say how he is going to vote on a \nparticular case, but he has to make it clear that he understands what \nthis Nation is all about, why we are the envy of the world with the \nprogress that we have made to knock down the walls of discrimination \nand prejudice and open up new opportunities for progress for our \npeople. That is the definition of America.\n  Why are we going to put that at risk by putting someone on the \nSupreme Court who is not committed to that progress? We are not asking \nthat they take a particular position on an issue. That is what is \nbefore us. We have a responsibility to try to present this to the \nAmerican people. Our constituents who are working hard, taking care of \ntheir kids, trying to do a job across this country--they are beginning \nto focus on it. It came to the Senate floor last Wednesday. Today is \nMonday. What is the next business? What is the next measure on the \ncalendar? Asbestos? Isn't that interesting? Is there anything more \nimportant than spending time and permitting the American people to \nunderstand this issue? I don't believe so, and that is what our vote at \n4:30 is about.\n  If you are concerned and you want a Justice who is going to stand for \nthe working men and women in this country--it is not going to be Judge \nAlito. If you are concerned about women's privacy rights, about the \nopportunity for women to gain fair employment in America--it is not \nJudge Alito. If you care about the disabled, the Rehabilitation Act \nthat we passed, the IDEA Act to include children in our schools, that \nwe passed, that has been on the books for 25 years, the Americans with \nDisabilities Act that we have passed to bring all of the disabled into \nour society, if you are looking for someone who is going to be a friend \nof the disabled--it is not going to be Judge Alito.\n  Finally, if you are looking for someone who is going to be willing to \nstand up to the executive branch of Government at a time that he is \ngoing to exceed his power and authority and the law of this country--it \nis not going to be Judge Alito. It is not going to be. He is not going \nto be similar to Sandra Day O'Connor who, in the Hamdi case, said: Oh, \nno. No President, even in times of war, is above the law in this \ncountry. He is not going to be similar to Warren Burger, who said ``No, \nMr. President. No, you have to surrender the papers,'' at the time of \nthe Watergate break-ins. ``No, Mr. President.''\n  This is the time. This is the issue. This happens to be the wrong \njudge at the wrong time for the wrong Court.\n  I hope this body will give us the time to be able to explain this in \ngreater detail to our fellow Americans so a real vote can be taken. \nWhen it is, I believe this nominee will not be approved.\n  I understand my time has expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I began the hearing on this nomination by \nputting forward what for me was the ultimate question during the \nconsideration of a successor to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor: Would \nJudge Alito, if confirmed by the Senate to the Supreme Court, protect \nthe rights and liberties of all Americans and serve as an effective \ncheck on government overreaching?\n  Since this debate began last Wednesday, I have posed the fundamental \nquestion that this nomination raises for this body: whether the Senate \nwill serve its constitutional role as a check on Executive power by \npreserving the Supreme Court as a constitutional check on the expansion \nof Presidential power.\n  This is a nomination that I fear threatens the fundamental rights and \nliberties of all Americans now and for generations to come. As \nastonishing as the facts may seem, it does not overstate them to point \nout that the President is in the midst of a radical realignment of the \npowers of the government and of its intrusiveness into the private \nlives of Americans. This nomination is part and parcel of that plan. I \nam concerned that if confirmed, this nominee will further erode the \nchecks and balances that have protected our constitutional rights for \nmore than 200 years. This is a critical nomination, one that can tip \nthe balance on the Supreme Court radically away from constitutional \nchecks and balances and the protection of Americans' fundamental \nrights.\n  The procedural vote just taken was in large measure symbolic. Its \nresult was foreseen by Senators on both sides of the aisle and on both \nsides of the question. The next vote the Senate takes on this critical \nnomination is not symbolic. It has real consequences in the lives of \nthe 295 million Americans alive today, and it will influence the lives \nof generations of Americans to come. It will affect not only our rights \nbut the fundamental rights and liberties of our children and our \nchildren's children. In short, it matters, and it matters greatly. The \nvote the Senate will take tomorrow will determine whether Samuel A. \nAlito, Jr., replaces Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on the Supreme Court \nof the United States.\n  I appreciate why Senators who voted against cloture believe this \nmatter deserves more searching attention by Senators and the American \npeople. Among Democratic Senators, each is voting his or her conscience \nand best judgment. There will be many Democratic Senators who, like the \nDemocratic members of the Judiciary Committee who have closely studied \nthe record of this nominee, will be voting against the nomination. \nThere will be some Democratic Senators who will vote to confirm the \nnominee. Among those voting against, there are some who believe that it \nis not appropriate to withhold the Senate's consent by extending \ndebate. The Senate debated Chief Justice Roberts' nomination during 8 \ndays and over a 10-day calendar period. Although much more divisive and \ncontroversial, the Alito nomination will be debated for just 5 days \nover a 7-day calendar period by the time the vote is called tomorrow.\n  It is true that Democratic Senators do not all vote in lockstep. Each \nDemocratic Senator individually gives these questions serious \nconsideration. They honor their constitutional duty. I am\n\n[[Page S297]]\n\nproud of the Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee for the \nstatements they made last week when the committee considered this \nnomination and during the course of the last few days. Their hard work \nin preparing for three Supreme Court nominations over the last few \nmonths is to be commended. I thank and commend the many Democratic \nSenators who came to the floor, who spoke, who set forth their concerns \nand their views. That includes Democratic Senators opposing the \nnomination and those in favor. It is quite a roster: Senators Kennedy, \nDurbin, Mikulski, Clinton, Kerry, Nelson of Florida, Reed, Murray, \nFeinstein, Inouye, Harkin, Bingaman, Lincoln, Lieberman, Salazar, \nCarper, Levin, Obama, Dayton, Feingold, Johnson, Sarbanes, Stabenow, \nLautenberg, Menendez, and, in addition, Senator Jeffords. These \nSenators approached the matter seriously, in contrast to those partisan \ncheerleaders who rallied behind this White House's pick long before the \nfirst day of hearings.\n  I respect those Senators who are giving this critical nomination \nserious consideration but come to a different conclusion than I, just \nas I continue to respect the 22 Senators who voted against the Roberts \nnomination. I have candidly acknowledged that over the course of \nhistory, their judgment and vote may prove right. I took Judge Roberts \nat his word in the belief that his words and the impressions he \nunderstood them to be creating had meaning. I continue to hope that as \nChief Justice he will fulfill his promise and steer the Court to serve \nas an appropriate check on abuses of Presidential power and protect the \nfundamental liberties and rights of all Americans.\n  Filibusters of judicial nominees--and, in particular, of Supreme \nCourt nominees--are hardly something new. When Justice Fortas was \nnominated by President Johnson to be the Chief Justice, a filibuster \nled by Strom Thurmond and the Republican leader resulted in an \nunsuccessful cloture vote and in that nomination being withdrawn. That \nwas the most recent successful filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee. \nBut that was not the first or last Supreme Court nomination to be \ndefeated. President George Washington, the Nation's first and most \npopular President, saw the Senate reject his nomination of John \nRutledge to the Supreme Court at the outset of our history. Over time \napproximately one-fifth of Presidents' Supreme Court nominees have not \nbeen confirmed.\n  The last time the country was faced with the retirement of the \npivotal vote on the Supreme Court was when Justice Lewis Powell \nresigned in 1987. A Republican President sought to use that opportunity \nto reshape the U.S. Supreme Court with his nomination of Judge Robert \nBork. Judge Bork had been a law professor, a partner in one of the \nNation's leading law firms, a judge on the DC Circuit for 5 years, and \nhe had served as Solicitor General of the United States and even as the \nActing Attorney General at a critical juncture of our history.\n  Many myths have arisen about why the Senate rejected that nomination. \nI was here and, along with the other Senators, both Republican and \nDemocratic, who voted to defeat that nomination, I know that the \nnominee's views were the decisive factor in his failure. His rejection \nof the constitutional right to privacy was a large part of his own \nundoing. Soon thereafter, President Reagan announced and withdrew the \nnomination of Judge Ginsburg and then turned to a conservative Federal \nappellate court judge from California named Anthony Kennedy. Justice \nKennedy, though conservative, was confirmed overwhelmingly and in \nbipartisan fashion. He continues to serve as a respected Justice who \nhas authored key decisions protecting Americans from unfair \ndiscrimination because of their sexual orientation.\n  When the Senate was considering a successor to Justice Powell almost \n20 years ago, I said that I believed a Supreme Court nominee's judicial \nphilosophy should play a central role in our consideration. I noted:\n\n       There is no question that the nominee who is confirmed to \n     succeed Justice Lewis Powell will be uniquely influential in \n     determining the direction of the Supreme Court's \n     interpretation of the Constitution for years to come. There \n     can hardly be an issue closer to the heart of the Senate's \n     role than a full and public exposition of the nominee's \n     approach to the Constitution and to the rule of the courts in \n     discerning and enforcing its commands. That is what I mean by \n     judicial philosophy.\n\n  The same remains true today as we consider a successor to Justice \nSandra Day O'Connor. I strongly believe that Judge Alito's judicial \nphilosophy is too deferential to the government and too unprotective of \nthe fundamental liberties and rights of ordinary Americans for his \nnomination by President Bush to be confirmed by the Senate as the \nreplacement for Justice O'Connor.\n  Judicial philosophy comes into play time and again as Supreme Court \njustices wrestle with serious questions about which they do not all \nagree. These include fundamental questions about how far the government \nmay intrude into our personal lives. Senators need to assess whether a \nnominee will protect fundamental rights if confirmed to be on the \nSupreme Court.\n  Several Republican Senators said that judicial philosophy and \npersonal views do not matter because judges should just apply the rule \nof law as if it were some mechanical calculation. Senator Feinstein \nmade this point exceptionally well during the debate. Personal views \nand judicial philosophy often come into play on close and controversial \ncases. We all know this to be true. Why else did Republican supporters \nforce President Bush to withdraw his previous nominee for this vacancy, \nHarriet Miers, before she even had a hearing? She failed their judicial \nphilosophy litmus test.\n  Indeed, Harriet Miers is the most recent Supreme Court nominee not to \nhave been confirmed. It was last October that President Bush nominated \nhis White House Counsel Harriet Miers to succeed Justice O'Connor. He \ndid so after the death of the Chief Justice and withdrawing his earlier \nnomination of Judge Roberts to succeed Justice O'Connor. The democratic \nleader of the Senate quickly endorsed the selection of Ms. Miers as the \nkind of person, with the kind of background, he found appealing. \nDemocratic Senators went about the serious business of preparing for \nhearings on the Miers nomination. But there were those from among the \nPresident's supporters who castigated Ms. Miers and the President for \nthe nomination. The President succumbed to the partisan pressure from \nthe extreme rightwing of his own party by withdrawing his nomination of \nHarriet Miers to the Supreme Court after repeatedly saying that he \nwould never do so. In essence, he allowed his choice to be vetoed by an \nextreme faction within his party, before hearings or a vote. As \nChairman Specter has often said, they ran her out of town on a rail. In \nfact, of course, she has remained in town as the President's counsel, \nbut his point is correct. Like the more than 60 moderate and qualified \njudicial nominees of President Clinton on whom Republicans would \nneither hold hearings or votes, the Miers nomination was killed by \nRepublicans without a vote--by what was in essence a pocket filibuster. \nThat eye-opening experience for the country demonstrated what a vocal \nfaction of the Republican Party really wants. Their rightwing litmus \ntest demands justice and judges who will guarantee the results that \nthey want. They do not want an independent federal judiciary. They want \ncertain results.\n  Instead of uniting the country through his third choice to succeed \nJustice O'Connor, the President has chosen to reward one faction of his \nparty, at the risk of dividing the country. Those so critical of his \nchoice of Harriet Miers as a nominee were the very people who rushed to \nendorse the nomination of Judge Alito. Instead of rewarding his most \nvirulent supporters, the President should have rewarded the American \npeople with a unifying choice that would have broad support. America \ncould have done better through consultation to select one of the many \nconsensus conservative Republican candidates who could have been \noverwhelmingly approved by the Senate. Instead, without consultation, \nthe President withdrew the Miers nomination and the next day announced \nthat his third choice to succeed Justice O'Connor was Judge Alito.\n  At his hearing, Judge Alito began by asking how he got this critical \nnomination. Over the course of the hearings, I think we began to \nunderstand the real answer to that question. It has little to do with \nJudge Alito's family story and a great deal to do with the pressures\n\n[[Page S298]]\n\nthat forced the President to withdraw the nomination of Harriet Miers \nand this President's efforts to avoid any check on his expansive claims \nto power.\n  This is a President who has been conducting secret and warrantless \neavesdropping on Americans for more than 4 years. This President has \nmade the most expansive claims of power since American patriots fought \nthe war of independence to rid themselves of the overbearing power of \nKing George III. He has done so to justify illegal spying on Americans, \nto justify actions that violate our values and laws against torture and \nprotecting human rights, and in order to detain U.S. citizens and \nothers on his say so without judicial review or due process. This is a \ntime in our history when the protections of Americans' liberties are at \nrisk as are the checks and balances that have served to constrain \nabuses of power for more than 200 years.\n  Judge Alito's opening statement skipped over the reasons he was \nchosen. He ignored his seeking political appointment within the Meese \nJustice Department by proclaiming his commitment to an extreme and \nactivist rightwing legal philosophy. His testimony sought to minimize \nthe Federalist Society and his seeking to use membership in Concerned \nAlumni of Princeton for advancement. He attempted to revise and \nredefine the theory of the ``unitary executive.'' That is a legal \nunderpinning being used by this President and his supporters to attempt \nto justify his assertions of virtually unlimited power. The President \nwanted a reliable Justice who would uphold his assertions of power, his \nmost extreme supporters want someone who will revisit the \nconstitutional protection of privacy rights, and the business \nsupporters wanted someone favorable to powerful special interests.\n  Supreme Court nominations should not be conducted through a series of \nwinks and nods designed to reassure the most extreme Republican \nfactions while leaving the American people in the dark. No President \nshould be allowed to pack the courts, and especially the Supreme Court, \nwith nominees selected to enshrine Presidential claims of government \npower. The checks and balances that should be provided by the courts, \nCongress, and the Constitution are too important to be sacrificed to a \nnarrow, partisan agenda. The Senate stood up to President Roosevelt \nwhen he proposed a court-packing scheme and should not be a rubberstamp \nto this President's effort to move the law dramatically to the right. I \ndo not intend to lend my support to an effort by this President to \nundermine checks and balances or to move the Supreme Court and the law \nradically to the right.\n  So what do we know about the Samuel Alito who graduated from \nPrinceton University and Yale Law School and obtained a plum job in the \noffice of the Solicitor General of the United States? We know that he \nwanted political advancement and was committed to the radical legal \ntheories of the Meese Justice Department. The job application that was \nthe subject of some question at the hearing is most revealing. I will \nask that a copy of that job application be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my statement so that the American people can see it.\n  This confirmation process is the opportunity for the American people \nto learn what Samuel Alito thinks about their fundamental \nconstitutional rights and whether he will serve to protect their \nliberty, their privacy and their autonomy from Government intrusion. \nThe Supreme Court belongs to all Americans, not just the person \noccupying the White House, and not just to a narrow faction of a \npolitical party.\n  We have heard from Judge Alito's supporters that those opposing this \nnomination were ``smearing'' him by asking substantive and probing \nquestions at the hearing and by addressing concerns about his record \nduring this debate. The Republican leader opened the debate with that \nattack. He said this before a single minute of debate or opening \nstatement by any Democratic Senator. These Republican talking points \nring hollow and are particularly inappropriate after President Bush was \nforced by an extreme faction in his own party to withdraw his \nnomination of Harriet Miers.\n  Democratic Senators should not be criticized for taking seriously \ntheir constitutional role in trying to assess whether Judge Alito is \nsuitable for a lifetime position on the Supreme Court. Democrats also \nasked tough questions of Justices Ginsburg and Breyer during their \nconfirmation hearings, which is in stark contrast to the free pass \ngiven to Judge Alito by Republican Senators during his hearing.\n  Those critical of the Democrats have a short and selective historical \nmemory. Republican Senators engaged in a party-line vote in committee \nagainst the nomination of Louis Brandeis to the Supreme Court. \nRepublican Senators, in an unprecedented party-line vote, blocked the \nnomination in 1999 of Missouri Supreme Court Justice Ronnie White, an \nextremely qualified nominee for a Federal district court judgeship. In \nfact, Republicans pocket-filibustered more than 60 of President \nClinton's judicial nominees by holding them up in the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  This President continues to choose confrontation over consensus and \nto be a divider rather than being the uniter that he promised to be. \nThis is in stark contrast to President Clinton's selection of Justices \nGinsburg and Breyer after real consultation. In his book, ``Square \nPeg,'' Senator Hatch described how in 1993, as the ranking minority \nmember of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he advised President Clinton \nabout possible Supreme Court nominees. Senator Hatch recounted that he \nwarned President Clinton away from a nominee whose confirmation he \nbelieved ``would not be easy.'' He wrote that he then suggested the \nnames of Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, both of whom were \neventually nominated and confirmed ``with relative ease.'' President \nBush, who had promised to be a uniter, not a divider, failed to live up \nto his promise or to the example of his predecessor, as described by \nSenator Hatch. The result is that, rather than sending us a nominee for \nall Americans, the President chose a divisive nominee who raises grave \nconcerns about whether he will be a check on Presidential power and \nwhether he understands the role of the courts in protecting fundamental \nrights.\n  The Supreme Court is the ultimate check and balance in our system. \nIndependence of the courts and its members is crucial to our democracy \nand way of life. The Senate should never be allowed to become a \nrubberstamp, and neither should the Supreme Court.\n  This is a nomination to a lifetime seat on the Nation's highest Court \nthat has often represented the decisive vote on constitutional issues. \nThe Senate needs to make an informed decision about this nomination. \nThis process is the only opportunity that the American people and their \nrepresentatives have to consider the suitability of the nominee to \nserve as a final arbiter of the meaning of Constitution and the law. \nHas he demonstrated a commitment to the fundamental rights of all \nAmericans? Will he allow the government to intrude on Americans' \npersonal privacy and freedoms?\n  In a time when this administration seems intent on accumulating \nunchecked power, Judge Alito's views on government power are especially \nimportant. It is important to know whether he would serve with judicial \nindependence or as a surrogate for the President who nominated him. \nBased on a thorough review of his record and that from his hearing, I \nhave no confidence that he will act as an effective check on government \noverreaching and abuses of power.\n\n  As we began the hearings, I recalled the photograph that hangs in the \nNational Constitution Center in Philadelphia, PA. It shows the first \nwoman ever to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States taking \nthe oath of office in 1981. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor served as a \nmodel Supreme Court Justice.\n  She is widely recognized as a jurist with practical values and a \nsense of the consequences of the legal decisions being made by the \nSupreme Court. I regret that some on the extreme right have been so \ncritical of Justice O'Connor and have adamantly opposed the naming of a \nsuccessor who shares her judicial philosophy and qualities. Their \ncriticism reflects poorly upon them. It does nothing to tarnish the \nrecord of the first woman to serve as an Associate Justice of the \nSupreme Court of the United States. She is a Justice whose graciousness \nand sense of duty\n\n[[Page S299]]\n\nfuels her continued service nearly 7 months after she announced her \nintention to retire.\n  As the Senate prepares to vote on President Bush's current \nnomination--his third--for a successor to Justice O'Connor, we should \nbe mindful of her critical role on the Supreme Court. Her legacy is one \nof fairness that I want to see preserved. Justice O'Connor has been a \nguardian of the protections the Constitution provides the American \npeople.\n  Of fundamental importance, she has come to provide balance and a \ncheck on government intrusion into our personal privacy and freedoms. \nIn the Hamdi decision, she rejected the Bush administration's claim \nthat it could indefinitely detain a U.S. citizen. She upheld the \nfundamental principle of judicial review over the exercise of \ngovernment power and wrote that even war ``is not a blank check for the \nPresident when it comes to the rights of the Nation's citizens.'' She \nheld that even this President is not above the law.\n  Her judgment has also been crucial in protecting our environmental \nrights. She joined in 5-to-4 majorities affirming reproductive freedom, \nreligious freedom, and the Voting Rights Act. Each of these cases makes \nclear how important a single Supreme Court Justice is.\n  It is as the elected representatives of the American people--all of \nthe people--that we in the Senate are charged with the responsibility \nto examine whether to entrust their precious rights and liberties to \nthis nominee. The Constitution is their document. It guarantees their \nrights from the heavy hand of government intrusion and their individual \nliberties to freedom of speech and religion, to equal treatment, to due \nprocess and to privacy.\n  The Federal judiciary is unlike the other branches of Government. \nOnce confirmed, Federal judges serve for life. There is no court above \nthe Supreme Court of the United States. The American people deserve a \nSupreme Court Justice who inspires confidence that he, or she, will not \nbe beholden to the President but will be immune to pressures from the \ngovernment or from partisan interests.\n  The stakes for the American people could not be higher. At this \ncritical moment, Democratic Senators are performing our constitutional \nadvice and consent responsibility with heightened vigilance. I urge all \nSenators--Republicans, Democrats and Independents--to join with us. The \nSupreme Court is the guarantor of the liberties of all Americans. The \nappointment of the next Supreme Court Justice must be made in the \npeople's interest and in the Nation's interest, not to serve the \nspecial interests of a partisan faction.\n  I have voted for the vast majority of President Reagan's, President \nBush's, and President Bush's judicial nominees. I recommended a \nRepublican to President Clinton to fill Vermont's seat on the Second \nCircuit, Judge Fred Parker, and recommended another Republican to \nPresident Bush to fill that seat after Judger Parker's death, Judge \nPeter Hall. I voted for President Reagan's nomination of Justice Sandra \nDay O'Connor, for President Reagan's nomination of Justice Anthony \nKennedy, for President Bush's nomination of Justice Souter, and for \nthis President's recent nomination of Chief Justice Roberts. In fact, I \nhave voted for eight of the nine current Justices of the Supreme Court.\n  I want all Americans to know that the Supreme Court will protect \ntheir rights and will respect the authority of Congress to act in their \ninterest. I want a Supreme Court that acts in its finest tradition as a \nsource of justice. The Supreme Court must be an institution where the \nBill or Rights and human dignity are honored. In good conscience, based \non the record, I cannot vote for this nomination. I urge all Senators \nto use this last night of debate to consult their consciences and their \nbest judgment before casting their votes tomorrow. That vote will \nmatter.\n  In my 30 years in the Senate, I have cast almost 12,000 votes here in \nthe Senate. Few will be as important as the vote we cast tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the application to \nwhich I referred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    PPO Non-Career Appointment Form\n\n       From: Mark R.

It is obviously very difficult to \n     summarize a set of political views in a sentence but, in \n     capsule form, I believe very strongly in limited government, \n     federalism, free enterprise, the supremacy of the elected \n     branches of government, the need for a strong defense and \n     effective law enforcement, and the legitimacy of a government \n     role in protecting traditional values. In the field of law, I \n     disagree strenuously with the usurpation by the judiciary \n     decisionmaking authority that should be exercised by the \n     branches of government responsible to the electorate. The \n     Administration has already made major strides toward \n     reversing this trend through its judicial appointments, \n     litigation, and public debate, and it is my hope that even \n     greater advances can be achieved during the second term, \n     especially with Attorney Meese's leadership at the Department \n     of Justice.\n       When I first became interested in government and politics \n     during the 1960s, the greatest influences on my views were \n     the writings of William F. Buckley, Jr., the National Review, \n     and Barry Goldwater's 1964 campaign. In college, I developed \n     a deep interest in constitutional law, motivated in large \n     part by disagreement with Warren Court decisions particularly \n     in the areas of criminal procedure, the Establishment Clause, \n     and reapportionment. I discovered the writings of Alexander \n     Bickel advocating judicial restraint, and it was largely for \n     this reason that I decided to go to Yale Law School.\n       After graduation from law school, completion of my ROTC \n     military commitment, and a judicial clerkship, I joined the \n     U.S. Attorney's office in New Jersey, principally because of \n     my strong views regarding law enforcement.\n       Most recently, it has been an honor and source of personal \n     satisfaction for me to serve in the office of the Solicitor \n     General during President Reagan's administration and to help \n     to advance legal positions in which I personally believe very \n     strongly. I am particularly proud of my contributions in \n     recent cases in which the government has argued in the \n     Supreme Court that racial and ethnic quotas should not be \n     allowed and that the Constitution does not protect a right to \n     an abortion.\n       As a federal employee subject to the Hatch Act for nearly a \n     decade, I have been unable to take a role in partisan \n     politics. However, I am a life-long registered Republican and \n     have made the sort of modest political contributions that a \n     federal employee can afford to Republican candidates and \n     conservative causes, including the National Republican \n     Congressional Committee, the National Conservative Political \n     Action Committee, Rep. Christopher Smith (4th Dist. N.J.), \n     Rep. James Courter (12th Dist. N.J.), Governor Thomas Kean of \n     N.J., and Jeff Bell's 1982 Senate primary campaign in N.J. I \n     am a member of the Federalist Society for Law and Public \n     Policy and a regular participant at its luncheon meetings and \n     a member of the Concerned Alumni of Princeton University, a \n     conservative alumni group. During the past year, I have \n     submitted articles for publication in the National Review and \n     the American Spectator.\n       Applicant Signature: Samuel A. Alito, Jr.\n       Date: Nov. 15, 1985\n       Associate Director Recommendation: Approved, Mark Sullivan.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. We work on many important issues here in the Congress, \nbut none more important than choosing a Justice to serve on the Supreme \nCourt.\n  Providing a lifetime appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court is a very \nserious matter for both the President and the U.S. Senate. Our choice \nwill impact\n\n[[Page S300]]\n\nour country well beyond the term of office for the President and for \nmost of the Senate.\n  Those nominations are also very important to the citizens of our \ncountry and my State of North Dakota, many of whom--on both sides--have \ncontacted my office and whose counsel I have heard and valued.\n  This is the second nomination for the U.S. Supreme Court that has \nbeen sent to the Senate by President Bush in the span of a few short \nmonths.\n  During consideration of the nomination of Judge John Roberts to \nbecome Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, I studied his record \ncarefully. I reviewed the hearing records of his appearance before the \nSenate Judiciary committee as well as his record as a Federal judge on \nthe Circuit Court.\n  And in the end, I voted to confirm Judge Roberts. I concluded that he \nwas very well qualified, and I also felt after meeting with him that he \nwould not bring an ideological agenda to his work of interpreting the \nU.S. Constitution.\n  In short, I felt he would make a fine Chief Justice.\n  The Supreme Court nomination we are now considering is that of Judge \nSamuel Alito.\n  This has been a difficult decision for me.\n  Judge Alito has substantial credentials. His education, work history, \nand his 15 years of service on the Circuit Court are significant.\n  However, in evaluating Judge Alito's rulings, writings, and his \nresponses during his nomination hearings, I have been troubled by \nseveral things.\n  First, he has a clear record over many years of a tendency to favor \nthe big interests over the small interests. That is, when an individual \nis seeking justice in the courts by taking on the government or a large \ncorporation, Judge Alito's rulings are often at odds with the rulings \nof his colleagues on the Court and tend to overwhelmingly favor the \ngovernment or the big interests.\n  People who live in small States like North Dakota have, over many \nyears, found it necessary to use the courts to take on the big economic \ninterests. Whether it is taking on big corporations, the railroads, big \nfinancial interests, or the U.S. Government, as farmers have had to do \nin recent decades, I think it is important that a Supreme Court Justice \nbe someone who will give the people a fair hearing.\n  Judge Alito's rulings on the circuit court have, I believe, tilted \nheavily on the side of the big interests.\n  One of the key questions for me about a new Justice for the Supreme \nCourt is ``will this person interpret the Constitution in a manner that \nexpands personal freedom and liberty, or will this person interpret it \nin a way that restricts personal freedom and liberty?''\n  I believe Judge Alito's record is one that leans in the direction of \nrestricting the freedom and liberty of individual citizens.\n  I am also concerned by Judge Alito's view of what is referred to as \nthe unitary executive. This is an issue about Presidential power in our \nform of government. The judicial branch of Government is designed to be \na check and balance on the expansion of Presidential powers. I believe \nJudge Alito's answers in the Judiciary Committee to questions about the \nunitary executive tilt toward showing deference toward expanded and \nunchecked Presidential authority. His views on this issue concern me.\n  For all of these reasons, I have decided to cast my vote against the \nnomination of Judge Samuel Alito. I take no joy in opposing his \nnomination, but for the reasons I have mentioned above, I am not \ncomfortable voting to confirm him for a lifetime appointment on our \nNation's highest Court.\n  Over the years, I have supported about 97 percent of the nominees for \nthe Federal court sent to us by President Bush. My record has been one \nof substantial support for the President's nominees.\n  But for me, a nomination to the Supreme Court carries much more \nweight and greater potential consequences for the country.\n  Judge Alito is replacing Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on the Court. \nJustice O'Connor has been a key swing vote on so many issues that have \nbeen decided by a 5-to-4 vote in recent years.\n  I believe that Judge Alito's nomination, if approved by the Senate, \nwould tilt that Court in a direction that will restrict personal \nfreedoms, strengthen the role of government and corporations in our \nlives, and allow the expansion of power of the Presidency.\n  For those reasons, I have decided to vote no on this nomination.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to share my thoughts and \nconcerns about the President's nomination of Samuel Alito to be an \nAssociate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  It goes without saying that the decision whether to confirm a nominee \nfor a lifetime position on the Supreme Court is among the Senate's most \nserious and solemn constitutional obligations.\n  My ultimate test for whether to support a nominee to the Supreme \nCourt rests with two questions: will the nominee protect the best \ninterests of West Virginians and will the nominee uphold the \nfundamental rights and freedoms of all Americans that are set out in \nthe Constitution and in our laws. It is a high standard, as it must be \nfor a lifetime appointment to the highest Court in the land.\n  In the last few weeks and months, through careful consideration, I \nhave attempted to answer those two questions. I have concluded that \nJudge Alito's judicial record, his writings, and his statements portray \na man who will not do enough to stand up against power when the rights \nof average Americans are on the line and who will not do enough to \nstand up against the President when the checks and balances in our \nConstitution are on the line.\n  I will not support a filibuster because I see it as an attempt to \ndelay his certain confirmation. But I will register my grave concerns \nabout Judge Alito's nomination to the Supreme Court by voting against \nconfirmation when that final vote is before us.\n  My decision is the result of a long and deliberative process.\n  As my record plainly shows, I have never applied a partisan or \nideological litmus test to nominees. George W. Bush was elected as a \nconservative President, and I have supported his conservative choices \nat every level. On the judiciary alone, I have voted to confirm 203 out \nof 212 judges nominated by President Bush. Just 4 months ago, I voted \nin support of Chief Justice John Roberts, a true conservative, because \nI concluded that he would consider fully the lives of average people, \nthe lives of those in need and those whose voices often are not heard. \nI believed on balance that he would be his own man in the face of \ninevitable outside pressures.\n  In recent weeks and months, I have heard from hundreds of West \nVirginians through letters, telephone calls, and personal \nconversations. Many have expressed strong opposition to Judge Alito, \nand many have expressed strong support for him. I have weighed all of \ntheir views carefully.\n\n  I also have labored over Judge Alito's record--his early writings, \nhis rulings, his speeches, and his Senate testimony--and I met \npersonally with Judge Alito. I wanted to hear directly from him, in his \nown words, what kind of an Associate Justice he would be.\n  There is no question he is an intelligent man with a deep knowledge \nof our legal system. During our conversations, he was a gentleman in \nevery sense of the word. But for me these important character traits \nare not enough to warrant elevation to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I have concluded that although Judge Alito is a well-qualified \njurist, I cannot in good conscience support a nominee whose core \nbeliefs and judicial record exhibit simply too much deference to power \nat the expense of the individual.\n  Particularly in the committee hearings, when pressed on issues such \nas individual rights and Presidential powers, Judge Alito's answers \ntroubled me--they were limited and perfunctory. I was left with a \nstrong sense of his ability to recite and analyze the law as it stands \nbut with very little sense of his appreciation for the principles and \nthe real people behind those laws.\n  Unfortunately, Judge Alito's record does not allay those concerns. As \na government lawyer, a Federal prosecutor, and a 15-year Federal judge \non the Third Circuit, with lifetime tenure, Judge Alito has repeatedly \nsided against people with few or no resources. The average person up \nagainst a big corporation, an employer, or even\n\n[[Page S301]]\n\nthe government itself, all too often comes out on the short end of the \nstick in front of Judge Alito.\n  I am particularly troubled by one case, RNS Services v. Secretary of \nLabor. In RNS Services, Judge Alito argued, in a lone dissent, against \nprotecting workers in a Pennsylvania coal plant by not enforcing the \njurisdiction of the Mine Safety and Health Administration, MSHA. Judge \nAlito claimed that the coal processing plant was closer to a factory \nthan a mine, and therefore should be governed by the more lenient \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, standards. \nFortunately for the miners, the majority of judges in the case did not \nagree with Judge Alito, and MSHA's standards prevailed.\n  Outside the courtroom, Judge Alito has at various times in his career \nsuggested, directly and indirectly, that he supports a \ndisproportionately powerful President and executive branch. As a mid \ncareer government lawyer, his writings showed a solicitous deference to \nthe executive branch and a willingness to undercut the constitutional \nauthority of Congress. As recently as 2000, Judge Alito forcefully \nargued in support of a controversial theory known as the ``unitary \nexecutive'' which would allow the President to act in contravention of \nthe laws passed by Congress in carrying out his duties.\n  As vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I have \ndeveloped an even greater appreciation for the wisdom of our Nation's \nFounders in creating a system of checks and balances among the \njudicial, executive and legislative branches of Government. The \ninteraction between the President and the Congress on matters of \nnational security, classified and unclassified, is incredibly important \nto our safety and our future. Today there is a serious legal and \nconstitutional debate going on in our country about whether the \nPresident, who already has enormous inherent powers as the leader of \nour country, has expanded his executive reach beyond the bounds of the \nlaw and the Constitution. The fact is the President does not write the \nlaws, nor is he charged with interpreting them--the Constitution is \nunequivocally clear that lawmaking resides with the Congress and \ninterpretation resides with the courts--yet this President, on many \nfronts, is attempting to do both.\n  This alarming trend has been exacerbated by the fact that we have a \nsingle party controlling both the White House and the Congress, \nresulting in minimal congressional oversight of an overreaching \nexecutive branch.\n  The Supreme Court, in the coming months and years, will be forced to \nrule on any cases related to expansion of Executive power. This nominee \nwill play a pivotal role in settling the legal questions of today and \ncharting a course for the legal questions of our children's and \ngrandchildren's generations.\n  These are core questions: What is the scope of presidential power \nunder the Constitution? What is the appropriate balance between the \nPresident and the Congress? When must the constitutionally protected \nrights of average Americans--workers' rights, families' rights, and \nindividuals' rights--prevail?\n  At the end of the day, I am left with the fear that Judge Alito \nbrings to the Court a longstanding bias in favor of an all-powerful \npresidency and against West Virginians' basic needs and interests.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, while I had expected that the Senate would \nmove directly to an up-or-down vote on Judge Alito's nomination to the \nSupreme Court without a vote on cloture, because I strongly oppose this \nnomination, as I explained in my remarks last week, and because the \nfilibuster has been a time-honored and accepted part of the checks and \nbalances on the President's appointment powers, I will vote against \ncloture on this nomination.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the nomination of \nJudge Samuel A. Alito, Jr., to become an Associate Justice of the \nSupreme Court. After following the confirmation process and reviewing \nJudge Alito's qualifications, I am pleased to support this nomination \nand congratulate President Bush on another outstanding pick for our \nNation's highest Court. Although there are no guarantees about how any \njudicial nominee will carry out his or her responsibilities once \nconfirmed, I believe that Judge Alito will serve our country well as \nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor has done for almost a quarter of a century \non the Supreme Court.\n  To explain why I support the nomination of Judge Alito, let me first \nbegin my remarks by referring to article II of the U.S. Constitution--\nin particular, section 2, which states that it is up to the President \nto appoint individuals to our highest Court. As he pledged to the \nvoters who elected him, President Bush has exercised his appointment \npowers to pick someone who firmly believes in the rule of law, the \nimportance of protecting the rights of all Americans, and the Founding \nFathers' wisdom of leaving policy decisions to the elected branches of \nGovernment. The President has followed through on his promise to the \nAmerican people by choosing Judge Alito.\n  With that said, Judge Alito is not simply the fulfillment of a \ncampaign promise--he is also one of the sharpest legal minds in the \nFederal appellate ranks and a dedicated public servant. A former editor \nof the Yale Law Journal and Army reservist, Judge Alito has served as a \nlaw clerk for Judge Leonard Garth of the Third Circuit, an assistant \nU.S. attorney for New Jersey, an Assistant to the Solicitor General, \nDeputy Assistant Attorney General in the Department of Justice's Office \nof Legal Counsel, and the U.S. attorney for New Jersey. After his first \n15 years of public service, he then went on to serve as a judge on the \nThird Circuit, for which he was unanimously confirmed by the Senate in \n1990. In total, Judge Alito has served our Nation for 30 years, using \nhis legal experience and talents for public good rather than for \npersonal profit. We should all applaud and support such a record of \npublic service, especially when you consider the fact that Judge Alito \nhas more judicial experience than any Supreme Court nominee in over 70 \nyears.\n  Unfortunately, however, there are a number of my colleagues from \nacross the aisle who somehow believe that this record of public service \nis something to deride and distort. Forget the fact that nearly \neveryone who has worked with Judge Alito or has taken an impartial \nreview of this man's record and credentials, such as the American Bar \nAssociation, supports this nomination wholeheartedly. Forget the fact \nthat Judge Alito has garnered the near unanimous support of his \ncolleagues on the Third Circuit and lawmakers from both parties--\nincluding Governor Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania--who know him best. \nForget the fact that Judge Alito has ruled in favor of minorities who \nhave alleged racial discrimination or were convicted of crimes. Forget \nthat Judge Alito is known by those who have worked with him as a good \nand decent man who does not put ideology over public responsibility. \nSome of my colleagues do not want to consider any of these facts, or \nthey somehow distort all of them as they try to smear the President's \nnominee. And why? Well, because Judge Alito is simply that; he is \nPresident Bush's nominee.\n  As someone who supported both of President Clinton's nominations to \nthe Supreme Court, I find this type of partisanship appalling. Instead \nof accepting the obvious fact that Judge Alito is more than well \nqualified to serve on the Supreme Court, some of my colleagues want to \ncherry-pick and distort a few opinions out of the hundreds that he has \nwritten, hype up his alleged relationship with a university \norganization, or huff and puff about the Vanguard recusal matter even \nthough the American Bar Association and most well regarded legal ethics \nexperts have found nothing unethical. As opposed to qualifications, \nsome of my colleagues across the aisle want to focus solely on these \npetty matters that are borne simply out of personal vendetta or the \necho chamber of liberal blogs. They now want the Senate and the \nAmerican people to forget everything else and base this important vote \non a few dubious claims.\n  None of this is healthy for the Senate or for our Nation. It does not \ntake a genius to realize that most Americans are tired of this petty \npartisanship, and the personal attacks on Judge Alito and the \ndistortion of his record will only further discourage, not encourage, \nfuture nominees who have lengthy records of public service and judicial \nexperience. This is troubling, and I hope that the previous few months \nare\n\n[[Page S302]]\n\nnot more evidence of a trend towards partisanship at all costs. Whether \nsome may like it or not, President Bush was elected by the American \npeople. His nominees therefore deserve fair and dignified consideration \nby the Senate, even by those who opposed the President's election or \nhis views on certain issues.\n  Perhaps these past few months should not have been a surprise to \npeople like me who believe that the Senate should not let politics or \nideology stand in the way of qualified nominees. After all, maybe all \nof this was foreseen by the Founding Fathers when they established the \nnomination process in article II, section 2 of the Constitution and \ngave the Senate only a limited advice and consent role. As Edmund \nRandolph noted, ``Appointments by the Legislatures have generally \nresulted from cabal, from personal regard, or some other consideration \nthan a title derived from the proper qualifications.'' Looking at how \nsome of my colleagues have approached the nomination of Judge Alito, I \nbelieve that Mr. Randolph, sadly, may have been right when he said this \nmore than 200 years ago.\n  Fortunately, there are a greater number of colleagues here in the \nSenate who do view the issue of judicial nominations as being about \nqualifications, not politics. They include the majority leader and the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, who have both done a commendable \njob of moving this nomination forward and giving us the opportunity to \nhave an up-or-down vote. I congratulate them on their efforts and look \nforward to casting my vote in support of Judge Alito. He certainly \ndeserves it, as well as the support of the rest of the Senate.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nnomination of Samuel Alito to serve as Associate Justice of the Supreme \nCourt.\n  The Supreme Court is entrusted with an enormous power--the power to \ninterpret the Constitution, to say what the law is, to guard one branch \nagainst the encroachments of another, and to defend our most sacred \nrights and liberties.\n  The decision of whether to confirm a nominee to the Supreme Court is \na solemn responsibility of the Senate and one that I approach with the \nutmost care. It is a duty that we must perform despite the fact that \nnominees are constrained in the information they can provide us.\n  Some interest groups, and even some of my colleagues, have called on \nnominees to promise to vote a certain way; they demand allegiance to a \nparticular view of the law or a guarantee in the outcome of cases \ninvolving high-profile issues. These efforts are misguided.\n  To avoid prejudging and to ensure impartiality, a nominee should not \ndiscuss issues in areas of the law that are ``live''--where cases are \nlikely to come before the Court. Parties before the Court have a right \nto expect that the Justices will approach their case with a willingness \nto fully and fairly consider both sides.\n  The cases that come before the Supreme Court each year present legal \nissues of tremendous complexity and import, and Justices should not be \nasked to speculate as to how they would vote, or make promises in order \nto win confirmation. Justice Ginsberg stated during her hearing that a \nnominee may provide ``no hints, no forecasts, no previews'' on issues \nlikely to come before the Court. As Justice Ginsberg's statement \nunderscores, the Justices should reach a conclusion only after \nextensive briefing, argument, research, and discussion with their \ncolleagues on the Court.\n  We must also recognize that there are limits to our ability to \nanticipate the issues that will face the Court in the future. Twenty \nyears ago, few would have expected that the Court would hear cases \nrelated to a Presidential election challenge, would try to make sense \nof copyright laws in an electronic age, or would face constitutional \nissues related to the war on terrorism.\n  While we cannot know with certainty how a nominee will rule on the \nfuture cases that will come before him or her, we are not without \ninformation on which to base our judgement. We must engage in a \nrigorous assessment of the nominee's legal qualifications, integrity, \nand judicial temperament, as well as the principles that will guide the \nnominee's decisionmaking. In fact, in Judge Alito's case, I note that \nwe have significantly more information on which to base our judgement \nthan with other nominees, given his long tenure as a judge on the Third \nCircuit Court of Appeals.\n  The excellence of Judge Alito's legal qualifications is beyond \nquestion. Even his fiercest critics acknowledge that he is an \nextraordinary jurist with an impressive knowledge of the law, a \nconclusion also reached by the American Bar Association, ABA.\n  The ABA Standing Committee on the Judiciary conducted an exhaustive \nreview of his qualifications. During this process, the Committee \ncontacted 2,000 individuals throughout the Nation, conducted more than \n300 interviews with Federal judges, State judges, colleagues, \ncocounsel, and opposing counsel, and formed reading groups to review \nhis published opinions, unpublished opinions, and other materials. \nBased on its review, the committee found Judge Alito's integrity, his \nprofessional competence, and his judicial temperament to be of the \nhighest standard, and decided unanimously to rate him ``well \nqualified''--the highest possible rating.\n  When asked at his hearing what type of Justice he would be, Judge \nAlito directed Senators to his record as a judge on the Third Circuit. \nI agree this is the appropriate focus.\n  During his 15 years of service on the Third Circuit, Judge Alito has \nvoted in more than 4,800 cases and has written more than 350 opinions. \nHis record on the bench is one of steady, cautious, and disciplined \ndecisionmaking. He is careful to limit the reach of his decisions to \nthe particular issues and facts before him, and he avoids inflammatory \nor politically charged rhetoric. And despite this extensive record, \nthere is no evidence that his decisions are results-oriented. For \nexample, in the area of reproductive rights, I note that he has reached \ndecisions favoring competing sides of the political debate.\n  After reviewing Judge Alito's dissenting opinions, Cass Sunstein, a \nwell-known liberal law professor from the University of Chicago, \nreached the following conclusion: ``None of Alito's opinions is \nreckless or irresponsible or even especially far-reaching. His \ndisagreement is unfailingly respectful. His dissents are lawyerly \nrather than bombastic. . . . Alito does not place political ideology in \nthe forefront.''\n  During his hearing, the committee heard the testimony of seven judges \nfrom the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, the court on \nwhich Judge Alito currently serves. The panel was comprised of current \nand retired judges, appointed by both Democratic and Republican \nPresidents, and holding views ranging across the political spectrum.\n  Who better to know how Judge Alito thinks, reasons, and approaches \nthe law, than those with whom he worked so closely over the past 15 \nyears? And it is significant that these colleagues were unanimous in \ntheir praise of Judge Alito--in his legal skills, his integrity, his \nevenhandedness, and his dedication to precedent and the rule of law.\n  As Judge Becker commented, ``The Sam Alito that I have sat with for \n15 years is not an ideologue. He's not a movement person. He's a real \njudge deciding each case on the facts and the law, not on his personal \nviews, whatever they may be. He scrupulously adheres to precedent. I \nhave never seen him exhibit a bias against any class of litigation or \nlitigants.''\n  Judge Aldisert, who was appointed by President Johnson, had this to \nsay: ``The great Cardozo taught us long ago the judge, even when he is \nfree, is not wholly free. He is not free to innovate at pleasure. This \nmeans that the crucial values of predictability, reliance and \nfundamental fairness must be honored. . . . And as his judicial record \nmakes plain, Judge Alito has taken this teaching to heart.''\n\n  Judge Lewis, a committed human rights and civil rights activist who \ndescribed himself as ``openly and unapologetic pro-choice,'' said: ``I \ncannot recall one instance during conference or during any other \nexperience that I had with Judge Alito . . . when he exhibited anything \nremotely resembling an ideological bent. . . . If I believed that Sam \nAlito might be hostile to civil rights as a member of the\n\n[[Page S303]]\n\nUnited States Supreme Court, I guarantee you that I would not be \nsitting here today.''\n  Judge Alito's colleagues provided compelling testimony of his deep \nand abiding commitment to the rule of law, the limited role of a judge, \nand the obligation to decide the case based on the facts and the record \nbefore him. They also testified that Judge Alito's decisions have been \nconstrained by established legal rules and specifically by a respect \nfor the rules of precedent. The weight of their testimony is \nsubstantial--they know far more about Judge Alito's judicial philosophy \nthan we could hope to learn in a few days of public hearings.\n  A nominee's judicial philosophy matters to me. When I met with Judge \nAlito, I specifically asked him about his views on the importance of \nprecedent and stare decisis--the principle that courts should adhere to \nthe law set forth in previously decided cases.\n  During both our meeting and his hearing, Judge Alito evidenced a \nstrong commitment to the principle of stare decisis. Judge Alito \nacknowledged the importance of this principle to reliance, stability, \nand settled expectations in the law.\n  At his hearing, Judge Alito, referring to the landmark Roe v. Wade \ndecision, testified as follows: ``[I]t is a precedent that is \nprotected, entitled to respect under the doctrine of stare decisis. . . \n.''\n  Similarly, Chief Justice Roberts, who was confirmed with a strong \nbipartisan support, made a nearly identical statement at his hearing. \nHe said that Roe is ``a precedent of the court, entitled to respect \nunder the principles of stare decisis.''\n  After a careful comparison of these statements and others, I find \nthat on substance, there is little that distinguishes the two nominees' \nstatements on this issue. Both nominees clearly acknowledged the \nimportance of precedent, the value of stare decisis, and the factors \ninvolved in analyzing whether a prior holding should be revisited. Both \nagreed that the Constitution protects the right to privacy, and that \nthe analysis of future cases involving reproductive rights begins not \nwith Roe but with the Casey decision, which reaffirmed Roe's central \nholding. And both testified that when a case has been reaffirmed \nmultiple times, as Roe has, this increases its precedential value.\n  Despite the strong testimony of both Chief Justice Roberts and Judge \nAlito, the reality is that no one can know for certain how a Justice \nwill rule in the future. History has shown us that many predictions \nabout how other Justices would decide cases have proven wrong.\n  At her hearing in 1981, Justice O'Connor vigorously defended her \nbelief that abortion was wrong and stated that she found it \n``offensive'' and ``repugnant.'' Justice Souter once filed a brief as a \nState attorney general opposing the use of public funds to finance what \nwas referred to in the brief as the ``killing of unborn children.'' \nJustice Kennedy once denounced the Roe decision as the ``Dred Scott of \nour time.''\n  Yet, in 1992, all three of these Justices joined together to write \nthe joint opinion in Casey reaffirming Roe based on the ``precedential \nforce'' of its central holding.\n  Based on my review of his past decisions, I doubt that I will agree \nwith every decision Judge Alito reaches on the Court, just as I do not \nagree with all of his previous decisions. I anticipate, however, that \nhis legal analysis will be sound, and that his decisionmaking will be \nlimited by the principle of stare decisis and the particulars of the \ncase before him.\n  Judge Alito has demonstrated his fitness for this appointment with \nhis clear dedication to the rule of law. After an exhaustive review \nprocess, the ABA has given him its highest possible rating. His \ncolleagues on the Third Circuit, both Republican and Democrat \nappointees alike, have been unqualified in their praise of his \nnomination.\n  Based on the record before me, I believe that Judge Alito will be a \nJustice who will exercise his judicial duties guided not by personal \nviews, but based on what the facts, the law, and the Constitution \ncommand.\n  For these reasons, I will vote to confirm Judge Alito. I hope and \nexpect that he will prove his critics wrong and that his record on the \nSupreme Court will show the same deference to precedent, respect for \nthe limited role of a judge, and freedom from ideologically driven \ndecisionmaking that he has demonstrated during his tenure on the Third \nCircuit.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I explained last Wednesday that I would \nsupport the nomination of Judge Alito. Since then, I have been somewhat \nfrustrated at how this Senate debate has progressed. Time and time \nagain, some Senators have mischaracterized the cases and record of \nJudge Alito. I would like to take a few minutes and walk through just a \nfew of those misstatements.\n  First, let me address the case of Sheridan v. DuPont.\n  On January 26, the junior Senator from Colorado indicated that Judge \nAlito was unlikely to support principles of diversity because he ruled \nagainst a female plaintiff in a gender discrimination case. The Senator \nsaid, ``In Sheridan, Judge Alito registered the lone dissent among \nthirteen judges voting to prevent a woman who had presented evidence of \nemployment gender discrimination from going to trial.'' The Senator's \nsummary of the case requires additional elaboration, though.\n  According to the record of that case, the plaintiff, Barbara \nSheridan, was employed as head captain of the Green Room restaurant in \nthe Hotel DuPont. Initially, she received good performance reviews, but \nDuPont claimed that her performance began to deteriorate in 1991. At \nthat point, her manager met with her to ask her to stop using the \nrestaurant bar for smoking and grooming. Apparently Sheridan was \nfrequently late to work, and other employees had complained about food \nand drinks she gave away. In February 1991, the hotel decided to \nreassign Sheridan to a nonsupervisory position that did not involve the \nhandling of cash. She would not suffer any reduction in pay because of \nthis job transfer. Rather than accept reassignment, Sheridan resigned \nin April 1992 and sued for gender discrimination.\n  When the case came before him on appeal, Judge Alito joined a \nunanimous three-judge panel that ruled for Ms. Sheridan. He held that \nher case should go to trial because it was plausible that a jury could \nagree with her. Judge Alito explained, ``a rational trier of fact could \nhave found that duPont's proffered reasons for the constructive \ntermination were pretextual.''\n  Later, however, the case was heard by the full Third Circuit. At that \ntime, Judge Alito expressed doubt about the applicable Third Circuit \nprecedent. Hesitant about the court's broad rule that affected all \ncases with varying factual situations, he explained that when the \nemployee makes out a case like this, she should usually, but not \nalways, be accorded a trial. He reached this conclusion after parsing \nthe Supreme Court's 1993 decision in St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks. \nAnd most importantly for present purposes, the Supreme Court later \nagreed with Judge Alito's view in a unanimous opinion authored by \nJustice O'Connor. That case, Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, can \nbe found at 533 U.S. 133, and was decided by the Supreme Court in 2000.\n  The job of an appellate court judge is to faithfully interpret the \nConstitution and the Supreme Court's interpretations of statutes. The \nhistory of this case demonstrates that Judge Alito got it right when he \nexamined pleading standards in title VII cases.\n  Let's move on to another case, the 1996 case of U.S. v. Rybar, in \nwhich Judge Alito dissented.\n  On January 25, the Senior Senator from Rhode Island said that Judge \nAlito ``advocated striking down Congress's ban on the transfer and \npossession of machine guns.'' He further said that Judge Alito had \nargued that he was ``not convinced by Congress' findings on the impact \nof machine guns on interstate commerce. He substituted his own policy \npreferences in a way that the Third Circuit majority found was, in \ntheir words, counter to the difference that the owes to its two \ncoordinate branches of government.''\n  I discussed this case with Judge Alito during his confirmation \nhearings. The description we have just heard does not tell the whole \nstory.\n  Judge Alito's dissent in that case had nothing to do with being \n``convinced'' by Congress's findings. Rather, Judge\n\n[[Page S304]]\n\nAlito based his dissent, in part, on the fact that Congress made no \nexplicit findings regarding the link between the intrastate activity \nregulated by these laws, the mere possession of a machine gun, and \ninterstate commerce. Note that this case was about possession, not \ntransfer or commercial activity.\n  Second, the dissent had nothing to do with Judge Alito's own policy \npreferences regarding the possession of machine guns. Rather, it was a \ncareful application of the then-recent decision in United States v. \nLopez, which reminded courts to take seriously the limits of Congress's \npowers under the commerce clause. In Lopez, the Supreme Court had held \nthat Congress's power to regulate commerce among the several States did \nnot include the power to regulate possession of a gun near a school \nwhere the gun never crossed State lines. It was for the Third Circuit \nto decide whether Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce \nincluded the power to regulate possession of a machine gun where the \nmachine gun never crossed State lines. In Judge Alito's view, the \nSupreme Court's decision ``require[d] [the court] to invalidate the \nstatutory provision at issue.'' He relied on and cited Lopez at least \n22 times in his 9-page dissenting opinion.\n  Again, this is the job of an appeals court judge: to interpret \nSupreme Court precedent and apply it to new cases.\n  I should also point out that Judge Alito's dissenting opinion \nprovided a virtual roadmap for how Congress could regulate the \npossession of guns in a way consistent with the Constitution and \nSupreme Court case law. This is hardly the behavior of someone bent on \nimposing a ``policy preference'' against regulating machine guns. \nAccording to Judge Alito, all Congress had to do was make findings as \nto the link between the possession of firearms and interstate commerce \nor add a requirement that the government prove that the firearm moved \nacross State lines.\n  Let me add one last word on the Rybar case. It is often said that \nJudge Alito always sides with the government. Well, this case was \ncalled ``United States versus Rybar,'' and Judge Alito was on the side \nof Mr. Rybar. Of course, he did not think of himself being on anyone's \nside. He was just doing as he believed the Constitution and Supreme \nCourt required. And he would have felt the same way if the law required \nthe opposite conclusion.\n  Let us now move on to another case, that of Riley v. Taylor.\n  Speaking at the executive business meeting for the nomination of \nJudge Alito, the senior Senator from Illinois left a misimpression of \nthe facts of this case, so I would like to clear up any confusion.\n  In that case, Judge Alito found there was insufficient evidence to \nsupport a criminal defendant's claim that the prosecutor had violated \nhis constitutional rights by striking three minorities from the jury \npool. The Senator said that the prosecutor had ``in three previous \nmurder cases, used every challenge they had to make certain that only \nwhite jurors would stand in judgment of black defendants.'' That is not \naccurate. While it is true that the criminal defendant relied heavily \non the anemic evidence that in three previous trials no African \nAmericans ended up on the jury, it is also the case that the prosecutor \nhad struck both Blacks and Whites from those juries. Indeed, Judge \nAlito pointed out in his decision that, of the excluded jurors in the \nprevious trials, only 24 percent were African Americans. He suggested \nthat this might not even be disproportionately high in a county where \nthe most recent census indicated that 18 percent of the population was \nBlack.\n  Most importantly, Judge Alito's opinion rejected the selective use of \nstatistics based upon the sample size of three trials. In so ruling, \nJudge Alito was in agreement with multiple State and Federal judges who \nhad heard the case before him. On the full Third Circuit, four other \njudges, half of them Democratic appointees, joined in his opinion on \nthis point. Not a single judge thought the statistical argument settled \nthe case.\n  As a postscript, when Riley was given a new trial by the Third \nCircuit, he was again convicted of all charges. When he again appealed, \nthe Delaware Supreme Court found that his petition was ``wholly without \nmerit.''\n  Let me turn to another case, one also discussed by the senior Senator \nfrom Illinois, but during his January 25 floor speech, that of Pirolli \nv. World Flavors.\n  The Senator from Illinois stated: ``Another case involved an \nindividual who was the subject of harassment in the work place. This \nperson had been assaulted by fellow employees. He was a mentally \nretarded individual.'' The Senator continued, ``His case was dismissed \nby a trial court, and it came before Judge Alito to decide whether or \nnot to give him a chance to take his case to a jury. And Judge Alito \nsaid no. The man should not have a day in court.''\n  Several corrections are needed here.\n  First, the plaintiff in this case did have his day in court; he just \ndid not reach a jury. During the course of the proceedings, the \nplaintiff presented his argument to not one, but four judges--one \ndistrict court judge and three appellate court judges. The rules of the \nThird Circuit require that a plaintiff present his case in a minimally \nadequate fashion in order to be considered. The plaintiff must, at a \nminimum, state what happened to him and provide the basis for his \nclaim. But the plaintiff in this case, a man who had a lawyer, never \ndid that. The Third Circuit judges in this case were not provided with \nenough facts to make an adequate and informed decision. Judge Alito \nemphasized, ``I would overlook many technical violations of the Federal \nRules of Appellate Procedure and our local rules, but I do not think it \nis too much to insist that Pirolli's brief at least state the ground on \nwhich reversal is sought.''\n  Second, with regard to the plaintiff's sexual harassment claim, Judge \nAlito refused to accept the arguably demeaning stereotype which the \nplaintiff's lawyer advanced, which was ``that retarded persons are any \nmore (or less) sensitive to harassment than anyone else.'' Judge Alito \nrequired evidence on which to base his ruling and refused to rely on \nthe proposed stereotype.\n  Let's move on to another case, that of Doe v. Groody.\n  This case was mentioned by several Senators but in particular by the \nJunior Senator from Massachusetts on January 25. The Senator said that \nJudge Alito did not support individual rights because he dissented in \nDoe v. Groody. He said, ``Judge Alito's hostility to individual rights \nisn't limited to civil rights. He consistently excuses government \nintrusions into personal privacy, regardless of how egregious or \nexcessive they are. In Doe v. Groody,'' the Senator from Massachusetts \nargued, ``dissented from an opinion written by then-Judge Michael \nChertoff because he believed that the strip search of a ten year-old \nwas reasonable.''\n  First, let's get the legal question straight. The issue in Doe v. \nGroody was whether police officers should be able to be personally sued \nfor money damages when they misunderstand the scope of the search \nwarrant they were given.\n  Second, let's look at what happened during the event in question. On \nMarch 6, 1998, as a result of a long-term investigation of a John Doe \nfor suspected narcotics dealing, officers of the Schuylkill County Drug \nTask Force sought a search warrant for Doe and his residence. The typed \naffidavit in support of the warrant stated, among other things, that a \nreliable confidential informant had purchased methamphetamine on \nseveral occasions from John Doe at his residence. The affidavit sought \npermission to ``search all occupants of the residence and their \nbelongings.''\n  However, the printed sheet entitled ``Search Warrant and Affidavit'' \ncontained an entry naming only John Doe under the question, ``specific \ndescription of premises and/or persons to be searched.'' When the \nofficers entered the house to commence the search, they decided to \nsearch Jane Doe and her daughter, Mary, age 10, for contraband. A \nfemale officer removed both Jane and Mary Doe to an upstairs bathroom \nwhere she searched them for drugs. No contraband was found. Once the \nsearch was completed, both mother and daughter returned to the ground \nfloor to await the end of the search.\n  As a matter of policy, the sad reality is that drug dealers often \nhide weapons and drugs on children in the home. Judge Alito \nacknowledged in his opinion that he found the fact that the\n\n[[Page S305]]\n\nsearch occurred to be unfortunate. Accordingly, police officers \nsometimes request warrants that allow them to search all persons found \nduring a drug bust.\n  The Does sued the police officers personally for money damages. The \nissue was how to read the warrant in light of the affidavit. And the \nlegal question question was whether a reasonable officer could have \nbelieved that the search warrant allowed the officers to search \neveryone in the house. Two judges on the panel said no, while Judge \nAlito said yes.\n  Why did Judge Alito believe that the police officers should not be \nliable personally? He concluded that a reasonable police officer could \nthink that the warrant should be read in conjunction with the attached \naffidavit. Judge Alito reasoned that a ``commonsense and realistic'' \nreading of the warrant authorized a search of all occupants of the \npremises. Judge Alito found that the officers in this case ``did not \nexhibit incompetence or a willingness to flout the law. Instead, they \nreasonably concluded that the magistrate had authorized a search of all \noccupants of the premises.''\n\n  So, on the law, Judge Alito did not, as he has been accused \nrepeatedly over the past few days, authorize the strip-search of a 10-\nyear-old girl. He just tried to sort out a practical, on-the-ground \nproblem for law enforcement. It is sad but predictable that this case, \nwith its inflammatory facts, would come up repeatedly, but repetition \nis not going to change the record of what happened.\n  Mr. President, let's move on.\n  I want to address a claim by the junior Senator from Illinois in a \nJanuary 26 speech that, whenever Judge Alito has discretion, he will \nrule against an employee or a criminal defendant. To quote, the Senator \nsaid, ``If there's a case involving an employer and employee and the \nSupreme Court has not given clear direction, Judge Alito will rule in \nfavor of the employer. If there's a claim between prosecutors and \ndefendants if the Supreme Court has not provided a clear role of \ndecision, then he'll rule in favor of the state.''\n  This just is not the case. There are 4,800 cases that could be \nreviewed to demonstrate the inaccuracy of that claim, but let's just \nlook at a few.\n  In Zubi v. AT, an employee claimed that AT had fired him based on \nhis race, but the record was far from clear. Judge Alito clearly had \nroom to rule against the employee. After all, the other two judges \ndeciding the case on appeal did so and threw out the employee's claim. \nThey held that the employee had waited too long to bring his claim. In \ncontrast, Judge Alito issued a lone dissent arguing that the employee \nwas entitled to bring his discrimination claim. Later, the Supreme \nCourt unanimously vindicated Judge Alito's view.\n  As another example to counter the Senator from Illinois's claim, \nconsider the case of United States v. Igbonwa. There, a criminal \ndefendant argued that the prosecutor had failed to honor his plea \nagreement. The majority of the court voted against the defendant and in \nfavor of the prosecutor. Clearly, Judge Alito had legal grounds to do \nthe same. Instead, Judge Alito issued a lone dissent arguing that the \nprosecutor was required to fulfill this promise to the defendant.\n  In yet another example, in Crews v. Horn, Judge Alito ruled that a \nprisoner was entitled to more time to bring his habeas petition. Again, \nthe Supreme Court and Third Circuit had never decided the question, and \nthe statute was unclear. Judge Alito could have ruled either way, yet \nhe ruled in favor of the prisoner's claim.\n  This is a good time to remind the Senate what Third Circuit Judge \nEdward Becker, who served with Judge Alito for 15 years, had to say on \nthis point. He testified, ``The Sam Alito that I have sat with for 15 \nyears is not an ideologue. He's not a movement person. He's a real \njudge deciding each case on the facts and the law, not on his personal \nviews, whatever they may be. He scrupulously adheres to precedent. I \nhave never seen him exhibit a bias against any class of litigation or \nlitigants.'' As Judge Becker summarized Judge Alito's career, ``His \ncredo has always been fairness.''\n  Mr. President, I want to turn to some of the mischaracterizations of \nJudge Alito's past record as a government official.\n  In her January 25 speech, the junior Senator from New York said that \nJudge Alito had written that ``in his estimation it is not the role of \nthe federal government to protect the health, safety, and welfare of \nthe American people.''\n  As best I can tell, the Senator is referring to a 1986 document \naddressing the Truth in Mileage Act, a bill to require States to change \ntheir automobile registration forms to include the mileage of the car \nevery time it was sold. That document did not, as the Senator said, \noffer Alito's ``estimation'' on anything. Judge Alito was drafting a \nveto message for President Reagan. Accordingly, he drafted that message \nin President Reagan's voice and restated President Reagan's policy on \nfederalism. The first-person pronoun in that message is President \nReagan, not Alito.\n  It is also worth nothing that Judge Alito did not challenge \nCongress's powers. His cover memo acknowledged that ``Congress may have \nthe authority to pass such legislation.'' He did point out that the \nlegislation was ``in large part unnecessary since only five states and \nthe District of Columbia do not already have'' title forms that meet \nthis requirement.\n  Let's move to another statement from the Senator from New York. She \nstated that Judge Alito's ``time on the bench shows an unapologetic \neffort to undermine the right to privacy and a woman's right to \nchoose.''\n  In fact, Judge Alito's record confirms that he is not an ideologue on \na crusade to curtail Roe v. Wade. In his 15 years on the bench, he has \nconfronted seven restrictions on abortion, and he struck down all but \none. Judge Alito has upheld a woman's right to choose even when he had \nthe discretion to limit abortion rights.\n  For example, in the 1995 case of Elizabeth Blackwell Health Center \nfor Women v. Knoll, Judge Alito struck down two abortion restrictions \nby the State of Pennsylvania. The first provided that a woman who \nbecame pregnant due to rape or incest could not obtain Medicaid funding \nfor her abortion unless she reported the crime to the police. The \nsecond provided that if a woman needed an abortion to save her life, \nshe had to obtain a second opinion from a doctor who had no financial \ninterest in the abortion. The question was whether these laws \nconflicted with a Federal regulation issued by the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services. There was no binding Supreme Court precedent on \npoint, and Judge Alito easily could have upheld the abortion \nrestrictions if he had such a preset agenda. But Judge Alito voted to \nstrike down both laws in favor of a woman's right to choose. This is \nnot the behavior of someone bent on chipping away at Roe v. Wade. This \nis the behavior of a jurist who understands the importance of \nprecedent.\n  The junior Senator from New Jersey came to the floor earlier today \nand criticized the work Judge Alito had done on behalf of the Reagan \nJustice Department on abortion cases. He suggested that those efforts \nshowed a bias against Roe v. Wade that would matter in the future. But \nthe record shows just the opposite, as discussed above. How else to \nexplain the Knoll case? Moreover, the Senator said that Judge Alito \nwould not describe Roe v. Wade as, quote, ``settled law.'' Judge Alito \naddressed this question repeatedly during the hearing. A judge cannot \ncall an area of law ``settled'' when it is likely that cases dealing \nwith that area will come before him. This demand to say that Roe is \nsettled is little more than a desire to prejudge all those cases, \nincluding cases pending before the Supreme Court today. Judge Alito \nsimply cannot do that without violating his judicial ethics and \ndepriving those litigants of their fair day in court.\n  I will move on.\n  Earlier today, the junior Senator from Michigan said that Judge Alito \nhad ``been criticized by his colleagues for trying to legislate from \nthe bench in order to reach the result that he desires.'' I am not \naware of a single example of any member of the Third Circuit, or of any \nother court in the Nation, claiming that Judge Alito had any tendency \ntoward quote, ``legislating from the bench.''\n  In fact, just the opposite is true. It is especially surprising to \nhear such a claim given the testimony of Judge Alito's colleagues on \nthe Third Circuit.\n\n[[Page S306]]\n\nWould seven current and former Third Circuit judges testify for Judge \nAlito if they believed he was a judicial activist or otherwise \nunqualified for the bench? Those listening now or reading the \nCongressional Record in future years should go to the Judiciary \nCommittee records on the Internet and read what those judges had to say \nwhen they testified on January 12. When I spoke last week, I entered in \nthe Record a series of excerpts from that testimony that the Senate \nRepublican Policy Committee, which I chair, had compiled. The complete \ntestimony is worth reviewing, too. Again, I am not aware of a single \ntime that any judge has accused Judge Alito of legislating from the \nbench.\n  As one last point, I must address this unitary executive issue. The \nsenior Senator from New Jersey and others have said that Judge Alito \nsomehow believes in making the executive more powerful than the \nlegislative and judicial branches. One wonders how many times this \nmisstatement has to be corrected. Judge Alito made clear during his \ntestimony that his past comments regarding the unitary executive theory \nonly--only, Mr. President--dealt with who has the power to control \nexecutive agencies. As he said repeatedly, insofar as this theory deals \nwith the scope of Presidential power, he does not--repeat, does not--\nsubscribe to it. What else can he say? He has made this extremely \nclear. He has said it repeatedly.\n  Mr. President, there have been other misstatements and mischaracter-\nizations of Judge Alito's record. I can only respond to so many. I will \nsimply encourage future students of this debate to look at the cases in \nquestion, and to carefully review the Committee record, before reaching \nconclusions based on floor debate.\n  I look forward to Samuel Alito serving on the Supreme Court for many \nyears to come.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the majority leader \nor his designee will be recognized for the final 15 minutes prior to \nthe vote on the motion to invoke cloture.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to invoke cloture on \nthe nomination of Judge Alito to the Supreme Court and to support him \non the final vote.\n  As the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I sat through every \nminute of the proceedings, reviewed in advance some 250 cases of Judge \nAlito's, his work in the Justice Department, his work as U.S. Attorney, \nas Assistant U.S. Attorney, his academic record, and I found him to be \neminently well qualified.\n  The objections which have been raised to the nomination turn on those \nwho think he should have been more specific on answering certain \nquestions. But to have been more specific, he would have had to in \neffect state how he would rule on cases to come before the Court, and \nthat is going too far. He went about as far as he could go.\n  With the critical question of women's right to choose, his testimony \nwas virtually identical to Chief Justice Roberts, and he affirmed the \nbasic principles of stare decisis, a Latin phrase which means ``let the \ndecision stand.''\n  He is not an originalist. He characterized the Constitution as a \nliving document, as Cardozo did, reflecting the values of our country, \nthe importance of the reliance on precedent, and articulated those \nviews. He also indicated that he had an open mind on the issue of a \nwoman's right to choose, notwithstanding what he had done in an \nadvocacy role for the Department of Justice, notwithstanding any views \nhe had expressed at an earlier date.\n  When it came to the critical question of Executive power, as to how \nhe would handle cases, he subscribed to Justice Jackson's concurrence \nin the steel seizure cases, which is the accepted model. And here \nagain, he went about as far as he could go in discussing the \nconsiderations and the factors which would guide his decisions.\n  When it came to Executive power, again he discussed the \nconsiderations which would guide him on his decisions but necessarily \nstopped short of how he would decide a specific case.\n  He disagreed with the Supreme Court of the United States, which has \ndeclared acts of Congress unconstitutional because of our method of \nreasoning, saying that our method of reasoning somehow was defective \ncompared to the Court's method of reasoning. Judge Alito rejected that.\n  Perhaps most importantly in evaluating the prospects as to how Judge \nAlito will rule, we have to bear in mind that history shows the rule to \nbe that there isn't a rule. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Justice \nAnthony Kennedy, Justice David Souter before coming to Court all \nexpressed their sharp disagreement with abortion rights; once they got \nto the Court they have upheld a woman's right to choose. Then there is \nthe classic case of President Truman's nominees on the big Youngstown \ncase on steel seizure, voting contrary to what the President, their \nnominator, had expected.\n  We heard enormously powerful testimony coming from seven circuit \njudges, some past, some senior, and some currently active who have \nworked with Judge Alito. There were precedents for other judges coming \nforward to testify on behalf of a nominee--but not quite in this \nnumber, not quite in this magnitude. The seven judges were uniform in \ntheir assessment that Judge Alito has no agenda and has an open mind. \nThese are jurists who know his work well, jurists who go with him after \noral arguments into a closed room--no clerks, no secretaries, no \nrecording--they see how he thinks and how he considers cases.\n  I think two judges were especially significant. The first was Judge \nEdward R. Becker, the winner of the Devitt Award as the outstanding \nFederal jurist a couple of years ago. Judge Becker has sat with Judge \nAlito on more than 1,000 cases. He is well known as a centrist and is a \nhighly respected judge. He testified that Judge Alito and he had \ndisagreed on a very small number of cases, about 25. The second was \nJudge Timothy Lewis, an African American who identifies himself as \nbeing very strongly pro-choice, very strong for civil rights. He was \nseated on the left-hand side of the panel--he made a reference to that \nreflecting his position on the philosophical spectrum--and testified \nvery strongly on Judge Alito's behalf, saying that if he did not have \nevery confidence in Judge Alito he would not have appeared as a witness \nin the proceeding.\n  The prepared statement which I filed in the record last week details \na great many cases where Judge Alito has decided in favor of the so-\ncalled little guy.\n  In the context of the hundreds of decisions that Judge Alito has \nwritten and the thousands of cases where he has sat, you could pick out \na few and put him with any position on the philosophical spectrum of \nthe court.\n  Candidly, it is a heavy responsibility to cast a vote on a Supreme \nCourt nominee, especially one who is taking the place of Justice \nO'Connor, a swing vote. But when we look at the traditional standard as \nto intellect, this man is an A plus. When we look at the traditional \nstandard of character, again he is an A plus. When you look at the \nstandard of experience and public service, he is an A plus. When you \nlook at his analytical style as a jurist, again he is an A plus.\n  Some have objected to nominees because, as some have put it, there is \nno guarantee. Guarantees are for used cars and washing machines, not \nfor Supreme Court nominees.\n  I believe Judge Alito is well qualified to receive an affirmative \nvote by the Senate and be confirmed as an Associate Justice of the \nSupreme Court.\n  I note the distinguished majority leader on the floor. The time left \nbefore the cloture vote--almost a full minute--I yield to Senator \nFrist.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will be using some leader time. For my \ncolleagues, the vote will be in about 10 minutes or so.\n  In a few moments the Senate will decide whether to invoke cloture to \nclose debate on the nomination of Sam Alito to be the 110th Associate \nJustice of the Supreme Court.\n\n[[Page S307]]\n\n  Before we vote, I want to take a minute to reflect just a bit on the \nprogress that we have made in this overall judicial confirmation \nprocess over the last 12 months.\n  In the Senate, I really wear three hats. One is the Senator from the \ngreat State of Tennessee; second, the Republican leader; and third, \nmajority leader. Wearing the third hat as majority leader, I have \nbecome a steward of our institution, steward in the sense of its rules \nand its precedents, its practices and the customs of this Senate.\n\n  My job is to bring Senators together, both sides of the aisle, to \ngovern. That is why we are here, to govern with meaningful solutions to \npeople's real problems, problems today, problems in the future, to \nidentify what those problems are and then to resolve them and to secure \nAmerica's future by honoring its past and by building on a record of \naccomplishment every day as we move forward.\n  Three years ago, when I assumed this position as majority leader, \nthere was probably no single greater challenge or obstacle than the \njudicial confirmation process. In a word, it was broken. The minority \nparty had decided to put partisanship first in the judicial \nconfirmation process by, at that time, orchestrating regular, almost \nroutine filibusters to block what we all know were highly qualified \nnominees from getting fair up-or-down votes. This partisan \nobstructionism began in 2001, it continued into 2002, in 2003, and then \n2004.\n  If we look back to the 108th Congress alone, the Senate voted 20 \ntimes to end debate on 10 different nominees. Each time, cloture \nfailed. We spent more time debating judicial nominations during those 2 \nyears than in any previous Congress. This partisan obstructionism was \nunprecedented. This routine use of the filibuster was wrong. Never in \n214 years had a minority denied a nominee with majority support that \nfair up-or-down vote. The minority had used the filibuster to seize \ncontrol of the appointments process. They used it unfairly to apply a \nnew political standard to judicial nominees and to deny a vote to any \nnominee who did not subscribe to a liberal, activist, ideological \nagenda.\n  To justify this unprecedented obstruction, Democratic leaders \nunfairly attacked the character of these nominees. They sought to paint \nthem as extremists and radicals and threats to our society and our \ninstitutions. But the American people saw through the attacks. They saw \nthem for what they were, purely partisan.\n  Finally, early this year the Republican leadership said: Enough is \nenough; enough obstruction, enough partisanship, enough disrespect to \nthese good, decent, and accomplished professionals. We put forward a \nvery simple, straightforward principle. A nominee with the support of a \nmajority of Senators deserves a fair up-or-down vote. And we led on \nthat principle. Because we did that, seven nominees who had been \npreviously filibustered, or blocked, obstructed in the last Congress--\nand we were told at the time would be blocked in this Congress--got \nfair up-or-down votes and were confirmed and now sit on our circuit \ncourts. A new Chief Justice of the United States, Chief Justice \nRoberts, now sits at the helm of the High Court.\n  If we had not led on principle, there would have been no Gang of 14. \nFilibusters would have become even more routine and led to more \nobstruction. However, the sword of the filibuster has been sheathed \nbecause we are placing principle before politics, results before \nrhetoric.\n  With the nomination of Sam Alito before the Senate, this Senate must \nagain choose principle or partisanship. Should we choose to lead on the \nprinciple that judicial nominees, whether nominated by a Republican or \na Democrat, deserve an up-or-down vote, or should we revert to the \npartisan obstructionism of the past? I believe a bipartisan group of \nSenators will choose today to put principle first.\n  Last week, the distinguished minority leader said there has been \nadequate time for people to debate. No one can complain in this matter \nthat there has not been sufficient time to talk about Judge Alito, pro \nor con. I could not agree more with my colleague and friend. It is time \nto end debate. It is time to move on. Since President Bush announced \nJudge Alito's nomination on October 31, Senators have had 91 days to \nreview his nomination, to review his records, his writings.\n  To put that in perspective, Chief Justice John Roberts' confirmation \ntook 72 days, even including an extra week's delay to pay respects to \nhis predecessor, Chief Justice Rehnquist. Justice O'Connor, who Judge \nAlito will replace, was confirmed in 76 days. President Clinton's two \nSupreme Court nominees, Justices Ginsburg and Breyer, got a fair up-or-\ndown vote in an average of 62 days. Judge Alito today is at 91 days.\n  During this 3-month period since Judge Alito was nominated, Members \nhave had an abundance of his written materials, documents, and opinions \nto review. They have had over 4,800 opinions from his tenure on the \nThird Circuit Court of Appeals spanning 27,000 pages; another 1,000 \npages of documents from Judge Alito's service at the Department of \nJustice; numerous speeches and news articles. The list goes on and on.\n  Members have had 30 hours of testimony from Judge Alito's judicial \ncommittee hearings; statements of 33 witnesses, including 7 who are \nJudge Alito's colleagues on the Third Circuit; Judge Alito's answer to \nover 650 questions, doubling the number of questions that either of \nPresident Clinton's Supreme Court nominees answered; and 4 days of \ndebate in the Senate.\n\n  Despite all this, some Members have launched a partisan campaign to \nfilibuster this nominee and have forced the Senate to file cloture \nwhich we will be voting on. Certainly, it is any Senator's right to \nforce this vote, but it sets an unwelcome precedent for the Senate.\n  As a reminder to my colleagues, the Senate did not have a cloture \nvote on any of the nine Justices currently sitting on the Supreme \nCourt. Judge Alito has majority support. A bipartisan majority of \nSenators stands ready to confirm him and have announced their support. \nJudge Alito deserves to be Justice Alito. He has the professional \nqualifications, the judge temperament and integrity our highest Court \ndeserves.\n  Whether Members agree with me, whether Members support him, we should \nnot prevent Judge Alito from getting a vote. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in voting for cloture. It is our constitutional obligation of \nadvise and consent, because it is fair and because it is the right \nthing to do.\n  Senators stand for election; judges should not. Absent some \nextraordinary evidence, we should not challenge a nominee's personal \ncharacter, credibility, or integrity. Continuing down this path could \ndeter qualified men and women from putting their names forward for \nnomination, from volunteering to serve their country as Federal judges. \nIt could threaten the quality Americans most desire in their judiciary: \nfairness and independence.\n  A vote today for cloture is a vote to support all we have done over \nthe past 3 years to repair what was broken. True, it is a vote to bring \nSam Alito's nomination to a fair up-or-down vote, but it is also a vote \nthat is so much more. It is a vote to demonstrate Members working \ntogether to end partisan obstructionism and to lead on that simple \nprinciple that every judicial nominee, with majority support, deserves \na fair up-or-down vote.\n  In closing, if I may borrow the words of my good friend Senator \nKennedy from 1998:\n\n       We owe it to Americans across the country to give these \n     nominees a vote. If our [colleagues] don't like them, vote \n     against them. But give them a vote.\n\n  I agree with Senator Kennedy's statement. I say to my colleagues, if \nyou do not like Judge Alito, vote against him. That is your right. But \nlet's give him a vote. That is our constitutional duty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will use leader time.\n  I want the record spread with the fact that Senator Ensign will miss \nthe vote today. The Senate is very fortunate. He was in a head-on \ncollision in Las Vegas going to the airport to return to Washington, \nDC. I spoke to him from the hospital. He is going to be fine. He has no \nhead injuries. The bags inflated, and I am sure saved him great bodily \npain. I talked to him. He was under some medication. He said he is sore \nbut he is going to be fine.\n\n[[Page S308]]\n\n  With all the travel we do, we all live on the edge of something \nhappening. I am so happy Senator Ensign is fine. He is a wonderful man. \nHe has great faith. He is a good friend of mine and to all of the \nSenate. I know all of our thoughts and prayers will be with him. I am \nconfident he is going to be fine.\n  As indicated, I spoke with him. I want Darlene, especially, to know \nour thoughts are with her and the children.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 4:30 \nhaving arrived, the Senate will proceed to a vote on the motion to \ninvoke cloture on Executive Calendar No. 490.\n  Under the previous order, the clerk will report the motion to invoke \ncloture.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the nomination \n     of Samuel A.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on \nExecutive Calendar No. 490, the nomination of Samuel A. Alito, Jr., of \nNew Jersey, to be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United \nStates, shall be brought to a close? The yeas and nays are mandatory \nunder the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Nevada (Mr. Ensign) and the Senator from Nebraska (Mr. \nHagel).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting, the Senator from Iowa \n(Mr. Harkin) would vote ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, yeas are 72, the nays are 25. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the \naffirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object, would my friend extend his unanimous consent request to \ninclude the following Democratic Members: Senator Boxer for 20 minutes, \nSenator Baucus for 20 minutes, Senator Dodd for 20 minutes, and Senator \nBiden for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I do add that to the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n\n\n                       State of the Union Address\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, today the Democratic leader, Harry Reid, \ngave what was billed as a ``prebuttal'' to the President's upcoming \nState of the Union Address.\n  I am, frankly, astounded that he would criticize a speech so harshly \nthat has not even been given yet.\n  I will let the President speak for himself when he addresses the \nNation tomorrow night, but this misleading partisan rhetoric put forth \non this floor by the Senator from Nevada cannot go unanswered, rhetoric \nwhich, unfortunately, further proves Democrats will say anything but do \nnothing.\n  Today, we heard many of the same tired cliches from the minority \nleader. He talks about a credibility gap. Well, the largest credibility \ngap in American politics is between what Democrats say and what they \ndo. Democrats promised months ago to bring forth their own legislative \nagenda, but the Nation is still waiting. Day after day, the Democrats \nlaunch attack after attack on Republicans and our agenda, but how are \nwe to take them seriously when they cannot articulate a clear plan of \ntheir own? They will say anything to get a media sound bite, but when \nit comes to solving today's challenges, Democrats do nothing.\n  It has been 4 years since 9/11, and after all their rock-throwing, \nDemocrats still have no plan for victory in the war on terror. In fact, \nthey have undermined the war effort with partisan attacks on the \nPresident.\n  They have complained about the economy since President Bush took \noffice, but almost everything they do makes it harder for American \nbusinesses to compete.\n  Democrats spent the last year criticizing Republican efforts to \nstrengthen Social Security but still offer nothing to fix this system \nin crisis. They even refuse to guarantee benefits for today's seniors \nand blocked a bill that would have stopped Congress from spending \nSocial Security dollars on other Government programs.\n  They have decried looming deficits but offer no map to a balanced \nbudget, instead calling for higher taxes and more spending programs.\n  How are we to take seriously a party that has no legislative agenda, \nthat has no solutions or ideas to solve America's greatest challenges?\n  In stark contrast to the Democrats' invisible agenda, Republicans \nhave clearly articulated and delivered a bold agenda to secure \nAmerica's future. And while we have had some victories in recent years, \nthe truth is that Democrats have fought bitterly to block progress for \nAmerica every step of the way. Then these same Democrats come to this \nfloor and blame inaction on Republicans.\n  To give just one example, Republicans have been working for decades \nto secure America's energy independence. However, Democrats, at the \nbehest of extreme environmental activists, oppose real solutions to \nhigh energy prices such as increasing production of domestic oil and \nnatural gas supplies and removing barriers to oil refinery investment \nsuch as onerous permitting requirements and a proliferation of boutique \nfuel blends.\n  Just last month, Democrats blocked energy exploration and production \non the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge which would \nprovide millions of barrels of oil a day, or about 4.5 percent of the \ncurrent U.S. consumption, with no significant environmental impact.\n  It is not just in Alaska where Democrats oppose efforts to access our \nNation's energy resources. It has been estimated that enough natural \ngas lies under the Outer Continental Shelf and in the interior Western \nStates to supply 27 years' worth of natural gas consumption, the \nprimary fuel used to heat Americans' homes. Yet Democrats support \npolicies that have closed these areas to exploration and production.\n  The administration has attempted to cut regulatory redtape, reduce \nregulatory costs, and streamline regulatory processes to allow more \nsensible use of the Nation's energy resources, while maintaining \nenvironmental standards--efforts that have been largely rebuffed by \nDemocrats in Congress.\n\n[[Page S309]]\n\n  The obstacle to America's energy independence is clear: it is the \nblockade formed by the Democratic Party. In seeking to appease far-left \ninterest groups, Democrats have blocked Republican efforts to reduce \nour dependence on foreign oil and have needlessly allowed energy prices \nto climb higher and higher for America's families.\n  Senator Reid likes to say Democrats can do better. I think he is \nright, Democrats should do better. They have been conducting a war of \nrhetoric for years without offering anything positive to the public \ndebate. Americans are rightly frustrated with a Democratic Party that \nwill say anything but do nothing.\n  Now let me address what has become the favorite sound bite of the \nDemocratic Party. Senator Reid said it today and many times over the \nlast week, what he likes to call the ``culture of corruption.'' \nApparently, Democrats believe this media strategy will carry them to a \nsweeping electoral victory in November. I have news for my Democratic \ncolleagues: The problem of outside influence on Congress is not a \npartisan issue. This is a bipartisan problem and requires a bipartisan \nsolution.\n  For those hoping to usher in a new Democratic majority in Congress on \na media sound bite, history teaches us that elections are won on ideas, \nnot rhetoric. Americans are far too smart and today's challenges are \nfar too serious for Democrats to expect they can coast to a victory in \nNovember with no solutions and no ideas.\n  Republicans learned this lesson long ago from one of our greatest \nteachers, Ronald Reagan. President Reagan always talked about ideas \nthat still resonate with Americans today: limited government, personal \nfreedom and responsibility, and peace through strength.\n  Republicans did not win on rhetoric in 1994. We won because Americans \nagreed with our solutions: lower taxes, fiscal responsibility, \ntraditional values, and strong national defense.\n  President Bush has connected with the American people because he has \nrun his campaigns on ideas. He promised to lower taxes, and he has. He \npromised to aggressively fight the war on terror to protect American \nfamilies, and he has. He promised to nominate judges who will follow \nthe law instead of creating it, and he has.\n  Yet, as Senator Reid demonstrated today, Democrats still do not \nunderstand that Americans want solutions, not more partisan rhetoric. I \nknow there are some Democrats who do have some good ideas and desire to \nwork together to improve the lives of Americans. I have talked to many \nof my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who do seem to \nunderstand the reality, but their leadership refuses to allow them to \nbreak from the party line.\n  I urge the Democratic Party to think long and hard about the war of \nrhetoric they are waging. It is poisoning the atmosphere in the Senate, \nand it is turning off Americans from the public debate. The \nconsequences of these actions will be fewer and fewer Democrats \nreturning next year. This has been proved out during the last \nelections, as I and my fellow freshman Republican Senators can testify.\n  If Democrats sincerely want the opportunity to govern again, they \nneed to abandon this ``say anything, do nothing'' stance and put \nforward some ideas and solutions. Regardless, the Republican Party will \nnot wait around. We will continue to secure America's future with a \nbold, positive agenda.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to amend the unanimous consent \nagreement to add an additional 10 minutes for Senator Baucus, which \nwill give him 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask the Senator to add to her request \nthat following the Democratic-allowed time that has already been agreed \nto, Senator Inhofe be recognized for up to an hour.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Certainly. I ask that at the conclusion of Senator \nBiden's remarks, Senator Inhofe be recognized for up to an hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I was listening to the Senator from South \nCarolina. I thought he was going to make some comments about the vote \nthat just took place on one of the most important issues facing the \nSenate. Instead, he launched into an attack on Senator Harry Reid.\n  Shakespeare once said something to this effect: When someone acts \nthat way, he is protesting too much. So Senator Reid must have hit a \nchord with the Senator from South Carolina, and there are reasons for \nit.\n  Senator Reid speaks straight from the heart, straight from the \nshoulder. He is fighting for the American people. He wants us to fix \nthe mess this President and this Congress made in the Medicare \nprescription drug benefit. He wants us to take care of our men and \nwomen in uniform. He wants to make sure the budgets are balanced. He \nwants to make sure that our families have health care, that we are \nmoving forward on homeland security, and cleaning up the culture of \ncorruption which has been brought to us by the ruling party. Remember, \nwe have one party that rules Washington.\n  So I think his remarks must have deeply touched the Senator from \nSouth Carolina for him to launch into such a personal attack on the \nDemocratic leader. I stand here and say: Keep it up, Senator Reid. You \nmust be doing something right to elicit that kind of outrageous \nresponse.\n  Mr. President, many of us have been in elected life for more than a \ndecade--in my case, three decades--and we know that when certain issues \ncome before us, they are so profound, they are so important to the \npeople we represent, they are such a watershed that they need to be \nmarked, not rushed.\n  The vote on Samuel Alito to be a Justice of the Supreme Court is such \na moment in our history. Yes, we are having two votes on this \nnomination, one just completed, which gave me and other opponents of \nthe nomination an opportunity to signal that this nomination should be \nsent back to the President for a mainstream nominee in the mold of \nSandra Day O'Connor.\n  We fell short of the 41 votes we needed to send this nomination back. \nBut yet I am still glad I had the opportunity to go on record twice. \nAnd do you know why? Because the Supreme Court belongs to the people of \nAmerica. It is their court. It is not George Bush's court. It is not \nany Senator's court. It is the people's court, and the highest court. \nIt is their freedoms that are at stake, their protection from a power-\nhungry Executive, their right to clean air, to clean water, and safe \ncommunities, their right to make private decisions with their families, \nnot with Senators and Congressmen and a President or Vice President \nbreathing down their necks.\n  So although we knew the votes were not there for the filibuster of \nJudge Alito, we felt it was appropriate to use that historic Senate \ndebate tool so the American people would know that we were willing to \npursue even a losing effort because the stakes are so high.\n  Tomorrow, we will cast our votes on the nomination itself, and I want \nthe record to reflect why I will be voting no.\n  Mr. President. Every judicial nomination is important, but rarely are \nthe stakes as high for the Nation as they are in the case of the \nnomination of Samuel Alito to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme \nCourt.\n  We now have a divided Court, a divided Congress, and a divided \nelectorate, as evidenced in the last two Presidential elections. \nUnfortunately, we also have a President who failed to remember his \npromise, which he made in the campaign of 2000: to govern from the \ncenter--to be ``a uniter, not a divider.'' If he had kept that promise, \nhe would not have nominated Samuel Alito.\n  Judge Alito was nominated to take the seat of Justice Sandra Day \nO'Connor, the first woman on the Court. She has long been the swing \nvote, and a commonsense voice of moderation, in some of the most \nimportant cases to come before the Court, including a woman's right to \nchoose, civil rights, and freedom of religion.\n  The right thing to do for the court and for the Nation would have \nbeen to nominate someone in the mold of Justice O'Connor, and that is \nwhat the President should have done.\n  Let me be clear: I do not deny Judge Alito's judicial qualifications. \nHe is experienced, intelligent, and capable. His\n\n[[Page S310]]\n\nfamily should be proud of him, and all Americans should be proud that \nthe American dream was there for him and for the Alito family.\n  But these facts do not outweigh my deep conviction that Judge Alito's \nextreme views of the law make him the wrong person for this job.\n  As a Senator, I have no more solemn duty than to vote on a nomination \nfor the Supreme Court of the United States. These are lifetime \nappointments, with extraordinary power to shape the law of the land, \nand to affect the lives of Americans, not just those living now, but \nfor generations to come.\n  In the 218 years since our Constitution was adopted, our Nation has \nmade great strides toward achieving the more perfect Union that the \nFounding Fathers dreamed of Women were given the right to vote. \nAfrican-Americans were given civil rights. A right to personal privacy \nhas been recognized for women and families. The accused have a right to \ncounsel. Congress has been recognized to have the power to enact laws \nprotecting the health and safety of the people. This has led to a \ncleaner environment, safer workplaces and communities, and better \nhealth care for all Americans.\n  We who have enjoyed the fruits of this progress owe it to future \ngenerations not to let it slip away. Thus, in a vote such as this, \nwhich will have long lasting effects, it is incumbent on us to consider \nwhat those effects might be.\n  If Judge Alito is confirmed, he will join the far right wing of the \nCourt now led by Justices Scalia and Thomas. Should their extreme views \nof the Constitution ultimately prevail--as they may well do in the very \nnear future--I fear they will take our Nation on a backward path--\ntoward a time of fewer rights for individuals and greater restrictions \non Congress's ability to protect the public health and welfare. In \naddition, I believe that Judge Alito will support Justice Thomas's \nradical ideas about stronger Presidential powers.\n  In short, our children could end up living in a very different \nAmerica from the one we treasure. What kind of Nation would that be?\n  Abortion undoubtedly would be illegal in many States. Dangerous \nautomatic weapons might become broadly available. It might be almost \nimpossible to get a claim of workplace discrimination to a jury. Search \nwarrants might not have to be issued, or if they were, wouldn't have to \nbe specific. The Nation's most important environmental laws might be \nmade toothless for lack of enforcement in the courts. Trial by jury, \none of the most precious of all rights guaranteed to Americans by their \nConstitution, could be tainted by racism in the selection of Jurors.\n  This is a harsh picture, but I believe it is not unrealistic. If you \nconsider where the Court is now and consider Judge Alito's record and \nviews carefully, you must conclude, as I did, that approving his \nnomination could have dire consequences for our Nation.\n  In reviewing Judge Alito's record, I asked myself whether, as a \nSupreme Court Justice, he would be likely to vote to preserve \nfundamental American liberties, values, and interests for all the \npeople.\n  Would Justice Alito vote to uphold Congress's constitutional \nauthority to pass laws to protect Americans' health, safety, and \nwelfare? The record says no. When his Third Circuit Court of Appeals \nvoted to uphold a ban on machine gun possession, Judge Alito voted to \nstrike it down because he said Congress lacked the power to enact such \na law. His colleagues on the court criticized him, saying his position \nran counter to ``a basic tenet of the constitutional separation of \npowers.''\n  Would Justice Alito vote to protect the right to privacy, especially \na woman's reproductive freedom? Judge Alito's record says no. We have \nall heard about Judge Alito's 1985 job application which he wrote that \nthe Constitution does not protect the right of a woman to choose. When \ngiven the chance to disavow that position during the hearings, he \nrefused to do so. He had the chance to say, as Judge Roberts did, that \nRoe v. Wade is settled law, and he refused.\n\n  When given the chance to explain his dissent in the Casey decision, \nin which he argued that the Pennsylvania spousal notification \nrequirement was not an undue burden on a woman seeking an abortion \nbecause it would affect only a small number of women, he refused to \nback away from his position. The Supreme Court, by a 5 to 4 vote, found \nthe provision to be unconstitutional, and Justice O'Connor, cowriting \nfor the Court, criticized the faulty analysis supported by Judge Alito, \nsaying that ``the analysis does not end with the one percent of women'' \naffected. ``it begins there.''\n  Judge Alito's ominous statements and narrow-minded reasoning clearly \nsignal a hostility to women's rights, and portend a move back toward \nthe dark days when abortion was illegal in many States, and many women \ndied as a result.\n  In the 21st century, it is astounding that a nominee for the Supreme \nCourt would not view Roe v. Wade as settled law. The fundamental \nprinciple of Roe--a woman's right to make reproductive choices for \nherself--has been reaffirmed many times since it was decided.\n  Would Justice Alito vote to protect Americans from illegal searches \nin violation of the fourth amendment? Judge Alito's record says no. In \na 2004 case, he found that a police strip search of a 10-year-old girl \nwas lawful, even though she was not named in the warrant. Judge Alito \nsaid that even if the warrant did not actually authorize the search of \nthe girl, ``a reasonable police officer could certainly have read the \nwarrant as doing so . . .''\n  This cavalier attitude toward one of our most basic constitutional \nguarantees--the fourth amendment right against unreasonable searches--\nis stunning. As Judge Alito's own court said regarding warrants, ``a \nparticular description is the touchstone of the fourth Amendment.'' \nAmericans have reason to fear a Supreme Court justice who does not \nunderstand this fundamental constitutional protection.\n  Would Justice Alito vote to let citizens stop companies from \npolluting their communities? The record says no. In a case involving \ntoxic discharges into a major river, Judge Alito voted to stop citizens \nfrom taking the polluting company to court, as they were authorized to \ndo under the Clean Water Act. Fortunately, in another case several \nyears later, the Supreme Court overturned Alito's narrow reading of the \nlaw.\n  Would Justice Alito vote to let working women and men have their day \nin court against employers who discriminate against them? Judge Alito's \nrecord says no. In a 1997 case, Judge Alito was the only judge to say \nthat a hotel employee claiming racial discrimination could not take her \ncase to a jury. His colleagues on the court said that if his standard \nfor getting to a jury were required of a plaintiff, it would \n``eviscerate'' title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which \nprohibits discrimination in the workplace.\n  In another case, a female employee sued for discrimination, alleging \nthat after she complained about incidents of sexual harassment, she was \ndemoted and marginalized to the point that she was forced to quit. By a \nvote of 10 to 1, the Third Circuit found for the plaintiff. Guess who \nwas the one? Only Judge Alito thought the employee should have to show \nthat discrimination was the main cause of the employer's action. Using \nhis standard would make it almost impossible for a woman claiming \ndiscrimination in the workplace to get to trial.\n  Would Justice Alito be an effective check on an overreaching \nexecutive branch? Judge Alito's record says no. As a Judiciary \nDepartment lawyer, Alito wrote a memorandum proposing that the \nPresident assert his own interpretations of statutes by issuing \n``signing statements'' when the laws are enacted. He said this would \ngive the Executive ``the last word'' on interpreting the laws.\n  The administration is now asserting vast powers, including spying on \nAmerican citizens without seeking warrants, in clear violation of the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act, violating international \ntreaties, and ignoring laws that ban torture.\n  We need Justices who will put a check on such overreaching by the \nExecutive, not rubberstamp it. Judge Alito's record and his answers at \nthe hearings raise very serious doubts about his commitment to being a \nstrong check on an ``imperial President.''\n  During the hearings, we all felt great compassion for Mrs. Alito when \nshe became emotional in reaction to the\n\n[[Page S311]]\n\ntough questions her husband faced in the Judiciary Committee.\n  Everyone in politics knows how hard it is for families when a loved \none is asked tough questions. It is part of a difficult process, and \nwhoever said politics is not for the faint of heart was right.\n  Emotions have run high during this process. That is understandable. \nBut I wish the press had focused more on the tears of those who will be \naffected if Judge Alito becomes Justice Alito and his extreme views \nprevail.\n  I worry about the tears of a worker who, having failed to get a \npromotion because of discrimination, is denied the opportunity to \npursue her claim in court.\n  I worry about the tears of a woman who is forced by law to tell her \nhusband that she wants to terminate her pregnancy and is afraid that he \nwill leave her or stop supporting her.\n  I worry about the tears of a young girl who is strip searched in her \nown home by police who have no valid warrant.\n  I worry about the tears of a mentally retarded man who has been \nbrutally assaulted in the workplace, when his claim of workplace \nharassment is dismissed by the court simply because his lawyer failed \nto file a well-written brief on his behalf.\n  These are real cases in which Judge Alito has spoken. Fortunately, \nhis views did not prevail in these cases. But if he sits on the Supreme \nCourt, he will have a much more powerful voice. His voice that will \nreplace one of moderation and balance, and he will join the voices of \nother Justices who share his severe views.\n  Perhaps the most important statement Judge Alito made during the \nentire hearing process was when he told the Judiciary Committee that he \nexpects to be the same kind of Justice on the Supreme Court as he has \nbeen a judge on the Circuit Court.\n  That is precisely the problem. As a judge, Samuel Alito seemed to \napproach his cases with an analytical coldness that reflected no \nconcern for the human consequences of his reasoning.\n  Listen to what he said about a case involving an African-American man \nconvicted of murder by an all white jury in a courtroom where the \nprosecutors had eliminated all African-American jurors in many previous \nmurder trials as well.\n  Judge Alito dismissed this evidence of racial bias and said that the \njury makeup was no more relevant than the fact that lefthanders have \nwon five of the last six Presidential elections. When asked about this \nanalogy during the hearings, he said it ``went to the issue of \nstatistics . . . (which) is a branch of mathematics, and there are ways \nto analyze statistics so that you draw sound conclusions from them. . . \n.''\n  That response would have been appropriate for a college math \nprofessor, but it is deeply troubling from a potential Supreme Court \nJustice.\n  As the great Jurist and Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, \nJr. wrote in 1881:\n\n       The life of the law has not been logic; it has been \n     experience . . . The law embodies the story of a nation's \n     development through many centuries, and it cannot be dealt \n     with as if it contained only the axioms and corollaries of a \n     book of mathematics.\n\n  What Holmes meant is that the law is a living thing, that those who \ninterpret it must do so with wisdom and humanity, and with an \nunderstanding of the consequences of their judgments for the lives of \nthe people they affect.\n  It is with deep regret that I conclude that Judge Alito' s judicial \nphilosophy lacks this wisdom, humanity, and moderation. He is simply \ntoo far out of the mainstream in his thinking. His opinions demonstrate \nneither the independence of mind nor the depth of heart that I believe \nwe need in our Supreme Court Justices, particularly at this crucial \ntime in our Nation's history.\n  That is why I must oppose this nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMontana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent the order for recognition of \nSenator Biden be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, on the corridor of the first floor of this \nCapitol building appear the words of Samuel Adams:\n\n       Freedom of thought and the right of private judgment in \n     matters of conscience direct their course to this happy \n     country.\n\n  America still stands as the world's beacon of individual rights and \nliberties. Of that I know we are very proud. In large part, it is \nbecause of our Supreme Court. Our Founding Fathers were very wise \nsetting up three separate branches of Government, including a very \nstrong, independent judiciary, something many countries have struggled \nto attain, and their failure to achieve greatness is largely because \nthey do not have a very strong, independent judiciary--and I mean \nindependent.\n  The Senate protects the independence of the Supreme Court. How? By \nseriously exercising its responsibility to advise and consent on the \nnominations to that honorable Court. It is in the Constitution. We all \ntake that duty seriously. We take it seriously by examining nominees. I \npersonally have three criteria I use to examine nominees. They are \nprofessional competence, personal integrity, and a view of important \nissues within the mainstream of contemporary judicial thought. Let me \nreview those three criteria.\n  First, professional competence. The Supreme Court must not be a \ntesting ground for the development of a jurist's basic values. Nor \nshould a Justice require further training. The stakes are simply too \nhigh. The nominee must be an established jurist already. Of that we \nmust be very clear.\n  A second criteria is personal integrity. Nominees to our Nation's \nhighest court must be of the highest caliber.\n  Third, the nominee should fall within the broad mainstream of \ncontemporary judicial thought. Justices must possess the requisite \njudicial philosophy to be entrusted with the Court's sweeping \nconstitutional powers. I believed that then-Judge and now Chief Justice \nRoberts met those tests. That is why I voted to support his \nconfirmation.\n  Measuring Judge Alito against these three criteria, I have decided he \ndoes not meet these three tests. I do not think he is the right choice \nfor my State of Montana or for our country.\n  This was not an easy decision. I grappled with it. I took my time. I \nhave reviewed this nomination very carefully. I reviewed Judge Alito's \nprior writings and case rulings. I reviewed his Judiciary Committee \ntestimony and I met with Judge Alito personally for over an hour.\n  Nominations to the Supreme Court rank among the Senate's most \nimportant decisions. Only the brightest, most objective minds should \nserve on the bench. But Judge Alito, in my judgment, stands outside the \nmainstream. I base my decision on what I think is right for my State \nand my country, and that is why I cannot support this nomination.\n  I reviewed the Judiciary Committee's hearings. The Judiciary \nCommittee held 5 days of hearings. The committee questioned Judge Alito \nfor 4 days. The committee heard from panels supporting and opposing his \nnomination. The Judiciary Committee members sought Judge Alito's views \non many matters, including States rights, antidiscrimination laws, \nimmigrant rights, due process, privacy, equal protection, ethical \nconsiderations, and broad judicial philosophy. Judge Alito responded \neloquently, but he provided little detail. Members of the Committee \nattempted to pin Judge Alito down on many of his views, but Judge Alito \ndid not offer detailed answers to their questions, at least not enough \ninformation to get a sense of who he was and where he was. Judge Alito \nappeared well prepared for these hearings--very well prepared, I might \nadd. He appeared to have been advised to say as little as possible.\n  On January 24, the Judiciary Committee voted to report Judge Alito's \nnomination on a party-line vote. Unfortunate, but that is how it turned \nout; again, I think in part because of the nature of the nominee's \nviews.\n  Let me take a few moments to examine Judge Alito's nomination in \ngreater detail against the criteria I have laid out. First, \nprofessional competence. Mr. Alito received an excellent education. He \nholds an undergraduate degree from Princeton and a law degree from Yale \nSchool of Law. Judge Alito also has extensive experience as a judge, \nserving 15 years as a\n\n[[Page S312]]\n\njudge on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. In fact, he has served \nmore years on the bench than many nominees to the Supreme Court.\n  Mr. Alito's work prior to his judicial appointment focused \nexclusively on representing only one client, the U.S. Government. Some \nhave raised questions about Judge Alito's experience protecting the \nrights of individuals rather than the Government. I conclude that Judge \nAlito is professionally competent to serve as a Supreme Court Justice.\n  Second, personal integrity. Several issues arise from Judge Alito's \npromise to avoid conflicts of interest as a judge. Some raised \nquestions about Judge Alito's sensitivity to the avoidance of conflicts \nof interest, and some raised questions about how steadfastly Judge \nAlito keeps his commitments to the Senate.\n  In 1990, Judge Alito told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he \nwould disqualify himself from any cases involving five matters with \nwhich he had personal connections. Those matters were the Vanguard \nCompanies, the brokerage firm of Smith Barney, the First Federal \nSavings & Loan of Rochester, New York, his sister's law firm, and \nmatters that he worked on or supervised at the United States Attorney's \nOffice in New Jersey. In the period of 1995 to 2002, however, Judge \nAlito heard cases related to these matters.\n  Judge Alito initially blamed the conflicts of interest on a computer \nglitch. In subsequent correspondence with Senators on the Judiciary \nCommittee, Judge Alito argued that his promise during his 1990 \nconfirmation hearings referred to only his ``initial service.'' He \nargued that as his service continued, he found unduly restrictive his \n1990 promise to recuse himself from cases involving entities in which \nhe had a financial interest. And he argued that the mutual funds in \nwhich he was invested were not at issue in the case that he heard.\n  In his responses to questions concerning Vanguard, Judge Alito \ntestified:\n\n       I think that once the facts are set out, I think that \n     everybody will realize that in this instance I not only \n     complied with the ethical rules that are binding on federal \n     judges--and they are very strict--but also that I did what \n     I've tried to do throughout my career as a judge, and that is \n     to go beyond the letter of the ethics rules and to avoid any \n     situation where there might be an ethical question raised.\n\n  But Judge Alito also admitted to Senator Kennedy that ``if I had to \ndo it all over again, I would have handled this case differently.''\n  Judiciary Committee members also asked about Judge Alito's membership \nin an organization called Concerned Alumni of Princeton. In his 1985 \njob application to the Reagan Justice Department, Judge Alito listed \nConcerned Alumni of Princeton as one of his extracurricular activities. \nConcerned Alumni of Princeton is an alumni group that took the extreme \nposition of arguing against letting women and minorities attend \nPrinceton. When questioned about Concerned Alumni of Princeton, Judge \nAlito claimed that he had no recollection of ever having been a member \nof the group.\n  Judge Alito testified:\n\n       I really have no specific recollection of that \n     organization. But since I put it down on that statement, then \n     I certainly must have been a member at that time. . . . I \n     have tried to think of what might have caused me to sign up \n     for membership, and if I did, it must have been around that \n     time. And the issue that had rankled me about Princeton for \n     some time was the issue of ROTC. I was in ROTC when I was at \n     Princeton and then until it was expelled from campus, and I \n     thought that was very wrong.\n\n  Judge Alito's response about Concerned Alumni of Princeton raises \nconcerns. In 1985, he apparently thought that his membership in this \ndiscriminatory organization was important enough to put on his page-\nand-a-half job application. His failure of memory now about that \ninconvenient position then raises questions about his credibility.\n  I am also disappointed that the White House has chosen not to release \nJudge Alito's tax returns for review by the Joint Committee on \nTaxation. On December 13 of last year, I introduced a bill that would \nrequire all Supreme Court nominees to submit 3 years of tax returns to \nthe nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation for review on a \nconfidential basis. The Joint Committee would report its findings on \nthe nominee's tax compliance to the Finance and Judiciary Committee.\n  I might add that all nominees who are referred to the Finance \nCommittee--from Cabinet Secretaries to Tax Court judges--have their tax \nreturns reviewed for compliance. The reviews are discreet and \nconfidential. We protect nominees' personal information. And I might \nsay that in several cases we found errors of facts, matters that had to \nbe attended to--and they were.\n  I understand the administration does a ``tax check'' for all Supreme \nCourt nominees. They say they already do one. But I believe it is \nimportant for Congress to do its own due diligence on a nominee's tax \nreturns. After all, this is a person who serves on the judiciary. That \nis a separate branch, not the executive, not the judicial. Both \nentities--namely both the Executive and the congressional--have a stake \nin making sure that the nominee's tax returns comply with the law.\n  I might also say, as I mentioned earlier, many so-called tax checks \nthe administration has taken on other nominees have been very \ninadequate, full of mistakes, and we have had to correct them.\n  The Finance Committee views proof of the nominee's tax compliance as \na testament to the nominee's integrity. What individuals do on their \ntax returns is a window on their ethical decision making. It is a good \ntest of integrity and character.\n  The American people expect their national leaders to comply \nfaithfully with the tax laws. A showing that leaders in the Federal \nGovernment faithfully comply with the tax laws sends an important \nmessage to people who might consider cheating on their taxes.\n  On January 19, President Bush appeared to agree. He told small \nbusiness leaders in Sterling, VA, that public officials' tax returns \nshould be public, because public officials have a ``high responsibility \nto uphold the integrity of the process.''\n  When I met with Judge Alito, I asked him to release his tax returns \nfor such a review. He initially agreed to do so. But the White House \nofficial present at the meeting immediately intervened to block the \nrelease saying that he cannot do so.\n  The President was right when he said in Virginia that the release of \npublic officials' tax returns contributes to the integrity of our whole \ntax system. And his White House was wrong to withhold that information \non Judge Alito. I will continue to press future nominees to allow this \nkind of neutral review of their tax, returns because I think it is the \nright thing to do.\n  Let me turn now to judicial philosophy.\n  I do not believe that a Senator should oppose a nominee just because \nthe nominee does not share that Senator's particular judicial \nphilosophy. But the Senate must determine whether a nominee is in the \nbroad mainstream of judicial thought. Is this a wise person, not an \nideologue of the far left or the far right. The Senate must determine \nwhether a nominee is committed to the protection of the basic \nConstitutional values of the American people.\n  What are those values?\n  One is the separation of powers of our Federal Government--including \nthe independence of the Supreme Court itself.\n  Another is freedom of speech. Another is freedom of religion. Another \nis equal opportunity. Another is personal autonomy--the right to be \nleft alone. And yet another is an understanding of the basic powers of \nthe Congress to pass important laws like those providing for protection \nof the environment.\n  These are not unimportant matters. They are hugely difficult--all of \nthese are.\n  The stakes are high. The Senate has a duty to ensure that the nominee \nwill defend America's mainstream Constitutional values.\n  Judge Alito's record calls into question his ability to act as a \ncheck on executive powers. Recently, many have noted with concern the \nNational Security Agency's surveillance of American citizens. At the \nJudiciary Committee's hearing, a number of questions focused on Judge \nAlito's interpretations of executive power, and the importance of the \ncourt's role as an effective check on overreaching presidential power \nand on government intrusion.\n\n[[Page S313]]\n\n  Judge Alito responded that ``no person is above the law.'' But he did \nnot provide assurances that he would act on the Court to balance \nexecutive authority. His prior statements and court rulings indicate \nthat he has an expansive view of the scope of executive power and a \nnarrow view of Congress's authority to legislate.\n  In a 1984 memorandum, Mr. Alito argued that the Attorney General \ndeserves blanket protection from lawsuits when acting in the name of \nnational security, even when those actions involve the illegal \nwiretapping of American citizens.\n  In a 2000 speech to the Federalist Society, Judge Alito said that \n``the theory of a unitary executive . . . best captures the meaning of \nthe Constitution's text and structure.'' Judge Alito said: ``The \nPresident has not just some executive powers, but the executive power--\nthe whole thing.'' Some have thus interpreted the theory of a unitary \nexecutive to support the proposition that the Constitution reserves all \nexecutive power exclusively for the President. The theory would thus \nprohibit other branches of Government from carrying out any power that \none could characterize as having executive characteristics. This view \nof executive power could limit Congress's ability, for example, to \ncreate independent agencies such as the SEC with oversight duties. And \nsome believe that this view could allow the President the ability to \nlegislate through signing statements.\n  When Senator Leahy pressed Judge Alito about his view of the unitary \nexecutive as well as his strategy of utilizing Presidential signing \nstatements to expand executive authority, Judge Alito responded that he \ndid not see a connection between these two principles.\n  In a 1986 memo, Mr. Alito argued that ``the President's understanding \nof the bill should be just as important as that of Congress.'' He \nargued that signing statements would allow the President to ``increase \nthe power of the Executive to shape the law.''\n  President Bush has employed this method of Presidential signing \nstatements to document his interpretation of congressional legislation, \nagain even though he is certainly not a member of Congress. He didn't \nwrite the law. How could he say what Congress intended to do? He has, \nin fact, issued 108 signing statements expanding his executive \ninterpretation of the laws passed by Congress.\n  Judge Alito's judicial rulings on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, \nas well as his 1985 job application to the Reagan Justice Department, \ndo not indicate an expansive view of civil rights and civil liberties. \nIn his 1985 job application, Judge Alito wrote that he developed a \n``deep interest in constitutional law, motivated in large part by \ndisagreement with the Warren Court.'' Many credit the Warren Court with \nexpanding civil rights and civil liberties.\n  Judge Alito has narrowly construed constitutional criminal procedure \nprotections, such as the fourth amendment restrictions on search and \nseizure. In the case of Doe v. Grody, for example, Judge Alito wrote a \ndissent. He argued that the strip search of a mother and her 10-year-\nold daughter without a proper search warrant did not violate their \nconstitutional rights.\n  That is his dissent, that is his view.\n  Judge Alito testified:\n\n       It was a rather technical issue about whether the affidavit \n     that was submitted by the police officers was properly \n     incorporated into the warrant for purposes of saying who \n     could be searched. And I thought that it was, and I thought \n     that it was quite clear that the magistrate had authorized a \n     search for people who were on the premises. That was the \n     point of disagreement.\n\n  Judge Alito also refused to agree that Congress cannot take away the \nSupreme Court's ability to protect Americans' First Amendment rights.\n  In contrast, both Chief Justice Roberts and former Chief Justice \nRehnquist have agreed to the position that Congress cannot take away \nthe Supreme Court's ability to protect Americans' first amendment \nrights. This is sometimes called ``court stripping.'' It is extremely \ncritical, extremely important. It is no academic matter. Basically it \nis that the Congress can say to the Supreme Court it does not have \njurisdiction to hear any cases with respect to, say, the first \namendment brought by an individual citizen; that is, Congress can take \naway the Court's authority to interpret the Constitution with respect \nto the first amendment. That is what that view held. I think it is an \noutrageous view. I don't understand how anybody can tentatively hold \nthat view.\n  Judge Alito defended his viewpoint, saying this is an academic debate \non which scholars are divided. I am astounded at that answer.\n  Judge Alito's rulings on civil rights cases appear to set a high bar \nfor proving unequal treatment. A review of his record indicates that \nplaintiffs rarely ever prevail. Senator Coburn defended Judge Alito's \nrecord by noting that Judge Alito ruled for the ``little guy'' in a \nlist of 13 cases. Judge Alito's record, however, includes almost 500 \npublished and unpublished opinions. Thirteen is not very many out of \n500.\n  Knight Ridder conducted a survey of Judge Alito's published opinions. \nThey concluded that:\n\n       although Judge Alito's opinions are rarely written with \n     obvious ideology, he's seldom sided with a criminal \n     defendant, a foreign national facing deportation, an employee \n     alleging discrimination or consumers suing big business.\n\n  I am also concerned by Judge Alito's responses to privacy questions \nat the Judiciary Committee hearings which conflict with his past \nstatements. In his 1985 job application, Mr. Alito wrote:\n\n       It has been an honor and a source of personal satisfaction \n     for me to serve in the office of the Solicitor General during \n     President Reagan's administration and to help to advance \n     legal positions in which I personally believe very strongly. \n     I am particularly proud of my contributions in recent cases \n     in which the government has argued in the Supreme Court that \n     . . . the Constitution does not protect a right to an \n     abortion.\n\n  In June 1985, Mr. Alito wrote a 17-page memo providing a strategy for \nusing the Government's brief in the case of Thornburgh v. American \nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists as an ``opportunity to \nadvance the goal of bringing the eventual overruling of Roe v. Wade, \nand in the meantime, of mitigating its effects.'' Judge Alito advocated \na strategy of creating a series of burdens on a woman's right to \nchoose. In the hearings, however, Judge Alito responded to Senator \nFeinstein that he ``did not advocate in the memo that an argument be \nmade that Roe be overruled.''\n  In his hearings, Judge Alito acknowledged that the Constitution \nprotects a right to privacy generally. He agreed with the premise in \nthe Griswold case, which protects the right to use contraceptives. It \nis unclear, however, how widely the right to privacy extends for Judge \nAlito.\n  When pressed, Judge Alito refused to acknowledge that the \nConstitution protects a woman's right to choose. Judge Alito explained \nthat he would approach privacy cases with an open mind.\n  On the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Alito also wrote a \ndissent in the case of Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania \nv. Casey. In that dissent, he argued that upholding Pennsylvania's \nrestrictive spousal notification requirement did not place an undue \nburden on women.\n  Yet Justice O'Connor, writing for the majority of the Supreme Court, \nwrote that the spousal notification requirement ``embodies a view of \nmarriage consonant with the common law status of married women, but \nrepugnant of our present understanding of marriage and of the nature of \nthe rights secured by the Constitution.''\n  When questioned specifically about the landmark case of Roe v. Wade, \nJudge Alito commented that he understands the principle of stare \ndecisis--that courts should honor precedents. But he also said that \nthis principle is not ``an inexorable command.''\n  Here again, Judge Alito's statements contrast with then-Judge \nRoberts' comments during his hearings. Judge Roberts said in his \nhearings that Roe v. Wade was settled law. When Senators asked Judge \nAlito about Judge Roberts' statements, Judge Alito responded that ``I \nthink it depends on what one means by the term `settled.' '' Judge \nAlito engaged in some discussion about what ``settled law'' means to \nhim. His interpretation of how settled the right to privacy is remains \nunclear.\n  Judge Alito answered questions about his judicial philosophy by \ntestifying that precedent is entitled to respect. But he would not \nprovide great detail about specific precedents such as Roe v. Wade. \nSenator Feinstein pushed\n\n[[Page S314]]\n\nJudge Alito to clarify the discrepancy between answering cases about \none- person one-vote, but not responding to questions about abortion \nand precedent. Judge Alito did not give a clear answer.\n  Judge Alito appears to support deference to the Framers' original \nintent. Judge Alito testified:\n\n       I think we should look to the text of the Constitution, as \n     we should look to the meaning that someone would have taken \n     from the text of the Constitution at the time of its \n     adoption.\n\n  That is called originalism.\n  Judge Alito's judicial philosophy of original intent raises concerns \nabout whether the Court could adapt to a changing society. And his \nphilosophy indicates that he may not take an active role in extending \nConstitutional protections to new situations in the 21st century.\n  I have some concern about one ruling that Judge Alito issued related \nto the environment. In 2001, in the case of W.R. Grace & Company v. \nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency, Judge Alito threw out \nthe Environmental Protection Agency order under the Safe Drinking Water \nAct for an ammonia-spill cleanup near Lansing, MI. Judge Alito \nconcluded that the government cleanup standard was ``arbitrary and \ncapricious.'' He explained that the reason for not upholding the order \nwas that the EPA lacked a rational basis for imposing the clean-up \nstandards on the company. This case raises sensitivities for me, \nbecause in my home state, W.R. Grace has acted with complete disregard \nof the health effects for Montanans in Libby, where illness from \ntremolite asbestos caused by W.R. Grace has hit the community hard.\n\n  In 1988, Judge Alito commented that Robert Bork ``was one of the most \noutstanding nominees of this century.'' When I asked Judge Alito about \nthat, he did not provide an adequate response. He ducked the question.\n  He did not respond adequately to many of my questions. He evaded my \nquestions, questions I asked in good faith, intended to elicit what \nkind of Justice he might be.\n  He was vague. He seemed not to want to talk to me. He seemed not to \nwant to have an honest discussion about what kind of person he is. That \nis why I find it very difficult to support this nominee.\n  I supported Judge Roberts for Chief Justice in large part because of \nJudge Roberts' hearing testimony and responses when he met with me \npersonally.\n  Judge Alito does not meet my standards for a Supreme Court Justice. \nJudge Alito has explained that he will be ``the same person that I was \non the Court of Appeals.'' Judge Alito's record demonstrates that he is \na very conservative judge who rules often in favor of expanding \nexecutive authority and of limiting civil rights and civil liberties. \nIf the Senate confirms Judge Alito to Justice O'Connor's seat, he could \nchange the balance of the Court, tipping it in a direction that could \nreverse or restrict important constitutional protections.\n  Based on all this information, I will vote against this nomination. I \nbelieve that Judge Alito is out of the mainstream. He is not the right \nchoice for our country.\n  On a corridor on the first floor of this Capitol building appear the \nwords of former Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis, who said:\n\n       The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious \n     encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without \n     understanding.\n\n  I shall thus vote against this nomination to carry out seriously my \nresponsibility as a Senator to Advise and Consent on nominations to \nthat honorable Court. I shall vote against this nomination because I \nbelieve the nominee is well-meaning, but without sufficient \nunderstanding of the importance of our cherished rights and liberties. \nAnd I shall vote against this nomination to help keep this great \ncountry the world's beacon of freedom.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nConnecticut is now recognized for up to 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to commend my colleague, Senator Max \nBaucus from Montana, before he leaves the Floor, for a very fine \nstatement. I appreciate his thoughts and comments.\n  I rise today to discuss my vote on the nomination of Judge Samuel \nAlito to the United States Supreme Court. First of all, I wish to \nbriefly comment on the cloture vote that occurred this afternoon. I \nvoted not to invoke cloture on the nomination. I want to explain why.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I went through minor surgery to have a \nknee replacement before the holidays and I have been home in \nConnecticut recuperating. I looked forward to coming back to \nparticipate in the debate on the Judge Alito nomination and I followed \nthe confirmation process closely from home. For this reason, I was \nsomewhat stunned to learn that Senator Frist filed a cloture motion on \nthe nomination a day after it was voted out of the Judiciary Committee.\n  I have been a member of this body for a quarter of a century and I \nhave voted to confirm the majority of the judicial nominations that \nhave come before this Senate. I, too, like my colleague from Montana, \nvoted with enthusiasm for the nomination of Chief Justice Roberts only \na few months ago. The majority leader's action was surprising to me. It \nis exceedingly rare that a cloture motion is filed on debate regarding \na Supreme Court nomination. In is my experience, cloture motions have \ngotten filed when the majority got frustrated with the minority for \ninsisting upon extending debate--beyond a reasonable period of time. In \nthis case, I feel strongly that there has not been a reasonable period \nof debate, let alone an extended debate.\n  But I am only one Member. Certainly, this institution cannot wait for \none Member. I was allocated only 5 minutes of time this afternoon to \ncomment on this nomination. However, my flight was canceled out of \nHartford, CT, and thus, I lost that small window of 5 minutes to be \nheard. I consider the matter of confirmation of a Supreme Court Justice \nwith great seriousness and solemnity. In my view, some of the most \nimportant votes that we make in the Senate are to fill vacancies in the \nJudicial Branch, second only to declarations of war. Constitutional \namendments are not far behind. Therefore, to be notified that I would \nhave only 5 minutes to comment on the nomination of a Supreme Court \nJustice who will serve for life, far beyond the tenure of the Chairman \nof the Federal Reserve Board, far beyond the tenure of a President of \nthe United States, far beyond the tenure of a Senator or Congressman, I \nfound rather disturbing.\n  We have always respected one another here, at least we try to, and to \nrecognize this is the Senate, different entirely from the body down the \nhall. We are a bicameral body for good reason. This is the place where \nwe spend a little more time evaluating issues that come before the \nSenate. To ask for a few more days to have discussion about the nominee \nthat has provoked serious controversy in the country, seems little to \nask.\n  Put aside the nominee for a second, put aside your decision to vote \nfor or against the nominee, we should respect one another's desire to \nbe heard on these matters. Tomorrow is the State of the Union, and \nthere will be a photo opportunity for the President. I am deeply \ndisturbed that this Senate may have made a decision to rush this \nnomination through, to invoke cloture, in order to provide a photo \nopportunity for a swearing-in ceremony prior to this President's State \nof the Union Message.\n  I note the presence of my good friend and colleague from Texas in the \nchair of the Presiding Officer. He serves on the Judiciary Committee. \nHe watched the gavel-to-gavel hearing proceedings. While I was at home \nrehabilitating this knee, I had a chance to watch my colleagues do \ntheir job. The circumstances around this nomination have been \ncomplicated. The nomination came up after Harriet Miers withdrew. We \nhad the Thanksgiving holiday and the recess coming up. In fact, the \nJudiciary Committee met when we were out of session. Obviously, the \ndesire was to move this along. I have no objection to that. That seems \nto be a reasonable request to have the committee meet when it did. \nCertainly, we all had an opportunity to watch those proceedings.\n  The majority leader stated earlier than we have consumed an excessive \namount of time on this nomination.\n\n[[Page S315]]\n\nThis statement is correct if we measure it by days on the calendar. If \nwe measure it by days we have actually been here during the last couple \nof months, it is incorrect. We have been out of session. There have \nbeen only a limited number of days in session and only a limited number \nof votes. Obviously, the number of days that have been consumed since \nthe nominee was presented to this Senate is more than usual due to the \ncircumstances surrounding the nomination and holiday session.\n  I cannot allow the moment to pass without expressing my concerns \nabout it and the rationale regarding why I voted against cloture. I \nwould have preferred not to have voted on a cloture motion at all. If \nthis were an extended debate, the majority leader might have been right \nto invoke cloture. I am troubled that now we are setting a new \nprecedent for invoking cloture within only a short time after a \nnomination comes out of the committee.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to explain my vote on this nomination. \nTomorrow, at 11 a.m., we are going to vote on the Alito nomination.\n  I would be remiss, obviously, if I did not thank the distinguished \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Specter, and the minority \nranking member, my good friend from Vermont, Senator Leahy, for the \nextraordinary service they have rendered to the Senate, along with \ntheir colleagues, during this nomination process.\n  Over the last several months, these members have managed three \nseparate nominations to the Supreme Court: Chief Justice Roberts, \nHarriet Miers, and now Samuel Alito. They are to be congratulated for \ntheir commitment to fair hearings and for the manner in which they \ndischarged their duties.\n  The Constitution, as we know, vests in this great body, the Senate, \nthe privilege and the solemn responsibility to advise and give consent \nto the President on Supreme Court nominations--a unique role in our \ngovernance. The Framers intended for the Senate to take an active role \nin the confirmation process. However, the Constitution does not \ndelineate the factors by which each Member of this body should \ndetermine the fitness of a judicial nominee to serve his or her \nlifetime appointment on the Federal bench. Thus, each Member of the \nSenate, each Senator, must determine for him or herself the acceptable \ncriteria in judging a Supreme Court nominee.\n  I have never opposed a nominee solely because he or she holds \ndifferent views than my own regarding the Constitution or the Court's \nrole in interpreting or applying it. I have supported seven of the last \nnine nominees to the Supreme Court, including the current President's \nnomination of John Roberts to be our country's Chief Justice. As I said \nearlier, I did it with enthusiasm, having witnessed and gone through \nthe process and watched the process of his confirmation hearing.\n  I, like many of my colleagues, have supported the overwhelming \nmajority of the current President's judicial nominees. Of the current \nPresident's 230 judicial nominees, only 5 have failed to be confirmed, \na rather remarkable record.\n  In the course of my Senate career, I have never imposed a litmus test \nwhile reviewing Supreme Court nominees. But, due to the nature of a \nlifetime appointment, I feel they are entitled to a higher level of \nscrutiny than other judicial nominees for the Federal bench.\n  I have three specific criteria that a Supreme Court must satisfy: \nFirst, I require that the nominee possess the technical and legal \nskills which we must demand of all Federal judges. Second, the nominee, \nin my view, must be of the highest character and credibility. And, \nfinally, I vigorously examine the nominee's record to see whether he or \nshe displays a commitment to equal justice for all under the law, in \norder to protect the individual rights and liberties guaranteed by the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  Now, I waited until after the committee vote had occurred last week, \nand then, in an interview with my local press in Connecticut, indicated \nhow I would vote on this nominee. I have always done that. I have \nalways reserved the first judgment to be made by the committee. It \nseems to me to respect the committee process is very important, and the \nviews of my colleagues are important to me. Whether I agree with them \nor not, I like to hear how they have arrived at their decisions.\n  So on Supreme Court nominees, I have never announced a view on a \nnominee until after the committee has completed its review. Hence, less \nthan a week after the committee voted, I find myself having to rush to \nthe floor to make a hurried statement on this nominee. I am denied the \nopportunity to debate back and forth with other members of the Senate.\n  I waited to make my decision because I felt that Judge Alito deserved \na hearing before the Judiciary Committee. I felt that each of us who \nare not on the committee should have an opportunity to review the \ntranscripts of that hearing and then engage, as nonmembers of the \ncommittee, in a discussion of the merits and demerits of this nominee. \nThat has been denied this Member because of the cloture motion filed by \nthe majority leader, provoking what I deeply regret that occurred only \na few hours ago, and that was actually to have to vote on a cloture \nmotion.\n  I did not like casting that vote. I did not want to vote for it, but \nI felt I deserved the opportunity to be heard. So I do not regret at \nall that I am a part of a very small minority that voted against \ncloture. I wish more Members had. But I wish the majority leader had \nnot filed that cloture motion, which provoked the exact scene we saw \nunfold here a few hours ago.\n  Now, there is little question in my mind as to Judge Alito's \nintellectual competence and legal experience, and all of that. If this \nwere the only criteria, I would be for him.\n  Judge Alito received his legal education from Yale University School \nof Law in my home State of Connecticut. He served as a Government \nattorney in a number of positions including: Assistant Solicitor \nGeneral, Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Office of Legal \nCounsel, and U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey under \nPresident Reagan. In 1990, Judge Alito was nominated by George H.W. \nBush to U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals. In the course of his 15 \nyears on the Federal bench, Judge Alito has heard more than 3,000 \ncases. Furthermore, the American Bar Association has twice unanimously \nawarded Judge Alito with their highest rating of ``well qualified.'' I \nhave great respect and admiration for his intellect, legal experience, \nand service to the American people as part of the Judicial Branch.\n  ``Next, I turn to character and creditability. The question is: Does \nJudge Alito possess the qualities of mind and temperament expected of a \nSupreme Court Justice? I do not question whether Judge Alito is \npersonally decent or if he has integrity. I was impressed by the \ndiverse group of former clerks and colleagues who testified before the \nJudiciary Committee who could not have given him higher praise.\n  Let me also say I know there were questions raised. I listened \ncarefully regarding these concern including those regarding the \nConcerned Alumni of Princeton and the recusal issues that were raised \nby a number of committee members on the Judiciary Committee. These \nquestions, while relevant, and certainly need to be explored, would not \nhave decided my vote on this nominee. I do not minimize it. But if my \ndecision were to be based solely on the recusal question or Judge \nAlito's membership in the Concerned Alumni of Princeton issue, I would \nbe here supporting this nomination.\n  Those are not the most important issues to this Member. But what is \nimportant are other issues that were raised during this nomination. \nIndeed, I am troubled that throughout Judge Alito's hearings, Judge \nAlito failed to provide clear and germane responses to legitimate \nquestions.\n  A few examples. For instance, when Senator Schumer, our colleague \nfrom New York, asked Judge Alito if he still believed his statement \nfrom the 1985 memo that said the ``Constitution does not protect the \nright to an abortion,'' rather than reply with a simple yes or no \nanswer, Judge Alito deflected the question and instead replied, ``The \nanswer to the question is that I would address the issue in accordance \nwith the judicial process as I understand it and as I have practiced \nit.''\n  When Senator Feinstein of California asked Judge Alito if Roe v. Wade \nwas the settled law of the land--not an unpredictable question, a fair \none, one you might ask about Brown v. Board of\n\n[[Page S316]]\n\nEducation, Griswold v. Connecticut, and there is a long list of cases \nthat are considered established law, settled law--when she asked the \nnominee whether Roe v. Wade--one in that litany of cases--is settled \nlaw, instead of answering it directly one way or the other, as Justice \nRoberts did, in very unequivocal terms--others might have said \nabsolutely not; that would have been a very straightforward answer--\nwhat did we hear? He said--this is reminiscent of some comments that \nwere heard earlier--``I think it depends on what one means by the term \n`well settled.' ''\n  When Senator Durbin of Illinois asked the same question, Judge Alito \noffered the convoluted response: ``It is--if settled means that it \ncan't be re-examined, then that's one thing. If settled means that it \nis a precedent then that is entitled to respect of stare decisis . . . \nthen it is a precedent that is protected, entitled to respect under the \ndoctrine of stare decisis in that way.''\n  Imagine giving that answer to Brown v. Board of Education. Imagine \ngiving that answer to the long list of cases we now have as settled \nlaw. Now, the answer is, as Justice Roberts said: ``It is settled \nlaw''. But what you have here with Judge Alito is this dance going on \nhere, instead of a direct yes or no. A no answer would have been a very \nhonest answer. In fact, I suspect that is what his answer is, but he \ndid not have the courage, in my view, to say that, which I would have \nrespected. I might have disagreed with it, but I would have respected \nit. That is troublesome to me.\n  Finally, I think we should vigorously examine the nominee to see \nwhether he or she is capable of and committed to upholding the \nConstitution of the United States and its promise of freedom and \nequality for all. Protecting the constitutional rights of all Americans \nis perhaps the most fundamental duty of a Supreme Court Justice. \nTherefore, I am deeply concerned in his 1985 memo Judge Alito explained \nthat his interest in constitutional law was ``motivated in large part \nby disagreement with Warren Court decisions, particularly in the areas \nof criminal procedure, the Establishment Clause, and reapportionment.''\n  That is a fairly sophisticated answer in 1985. Many of these \ndecisions, of course, compromise the cornerstone of the Supreme Court's \nmodern jurisprudence, in enforcing the fundamental democratic principle \nof one person, one vote, in preventing the violation of an individual's \nprivacy by the state--a matter that concerns everybody in this country; \nwe see a lot of it going on today--and in ensuring procedural fairness \nin criminal trials. To wholeheartedly reject this legacy is also to \nreject the continued pursuit of the constitutional ideals of liberty \nand equality, in my view.\n  Before the Judiciary Committee, Judge Alito defended himself by \nsaying he wrote the comments 20 years ago. Twenty years ago, he was \nwell into his thirties. This is not some 18-year-old who is writing \nthese thoughts. Of course, before becoming a judge, in that case, he \nwas merely outlining the development of his thinking about \nconstitutional law at the time and pledged to keep an ``open mind'' if \nconfirmed to the Supreme Court. Well, that is nice to know. I am glad \nto hear he is going to have an open mind.\n  The seven current and former members of the Third Circuit Court of \nAppeals stated Judge Alito is ``not an ideologue,'' ``has no agenda,'' \nand ``is attentive and respectful of all views and is keenly aware that \njudicial decisions are not academic exercises but have far-reaching \nconsequences on people's lives.'' I think those were certainly \nworthwhile comments to make, and certainly the comments of his fellow \npeers on the court I found to be compelling arguments on his behalf. \nHowever, I must say, having said all of that--I respect the fact they \nsaid it in our hearings--Judge Alito's long record as a Third Circuit \njudge, particularly in cases involving questions of individual rights, \nindicates a personal intent on stripping away many of these so-called \nWarren Court era achievements. In Reynolds v. Simms, for instance, \nJustice Warren wrote:\n\n       The right to vote freely for the candidate of one's choice \n     is of the essence of a democratic society, and any \n     restrictions on that right strike at the heart of \n     representative government. And the right of suffrage can be \n     denied by a debasement or dilution of the weight of a \n     citizen's vote just as effectively as by wholly prohibiting \n     the free exercise of the franchise.\n\n  Yet, in Jenkins v. Manning, Judge Alito was part of a decision to \ndismiss a suit brought by African-American voters who argued that the \ndistrict's voting system diluted the voting strength of minorities. In \nthat case, the dissenters argued that the decision failed to give \neffect to ``the broad sweep of the Voting Rights Act.''\n  Judge Alito's long record of opinions and dissents in these, and \nother divided cases lead me to believe that he has a legal philosophy \nwhich lies outside the mainstream. Several newspapers and scholars \nprovided support for this concern. One study conducted by University of \nChicago Professor Cass Sunstein, found that when there was a conflict \nbetween institutions and individual rights, Judge Alito's dissenting \nopinions supported the institutional interest over individual rights 84 \npercent of the time. Moreover, 91 percent of Alito's dissents take \npositions more conservative than his colleagues--including those \nappointed by Presidents Bush and Reagan.\n  Judge Alito has set an incredibly high standard for individuals to \nmeet when bringing a claim against the Government or a Corporation. He \nhas repeatedly dissented in cases where the majority has ruled in favor \nof an individual alleging racial or gender discrimination. In Bray v. \nMarriott Hotels, for example, a housekeeper manager alleged that she \nwas denied a promotion because she was black. While the Third Circuit \nCourt of Appeals ruled that the plaintiff had established the essential \nelements of a case of race discrimination and therefore was entitled to \ngo to trial by a jury, Judge Alito dissented. He argued for a \nheightened evidentiary burden in order to protect employers who, in the \nfuture, would have to choose between--and I quote--``competing \ncandidates of roughly equal qualifications and the candidate who is not \nhired or promoted claims discrimination.'' The majority again \ncriticized Alito's approach stating that ``Title VII would be \neviscerated if our analysis were to halt where the dissent suggests.''\n  I also fear that if confirmed, Judge Alito may pose a threat to the \nlaws that protected disabled citizens from discrimination. In Nathanson \nv. Medical College of Pennsylvania the majority held that the \nplaintiff, a victim disabled by a terrible car accident, should be \nallowed to present, to the jury, evidence that the college had failed \nto make reasonable accommodation for her disability. Alito dissented, \nand again the majority reacted strongly to Alito's analysis: ``few if \nany Rehabilitation Act cases would survive summary judgment if such an \nanalysis were applied to each handicapped individual's request for \naccommodations.''\n  But, I am especially troubled about Judge Alito's dissent in the \nThird Circuit Case of Chittester v. Department of Community and \nEconomic Development. That case involved an employee who was fired \nwhile taking sick leave and who sought to enforce his rights under the \nFamily and Medical Leave Act, which became law in 1993. I was the \noriginal author of this law which has enabled more than 50 million \nworkers to take leave for medical reasons or to care for a child or \nfamily member. A primary objective of the act is to ensure that both \nmale and female workers have access to leave, and that they were not \npunished or discriminated against because of their family \nresponsibilities. However, Judge Alito found that the law was not a \nvalid exercise of Congressional power to enforce the Equal Protection \nClause. He said:\n\n       Unlike the Equal Protection Clause, which the Family \n     Medical Leave Act is said to enforce, the Family Medical \n     Leave Act does much more than require nondiscriminatory sick \n     leave practices; it creates a substantive entitlement to sick \n     leave.\n\n  The decision reflects a proscriptively narrow conception of what \n``equal protection'' required. Real equality cannot be achieved, and \nthe very real effects of discrimination cannot be remedied, without \nmeaningful, substantive action. This is precisely why Congress enacted \nthe Family and Medical Leave Act. The Supreme Court recognized this in \nNevada Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs. In a 6-3 decision \nauthored by Chief Justice Rehnquist, the Court held that contrary to \nwhat Judge Alito said in Chittester, a worker can sue a State employer \nwho fired\n\n[[Page S317]]\n\nhim for taking family leave to care for his sick wife. This finding is \ncritical to ensure that workers and their families can continue to take \nleave without fearing for their job. This right might be jeopardized if \nJudge Alito is confirmed, as during the hearing Judge Alito continued \nto reject evidence of discrimination in personal sick leave even though \nthere is compelling evidence in the legislative history of this law.\n  In these cases, the very judges who talked about our nominee as being \nfair and not being an ideologue, in their majority opinions had very \ndifferent things to say about their colleague on some very critical \ncases on which this Appellate Court Judge reached different opinions, \nsuch as I have cited here, as well as in several others that came \nbefore that circuit.\n  I am also concerned about Judge Alito's ruling regarding the Family \nand Medical Leave Act, which I authored. The Family Medical Leave Act \nhas provided meaningful relief to millions of Americans. Judge Alito \nwould have made significant changes, if not eliminated the law \naltogether, a great setback, in my view. The Supreme Court strongly \noverruled his decision.\n  Finally, I am troubled that the rights of privacy which are so deeply \nvalued by Americans could be eroded by a Justice on the bench who does \nnot appreciate the importance of these issues.\n  I am alarmed by Judge Alito's unwillingness to explain his previous \nstatements on the unitary executive theory of Presidential power. In a \nNovember 2000 speech to the Federalist Society, Judge Alito expressed \nstrong support for the unitary executive theory calling it ``Gospel \naccording to the Office of Legal Counsel'' referring to the position he \nheld in the Reagan Justice Department. Proponents of this theory \nbelieve that the Constitution vests in the executive complete control \nover the administrative and regulatory branches. Judge Alito's failure \nto shed any light on his professed support for a powerful, unitary \nexecutive is troubling. In Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, Justice O'Connor \nacknowledged that the executive power must have reasonable limits, \nasserting that ``a state of war is not a blank check for the President \nwhen it comes to the rights of the Nation's citizens.'' Judge Alito \nrefused to comment on O'Connor's statement, and instead remarked that \n``no person is above the law, and that includes the President.'' Unlike \nChief Justice Roberts at his confirmation hearing, Judge Alito did not \nidentify an affirmative obligation of the courts to block an executive \naction if the Executive acts unconstitutionally. Judge Alito' s answer \nfails to adequately explain in any substantial way, his views on \nlimitations to executive power.\n  This failure is of particular significance given the current \npolitical landscape. President Bush and his lawyers adopted an \nexpansive interpretation in their view of executive power, particularly \nin relation to the War on Terror and the conflict in Iraq. In fact, \nPresident Bush has cited the ``unitary executive'' theory in several \nrecent instances to override congressional provisions he finds \nobjectionable. I am disturbed that the President has claimed, for \nhimself, the authority to overrule the will of the Congress in passing \nits antitorture legislation--legislation which received the \noverwhelming support of congressional Members. This undermines the \nseparation of powers and democratic principles. I am further troubled \nthat in the course of the Judiciary Committee hearing, Judge Alito did \nnot adequately distance himself from the current administration's \nbelief that this theory provides justification for the NSA to engage in \nthe warrantless wirewrapping of U.S. citizens in defiance of the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and for the detention of U.S. \ncitizens accused of being enemy combatants.\n  Defining permissible boundaries of Presidential power is among the \nmost pressing of today's constitutional questions, and will almost \ninevitably arrive before the Supreme Court in the years to come. It is \nfor this reason that Judge Alito' s inability to shed light on his past \ncomments and his current beliefs is so significant. These failures call \ninto question whether Judge Alito has sufficiently demonstrated that \nhis jurisprudential philosophy allows for the degree of respect for \ndemocratic checks and balances, and the protection of individual rights \nand freedoms that the Constitution--and the public--demands.\n  A Supreme Court Justice influences the most critical issues facing \nthis and future generations of Americans. I believe that the Court may \nnow be at a pivotal point in which the future direction of our law is \nat stake. Judge Alito, if confirmed, will take the seat of Justice \nSandra Day O'Connor on the Supreme Court. While all Supreme Court \nJustices have the same unique obligation--to serve as the ultimate \nguardians of the Constitution, the rule of law, and the rights and \nliberties of every individual citizen--Justice O'Connor has long \nprovided a voice of reason and open-mindedness as she has carried out \nthis weighty responsibility. With a moderate temperament and judicial \nindependence, Justice O'Connor has often supplied the deciding vote to \nprotect fundamental American rights and freedoms. We cannot \nunderestimate how much is at stake in filling this critical seat on the \nCourt.\n\n  When I spoke on this floor regarding the nomination of Chief Justice \nJohn Roberts, I stated that for those of us concerned about keeping \nAmerica strong, free and just, his confirmation was no easy matter. \nHowever, I ultimately concluded that although he was a conservative \nnominee, Judge Roberts was within the mainstream of judicial thinking--\nin his judicial philosophy, his respect for precedent and his belief \nthat the Constitution cannot be read as a document frozen in time. \nWhile his responses to questions in the Judiciary Committee may not \nhave been as open as I had hoped, I decided that there was sufficient \nevidence to believe that he would honor and protect the individual \nrights and freedoms enshrined in our Constitution as the majority of \nhis record showed him to be a persuasive advocate for his clients \nrather than a radical judge out of the mainstream of judicial thought.\n  I regret to say that, having reviewed his judicial record and his \nresponses to the committee, I cannot be convinced that Judge Alito \nfalls within the judicial mainstream. His evasiveness in the face of \nquestioning by the committee, his established record on the bench of \ntaking a restrictive view of individual rights, and his inability to \nexplain his past comments on executive power all lead me to harbor \nsignificant concern. Determining whether to confirm a nominee to the \nSupreme Court is never an easy decision. Whether a nominee is \nsufficiently within the mainstream of judicial thinking is often a \nquestion of degree. While Judge Alito is clearly intellectually \nqualified and legally experienced, I am not convinced that Judge \nAlito's judicial philosophy will allow for the faithfulness to the \nconstitutional rights and freedoms, and the protection of equality \nbefore the law we have come to expect from a Supreme Court Justice.\n  After a review of Judge Alito's extensive record, his decisions as a \njudge on the Third Circuit, and his testimony before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, I must oppose this nomination. I have concluded \nthat Judge Alito's judicial temperament is out of step with our \nfundamental constitutional values and that his confirmation would not \nbe in the best interests of the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. So, Mr. President, for the reasons I have stated, I will \noppose this nomination. I say this with regret because it will only be \nthe fourth occasion in 25 years I will have voted against a nominee for \nthe Supreme Court. I will do so tomorrow at 11 a.m.\n\n  I deeply regret that I didn't have the opportunity to engage in a \nfuller discussion. It is somewhat disturbing, that I was only allocated \n20 minutes. Because of the constraints on time, this is all this \nSenator can say about a lifetime appointment to a coequal branch of \nGovernment, a nominee that will have a huge impact on the course of \nAmerica in the 21st century.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for up \nto 1 hour.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I say to my good friend from Connecticut, \nI was surprised to find out he was not a member of the conservative \ncaucus. Now I know. But I would agree with him insofar as the \nsignificance of the confirmation vote that will take place\n\n[[Page S318]]\n\ntomorrow. There is nothing more solemn, nothing more significant that \nwe have to deal with than confirming judges, whether they are nominated \nby Democrats or by Republicans.\n  However, I respectfully disagree with the Senator from Connecticut. I \nlook forward to voting for the successful confirmation of Judge Alito. \nI have had a chance to talk about him. I believe he will be a strict \nconstructionist and will do a good job for the United States, \nspecifically for my 20 kids and grandkids.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/30/senate-section/article/S318-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S318-S323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NATIONAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Serving on \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee, as is the keeper of the chair, I \nhave been there for quite a number of years. I have taken the \nassignment of giving a grade as to what President Bush, prior to his \nState of the Union Message tomorrow night, has done in the way of \nnational security and national defense. I am proud to say that I am \nvery proud of the job he has done. In doing this, what I would like to \ndo is break it down into three segments.\n  First, I want to talk about the problems this President inherited \nwhen he became President in terms of our national security; second, the \nsolutions, the very impressive solutions so far to these problems; and \nthird, the challenges he has for the future, for the next 2 or 3 years. \nIn doing this, I know I will come across as being very partisan. Quite \nfrankly, when we are dealing with national defense, I am quite \npartisan. I think the most important thing we have to do here is to \nkeep America strong, make sure that we have a strong national defense \nsystem. I hate to say it, but that becomes a partisan issue. However, \nit is too serious of an issue to try to be diplomatic, so I will not \nattempt to be diplomatic tonight. I will be dealing with the truth.\n  Winston Churchill said: Truth is incontrovertible. Panic may resent \nit, ignorance may deride it, malice may destroy it, but there it is.\n  First, in dealing with the problems that he inherited, I would like \nto outline seven huge problems that this President inherited when he \nbecame President. The first is, when he was inaugurated he received a \nmilitary structure that was in total disarray. During the Clinton \nadministration in the 1990s, I will show you in terms of dollars what \nhappened to our system. There was a euphoric attitude everyone had that \nsomehow the Cold War was over and we did not need a military anymore.\n  This is what the Clinton administration did. If you take this line \nright here, this is kind of the baseline only increased by inflation. \nSo by doing this, we would say if that President had taken the \nbaseline, the appropriations that he came in with and just applied the \ninflationary rate, it would be that top line, the black line. However, \nhe didn't do it. Instead, with his budget, this yellow line is what he \nrequested.\n  Fortunately, we in Congress were able to get this up to what I see as \na green line here. So this is actually what happened right here. This \nis what was actually appropriated. This would have been a static \nsystem. This is what the President wanted.\n  What does that mean? It means that during the years he was President, \nhe decreased spending from the level where it was by $313 billion. If \nwe had not raised the amount that was in his budget, his budget called \nfor a decrease of $412 billion. We are talking about the difference \nbetween the black line and the red line. It means that the Clinton-Gore \nadministration cut the budget by 40 percent, reducing it to the lowest \npercentage of gross national product since before World War II.\n  The first 2 years of the Clinton administration, I was in the House \nof Representatives. I was on the House Armed Services Committee. I knew \nwhat he was going to be doing to our military. I started complaining \nabout this during the first 2 years of his administration. Then as I \nsaw it taking place, we were on the floor at least every week or two \ntalking about what this President was doing to our military.\n\n  When they say the Cold War is over, we don't need a military anymore, \nI look wistfully back to the days of the Cold War. During the Cold War, \nwe knew we had one superpower out there. It was the Soviet Union. We \nknew what they had. They were predictable. Their attitudes were \npredictable. They represented a great country, the U.S.S.R. We knew \npretty much where we were. We had a policy that was in place. It was a \nmilitary that stood up to an Eastern Bloc type of mentality. It was one \nthat was working quite well.\n  During the time of the 1990s, during the Clinton drawdown of the \nmilitary, one particular general comes to mind. I considered him to be \na hero because it took courage. It is hard to explain to real people, \nas I go back to Oklahoma, how much courage it takes for someone to \nstand up against his own President if he is in the military. These are \ncareer people. GEN John Jumper, who later became the Chief of the Air \nForce, stood up in 1998 or 1999 and said: This insane drawdown of our \nmilitary is something we cannot continue.\n  Not only were we drawing down to almost 60 percent, in terms of Army \ndivisions, of our tactical airwings, our ships were coming down from \n600 to 300, but also our modernization program.\n  So General Jumper, with all the credibility that he had--and there is \nno one in America more credible than he is--was able to say that we \nhave a very serious problem and we now are sending our kids out in \nstrike vehicles where the prospective enemy has better equipment than \nwe do.\n  People don't realize it. When I go back to Oklahoma, I say: Do you \nrealize some countries make better fighting equipment. For instance, \nfive countries make a better artillery piece than the very best one \nthat we have, which is the Paladin.\n  John Jumper said: Our best strike vehicles are the F-15 and F-16. The \nRussians are now making the SU-27, the SU-30s, and are proposing to \nmake the SU-35. Those vehicles are better than the best ones we have in \nterms of jammers and radar.\n  I could get more specific in how they were better, but they were \nbetter. I agreed with him at the time and said so and applauded him \nwhen he made the statement that we need to move on with the FA-22 so we \ncan get back and be competitive again.\n  People wonder why the liberals and, I say, the Democrats do not \nsupport a strong national defense. There are some reasons for this. One \nof the things we have in this country, which people don't stop and \nreally think through, is the convention system. It is kind of a \nmiracle. In a living room in Broken Arrow, OK, Republicans all meet and \nthey decide what we stand for. We stand for a strong national defense, \nwe are pro-life, all that stuff. At the same time, across the street \nyou have the Democrats meeting. They are talking about gay rights and \nabortion and all the things they stand for. They decide what delegates \ngo to the county convention. So the most activist of each side, \nliberals and conservatives, become the people who end up going to the \nconventions. Then they go to the district convention, the State \nconvention, and then the national convention.\n  The bottom line is, if any Republican wants to run for the Senate or \nfor the House or for a higher position, that person has to embrace the \nphilosophy, at least partially, that is adopted by his party in the \nnational convention of the Republican Party. It is a conservative \nagenda. For the Democratic Party, it is liberal agenda. That is a long \nway around the barn, but it kind of explains as to why these Members of \nthe Senate from the Democratic side are not strong in terms of a \nnational defense.\n  It is because if you really look at a liberal, they don't think you \nneed a military to start with. Liberals believe that if all countries \nwould stand in a circle and hold hands and unilaterally disarm, all \nthreats would go away. They don't say that, but that is what they \nreally think. So we have these people running for President on the \nDemocratic side, and they don't want to perform in terms of what the \nneeds are from a national security standpoint.\n  I said at the outset, there are two things unique to America. The \nother one is, we are so privileged in this country. If people at home \nwant to know how Jim Inhofe, as a Member of\n\n[[Page S319]]\n\nthe Senate, or any other Republican or Democratic Member of the Senate \nor House is voting, they can find out because we are ranked and rated \non a daily basis. If you are back home and wondering what your Member \nof Congress is doing and somehow your concern is taxes, the National \nTaxpayers Union ranks all of us in terms of what we do and what we feel \nin terms of taxes. If we want to increase taxes or decrease taxes, they \nknow.\n\n  They don't have to listen to us because, unfortunately, a lot of the \nMembers of the Senate and the House go back home and lie to the people. \nThey tell them they are for reducing taxes when, in fact, they vote to \nincrease taxes.\n  If you are concerned about whether you are a conservative, then the \nAmerican Conservative Union ranks every Member of the Senate, every \nMember of the House in terms of whether they are conservative or \nliberal. I bring that up because they happen to have me as the most \nconservative Member this last year. I was very proud of that ranking.\n  If you are concerned and you are back in Sapulpa, OK, wondering which \nMembers are voting for a more favorable climate for small business, the \nNational Federation of Independent Business ranks each one of us as to \nwhat our attitude is insofar as business issues.\n  I say that because if you want to know how we are voting on national \nsecurity issues or on national defense issues, the Center for Security \nPolicy is a ranking organization that ranks each one of us. I could \nname 30 or 40 of them. Ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty, confirmation of John Bolton, missile defense filibuster, the \nAmerican Missile Protection Act--these are all things that have to do \nwith defending America. This is significant and people need to know it. \nThe way we are ranked in accordance with how we vote for national \ndefense issues, the most recent report shows that the Republicans voted \nin favor of national security 82 percent of the time. The Democrats \nvoted prosecurity and prodefense 21 percent of the time. That tells you \nwhy defending America is a partisan issue.\n  We all know what happened during the hollow force that followed the \nCarter administration. We saw what Reagan had to do to rebuild our \ndefenses. He did it. Now we have a situation where we are going through \nessentially the same thing. The Bush administration inherited the \nClinton military and had to start building on it. That is a serious \nproblem, but he has done a good job.\n  I said there are seven things that this President inherited. The \nsecond thing is an economy that was set up to fall. We all know now \nthat we went into the recession in March of 2000. That was prior to the \ntime that President Bush came into office. So he inherited this \nrecession. People have asked: What does that have to do with national \nsecurity? What does that have to do with national defense? It has a lot \nto do with it because each 1 percent of increase in economic activity \ntranslates to $46 billion in new revenue. So if we are 5 or 6 percent \ndown during a recession, that is money that the President can't spend.\n  I often say to my conservative friends when I go back to Oklahoma and \nthey are complaining about the deficit--and you hear the ranting and \nraving from this side that Republicans are responsible for it--they \nhave to realize that this President not only inherited a military that \nhad to be built up, he also inherited an economy that was down in the \ncellar and, of course, he had to prosecute a war. That is a serious \nproblem. That is the second thing this President inherited.\n  The third thing this President inherited were the international \nchallenges that have become threatening to this country. In Iraq, the \nfailure of the Oil-for-Food Program, we all know about that. We know \nabout Saddam Hussein taking the money and using it for other purposes \nand denying the weapons inspectors access to the country, as he had \nagreed to do. All these things were happening in Iraq. Sometimes I look \nat the way people were trying to--I don't think they are trying \nanymore--talk about weapons of mass destruction. That wasn't the real \nissue at the time. When you stop and realize, if we hadn't gone in and \ndone what we did to Saddam Hussein, we would have more of what we had \nfor the 12 years, between the first and the second Persian Gulf wars.\n  Let me explain that a little bit. The first freedom fight came in \n1991, after the first Persian Gulf war. I was one of nine people \nselected to go on the first freedom fight. Alexander Hague went, and a \nDemocrat, Tony Cohelo, went. We had one person I will not mention. We \nhad a prominent Kuwaiti citizen, one of nobility, and his 7-year-old \ndaughter. All they could talk about was they wanted to go back and see \nwhat their home looked like after the demise took place in the first \nPersian Gulf war. We found that their home--this was the day after the \nwar was over. At that time, the Iraqis didn't even know the war was \nover. They were still burning the oilfields. We went to their home on \nthe Persian Gulf, which was a beautiful palace, only to find that--the \nindividual and his daughter who were with us on this first freedom \nfight found out that Saddam Hussein had used that particular house for \na headquarters. I took the 7-year-old girl up to her room--she wanted \nto see her animals--only to find that her bedroom was used as a torture \nchamber. There were ears and body parts scattered about the place. \nTwelve years following that, one of the bloodiest regimes took place, \nwith the torturing of individuals. They were shredding people, and they \nwould beg to be put into the shredder head first to avoid the pain. It \nwas the same with vats of acid. Babies were taken from their mothers; \nthey were taken by their arms and banged against a brick wall until \nthey were dead. This happened for a long period of time. And people \nthink the only reason to go in there was for weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  There is something kind of interesting happening right now that I \ndon't think even the Presiding Officer is aware of, and that is there \nis an individual I met in my office in Oklahoma, a former general in \nthe Iraqi Army. He was an air general of the Air Force in Iraq, Georges \nSada. There is a book he has written, which is out today, called \n``Sadam's Secrets.'' He witnessed what they did with the weapons of \nmass destruction. They took them and put them into various aircraft and \ntook them across the Syrian border. It is all in this book. He was on \n``Hannity and Colmes'' about 4 days ago. Watch for this guy, Georges \nSada. He will let you know that there were weapons of mass destruction. \nWe knew that anyway because he used them on some 200,000 people that he \nwas able to painfully kill using chemical weapons.\n  But I say that not because we have now solved the mystery of the \nweapons of mass destruction because that never was important. What was \nimportant was the things we knew when we went into Iraq.\n  Let me tell you the most significant thing and the greatest victory \nthat we could not talk about at that time, which was the three major \nterrorist training camps that were located in Iraq--Samarra, Ramadi, \nand Salman Pak. We broke those as soon as we brought down Saddam \nHussein.\n  I said there were seven things the President inherited--a downgraded \nmilitary, a broken economy, and one was the national security \nchallenge. The fourth one is international terrorism. We had with bin \nLaden--and during the Clinton administration we remember a lot of \nthings that did happen. We had the 1993 car bomb that went off in the \nbasement of the World Trade Center. We saw, in 1996, Khobar Towers blow \nup. We remember the embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, \nKenya, that were blown up in 1998. We remember, of course, the USS Cole \nin Yemen, when a little boat floated up and killed a bunch of our \nsailors. The Clinton response was comparatively benign, restrained and, \nat best, inconsistent. The operation ``Infinite Reach'' included cruise \nmissile strikes against Afghanistan and Sudan, which were not the \nproblem. But that was during the Lewinsky scandal, so nobody paid much \nattention to that.\n  The fifth thing was the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. \nThis is something we saw. When the Soviet Union fell, when the vast \nnuclear stockpile kind of disappeared--we had people going up there, \nincluding brokers--and then we could only identify some 30 or 40 \npercent of that which was stolen from the massive stockpile that\n\n[[Page S320]]\n\nthe Soviets had put together. That means there is about 60 to 70 \npercent of the stolen stockpile out there, and we are not sure where \nthat is.\n  During this time, AQ Khan, the father of Pakistan's nuclear program, \nbegan an international network of clandestine nuclear proliferation to \nLibya, Iran, and North Korea.\n  I remember one thing that happened because I was in this body at that \ntime and a member of the Armed Services Committee. I was trying to get \nthe point across that even though President Clinton's staff had said we \ndon't have a problem in terms of North Korea, I asked the question--I \nwrote a letter to the Clinton administration on August 24, of 1998 and \nI asked the question: How long will it be until North Korea has \nmultiple-stage rockets that could send a missile that could reach the \nUnited States. I got a reply back, but it wasn't in writing--they \ndidn't want to put it in writing. They said it would be 5 to 10 years \nbefore they will have that capability. Seven days later, on August 31 \nin 1998, the North Koreans fired a multiple-stage rocket with the \ncapability of reaching America. In fact, it did reach some areas of \nAlaska; that is America.\n\n  We have gone through the weapons of mass destruction proliferation, \nand we didn't have a strong response to that. The strongest response we \nhad back during the problem with Somalia and Mogadishu--you might \nremember that tragedy--we bailed out, ``cut and run,'' which is a \nfavorite thing for liberals to do when crises appear.\n  The sixth huge problem that the President inherited was an \nintelligence breakdown. It had been broken for a long time. I could not \nblame Democrats for that. When I was elected in 1994 from the House to \nthe Senate, I replaced David Boren. Senator Boren had been chairman of \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee for quite some time. After I was \nelected in that special election, he said we need to sit down and talk \nabout our intelligence system. So we did. He talked about turf battles, \nthat we have the CIA, FBI, NSA, and DIA, and none of them were \ncooperating or coordinating with one another. I said I will get on the \nIntelligence Committee, which I did, only to find out what David Boren \ntold me was exactly the situation. We tried to correct it, and we were \nnot successful, the same as he was not successful prior to 1994.\n  I remember once going down to the NSA in Virginia and they were \nshowing me, at that time, a new listening device that could listen to \nsomebody through 2 feet of concrete. I said: That is great; it is what \nthey need in New York City right now. The FBI has a need for this type \nof technology. They said: This is ours, they cannot have it. That is \nthe type of situation we had. It was something that had been that way \nfor a long period of time. Nonetheless, the President did inherit that.\n  The last thing that falls into the class of the huge inherited \nproblems by this President is the problem of China, and I was critical \nabout this on the Senate floor. I stood here at this podium and said at \nthe time that the first thing Clinton-Gore did when they assumed office \nwas go to our energy labs and start tearing down the security system. \nThey did away with color-coded badges. We remember that. Everybody knew \nthat. Do you know why? They said: This is demeaning for someone who has \na color that designates a lower form of security. We want everybody to \nbe the same. Then they did away with background checks and with the FBI \nwiretapping, and as a result of that--remember Wen Ho Lee who ended up \ntaking to China everything we had from our energy labs? We lost at that \ntime to China our W-88 warhead capability. This was a crown jewel; this \nwas the device that would allow us to have nuclear capability where we \ncould attach 10 nuclear missiles to a single warhead. We lost that and \nthe Chinese got that.\n  Remember what happened with the Loral Corporation? At that time, we \nhad a system the Loral Corporation had that was a guidance technology \nthat we were using in this country. However, they were precluded from \nsending it to other countries because this was something we didn't want \nanybody else to have. In order to send this to China, the President, \nBill Clinton, had to sign a waiver, and he signed a waiver so Loral \ncould sell guidance technology to the Chinese so they would be more \naccurate in their efforts to use their missiles. I am sure it was not \nrelated at all to the fact that Bernard Schwartz, the head of Loral \nCorporation, was their largest single financial contributor. Now they \nare talking about how terrible this thing is with this guy that was \ncontributing to both Democrats and Republicans and, yet, that wasn't \nhalf as bad as what happened during the time that President Clinton \nsigned a waiver so the Chinese would have our guidance technology.\n  Tomorrow night is going to be the State of the Union Message. I sat \nin the House Chamber and watched the second or third one that President \nClinton had. He made the statement--and it was documented that at the \ntime he made the statement the Chinese had between 13 and 18 of our \ncities targeted, and he stood up and said: Not one missile is pointed \nat one American child tonight, not one. Everybody applauded, but at \nthat time between 13 and 18 of our cities were targeted by the Chinese.\n  So we have had a problem that is a very serious one and one that the \nPresident had to deal with. Of course, we knew the Chinese were \ntransferring the prohibited weapons technology to Pakistan, Iraq, Iran, \nSyria, and North Korea and other countries. That is the ninth thing the \nPresident inherited. That is the real serious problem. Yet if we look \nat this chart again, the President had the lowest, in terms of \npercentage of gross national product, since before World War II.\n  This President came in, and the first thing the Bush administration \ntried to do is rebuild this broken military system. This is what \nPresident Bush did. I was so proud of him for doing it. You saw the \nother one, where you take the static line up there and it looked like a \nbathtub, where Clinton was $400 billion below, down here, just a static \nincrease that would go with the inflationary rate. This is what the \nBush administration did. If you take that black line, instead of being \nbelow that, they proposed, and the Senate and House agreed, to increase \nit during that period of time. That is up now, and that is 5 years. So \nit is $334 billion more than the static inflation-rate increase--not \n$400 billion less, as it was in the Clinton administration. Now, if you \ntake, in addition to that, the emergency supplementals that went to \nmilitary, that is another $292 billion. Add that together, and it is \n$626 billion more. That is a lot of money.\n  It is hard for me, as a conservative, to stand here and brag about \nthe fact that we are spending more on the military, but we had to in \norder to strengthen our programs and build up our troop strength and \nour modernization program. Bush went in and he did a lot of other \nthings, too. He helped the troops by increasing salaries and their \nhousing allowances. Prior to this time, they were having to spend 15 \npercent of their housing out of their own pockets. He took care of that \nfor them. He increased their capabilities and readiness, the growth in \nthe language training and funding of intelligence, and we have seen an \nincrease in lethality across all forces by focusing much more on \nprecision instruments.\n  If I could, I will go through our different services and make some \ncomments as to what this President did when he inherited this broken \ndefense system.\n  In the Army, he moved it from the old system of dealing with \ndivisions and organized them into modular brigades, combat teams that \nare much more capable and much faster to be deployed. These are ongoing \nplans to increase our force size from 33 brigades to 42 brigades to \nbuild back up what came down in the nineties.\n  Because of this reorganization, about 75 percent of the Army's \nbrigade structure should always be ready, and with the increase for the \nSpecial Ops, for the Psych Ops, for the military police, and for the \nlogistic units, he has done a remarkable job.\n  The rotation of units is kind of interesting, and I will get to that \nin a minute.\n  In looking at the Navy, the biggest problem he inherited there was \nspare parts. None of our ships would float. He concentrated on spare \nparts, and he now has the ships so they are out and ready and are \nactually out in areas that could be combat areas.\n  One of the changes he made was, instead of bringing it all the way \nback to\n\n[[Page S321]]\n\nthe United States and changing the crews, he leaves the ship in the \nbattle area and flies the crew back and puts a new crew in. As a \nresult, the percentage of ships routinely at sea has increased by more \nthan 50 percent.\n  In the Air Force, the modernization program--we are back with the \nJoint Strike Fighter working for that, and we actually have our FA-22. \nIt is flying. We have increased that fleet. We are actually going to be \nahead of the other countries.\n  Keep in mind--I talked about China a minute ago--back during the time \nthe Russians were selling the SU-27s which are better than our F-15s \nand F-16s, in one purchase, the Chinese purchased 240 of those. We have \na long way to get back.\n  One of the things the President did in the Air Force was recognize \nour ALCs, air logistic centers, and start funding them again so we can \nmaintain and rebuild our aging aircraft fleet. We now have three ALCs. \nThey are located in Utah, Georgia, and Oklahoma.\n  It is amazing what they have done. The rate of aircraft grounded due \nto parts issues decreased by 37 percent, it has bettered our flying \ngoal of 922,000 hours, the rate of aircraft incidents due to parts \nissues has decreased by 23 percent, and logistics response time has \nincreased by 20 percent. Good things are happening, and we see tangible \nresults.\n  On force posturing, this is something the President did, and I am \nvery proud I had something to do with this. It occurred to me as a \nmember of the Senate Armed Services Committee that we have all these \nfamilies deployed in Western Europe and South Korea, and yet, as \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I know what \nsome of the far-left environmentalists are doing to our ability to have \nlive ranges.\n  In Europe, that same thing was happening. So our families with our \nsoldiers training over there could only train on live ranges, sometimes \n5 days a week, sometimes 3 days a week, only during daylight hours, and \nthe restrictions were so cumbersome that we were not able to train \nthese guys.\n  It just made sense, if we tried something totally different and \nchanged our force structure, instead of having them in Western Europe \nwhere they cannot train, put them in Eastern Europe. I went to Bulgaria \nand Romania and a number of places where they have training ranges that \nthey will allow us to use free of charge. They will even billet us \nwhile we are there.\n  In changing our structure, we will bring all the families back. \nInstead of having 2-, 3-, 4-year deployments with the families going \nover to Western Europe, we will have 2- and 3-month deployments and not \nsend the families, just the troops over to the eastern areas, and they \ncan get as much training in 3 months as they could before this in 3 \nyears. That is one of the major changes. Right now, we are in the \nprocess of bringing back 70,000 troops, and 100,000 family members are \ncoming back. It is a major improvement.\n  That is how Bush responded to the national security threats. He did \nit swiftly and decisively. After taking office, he was faced with a \ncouple of crises. The first one was not quite as severe, but it was \nserious. That was back when the Chinese shot down one of our EP-3 Navy \nsurveillance planes, and he was able to, because of the decisive action \nhe took, bring the plane back and the crew and no one was hurt.\n  Then along came the tragedy of all tragedies, 9/11. I thought: Boy, \nam I glad we have somebody in there who is decisive and can respond. \nThe World Trade Center and the Pentagon got hit. If it had not been for \nthe courageous bunch of people over Pennsylvania, very likely this \nbuilding, where I am speaking right now, would have been one of the \ntargets and one of the victims. That is what we are dealing with and \nthe changes that were made.\n  The third part is policy change. I am going to run through this \nquickly, but I would like to have people think about this. The \nPresident changed the policy, and I think we can pretty much take his \nrhetoric that he has lived up to and see how different this is from the \ndecade of the nineties.\n\n  The President said: You are either with us or against us. That is \nwhat the President said to other countries. If you are not with us, you \nare an enemy. He said that Americans are asking how will we fight to \nwin this war:\n\n       We will direct every resource at our command, every means \n     of diplomacy, every tool of intelligence, every instrument of \n     law enforcement, every necessary weapon of war to the \n     disruption and defeat of the global war on terror network.\n\n  The President went further to say we are going to do four things. He \nsaid we are determined to prevent the attacks of terrorist networks \nbefore they occur.\n  Second, we are determined to deny weapons of mass destruction to \noutlaw regimes and to their terrorist allies who will use them.\n  Third, we are determined to deny radical groups the support and \nsanctuary of outlaw regimes.\n  Fourth, we are determined to deny militants control of any nation.\n  Within weeks of 9/11, he sent the military to Afghanistan to remove \nthe Taliban. Operation Enduring Freedom was successful.\n  He asked Congress for the PATRIOT Act.\n  He established the Department of Homeland Security.\n  He formed the 9/11 Commission. The 9/11 Commission had 39 \nrecommendations, of which we adopted 37.\n  He launched a preemptive attack against Saddam Hussein, and that \nworked successively. That was Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  He established the National Counterterrorism Center, which is now up \nand running.\n  He established a Domestic Nuclear Detection Office where just one \nsingle Federal agency is in charge so these things don't get lost in a \nbarrage of bureaucracies.\n  He established the Terrorist Screening Center.\n  He established and transformed the FBI to focus on preventing \nterrorism.\n  He strengthened the Transportation Safety Administration.\n  He improved border screening and security through the US-VISIT entry-\nexit system.\n  For the first time, he started looking at our problems with regard to \ncargo coming into this country. He set up the National Targeting \nCenter, which is responsible for that.\n  He expanded shipping security through the Container Security \nInitiative, which worked successfully.\n  He developed Project Bioshield. This is an organized defense against \nchemical weapons and biological weapons, as well as nuclear attacks.\n  He aggressively cracked down on terrorist financing with many \ninternational partners. Over 400 individuals and entities have been \ndesignated pursuant to the Executive order, resulting in nearly $150 \nmillion in frozen assets and millions more blocked so they cannot get \nto the terrorist activities.\n  The international successes he has had are incredible. We are safer \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, 9/11 was a wake-up call. We are doing the right \nthings.\n  Another measure of success is Iraq. You would never know it, \nlistening to the media. The first thing the troops ask me when I go \nover there is, Why doesn't the media like us? Why don't they understand \nwhat we are doing? I think now they are catching on that the American \npeople are aware of our success.\n  They have had three successful nationwide elections. They voted for a \ntransitional government and drafted the most progressive democratic \nconstitution in the Arab world, approved a new constitution, elected a \nnew government under a new constitution, with each election less \nviolent, with a bigger turnout than the one before.\n  The Sunnis, the ones who were not cooperating, are now cooperating. \nThere was an article about a week ago in the Los Angeles Times that \ntalked about the killing by a suicide bomber of literally hundreds of \nIraqi troops, and most were Sunnis, and 225 Sunni families each offered \nanother member of their family to replace those who had been killed. \nThat is Iraq.\n  Still, there are international successes with terrorism. The \nterrorists who attacked on 9/11 are in jail, dead, or on the run. They \nare isolated. Al-Qaida and bin Laden no longer have a safe haven in \nwhich to hide. The Taliban is deposed, and democracy is in its place.\n  The al-Qaida structure has been taken out. No major attacks on the \nUnited States have taken place since all this took place. We have had \nthe\n\n[[Page S322]]\n\ndisruption of at least 10 serious al-Qaida terrorist plots since 9/11. \nThree of those plots, incidentally, were plots to do something to \nthe United States of America within the confines of our borders.\n\n  We had the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction that was \ntaking place during the nineties and the AQ Khan network in Pakistan. \nThey are no longer distributing weapons of mass destruction or \ninformation about them.\n  There are now six-party talks ongoing with North Korea, and the \nUnited States is no longer alone in pressuring the North Koreans to \ngive up their nuclear programs.\n  Libya opened its doors to inspection. This is really critical because \nLibya, during the Clinton administration of the nineties, was building \nweapons of mass destruction, their unconventional weapons program. I \ncan't help but think they equate President Bush with President Reagan \nbecause we remember and they remember, certainly, what happened in 1986 \nwhen President Reagan sent about F-111s into Libya and pounded them \ninto the ground. All of a sudden, Libya opened their doors to our \ninspectors, and they have admitted the country had sought to develop \nunconventional weapons, but now they are eliminating them.\n  In missile defense, this is significant because since 1983 when the \nSDI program started and people were deriding it--the liberals didn't \nwant us to be able to defend ourselves against incoming missile \nattacks. We now have the beginning of one coming in place. We can now \nknock down incoming missiles into the United States. That is huge. Not \nmany people are aware of it, but that is what is happening.\n  We talked about the problems he inherited and about the solutions. \nHow much further do we have to go? In the State of the Union Message \ntomorrow night, we are going to hear the President talk about Iraq and \nabout some of the things we need to continue in Iraq, the successes we \nhave had, but also the international community, the fact they are going \nto have to come up with what they agreed to. They agreed to supply $13 \nbillion toward the war in Iraq. They have not done it yet. I think he \nis going to invite them to do it tomorrow night.\n  The Iran problem, with the President of Iran declaring Israel must be \nwiped off the map and the Holocaust was actually a myth--a far more \nserious issue is Iran's attempt to restart their nuclear program. \nAgainst the International Atomic Energy Agency directive, on January \n10, Iran reopened Natanz nuclear complex. That is a serious problem.\n  Mexico and the borders--we have talked about that and recognize it is \na serious problem.\n  The NSA eavesdropping--I think the President will talk about that. \nEveryone is concerned about people's feelings being hurt and not about \nthe intervention of the President to eavesdrop and try to get \ninformation from known terrorist groups coming into this country and \ntrying to communicate with terrorists within the country. I am really \nproud of this President for sticking to his guns on this issue. We need \nto keep that going. I am sure he will mention something about that \ntomorrow night.\n  China--I am sure he will talk about the problems with China. I have \nto say this: As a member of the Armed Services Committee, during the \nnineties, during the Clinton administration, I watched the dismantling \nof our system. At the time, we were going down to about 60 percent of \nwhat we had at the end of the Persian Gulf war, and at that time, China \nhad increased its military procurement by 1,000 percent. That is bad \nenough, and that is serious, but the other thing they are doing, their \nproblem with us is we are the No. 1 and No. 2 country in terms of \nhaving to depend on other countries to have the energy to run our \ncountry and certainly to fight a war.\n  When we do this, I see China out there all of a sudden has its $70 \nbillion deal with Iran, and now they are importing 13 percent of their \noil from Iran. They are refusing to go along with us on sanctions \nagainst the Sudan with all the atrocities going on there. Now they are \nimporting 70 percent of their oil from Sudan. We know what they have \nbeen doing with Chavez in Venezuela.\n  These are real serious problems we are facing with China. I am sure \nhe will talk about these tomorrow night.\n  He will talk about our overreliance on foreign oil. I cannot be \ncritical of the Democrats or Republicans. We are all responsible for \nthat.\n  Back when Don Hodel was Secretary of Interior during the Reagan \nadministration, we had a little song and dance where we would go out to \nthe consumption States, such as New York and Illinois, and we would \ntell them that our reliance on foreign countries for energy is really \nnot an energy issue, it is a national security issue because we are \nrelying on them for our ability to fight a war. Do you know what our \nreliance was at that time? We were relying on foreign countries for 35 \npercent of our total amount of oil imports, oil to run our country. Now \nit is at 63 percent. That is serious.\n\n  I have to say in conclusion I believe the President deserves \nexcellent grades. What this administration accomplished in the last 5 \nyears is phenomenal. If we compare where we were and where we are now, \nwe are a more secure nation. We have finally awakened and we have \nstarted to deal aggressively with the threats that are facing us. We \nare no longer treating the terrorist enemies of the United States like \ndisadvantaged people. We are no longer turning a blind eye to the \nnuclear proliferation by negotiating without the real threat of \nmilitary action. Our negotiators can now go to the table with more \ncredibility.\n  We are no long underfunding the readiness challenge. If we had an \nadministration without the willingness to fund defense, take decisive \naction and stand up to our allies with their heads buried in the sand, \nwe would be in far worse shape than we are today. I believe Europe is \nslowly awakening to the threats that exist. Fortunately we have had one \nvery strong ally who stayed with us through this challenging period, \nTony Blair. I am sure the President will renew his praise for Tony \nBlair and all the help he has given to us.\n  I wish to say one thing. Let me ask the Chair how much time I have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). The Senator has approximately 14 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me make a comment about this thing, ``The U.S. \nMilitary Under Strain and at Risk.'' It is amazing that the media would \ngive any attention to this group. Do you know who this group is? This \ngroup is Madeleine Albright, Burger--this is the group, Podesta--these \nare the ones who gave us the problems we had in the 1990s and so they \ncame with a report and say the military is under strain, at risk.\n  We are undoing the damage they did. The far-left Democrat club that \ngave us the broken force of the 1990s is the one in charge of this \nreport. If you watch TV, you would think they are actually people who \nare seriously concerned about the United States of America and \nconcerned about undoing the damage that has been done there when they \nin fact were the ones who caused damage. The Chief of Staff of the \nArmy, General Schoomacker is a good guy. He came out of retirement and \nagreed to do this. He didn't have to do it. He is not one of the guys \nwho had to do it for a job. He is retired. He is down on a ranch. He \nagreed to come in and become the commander of the Army, and he read \nthis report and said there is no truth to it. Our Army is not broken. \nWe are actually going through modernization challenges, but it is \ntrying to modernize, modularize, and mobilize, and fight a global war \nat the same time.\n  The accusations that were made, let's look at one of them in \nparticular. It says:\n\n       Nearly all of the available combat units in the U.S. Army \n     National Guard and Marine Corps have been used in the current \n     operations.\n\n  That is true because we started with a force that was underfunded and \nhad been drawn down during the 1980s by the very people who came out \nwith this report. They didn't have the right kind of a mix. So we are \nchanging that and taking it away from the Cold War military to one that \nis facing this asymmetric threat we have out there. We are currently \nraising the number of our brigades from 33 to 42. Congress has given us \nnow, through the leadership of the President, authorization for 30,000 \nmore troops.\n\n[[Page S323]]\n\n  The shortfall, that was their fault. Again, you can go in and read \nmore of this report saying the Army is experiencing the beginnings of \nwhat could become a major recruiting crisis. Right now we are raising \nour number within the Army from 484,000 to 512,000 and, while we are \ndoing that, our recruiting and our retention is very good. Right now \nthe Active Force retention and recruiting figures combined for 2005 \nwere 99.1 percent. It may not be growing as fast as we would like \ntoward the 512,000, but we can hardly call that a failure. In the first \nquarter of fiscal year 2006, we achieved 104 percent of the recruiting \nmission and 100 percent of the retention mission for the quarter.\n  The Guard and Reserve are all overworked, but in the first quarter, \nrecruiting figures for the National Guard are 106 percent and the \nReserves are doing even better at 122 percent. General Fuzzy Webster, \nwho came back with the Third Infantry Division--that was their second \nrotation--they now have a 133-percent retention. That is the third ID \nthat has been over there fighting for freedom on two different \noccasions.\n  Anyway, the surprising thing is the press would give them any \nattention at all.\n  Last, let me share my own personal experience. I have had occasion to \ngo to Iraq or the Iraq area 10 times now. I take very seriously my job \nas a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Let me share with \nyou, not all 10 times but a little anecdotal experience on 3 of those \ntimes.\n  First, in January, January is the first vote. I remember one lady--I \nhad an interpreter and we were interviewing--and she said I couldn't \nsee the ballot because of the tears in my eyes. Then it occurred to me, \nthis is not the first time in the 30 years of the butcher Saddam \nHussein, this is the first time in 7,000 years we have had an \nopportunity at self-determination.\n  A few days later I decide to spend my time in the Sunni triangle \nbecause that is where they are supposed to hate us the most. There is a \ngeneral in Fallujah by the name of Mahdi, the brigade commander for \nSaddam Hussein, the brigade commander for the Iraqi security forces in \nFallujah. At that time he hated Americans, until they started training \nwith the Marines in Fallujah, called embedded training. They became so \nfond of the Marines, when they rotated the Marines out we all got \ntogether and we cried. He renamed Fallujah Iraqi security force the \nFallujah marines. That man is now in charge of security in Baghdad \nbecause he is doing security for us. In Tikrit, I was there when they \nblew up one of the training centers where 40 Iraqis were seriously \ninjured. What you don't see in the media is the 40 families who had \nthat loss replaced their loved ones with another member of the family.\n  When you go across the Sunni triangle 50 or 100 feet off the ground \nin a helicopter, little kids are waving American flags. When we send \ncare packages to our kids, cookies or candies, they don't eat them, \nthey repackage them and throw them to the kids there. That is the truth \nof what was happening.\n  I was up there last month during the election. Everybody expected the \nproblems of the terrorists, the insurgents, to spike at that time, but \nit didn't happen because they have run out of steam. The IEDs, they \nwent down by 30 percent in the month before the December election. \nSuicide bombs went down by 70 percent in 90 days. The road from the \nairport that goes into the green zone, I have been on it many times, \nthey were having about 10 terrorist activities each week and now there \nhave not been any for 7 months. Not one. That is when we turned over \nthe security to the Iraqis and they are taking care of their own \nsecurity.\n\n  These are the successes that are taking place. The number of tips \nthat come in from Iraqis, they used to be 500 a month, now they are up \nto 5,000 a month. This is what is happening.\n  When we see that this general is now in Baghdad, and more than the \neastern half of Baghdad, there is not one American boot on the ground, \nthey are all Iraqis. They are the ones taking care of their own \nsecurity and the 112 battalions they have right now, approximately \n220,000 troops, 32 of those 112 battalions are either level 1 or level \n2; that is, they can go into battle on their own. In January a year ago \nnone were in that position.\n  Is it going to be over? People are always asking that question. \nPeople are not answering. I will answer that question. If you take the \ntrend where we are right now, right now we have trained and equipped \n220,000 Iraqi troops. By the end of this year it will be 300,000 Iraqi \ntroops. The goal was to get up to 325,000. Why? Because all the \nmilitary people tell me we need to get to 10 divisions before we can \nturn the security of Iraq over to the Iraqis, and that will be 325,000. \nWe will be there by June of 2007. By June of 2007 we will have turned \nover the security to the Iraqis. We will still have a few troops \nthere--we still have troops in Bosnia and Kosovo--but the security will \nhave been turned over to them.\n  When you go through the towns and see the hospitals, the schools, the \nbusinesses--$22 billion in oil reserves are going in. Yet you have \nseveral Senators coming back, Senators who, I might add, are running \nfor President in 2008, trying to make you think things are not \nsuccessful there. Senator Biden came back and said they only had 30,000 \ntroops. It was not 30,000, it was 200,000 when he made that statement. \nSenator Kerry said our troops are out at night terrorizing women. I \ntalked to the troops. None of them even know what he is talking about.\n  I have to conclude, and I say this in all sincerity to the authors of \nthis report and to the 1990s crowd that got us into this mess, and I \nsay to the naysayers, and I say to the cut-and-run caucus, I have named \nthem--I say to the hand wringers: I am sure glad you are not in charge \nbecause, if you were, what happened to the military and national \nsecurity in the 1990s would be happening again right now. We would be \nright back to the same path where surrender is always an option. Back \nwhere? Negotiating with terrorists. There is nothing wrong with that. \nNegotiate and appease, negotiate and appease. I thank God every day our \nPresident, George Bush, is not an appeaser. An appeaser is a guy who \nthrows his friends to the alligators hoping they will eat them last.\n  Hiram Mann said:\n\n     No man survives when freedom fails.\n     The best men rot in filthy jails.\n     And those who cry appease, appease,\n     are hanged by those they tried to please.\n\n  Back in 2000 we came within six electoral votes of being hanged by \nthose we tried to please.\n  Looking at what this President has done, grading the President on \nnational defense and national security, very clearly President Bush--I \nam anxious to hear him tomorrow night--very clearly he will get an A.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/30/senate-section/article/S323-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to our late \ncolleague, Senator William Proxmire--beloved father, husband, veteran, \nand former member of this body. With over 32 years of service in this \ninstitution, Senator Proxmire constantly challenged us to remain \nfiscally responsible. As chairman of the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs for four Congresses, he was constantly working to \nprotect the taxpayers.\n  Most Members of this esteemed body recall the steady reminder by \nSenator Proxmire that ``Uncle Sam is the last of the big spenders.'' \nHis firm advocacy for good sense and forethought on spending led to the \ncreation of the ``Golden Fleece'' awards. Senator Proxmire would hand \nthese awards out, to friend and foe, to highlight government waste, \nabuse and scandal. His ``maverick'' attitude toward our \nresponsibilities with the taxpayers' dollars should be remembered, \nhonored, and, as I am sure he would agree, employed more today. We miss \nSenator Proxmire and his ``Golden Fleece'' awards.\n  Our country lost Senator Proxmire this past December as he succumbed \nto the devastating affects of Alzheimer's--a disease he battled daily \nsince 1994. He spent his last years at the Copper Ridge Institute in \nEldersburg, MD. Copper Ridge is a fantastic facility dedicated to the \nstudy of caring for those suffering from dementia. The goals of the \nCopper Ridge Institute are to share the knowledge it has acquired in \nthe field of dementia care. For the last 10 years, staff from Copper \nRidge, the Copper Ridge Institute and the Johns Hopkins University \nSchool of Medicine have worked together to develop a model of care that \nrespects the dignity of the people battling this disease and that \nprovides a better quality of life to them.\n  I had the pleasure of meeting and talking with Senator Proxmire's \nwife, Ellen, in September 2004. Mrs. Proxmire sponsors an annual award \nin the name of her husband for those who support this dedicated \nAlzheimer's research. Mrs. Proxmire has truly become the voice for \nthose who cannot speak. She has worked diligently to see more national \nattention given to Alzheimer's disease and the important role specific \ncare models like that at Copper Ridge play in preserving the dignity \nand quality of life of those with the disease. As Mrs. Proxmire likes \nto point out, ``Until there is a cure for the disease, learning to care \nfor those with Alzheimer's is paramount.''\n  Mr. President, we have a responsibility, as nearly 4.5 million \nAmericans find themselves faced with this terrible disease, to work \nwith those involved with research and medicine in this field. Our \ncountry is stronger today because the name ``William Proxmire'' is \nfound on the rolls of the Senate. As we pause to remember this great \nman, true patriot, and fellow Senator, this institution should take \nheed and continue our support in the fight for an Alzheimer's cure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/30/senate-section/article/S324-2", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PALESTINIAN LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL ELECTIONS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.

Hamas must use its \nelectoral success as an opportunity to renounce its violent platform \nand to join in a coalition dedicated to achieving peace in the region. \nRenouncing terrorism and violence and accepting the right of Israel to \nexist are essential steps toward fulfilling the desire of the \nPalestinian people for a peaceful representative democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/30/senate-section/article/S324-3", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL MENTORING MONTH\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

That is 15 million young people who need the guidance to \nimprove life-essential skills, make healthy choices, and increase their \nown self worth. I hope the rest of the Senate will join in supporting \nthis resolution and supporting this very important campaign.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/30/senate-section/article/S324-4", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ABRAMOFF SCANDAL\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, as both vice chairman of the Senate \nEthics Committee and a member of the Senate Committee on Indian \nAffairs, I have been absolutely appalled at the scope and the depth of \nthe villainy associated with the Abramoff lobbying scandal.\n  Inasmuch as Washington recently has become consumed and distracted by \nthe utterly shameful actions of disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff, I \nbelieve that it is essential to understand just how far removed from \nthis scandal Indian tribes are. While a small handful of tribes were \nrepresented by Mr. Abramoff and were victimized by his incredibly shady \nand cynical manipulation of their funds, the vast majority of our \nNation's 560 tribes and Alaskan Native villages had nothing to do with \nhim or his practices. Less than half of those tribes operate casinos, \nand only a tiny proportion of those generate the kind of money that \nwould attract the likes of Mr. Abramoff.\n  Most of the tribes that operate casinos are far from wealthy. The \nmyth that all or most gaming Indian tribes are rolling in dough is \nwildly incorrect. The tribes in South Dakota and many around the \ncountry have large land bases and extensive enrolled memberships. Their \ncasinos are often located in remote, rural areas far away from large \nnumbers of affluent customers and set amidst dire levels of poverty and \nunemployment. The truth is that most of these casinos provide some \nbadly needed jobs and only a modest amount of revenue. The income that \nremains after payroll expenses are largely then immediately consumed by \na huge backlog of financial needs for education, housing, health and \neconomic development within their reservations.\n  While a few Indian tribes were associated with Mr. Abramoff, the fees \nthey paid were far beyond what most tribes could possibly afford--and \nin the end, their hired lobbyist abused both their money and their \ntrust. Clearly, this scandal was a lobbying scandal, not a tribal \nscandal. The reality in too much of Indian Country is the consequence \nof chronic poverty: shocking levels of disease, inadequate housing, \ncrime, drug and alcohol abuse, low school graduation rates, hunger, and \nstressed families. These tribes aren't paying Washington lobbyists \nmillions of dollars, but instead are struggling every day to make ends \nmeet and to help restore the dignity of their members.\n  While I did not receive any money from Jack Abramoff, I did receive \nlegal contributions from tribes he represented. I am proud of the \nsupport Indian tribes and individual Native Americans have extended to \nme over the years. We must help restore the American public's faith in \ngood, responsible government and preserve participation by sovereign \nIndian tribes in our democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/30/senate-section/article/S324-5", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S324-S325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      CONGRATULATING EAGLE SCOUTS\n\n Mr. THUNE.

This honor is not given lightly, and it represents their great \ndrive and dedication to excellence.\n  These young men should be proud of their accomplishment. The rank of \nEagle is given to only 2 percent of all Boy Scouts, and these young men \nfind themselves among other great Americans including Neil Armstrong \nand Gerald Ford. I look forward to these Scouts going on to do great \nthings as well.\n  I am proud to join the friends and family of these proud Scouts in \ncongratulating them on their many and most recent \naccomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/30/senate-section/article/S325-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AWARD FOR EXCELLENCE IN EDUCATION\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Bamber Valley \nElementary School, in Rochester, MN, which recently earned an Award for \nExcellence in Education for its exceptional and innovative achievements \nin educating children.\n  Bamber Valley Elementary School is truly a model of educational \nsuccess. The school is Rochester's largest elementary school, serving \n885 students in kindergarten through fifth grade. The successful \npartnership created between families and the community has made \npossible a school that exemplifies teamwork, pride, and excellence.\n  Bamber Valley is making full use of test score data to improve \nteaching techniques and to address the specific reading and math \nchallenges facing individual students. The administration's quick \ndissemination of test data to the classroom teachers has allowed the \nteachers to adjust their teaching strategies, addressing the skills \nthat students found to be the most difficult on the standardized tests.\n  Bamber Valley is home to the district's programs serving the \nelementary deaf and hard-of-hearing children. The program's resource \nteachers work with families encountering crisis situations, and a \ngifted and talented specialist is assigned to the school to help \nchallenge students who excel.\n  For students in the first through fifth grades, the school has an \nafterschool academy program, where laughter and high energy combine to \ncreate a learning environment that is safe, welcoming, and fun.\n  Much of the credit for Bamber Valley Elementary School's success \nbelongs to its principal, Ms. Becky Gerdes, and her dedicated teachers. \nThe students and staff at Bamber Valley Elementary School understand \nthat, in order to be successful, a school must go beyond achieving \nacademic success; it must also offer a nurturing environment where \nstudents develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes for a lifetime of \nsuccess. All of the faculty, staff, and students at Bamber Valley \nElementary School should be very proud of their accomplishments.\n  I congratulate Bamber Valley Elementary School in Rochester, MN, for \nwinning the Award for Excellence in Education and for its exceptional \ncontributions to education in Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/30/senate-section/article/S325-2", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AWARD FOR EXCELLENCE IN EDUCATION\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Mayo High \nSchool, in Rochester, MN, which recently earned an Award for Excellence \nin Education for its exceptional and innovative achievements in \neducating children.\n  Mayo High School is truly a model of educational success. Several \nyears ago, the school established three major goals and developed an \naction plan to achieve them: No. 1, to improve the graduation rate; No. \n2, to address a disproportionate number of suspensions of racial \nminority students; and No. 3, to improve poor math and reading test \nscores.\n  Several key school leaders are largely responsible for the school's \nattaining these goals.\n  Ms. Joan Bachman, who chaired the diversity committee, initiated a \nmultiyear plan, working with the community, staff, and students to make \nMayo High School a more welcoming place for all students. Through her \nleadership, the school has won the District's Diversity Award for each \nof the last 4 years. She also won the Rochester Diversity Council's \nEducators Award last year.\n  Ms. Jeri Brown oversees the school's conflict mediation program and \ntrains students in conflict mediation skills. The students who receive \nconflict mediation training perform nearly 400 mediations per year, \nachieving a 93-percent success rate.\n  Mr. Ron Randall, chair of the math department, and Barb Milburn, \nchair of the English department, have done a superior job in improving \nthe academic performance of all students. Last year, Mayo received the \nState's Five Star rating in math.\n  Recognizing that many of the students receiving suspensions for \nbehavioral reasons were the same students who least could afford time \naway from school, Mayo modified its policies. By focusing on addressing \ncauses of students' poor behavior, Mayo has avoided loss of valuable \nclass time. Consequently, suspension rates have improved, and \ngraduation rates have dramatically risen. Last year, the school boasted \na 95-percent graduation rate.\n  Much of the credit for Mayo High School's success belongs to its \nprincipal, Dr. John Frederikson, and his dedicated teachers. The \nstudents and staff at Mayo High School understand that, in order to be \nsuccessful, a school must go beyond achieving academic success; it must \nalso provide a nurturing environment where students develop \nthe knowledge, skills, and attitudes for a lifetime of success. All of \nthe faculty, staff, and students at Mayo High School should be very \nproud of their accomplishments.\n\n  I congratulate Mayo High School in Rochester, MN, for winning the \nAward for Excellence in Education and for its exceptional contributions \nto education in Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/30/senate-section/article/S325-3", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S325-S326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AWARD FOR EXCELLENCE IN EDUCATION\n\n Mr. DAYTON.

The school, which is part of the Mankato Area School \nDistrict, serves 290 students from the communities of Eagle Lake and \nMadison Lake. Although relatively small, Eagle Lake Elementary offers \nan impressive variety of educational opportunities, including all-day \nkindergarten, special education services, assurance of mastery program \nfor at-risk students, a school psychologist and social worker, a \nstructured study center, afterschool academic assistance, speech and \nlanguage assistance, an artist-in-residence program, mentoring program, \nlyceum programs, and challenging opportunities for highly capable \nstudents.\n  Eagle Lake Elementary's ``400 Club,'' a school-wide home reading \nprogram, encourages students to spend at least 100 minutes per week \nreading. At the end of each month, a school-wide celebration honors \nthose who have read over 400 minutes for the month. The ``Reading \nBuddies'' program pairs early elementary students with fourth and fifth \ngrade students to explore reading through weekly themed projects and \nactivities. The older buddy learns role model and leadership skills \nwhile the younger buddy is encouraged to develop lifelong reading \nhabits. The school also boasts an orchestra program, a science fair, a \nQuiz Bowl, Peace Makers, which teaches peer mediation and conflict \nresolution, novel study, word masters, art masterpiece, geography and \nspelling bees, Jump Rope for Heart, and a variety of afterschool \nactivities.\n  Parents' involvement in the education of their children is also very \nhigh at Eagle Lake Elementary. This fall, 99 percent of all parents \nparticipated in parent-teacher conferences.\n  Much of the credit for Eagle Lake Elementary School's success belongs \nto principal, Jason Scherber, and his dedicated teachers. The students \nand staff at Eagle Lake Elementary School understand that, in order to \nbe successful, a school must go beyond achieving academic success; it \nmust also provide a nurturing environment where students develop the \nknowledge, skills, and attitudes for a lifetime of success.

Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate a special \noccasion in the life of a true American; Mr. Raymond Twomey of Boston, \nMA. As Ray gathers with his friends and family, I wish to join with all \nof them in celebrating his career of public service, his distinguished \nmilitary service, and his 90th birthday.\n  Ray was born on January 30, 1916, and grew up in east Boston, where \nhe resides to this day with his son Jerry and daughter-in-law Sandra. \nHe answered his country's call to service in World War II and worked as \na medic in the ``Spearhead Division,'' known outside the service by its \nmore formal title of the U.S. Army 703rd Tank Destroyer Battalion, 3rd \nArmored Division. He ascended to the rank of corporal, fought \ncourageously in the critical Battle of the Bulge, and was subsequently \nawarded a Purple Heart.\n  Upon his return to the States, Ray began his work for the U.S. Postal \nService and served the Boston neighborhoods of Beacon Hill and the \nNorth End. He married the lovely Marie Louise Spinazola, also of east \nBoston, in 1948; and their four children, Jerry, Claudia, Mary and \nBernadette were born and raised in east Boston as well. He is the proud \ngrandfather of six grandchildren and one great grandchild.\n  On the occasion of Ray's 90th birthday, his entire family will gather \nto honor him and celebrate his life and accomplishments. I am proud to \njoin them in wishing happy birthday to Ray and wish him the very \nbest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/30/senate-section/article/S326-2", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING THE LIFE OF CHARLES F. CUMMINGS\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nCharles F. Cummings, the official historian of Newark, NJ. Mr. Cummings \npassed away on December 21, 2005, at the age of 68.\n  Mr. Cummings was born in Puerto Rico and raised in Virginia, but it \nwas Newark, NJ, to which he pledged his life's work. With a master's \ndegree in American History from Vanderbilt University, Mr. Cummings \narrived in New Jersey in 1963 to begin a job with the Newark Public \nLibrary. He adapted quickly to his new home, studying the history and \ntraditions of both the city and the State. Before long, Mr. Cummings \nwas renowned for having an encyclopedic knowledge of all things New \nJersey.\n  Not content to keep this information to himself, Mr. Cummings sought \nto make the State's history public knowledge so that the people of \nNewark would love his adopted home as much as he did. As an employee of \nthe Newark Public Library for over 40 years, Mr. Cummings took pride in \ncurating public exhibitions that shed light on the history of Newark \nand brought to life the stories of those who lived there. Mr. Cummings \nshared the history and accomplishments of Newark with thousands of New \nJersey residents by conducting walking tours of the city and writing a \nregular column for the The Star Ledger of New Jersey called ``Knowing \nNewark.'' He also served as an affiliate member of the Rutgers \nUniversity Federated Department of history, where he taught a popular \nundergraduate course on the history of Newark.\n  There has hardly been a person, past or present, who has cared about \nthe history of Newark the way Mr. Cummings did. He was an indispensable \nresource for journalists, historians, and citizens alike. While Mr. \nCummings will be missed by the people of New Jersey, he will be forever \ncherished as a loyal friend, a great man, and a true Newark treasure.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to \nCharles F. Cummings and the immeasurable contributions he has made to \nthe city of Newark and the State of New Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/30/senate-section/article/S326-3", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S326-S329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-5391.
