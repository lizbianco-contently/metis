That will be \nfollowed by an additional 30-minute period of time which has been set \naside for closing remarks on the Defense authorization bill. At \napproximately 10:50 or so this morning we are scheduled to begin a \nseries of votes which will end with a vote on passage of the Defense \nauthorization bill. Those stacked votes include the Warner amendment on \nIraq; a Levin amendment on Iraq; Senator Bingaman's second-degree \namendment relating to detainees; Senator Graham's underlying amendment \non detainees, and then final passage of the bill. Therefore, we should \ncomplete our work on the Defense bill by the start of our policy lunch \nrecess.\n  Yesterday, I mentioned the many items that we will need to consider \nprior to adjourning for Thanksgiving. The tax reconciliation bill may \nbe available as early as later today, and we will proceed to that bill \nunder the statutory time limit as soon as possible. We will know a \nlittle bit later this morning.\n  We will continue to expedite consideration of the other \nappropriations conference reports as they arrive at the desk and we can \nclear them with short time agreements. We will also consider other \nconference reports I mentioned yesterday, the PATRIOT Act, as well as \nthe pension bill under an agreement now being negotiated. That is the \npension bill.\n  If we use all of this time wisely we can get through our remaining \nbusiness in this week. I hope we can work together during these final \ndays so we do not have to work into Saturday or longer to complete the \nitems that remain. We will have to gauge our progress over the next 24 \nto 48 hours in that regard, and I urge everyone to keep a flexible \nschedule over the next several days.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an urgent problem \nthat continues to confront this great Nation. The problem is simply \nstated. Today, America is held hostage to our overdependence on foreign \noil. That dependency is continuing to grow at an ever-alarming rate. \nAmerica deserves better.\n  The problem is a result of the malignant neglect of the United States \nof a meaningful national energy policy for the last three decades. From \nthe formation of OPEC and President Carter's national statement that we \nmust embrace energy independence with ``the moral imperative of war,'' \nWashington has been stuck in the swamp of inaction. It is time to \nchange this neglect and, for the sake of ourselves and for our \nchildren, find our way out of this swamp of inaction.\n  Ever since 1970, America's domestic production of oil has been \ndropping. And ever since, many speeches have been given in Washington \nabout the importance of achieving energy independence. Many of us \nremember the speeches of Richard Nixon and President Carter in the \n1970s and the 1980s.\n  In 1973, following the formation of OPEC, President Nixon gave a \nspeech to the Nation where he said:\n\n     our overall objective . . . can be summed up in one word that \n     best characterizes this Nation and its essential character. \n     The word is ``independence.''\n\n  Then again in 1980, President Carter spoke to the Congress at his \nState of the Union address. In that speech, President Carter said:\n\n       Our excessive dependence on foreign oil is a clear and \n     present danger to our Nation's security. The need has never \n     been more urgent. At long last, we must have a clear, \n     comprehensive energy policy for the United States.\n\n  That was President Jimmy Carter in 1980. Well, here we are in 2005 \nand the Nation has miserably failed to achieve any meaningful reform \nand any progress toward energy independence. Instead, we have retreated \nand gone backward. We have become more dependent on imports of foreign \noil. The words of President Nixon and President Carter today in 2005 \nsound hollow because there has not been action to follow the words that \nhave come out of Washington. I am sure both President Nixon, if he were \nalive today, and President Carter today would be frustrated with the \nrefusal by Washington, the refusal by the White House, to move this \ngreat Nation toward energy independence.\n  I, too, am tired of this talk, and I believe many of my colleagues in \nthis Chamber are tired of this talk. I am tired of the maneuvering of \nCongress to protect the special interests, and it is time for us to \ntake action.\n  The facts do not lie about the national energy crisis that we are in \nand how we are being held hostage to the whims of foreign governments. \nThe conclusion is inescapable when one reviews the facts. Let me review \njust a few of those important facts. One, Americans today consume one-\nquarter of the world's oil, but we only stand on top of about 3 percent \nof the global reserves. So we consume one-quarter of the world's oil, \nbut we only have 3 percent of the world's reserves.\n  Currently, the OPEC member countries produce about 40 percent of the \nworld's oil, but they hold 80 percent of the proven world reserves. \nThat is a second fact that should be alarming to us because 85 percent \nof those reserves are in the greater Middle East in countries such as \nIraq, Iran, and Saudi Arabia.\n\n  Third, 22 percent of the world's oil is in the hands of state \nsponsors of terrorism under U.S. or U.N. sanction, and only 9 percent \nof the world's oil is in the hands of free countries.\n  Today, as we debate the Department of Defense authorization bill to \nmake sure that we remain a strong America, this ought to be something \nin the back of our minds and in the front of our minds, that we cannot \nreally have a strong America unless we address this most fundamental \nnational security threat of our overdependence on foreign oil.\n  In the 1970s, this Nation imported about a third of our oil needs. \nToday, we import almost 60 percent, and the projections are that 20 to \n25 years from now we will be importing 70 percent of our oil from \nforeign countries.\n  Fifth, we are importing more oil at a time when other growing nations \nsuch as China continue to grow in their importation of oil from other \ncountries. China, today, has become the No. 2 petroleum user on the \nentire globe. Experts predict that China's 1.2 billion people and its \nlarge and rapidly growing demand for oil will have serious implications \nfor the United States and for oil prices and supplies at home.\n  Fully one-quarter of the U.S. trade deficit today--those of us like \nmy colleague from Oklahoma who is here today, who is concerned about \nthe growing deficits that we have in America today, understand that \none-quarter of the U.S. trade deficits are associated with oil imports. \nThe problem that we face for sure is due in part to dwindling resources \nin America. Domestic reserves of oil and natural gas are declining \nalthough our demand continues to grow. However, the reality is that \nthere has been a deliberate unwillingness to address this problem in \nAmerica.\n  As proof, the average American vehicle gets fewer miles per gallon \ntoday than it did in 1988. That is right. Even though transportation \nfuels represent about two-thirds of our demand for petroleum products, \nour current fuel economy is worse today than it was 17 years ago. \nAccording to EPA estimates, back in 1988 passenger vehicles in America \nhad an average fuel economy of 26 miles per gallon. Today, in the midst \nof this national crisis, we have 50 million more passenger vehicles on \nthe road and the average fuel economy has declined to less than 24 \nmiles per gallon. That is going in the wrong direction. How is it \npossible that the world's biggest economy with the world's best \nscientists and engineers, we, the United States of America, are doing \nworse today on fuel economy than we were 17 years ago?\n\n  We find ourselves in this mess because we have not taken our energy \nconsumption problem seriously. Since most of the known oil reserves lie \nin one specific region of the world, the Middle East, our addiction to \nforeign oil means that we will continue to be held hostage to the whims \nof despotic or increasingly unstable regimes. Ominously, the money we \npay today for foreign oil helps pay for the activities of extremists \nand terrorists around the world who hate the United States and the West \nin general. We only need to recall the horrors of 9/11 to know how real \nthat hatred is.\n  Even worse, the money pit grows deeper because we as a world consume \nmore oil and that oil becomes more expensive and the money that keeps \nsome of these regimes in place gets more concentrated in the hands of \nthese few countries. So, yes, America is held hostage and in a tighter \nand tighter grip.\n  There is only one way for us to fix this. America must stop the \nrhetoric, and we must embrace a true imperative of energy independence.\n  I wish to say a word about the work of this body, this Congress, in \nthe last year with the Energy Policy Act of 2005. I wish to say two \nthings about that legislation. It was the first time in 13 years that \nany significant energy legislation came out of Washington, DC, again, \ndemonstrating the malignant neglect. There are two important lessons we \nshould take from the act. The first is it was a good template of \nbipartisan cooperation. In this body, with more than 80 votes, \nRepublicans and Democrats coming together saying we need to embrace a \nnew National Energy Policy Act, we are making a statement that this is \nan important issue for the American people. We ought to find more \nplaces where the American people can get that kind of\n\n[[Page S12775]]\n\nbipartisan action on the part of the Senate, the Congress.\n  Second, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 did some good things in making \nus move forward toward energy independence. It embraced an ethic of \nenergy conservation, of which all of us should be proud, and included \nin that are efficiency standards for the 14 appliances that are most \ncommonly used in our homes. That is an important step for the United \nStates of America to take because we know from the experts at the \nDepartment of Energy that we currently waste about 62 percent of the \nenergy we consume.\n  Second, the 2005 Energy Policy Act also took some major steps forward \nwith regard to renewable energy. We embraced an ethic that said we can \nstart growing our way toward energy independence. We increased the \namount of ethanol that will be produced in America so we will have 7.5 \nbillion gallons of ethanol being produced by 2012. That is only 5 years \naway. That will be very helpful to us as we move toward energy \nindependence.\n  Third, the new technologies that were embraced in this law are \nimportant. When we look at the possibility of coal gasification, we \nknow the huge reserves we have in America can be used in a way to help \nus fill up that menu board that we must fill up if we are going to find \nour way toward energy independence.\n  Finally, there are approaches in the legislation that will help us \nwith the balanced development of our current natural resources, \nincluding the appropriate development of oil shale within my State of \nColorado.\n  While I have been a fan of our 2005 legislation, I believe there is \nmore that we must do to set America free from the overdependence on \nforeign oil. We need to do more. There is a hard winter ahead for many \nAmericans. Gas prices remain very high. Diesel prices remain even \nhigher. This directly affects the pocketbooks of people across America.\n  In Colorado, as across the Nation, high fuel prices affect everyone, \nand they also hit our agricultural producers and perhaps hit them the \nhardest. Farming and ranching equipment uses diesel fuel. When you have \nto tend to hundreds of acres, you use a lot of it.\n  Americans are in for a one-two punch on energy prices this winter \nbecause home heating prices are going to be high as well. The cost of \nnatural gas is at an unprecedented level and, similar to the high \nprices at the pump, the resulting high heating costs will affect every \nAmerican. We should take action.\n  Back in August I remember traveling around in places where I saw gas \nprices hit $3 for the first time around. Yet through the ravages of \nKatrina and Rita and the escalation of gas prices over the last several \nmonths, we in Congress have had a few hearings but we have not taken \naction to deal more effectively with the crisis at hand. We must do \nmore. We must begin now. I suggest we start in the following three \nways.\n  First, we should embrace a national price-gouging law. That is a law \nwhich was discussed by Senator Bingaman and Senator Stevens in a \nhearing that was held in the Senate last week. The oil companies should \nhave nothing to be afraid of with respect to price gouging because they \nsay they have not engaged in price gouging. But we need to have a \ndefinition of what price gouging is so in the future we can make the \ndeterminations as to whether price gouging has occurred on the backs of \nthe American people. We ought to be able to pass a price-gouging law in \nAmerica today.\n\n  Second, we need to immediately embrace conservation emergency efforts \nfor the year 2005 and for this winter. The years of malignant neglect \nhave suddenly caught up with all of us, and we need to conserve energy \nfor this winter. I believe we need to pass an Emergency Energy \nConservation Act of 2005. I have promoted a number of proposals on the \nfloor of the Senate, as have several of my colleagues. On the House \nside, the story is the same. There are many good ideas available to \nthis Congress that will encourage conservation. But we do not have time \nto wait. We need to act now, before the cold days of winter are upon \nus.\n  Finally, we need to continue to put the spotlight on the \npossibilities and opportunities of renewable energy. Today, the nation \nof Brazil produces about half of its energy supply from renewable \nenergy. They have truly embraced and achieved a goal of energy \nindependence. If Brazil and other countries that are less prosperous, \nThird World countries, can in fact achieve energy independence by \nlooking at renewable fuels, why can't we in the United States do the \nsame? I believe we can. More production of renewable fuels combined \nwith more development of wind, solar, biomass, and other renewable \nresources will move the United States closer to energy independence. At \nthe same time, renewable energy production will directly benefit those \nagricultural and rural communities hardest hit by high energy prices. \nHarvesting renewable energy from our Nation's farmlands and wide open \nspaces is perhaps the most important opportunity to come to rural \nAmerica in the last 50 years.\n  A group called the Energy Future Coalition, composed of leading \nconservatives and leading progressives--from across the political \nspectrum--is working toward harvesting 25 percent of America's energy \ndemands by the year 2025. I believe we can do even better than that, \nand there are experts within the Department of Energy who believe that \nwe can do that.\n  There is a lot of work ahead of us as we deal with what I believe is \none of the two most important domestic issues that face America and \nthat is energy and how we get to energy independence. It ought to be at \nthe forefront of the work of this Senate and this Congress.\n  In conclusion, this country has an Energy bill and it is a good first \nstep. However, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 does not do enough to \nprepare America for the future. The events of the last several months \nprove that. We can do better with a more comprehensive long-term energy \npolicy that hammers home on two simple points: energy efficiency and \ndeveloping renewable resources. America can do better. America deserves \nbetter. America can do better with true deeds that move us to energy \nindependence, with deeds that transcend the rhetoric of Washington and \nthe stalemate of Washington for the last 30 years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today because, as I \ntravel around Oklahoma, one of the things I find is a lack of \nrecognition of the war we are in, why we are there, what the problems \nare associated with it. Every one of us has a heavy heart for the fact \nthat we now have troops committed and dying and sacrificing every day \nin the war on terrorism.\n  As I thought about what to say to my constituents in Oklahoma but \nalso to the American people, I found that I could not say it as well as \nretired MG Vernon Chong of the U.S. Air Force. I wish to read, for a \nfew moments, a commentary he has written, dated October 1, 2005. If you \nwould indulge me to read that, I think it will give us some \nenlightenment to where we are. He says:\n\n       To get out of a difficulty, one usually must go through it. \n     Our country is now facing the most serious threat to its \n     existence, as we know it, that we have faced in your lifetime \n     and mine (which includes WWII).\n       The deadly seriousness is greatly compounded by the fact \n     that there are very few of us who think we can possibly lose \n     this war, and even fewer who realize what losing really \n     means.\n       First, let's examine a few basics. When did the threat to \n     us start? Many will say September 11, 2001. The answer, as \n     far as the United States is concerned, is 1979--22 years \n     prior to September 2001--with the following attacks on us:\n       Iran Embassy Hostages, 1979; Beirut, Lebanon, Embassy, \n     1983; Beirut, Lebanon, Marine Barracks, 1983; Lockerbie, \n     Scotland, Pan-Am flight to New York, 1988; First New York \n     World Trade Center attack, 1993; Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, \n     Khobar Towers Military complex, 1996; Nairobi, Kenya, U.S. \n     Embassy, 1998; Dares Salaam, Tanzania, U.S. Embassy, 1998; \n     Aden, Yeman, USS Cole, 2000; New York, World Trade Center, \n     2001; Pentagon, 2001; and Shanksville, Pennsylvania, Plane \n     Crash, 2001\n       Why were we attacked: Envy of our position, our success, \n     and our freedoms. The attacks happened during the \n     administration of Presidents Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, \n     and Bush. We cannot fault either the Republicans or \n     Democrats, as there were no provocations by any of the \n     Presidents or their immediate predecessors, Presidents Ford \n     or Carter.\n\n[[Page S12776]]\n\n       Who were the attackers? In each case, the attacks on the \n     U.S. were carried out by Muslins. What is the Muslim \n     population of the World? Twenty-five percent. Isn't the \n     Muslin Religion peaceful? Hopefully, but that is really not \n     material. There is no doubt that the predominantly Christian \n     population of Germany was peaceful, but under the dictatorial \n     leadership of Hitler (who was also Christian), that made no \n     difference. You either went along with the administration, or \n     you were eliminated.\n       Although Hitler kept the world focused on the Jews, he had \n     no hesitancy about killing anyone who got in his way of \n     exterminating the Jews, or of taking over the world--German, \n     Christian, or any others.\n       Same with the Muslim terrorists. They focus the attention \n     of the world on the U.S., but kill all in the way--their own \n     people, or the Spanish, French, or anyone else. The point \n     here, is that just like the peaceful Germans were of no \n     protection to anyone from the Nazis, no matter how many \n     peaceful Muslins there may be, they are no protection for us \n     from the terrorist Muslim leaders, and what they are \n     fanatically bent on doing--by their own pronouncements--\n     killing all of us ``infidels.'' I don't blame the peaceful \n     Muslins. What would you do--if the choice was shut up, or \n     die?\n       So who are we at war with? There is no way we can honestly \n     respond that it is anyone other than the Muslim terrorists. \n     Trying to be politically correct, and avoid verbalizing this \n     conclusion can well be fatal. There is no way to win, if you \n     don't clearly recognize, and articulate who you are fighting.\n       So with that background, now to the two major questions: \n     Can we lost this war? What does losing really mean? If we are \n     to win, we must clearly answer these two pivotal questions.\n       We can definitely lose this war, and as anomalous as it may \n     sound, the major reason we can lose is that so many of us \n     simply do not fathom the answer to the second question--\n     ``What does losing mean?''\n       It would appear that a great many of us think that losing \n     the war means hanging our heads, bringing the troops home, \n     and going on about our business, like post-Vietnam. This is \n     as far from the truth as one can get. What losing really \n     means is: We would no longer be the premier country in the \n     world. The attacks will not subside, but rather will steadily \n     increase. Remember, they want us dead, not just quiet. If \n     they had just wanted us quiet, they would not have produced \n     an increasing series of attacks against us, over the past 18 \n     years. The plan was clearly, for terrorists to attack us, \n     until we were neutered, and submissive to them.\n       We would, of course, have no future support from other \n     nations, for fear of reprisals, and for the reason that they \n     would see that we are impotent, and cannot help them.\n       They will pick off the other non-Muslim nations, one at a \n     time. It will be increasingly easier for them. They already \n     hold Spain hostage. It doesn't matter whether it was right or \n     wrong for Spain to withdraw its troops from Iraq. Spain did \n     it because the Muslim terrorists bombed their train, and told \n     them to withdraw the troops. Anything else they want Spain to \n     do, will be done.\n       The next will probably be France. Our one hope on France is \n     that they might see the light and realize that if we don't \n     win, they are finished too, in that they can't resist the \n     Muslim terrorists without us. However, it may already be too \n     late for France.\n       If we lose the war, our production, income, exports, and \n     way of life will all vanish, as we know it. After losing, who \n     would trade or deal with us, if they are threatened by the \n     Muslims?\n       If we can't stop the Muslims, how could anyone else?\n       The Muslims [Islamo-fascists] fully know what is riding on \n     this war, and therefore, are completely committed to winning, \n     at any cost. We better know it too, and be likewise committed \n     to winning at any cost.\n       Why do I go on at such lengths about the results of losing? \n     Simple. Until we recognize the costs of losing, we cannot \n     unite, and really put 100 percent of our thoughts and efforts \n     into winning. And, it is going to take that 100 percent \n     effort to win.\n       So, how can we lose the war?\n       Again, the answer is simple. We can lose the war by \n     ``imploding.'' That is, defeating ourselves, by refusing to \n     recognize the enemy and their purpose, and really digging in \n     and lending full support to the war effort. If we are united, \n     there is no way that we can lose. If we continue to be \n     divided, there is no way that we can win!\n       Let me give you a few examples of how we simply don't \n     comprehend the life-and-death seriousness of this situation.\n       President Bush selects Norman Mineta as Secretary of \n     Transportation. Although all of the terrorist attacks were \n     committed by Muslim men between 17 and 40 years of age, \n     Secretary Mineta refuses to allow profiling. Does that sound \n     like we are taking this thing seriously?\n       This is war! For the duration, we are going to have to give \n     up some of the civil rights we have become accustomed to. We \n     had better be prepared to lose some of our civil rights \n     temporarily, or we will most certainly lose all of them, \n     permanently.\n       And, don't worry that it is a slippery slope. We gave up \n     plenty of civil rights during WWII, and immediately restored \n     them after the victory, and in fact, added many more since \n     then.\n       Do I blame President Bush or President Clinton before him?\n       No, I blame us for blithely assuming we can maintain all of \n     our Political Correctness, and all of our civil rights during \n     this conflict, and have a clean, lawful, honorable war. None \n     of those words apply to war. Get them out of your head.\n       Some have gone so far in their criticism of the war and/or \n     the Administration that it almost seems they would literally \n     like to see us lose. I hasten to add that this isn't because \n     they are disloyal. It is because they don't recognize what \n     losing means. Nevertheless, that conduct gives the impression \n     to the enemy that we are divided and weakening. It concerns \n     our friends, and it does great damage to our cause.\n       Of more recent vintage, the uproar fueled the politicians \n     and media regarding the treatment of some prisoners of war, \n     perhaps exemplifies best what I am saying.\n       We have recently had an issue, involving the treatment of a \n     few Muslim prisoners of war, by a small group of our military \n     police.\n\n  By the way, all of those have gone to trial or are going to trial, \nand will be punished.\n\n  Again, these are MG Chong's words:\n\n       These are the type of prisoners, who just a few months ago, \n     were throwing their own people off buildings, cutting off \n     their hands, cutting out their tongues, and otherwise \n     murdering their own people, just for disagreeing with Saddam \n     Hussein.\n       And just a few years ago, these same types of prisoners \n     chemically killed 400,000 of their own people for the same \n     reason. They are also the same type of enemy fighters who \n     recently were burning Americans, and dragging their charred \n     corpses through the streets of Iraq.\n       And still more recently, the same type of enemy that was, \n     and is, providing videos to all news sources internationally, \n     of the beheading of American prisoners they held.\n       Compare this with some of our press and politicians, who, \n     for several days, have thought and talked about nothing else \n     but the ``humiliating'' of some Muslim prisoners--not burning \n     them, not dragging their charred corpses through the streets, \n     not beheading them, but ``humiliating'' them.\n        Can this be for real?\n       If this doesn't show the complete lack of comprehension and \n     understanding of the seriousness of the enemy we are \n     fighting, the life and death struggle we are in, and the \n     disastrous results of losing this war, nothing can.\n       To bring our country to a virtual political standstill over \n     this prisoner issue makes us look like Nero playing his \n     fiddle, as Rome burned--totally oblivious to what is going on \n     in the real world. Neither we, nor any other country, can \n     survive this internal strife.\n       Again I say, this does not mean that some of our \n     politicians or media people are disloyal. It simply means \n     that they are absolutely oblivious to the magnitude of the \n     situation we are in, and into which the Muslim terrorists \n     have been pushing us, for many years.\n       Remember, the Muslim terrorists' stated goal is to kill all \n     infidels! That translates into all non-Muslims--not just in \n     the United States, but throughout the world.\n       We are the last bastion of defense.\n       We have been criticized, for many years, as being \n     ``arrogant.'' That charge is valid, in at least one respect. \n     We are arrogant in that we believe that we are so good, \n     powerful, and smart; that we can win the hearts and minds of \n     all those who attack us; and that with both hands tied behind \n     our back, we can defeat anything bad in the world.\n       We can't.\n       If we don't recognize this, our Nation as we know it, will \n     not survive, and no other free country in the world will \n     survive, if we are defeated.\n       And finally, name any Muslim countries throughout the world \n     that allow freedom of speech, freedom of thought, freedom of \n     religion, freedom of the press, equal rights for anyone--let \n     alone everyone, equal status, or any status for women.\n       This has been a long way of saying that we must be united \n     on this war, or we will be equated in the history books to \n     the self-inflicted fall of the Roman Empire. If, that is, the \n     Muslim leaders will allow history books to be written, or \n     read.\n       Democracies don't have their freedoms taken away from them \n     by some external military force. Instead, they give their \n     freedoms away, politically correct piece by politically \n     correct piece.\n       And, they are giving those freedoms away to those who have \n     shown, worldwide, that they abhor freedom, and will not apply \n     it to you, or even to themselves, once they are in power.\n       They have universally shown that when they have taken over, \n     they then start brutally killing each other, over who will be \n     the few who control the masses. Will we ever stop hearing \n     from the politically correct, about the ``peaceful Muslims''?\n       I close on a hopeful note, by repeating what I said above. \n     If we are united, there is no way that we can lose. I hope \n     the factions in our country will begin to focus on the \n     critical situation we are in, and will unite to save our \n     country. It is your future we are talking about! Do whatever \n     you can to preserve it.\n       After reading the above, we all must do this not only for \n     ourselves, but our children, our grandchildren, our country, \n     and the World.\n       Whether Democrat or Republican, conservative or liberal, \n     and that includes the politicians and media of our country, \n     and the free World!\n\n\n[[Page S12777]]\n\n\n  Those are the words of retired MG Vernon Chong, U.S. Air Force.\n  I think it brings to mind the very important facts that face us \ntoday. We are at war. The war is real. The threats to our country and \nto our freedom are real. We must come together as a nation and \nrecognize this threat, or we stand to lose the very principles, the \nvery freedom, we each cherish so much.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/15/senate-section/article/S12777-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 1042, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1042) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2006 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed \n     Forces, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Graham amendment No. 2515, relating to the review of the \n     status of detainees of the United States Government.\n       Warner/Frist amendment No. 2518, to clarify and recommend \n     changes to the policy of the United States on Iraq and to \n     require reports on certain matters relating to Iraq.\n       Levin amendment No. 2519, to clarify and recommend changes \n     to the policy of the United States on Iraq and to require \n     reports on certain matters relating to Iraq.\n       Bingaman amendment No. 2523 (to amendment No. 2515), to \n     provide for judicial review of detention of enemy combatants.\n       Graham amendment No. 2524 (to amendment No. 2515), in the \n     nature of a substitute.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There will be 30 minutes for debate \nequally divided between the bill's managers.\n  The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first, I advise the Senate that last night \nfor a period of 2 hours we had a very thorough debate on amendments of \nmy distinguished colleague from Michigan and amendments that I put in \nwith our distinguished leader, Mr. Frist, and I believe cosponsors of \nSenator Levin, and we were joined by another colleague, Senator \nLieberman. Of course, Senators don't have access to that Record yet. \nBut I assure you the merits of both cases were thoroughly stated.\n  As we have 30 minutes divided between the two of us this morning, my \ndistinguished friend and I talked this morning, and he expressed an \ninterest in having his amendment voted first. As a matter of comity and \ncourtesy, we offer that to the Senator from Michigan. If that is his \ndesire, I ask unanimous consent that be the order in which votes be \ntaken.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, that would be acceptable, indeed, and I \nthink preferable from every perspective. It is our understanding there \nis a suggestion to that effect from the Republican side. Whether it is \nfrom the Republican side or our side, I think it is wise. I accept the \nsuggestion and do so with thanks to my good friend from Virginia.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, to inform the Senate, there are two \namendments. Basically, as we will explain momentarily, the amendments \nare almost identical except in three areas. They are important areas, \nand we will go into that in some detail here in a moment.\n  The Levin amendment will go first, and ours will go second. There \nwill be votes on both amendments.\n  We had the option to draw up an entirely different amendment, to go \ninto many ramifications and many issues that we feel very strongly \nabout on this side of the aisle. I take the responsibility. Or if \nanyone wishes to share it with me, they may well do so. I felt that it \nis so critical at this point in history with regard to the United \nStates policy towards Iraq, together with our coalition forces, that \nthe extent to which the Senate could speak with one voice had great \nmerit. Therefore, essentially on this side we looked at the amendment \nof the Senator from Michigan and made, in my judgment, several minor \nmodifications and one very significant modification. That is the \nstanding.\n  As Senators vote, they will note the similarity between these \namendments. But I felt the Senator from Michigan and I have a very \nstrong feeling that the basic purpose of these amendments--whichever \none is voted and survives--is to send the strongest possible message to \nthe Iraqi people, the new government that will be formed subsequent to \nDecember 15, that our country, together with our coalition partners, \nhas made enormous efforts, enormous sacrifice of life and limb, \ncontributions by the people not only from our country but a number of \nother countries, to let them establish for themselves a form of \ndemocracy.\n  I believe we have made great progress with several transitional \ngovernments, a referendum vote, and now on the verge of what I \nperceive--and I think the Senator from Michigan shares the view--of an \neven stronger and larger vote to elect the permanent government.\n  The next 120 days, in my judgment, are critical--absolutely critical. \nEvery word that comes from the Congress of the United States will be \ncarefully scrutinized not only by the Iraqi people but by the nations \nthroughout the Middle East and indeed our coalition partners. We have \nto be extremely careful in the formulation of those words and messages \nso they are not misconstrued.\n  I feel, with all due respect to the amendment originally drawn by my \ncolleague from Michigan and others, that the last paragraph phrases a \ntimetable of withdrawal requiring the President to file a report every \n90 days giving specific dates and other factors.\n  That is the major change between these two amendments. The amendment \nof the Senator from Virginia strikes that last paragraph. I will go \ninto further detail momentarily as to exactly why. We made the effort \nto have a bipartisan amendment. It is forward-looking.\n\n  Again, it is my intention to have the amendment on this side of the \naisle not contain any language that could be misconstrued as a \ntimetable which could establish and set up a fragile situation, \nparticularly on the eve of another election on December 15.\n  I thank my distinguished colleague from Michigan. I commend him for \nmuch of the language he included in the amendment. I was privileged to \ndraw on it. However, it sends that message on which we have absolute \nunity to the Iraqi people: We mean business. We have done our share. \nNow the challenge is up to you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield myself 1 minute, and then I will yield to Senator \nKennedy.\n  I thank the Senator from Virginia for his words. There is no \ntimetable for withdrawal in the last paragraph. I, like him, urge \nMembers to read that paragraph. It simply says that the same type of \nschedule which we all agreed to in paragraph 6 should also be proposed \nwith an estimated schedule relative to phased withdrawal if--if--the \nconditions which we all agree upon should be set forth in the report \nhave been achieved.\n  That is what it does. That is an important message. It is not a \nwithdrawal timetable in paragraph 7, but each Member will reach their \nown conclusion on that. It sends an important message, but it is not \nthe one the Senator from Virginia has characterized.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his strong \nleadership.\n  I strongly support the Levin-Biden-Reid amendment on Iraq. Our \namendment expresses the clear sense of the Senate that the U.S. \nmilitary forces should not stay in Iraq indefinitely. Although many \ndisagree with the President about the war, we all honor the service and \nsacrifice and heroism of our brave men and women in Iraq. Our Armed \nForces are serving courageously in Iraq, under enormously difficult \ncircumstances. The policy of our Government must be worthy of their \nsacrifice. Unfortunately, it is not. The American people know it.\n\n[[Page S12778]]\n\n  An open-ended commitment in Iraq is not in America's interests, and \nit is not in Iraq's interests, either. Our amendment clearly states \nthat the commitment of our military is not open-ended. The goal of our \nmilitary should be to establish a legitimate functioning government, \nnot to dictate to it. If we want the new Iraqi government to succeed, \nwe need to give Iraq back to the Iraqi people. We need to let Iraq make \nits own political decisions without American interference. We need to \ntrain the Iraqi security forces, but we also need to reduce our \nmilitary presence.\n  There is widespread recognition that our overwhelming military \npresence is inflaming the insurgency. After the election of a permanent \nIraqi government, we should begin a substantial and continuing drawdown \nof U.S. forces. If additional forces are necessary during our drawdown \nor when our drawdown is completed, they should have the support of the \nIraqi people and the United Nations and come from the international \ncommunity. American troops can participate, but, unlike the current \nforce, it should not consist mostly of Americans or be led by \nAmericans.\n  All nations of the world have an interest in Iraq's stability and \nterritorial integrity. Defenders of President Bush's failed stay-the-\ncourse policy pretend that alternatives such as this are a cut-and-run \nstrategy. They are not.\n  Last February, General Abizaid said what makes it hard for the United \nStates is that an overbearing presence or a larger than acceptable \nfootprint in the region works against you. No one accused him of cut \nand run.\n  Last July, GEN George Casey, commanding general of the Multi-National \nForce in Iraq, talked about fairly substantial reduction of troops in \n2006. No one has accused him of cut and run.\n\n  Just last month, America's Ambassador to Iraq said it is possible we \ncan adjust our courses, downsizing them in the course of next year. No \none has accused him of cut and run.\n  This month, Mel Laird, Secretary of Defense of the Nixon \nadministration, wrote in the current issue of the Journal of Foreign \nAffairs that our presence is what feeds the insurgency, and our gradual \nwithdrawal would feed the confidence and the ability of average Iraqis \nto stand up to the insurgency. No one has accused him of cut and run.\n  We need to have an open and honest debate about our future military \npresence in Iraq. An open-ended commitment of our military forces does \nnot serve America's best interests and does not serve Iraqi's \ninterests, either. Our current misguided policy has turned Iraq into a \nquagmire with no end in sight. It is urgent for the administration to \nadopt an honest and effective plan to end the violence and stabilize \nIraq so that our soldiers can begin to come home with dignity and \nhonor.\n  Last Friday, President Bush outlined a new bumper-sticker slogan for \nhis misguided policy in Iraq: ``Strategy for Victory.'' But it is still \nthe same failed strategy. He should have called it ``Strategy for \nQuagmire.''\n  Our men and women in uniform deserve better, much better from this \nPresident. So does the Nation. We can do better. I urge my colleagues \nto support the Levin-Biden-Reid amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n\nAmendments Nos. 1345, 1354, 1468, as Modified; 1500, as Modified; 1518, \n  1522, as Modified; 1538, 1898, 1902, 2525, 2526, 2527, 2528, 2529, \n2530, 2531, 2532, 2533, 2534, 2535, 2536, 2537, 2538, 2539, 2540, 2541, \n2542, 2543, 2544, 2545, 2546, 2547, 2548, 2549, 2550, 2551, 2552, 2553, \n2554, 2555, 2556, 2557, 2558, 2559, 2560, 2561, 2562, 2563, 2564, 2565, \n2566, 2567, 2568, 2569, 2570, 2571, 2572, 2573, 2574, 2575, 2576, 2577, \n                          2578, 2579, en bloc\n\n  Mr. WARNER. At this juncture, the distinguished Senator from Michigan \nand I would like to offer our managers' package to this bill. I send a \nmanagers' package of some 64 amendments to the desk. They have been \ncleared by both sides.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The amendments have been cleared on our side.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate consider the \namendments en bloc, the amendments en bloc be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements relating to any \nof these individual amendments be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The United States Trade \n     Representative should consult with our trading partners \n     regarding any trade dispute with China.\n       (C) Actions to encourage United States diplomatic efforts \n     to identify and pursue initiatives to revitalize United \n     States engagement in East Asia. The initiatives should have a \n     regional focus and complement bilateral efforts. The Asia-\n     Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) offers a ready \n     mechanism for pursuit of such initiatives.\n       (D) Actions by the administration to work with China to \n     prevent proliferation of prohibited technologies and to \n     secure China's agreement to renew efforts to curtail North \n     Korea's commercial export of ballistic missiles.\n\n[[Page S12783]]\n\n       (E) Actions by the Secretaries of State and Energy to \n     consult with the International Energy Agency with the \n     objective of upgrading the current loose experience-sharing \n     arrangement whereby China engages in some limited exchanges \n     with the organization, to a more structured arrangement.\n       (F) Actions by the administration to develop a coordinated, \n     comprehensive national policy and strategy designed to \n     maintain United States scientific and technological \n     leadership and competitiveness, in light of the rise of China \n     and the challenges of globalization.\n       (G) Actions to review laws and regulations governing the \n     Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), \n     including exploring whether the definition of national \n     security should include the potential impact on national \n     economic security as a criterion to be reviewed, and whether \n     the chairmanship of CFIUS should be transferred from the \n     Secretary of the Treasury to a more appropriate executive \n     branch agency.\n       (H) Actions by the President and the Secretaries of State \n     and Defense to press strongly their European Union \n     counterparts to maintain the EU arms embargo on China.\n       (I) Actions by the administration to discourage foreign \n     defense contractors from selling sensitive military use \n     technology or weapons systems to China.

Movements abroad from established \n     bases into new locations, or into locations already in use \n     that will be put under pressure by increases in populations, \n     will impact on living conditions.''\n       (6) The Overseas Basing Commission notes that the four most \n     critical elements of quality of life as they relate to \n     restructuring of the global defense posture are housing, \n     military child education, healthcare, and service member and \n     family services.\n       (7) The Overseas Basing Commission recommended that \n     ``planners must take a `last day-first day' approach to the \n     movement of units and families from one location to \n     another'', meaning that they must maintain the support \n     infrastructure for personnel until the last day they are in \n     place and must have the support infrastructure in place on \n     the first day troops arrive in the new location.\n       (8) The Overseas Basing Commission further recommended that \n     it is ``imperative that the `last day-first day' approach \n     should be taken whether the movement is abroad from one \n     locale to another, from overseas to the United States, or \n     from one base in CONUS [the continental United States] to yet \n     another as a result of base realignment and closures''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the Secretary of Defense should not transfer any unit from a \n     military installation closed or realigned due to the \n     relocation of forces under the Integrated Global Presence and \n     Basing Strategy or the 2005 round of defense base closure and \n     realignment until adequate facilities and infrastructure \n     necessary to support the unit's mission and quality of life \n     requirements for military families are ready for use at the \n     receiving location.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2555\n\n    (Purpose: To extend the period for which certain individuals in \nfamilies that include members of the Reserve and National Guard do not \n   have to reapply for supplemental security income benefits after a \n               period of ineligibility for such benefits)\n\n       In title VI, subtitle E, at the end, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of an amendment \nto the Defense Authorization Act of 2006, introduced by Senator Warner \nalong with Senator Levin and myself, which would authorize emergency \nsupplemental appropriations for the Department of Defense for domestic \nhurricane relief and avian flu preparedness. At my request, this \namendment also includes $40 million in relief assistance for the people \naffected by the devastating earthquake that struck northern Pakistan, \nIndia, and Afghanistan on October 8, 2005. It would also require the \nSecretary to submit a report to Congress describing the Department of \nDefense's humanitarian efforts in the region and assessing the need for \nfurther reconstruction and relief assistance. Although I fully support \nthe $40 million authorized in this amendment, I believe the DOD \nassessment will reveal the need for a substantial increase\n\n[[Page S12792]]\n\nin assistance for the approximately 3 million people left homeless by \nthis earthquake.\n  Initial reports of this disaster described the situation as critical, \nwith over 30,000 people estimated dead and 1 million people in \ndesperate need of assistance. It is my understanding that, based on \nthese initial estimates, USAID has spent approximately $50 million of \nthe $156 million that the United States pledged in humanitarian \nassistance to South Asia. In addition, the U.S. military has been \nallocated $56 million of this pledge to support logistical and other \nmilitary relief efforts, and $50 million of this has already been \nspent. As of November 9, the Department of Defense had more than 900 \npersonnel providing relief and reconstruction support. DOD has flown \nmore than 1,100 helicopter missions delivering 2,700 tons of relief \nsupplies and evacuated over 8,200 casualties from the affected area. In \naddition, the 212th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital has established a \nunit in Pakistan and has 36 intensive care unit beds, 60 intermediate \nminimal care beds, and 2 operating rooms. This unit has performed \nvaliantly, having completed more than 100 surgeries and treated 1,200 \nnonsurgical patients.\n  While I fully support these efforts, it has become clear that this \ndisaster is much larger than what was first assumed. The United Nations \nis now reporting that ``the unfolding picture reveals levels of human \nand economic devastation unprecedented in the history of the \nsubcontinent.'' In Pakistan alone, approximately 80,000 people have \ndied, half of whom were children. Nearly the same amount of people are \ninjured, with both numbers expected to rise. This region is home to 5 \nmillion people scattered across this mountainous area, and with a harsh \nwinter quickly approaching, the situation has the potential to become \nmuch worse.\n  The earthquake destroyed most hospitals, schools, and government \nbuildings, and hundreds of towns and villages in the region have been \ncompletely wiped out. Most roads and bridges have been completely \ndestroyed, and the 900 aftershocks have blocked the remaining roads by \nlandslides. Tens of thousands of people are still completely cut off \nfrom any form of assistance. According to the United Nations, over 2 \nmillion people require life-saving assistance, including basic \nnecessities like food, water, and medicine. In addition, approximately \n3 million people lack adequate shelter at a time when temperatures are \nconsistently below freezing and growing colder. There is now growing \nconcern that the death toll could quickly double if increased aid is \nnot provided immediately.\n  The U.N. has increased its appeal for aid to $550 million for the \nnext 6 months of operations, and it is estimated that disaster relief \nand reconstruction may cost up to $6 billion over the long term. In the \nnear term however, I believe it is critical that we do all we can \nbefore the Thanksgiving recess to help these people as they struggle \nthrough the winter months. It is also important that if we are truly \ncommitted to changing how the United States is perceived in a region \nwhich is predominantly rural, poor, and Muslim, we must be willing to \ndemonstrate America's compassion and generosity in this time of urgent \nneed. To this end, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2577\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, for the past several years the Senate has \nbeen very engaged in producing a comprehensive energy policy. This \nsummer we took a positive step forward passing the first Energy bill in \nmore than 14 years.\n  It is my hope that this Energy bill will expand domestic supply, \nencourage alternative sources, and help reduce our overall demand for \nenergy. Alternative energy sources will continually play a larger role \nin the Nation's future and I believe wind power is a part of that \nsolution.\n  The Energy bill shifted the inadequate permitting process for \nalternative energy production on outer continental shelf lands from the \nArmy Corps of Engineers to the Department of Interior's Minerals \nManagement Service. Given the Minerals Management Service's experience \nwith permitting offshore oil and gas leases, the inclusion of \nalternative energy production such as windmills is a natural fit. Now \nthe permitting of wind farms, whether on or off shore, follows a strong \npermitting process with input from the local, State, and Federal \nGovernments.\n  However, as windmills become a more prevalent part of the Nation's \nenergy landscape, we must be fully aware of the effects these \nfacilities may have on other aspects of the country's well being.\n  I have been prompted to look into this based upon the experiences of \nthe United Kingdom, which has studied in detail the potential adverse \neffects of wind turbines on their radar abilities. The UK Ministry of \nDefence is now a part of the permitting process for potential wind \nfarms in that country and some of these findings are currently being \nshared with our own Department of Defense. However, we need more study.\n  Today I offer an amendment to provide a study regarding the effects \nof wind turbines on military readiness, including an assessment of the \neffects such farms may have on military radar. My amendment also \nrequires the report to include an assessment of technologies that could \nmitigate any adverse effects wind projects could have on military \noperations. As the entire world continues the development of \nalternative sources of energy, it is imperative that the Department of \nDefense and the Congress understand the effects that those energy \nsources may have on the military's ability to do its job.\n  Whether it is a wind farm in the middle of the Arizona desert, \nseveral miles off the Alaska Coast, or set along the shore of South \nAfrica, this Nation's military simply must be able to adequately deal \nwith the potential effects.\n  I thank the Senate for agreeing to include this study in the Defense \nAuthorization bill and look forward to its findings.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1345\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, competitive sourcing is the process by \nwhich the Federal Government conducts a competition to compare the cost \nof obtaining a needed commercial service from a private sector \ncontractor rather than from Federal employees. Properly conducted, \ncompetitive sourcing can be an effective tool to achieve cost savings. \nPoorly utilized, however, it can increase costs and hurt the morale of \nthe Federal workforce.\n  The current guidelines under which agencies conduct these \ncompetitions are contained in the Office of Management and Budget's \nCircular A-76. To ensure that we maximize the benefit and minimize the \ncost of competitive sourcing, A-76 competitions must be conducted in a \ncarefully crafted manner. The rules under which they take place must be \nfair, objective, transparent, and efficient. In one particular regard, \nI believe the current rules fail to meet these criteria.\n  Specifically, they do not allow Federal employees to protest the \nagency's decisions in an A-76 competition beyond the agency's own \ninternal review processes to the General Accountability Office. \nCongress has vested in the GAO the jurisdiction to hear and render \nopinions in protests of agency acquisition decisions generally. Private \nsector contractors, in contrast to Federal employees, have standing to \nprotest agency procurement decisions, including those in A-76 \ncompetitions, before GAO.\n  The current situation does not arise from any conscious policy \ndecision of Congress, GAO, or OMB. Rather, it occurs because the \nFederal statute that confers protest jurisdiction upon GAO, the \nCompetition in Contracting Act of 1984 or ``CICA'' was not drafted to \naddress the unique nature of A-76 competitions, in particular, the role \nof Federal employees in the ``Most Efficient Organization'' or ``MEO,'' \nwhich is the in-house side of these competitions. This was not \ndeliberate--this particular circumstance for protest was simply not \ncontemplated by Congress when drafting CICA.\n  Recent revisions to A-76 created the potential for GAO to review past \ndecisions by Federal courts and revisit its own opinions to see whether \nthe revisions would merit a determination that Federal employees had \ngained standing to protest adverse A-76 competition decisions. However, \na GAO protest decision indicates that GAO has concluded\n\n[[Page S12793]]\n\nit lacks the authority under CICA to hear protests from Federal \nemployees in the MEO in these competitions. As a result, corrective \nlegislation became necessary in our view.\n  The Collins-Akaka amendment addresses a very important inequity in \nour current procurement system. The amendment would ensure that Federal \nemployees have standing to protest to GAO similar to what the private \nsector enjoys. The amendment would extend GAO protest rights on behalf \nof the MEO in A-76 competitions to two individuals. The first is the \nAgency Tender Official or ``ATO.'' The ATO is the agency official who \nis responsible for developing and representing the Federal employees' \nMEO. The second is a representative chosen directly by the Federal \nemployees in the MEO for the purposes of filing a protest with GAO \nwhere the ATO does not, in the view of a majority of the MEO, fulfill \nhis or her duties in regards to a GAO protest. Our intent is to bolster \nthe A-76 process by providing a mechanism for Federal employees to seek \nredress from GAO, an entity that is well known for its fair, effective \nand expert handling of acquisition protests.\n\n\n                         Study of Nuclear Power\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as the world economy continues to develop, \npopulations and economies grow, and energy demand continues to rise, it \nis imperative that we diversify our supply of energy. Nuclear power \nprovides approximately 20 percent of our Nation's electricity needs and \nit is a clean air alternative to fossil fuels. The safety record of our \ncommercial nuclear industry is a positive story and one that we need to \nshare. In an era where resources have become increasingly scarce and \nexpensive, it is unfortunate that nuclear power hasn't seemed to be a \npart of the readily accepted solution. We have not been building \nnuclear power plants in the past 20 plus years because of environmental \nand safety concerns and this is a trend that I feel must be reversed.\n  I feel these concerns and that opposition to nuclear power are simply \na result of a lack of information. Today I offer an amendment that will \nprovide objective data for the public to see. Specifically, my \namendment calls on the Department of Energy to report to Congress on \nthe technologies for advanced nuclear power reactors and the potential \nfor safety enhancements as a result of those technologies.\n  This amendment will build on the nuclear provisions in the recently \npassed Energy bill. Specifically, the extension of Price Anderson \ninsurance, incentives for nuclear power production, and support for the \nconstruction of new nuclear reactors are positive policy developments. \nIn addition, there are several security related provisions regarding \nsecurity exercises, worker screening, and minimum facility standards \nthat will further enhance the safety and security of our nuclear \nfacilities. However, I feel there is information that would help many \nunderstand the safety record of the industry and the potential \nenhancement of that through new technology in the future.\n  I believe we must expand our nuclear power output as part of a \ncomprehensive energy policy and it is my hope that this study helps the \npublic better understand the safe and reliable contribution nuclear \npower can make.\n  I thank the Senate for including this amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Returning to the debate on the two amendments, I yield \nfrom my time 3 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Connecticut.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia. I \nrise to support the Warner amendment and to respectfully oppose the \nLevin amendment.\n  I believe something very important has happened in the last 24 hours. \nIn my opinion, the debate has grown in our country and in this city \nmuch too partisan over what is happening in Iraq. That partisanship has \nbegun to get in the way of the potential for a successful completion of \nour mission there.\n  I cite the great Senator Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan, who said: \nPolitics must end at the water's edge. Why? So that America speaks with \nmaximum authority against those who would divide and conquer us in the \nfree world. That is from an earlier chapter in history, but his words \ncry out to us.\n  Here is what the Washington Post said Saturday:\n\n       President Bush and leading congressional Democrats lobbed \n     angry charges at each other Friday in an increasingly \n     personal battle over the origins of the Iraq war. The sharp \n     tenor Friday resembled an election year campaign more than a \n     policy disagreement.\n\n  That is the danger that Vandenberg warns of. And about what? About \nprewar intelligence, almost 3 years ago--not irrelevant, not \nunimportant, but not as relevant and important as how we successfully \ncomplete our mission in Iraq, how we protect the 150,000 men and women \nfighting for us in uniform over there, how we do what the majority of \nMembers of both parties have said is so important to us--successfully \ncomplete this mission.\n  Senator Warner and Senator Levin have done something unique. Senator \nLevin worked very hard on our side to try to put together a broad \namendment that could involve as many members of the Democratic caucus \nas possible. He did something that is important: expressed support for \nthe troops, for successful completion of the mission, but quite \ncorrectly asked the administration and the Pentagon for a plan, for \nmeasurements, for the beginning of a more open and complete dialog with \nCongress.\n  He put something in there that I don't agree with that will lead me \nrespectfully to vote against the amendment. The last paragraph in the \nLevin-Reid amendment looks like a timetable for withdrawal. It may not \nbe the intention, but I fear that is the message it will send. That is \na message I fear will discourage our troops in the field, will \nencourage the terrorists, and will confuse the Iraqis.\n  Senator Warner has come along and accepted most of the Levin \namendment except primarily eliminated that last paragraph. In doing so, \nthese two leaders, Senator Levin and Senator Warner, have created a \ncontext to break through the partisanship that has begun to diminish \nAmerican public support for the war, and that means making it more \ndifficult for our troops to successfully complete the mission.\n  We set up a dialog between the Congress and the President, measuring \npoints, and hopefully the administration will respond. This is a \nstatement of trust between Senator Warner and Senator Levin. I hope it \nwill be responded to by the administration because ultimately, only \ntogether, as Vandenberg advised, will we achieve success in Iraq. And \nsuccess in Iraq means great stability in the Middle East, great freedom \nfor the people of Iraq, and a setback for the terrorists who attacked \nus on September 11 and are anxious to do so again. I thank my friends \nfor working together to get us to this point.\n  Here is my hope. The vote on the Levin amendment, I gather, will be \nfirst. I will respectfully vote against it. If it does not pass, I hope \nthere is overwhelming support for the Warner amendment. I can even \ndream that 100 Senators would vote for it. That would be the strongest \nstatement of support to our troops and the strongest statement of \nopposition to our enemy in Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. How much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 9 minutes 55 \nseconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, before my friend from Connecticut leaves, I \npoint out it is not partisanship that has caused the American people to \nleave this war; it is the incredible gap between the rhetoric of the \nadministration of the last 2 years and the reality on the ground. \nBefore we ever got into the open debate, the American people in droves \nwere leaving this not just because Americans are dying, as tragic as \nthat is, but because they do not think we have a plan.\n  What I think all Democrats and Republicans are deciding is, Tell us \nthe plan, Stan. Tell us, Mr. President, what is the plan? It is the \nfirst time this has happened.\n  The purpose of the amendment is as clear as it is critical: to \nrequire the Bush administration to lay out what we need to do to \nsucceed in Iraq. For\n\n[[Page S12794]]\n\nthe first time, our Republican colleagues have joined Democrats in \ninsisting on a clear Iraqi strategy from this administration, a \nschedule to achieve it, and real accountability.\n  Let me be clear about what the amendment does not do. It does require \nthe administration to explain in detail, in public, its plan for \nsuccess--it has not been public, and that is why the American people \nhave left this outfit--and do it with specific goals, a realistic \nschedule for achieving those goals, and the relationship between \nachieving the goals and redeploying U.S. forces. It does not set a \ndeadline for withdrawal.\n  In providing the plan, both Democrats and Republicans are saying: I \nhope the administration will start by being realistic and state \nspecifically what the mission is. Is the mission to protect every \nIraqi, or is the mission different? As the military will tell, and no \none knows better than my friends on the Committee on Armed Services, \nthe mission dictates the force structure, and the more realistic \nmission calls for less force. We have to refocus our mission on \npreserving America's fundamental interests in Iraq. What are they?\n  First, we have to ensure that Iraq does not become what it was not \nbefore the war: a haven for jihadist terrorists.\n  Second, we have to do what we can to prevent a full-blown civil war \nthat turns into regional war. I predict if there is a civil war, there \nwill be a regional war.\n  To leave Iraq a stable and a united country with representative \ngovernment, posing no threat to its neighbors, we need to proceed on \nthree tracks at the same time: a political diplomatic track, an \nassistance track, and a security track. We cannot succeed in Iraq \nwithout all three of those succeeding.\n  On the diplomatic track, nothing is more important than getting \nIraq's three main groups--Shiites, Sunnis, and Kurds--to agree to \nchanges in a constitution by next spring so that there is a consensus \nconstitution.\n  My friend, the chairman of the committee, says without a political \nsolution, we cannot do this. He is right. We need to know exactly what \nthe administration is doing to convince each community to make the \ncompromises necessary for a broad and sustainable political settlement.\n  We also need to know that the administration plans to engage the \nworld powers and regional powers in this effort, as we did in the Six \nPlus Two Plan in Afghanistan, as we did in Bosnia. Iraq's neighbors \nhave real influence with these different communities, and we need them \nto use that influence to arrive at a political settlement.\n  On the assistance track, the whole house of cards will collapse if \nIraqis have no capacity to govern themselves, and if the Iraqi people \ncannot turn on the lights, drink the water, and walk out their front \ndoors without wading into sewage.\n  So we need to know what specific steps the administration is taking \nto strengthen the capacity of Iraq's governmental ministries. We all \nknow none of them can function now--none. Not a single Iraqi ministry \nis capable of functioning. The administration rejected the British plan \nto adopt these ministries. So what is the plan? What are you going to \ndo, Mr. President, to make them able to function? How many regular \npolice do we have to keep? What are the basic law-and-order \nrequirements before we can draw down?\n  We need to stop this silliness about having trained 179,000 troops. \nStop this silliness. Tell us what the facts are and tell us the \nrelationship between the facts and our ability to draw down.\n  What is the plan to ensure that these local ministries are able to \nmove on their own and coordinate Iraqi security forces?\n  Our amendment lays this out. The fact that our Republican colleagues \nhave signed on to a very similar amendment makes it clear that all of \nus in this body are tired of not being told the facts.\n  So, Mr. President, the gap between this administration's rhetoric on \nIraq and the reality on the ground has created a huge credibility gap. \nAnd I would have never thought this: Only this President could unite \nthe Senate. He has united the Senate on a single point: What is the \nplan? That is what our amendment does.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair and I thank my colleague.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, if it is possible, \nfor 1 minute for my friend from California.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, is that an additional minute above the time \nallotted to us?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I assume that a minute comes to this side \nlikewise.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from California is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair and my friend from Delaware.\n  Mr. President, remember when Secretary Rumsfeld said he doubted the \nwar would last 6 months, and when White House Budget Director Daniels \nsaid Iraq would be an affordable endeavor, and Condoleezza Rice used \nthe imagery of a mushroom cloud to describe the threat of Iraq, and \nVice President Cheney's now famous assessment of the insurgency: ``They \nare in their last throes, if you will''? That is a quote.\n  Well, this administration has failed to lead in Iraq in a way that is \nensuring a way out of this with a successful mission.\n  Finally, the Senate is finding its voice today in both of these \nproposals in front of us. I am proud to say the Senate is standing up \nfor a change in policy. The status quo is not working. In California, \nwe have lost about 24 percent of the dead. We are suffering. Their \nfamilies are suffering. Just to say, ``stay the course, stay the \ncourse, no matter how badly it is going,'' is simply not going to help \nour troops in the field.\n  So, Mr. President, I view this day as a very important breakthrough \nfor the American people. They are being heard. The Democrats are \nhearing them. The Republicans took the very words of our resolution, \nmade a couple of changes, I think important changes, which mitigate in \nfavor of ours, but I certainly will be voting for both.\n  Thank you very much.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used her 1 minute.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on both sides?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan has 3 \nminutes 38 seconds. The Republican side has 4 minutes 18 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield a minute to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, after 2\\1/2\\ years of insurgency warfare in \nIraq, it is a stunning indictment of the Bush administration that this \nSenate has to ask for a plan. And we are asking on behalf of the \nAmerican people because their disquiet with Iraq is not a function of \npolitical bickering, it is a function of not understanding what the \nplan is because the President has not presented us with a viable, \ncoherent plan.\n  I believe an important part of that plan is the phased redeployment \nof American forces without a deadline. I believe that is being embraced \nby people around the world. Yesterday, Tony Blair spoke about the \npossibility of withdrawing British troops in 2006. Talabani, the Iraqi \nleader, spoke about it. John Reid, the Defense Secretary of Great \nBritain, talked about it.\n  I think we have to have from the administration a notion of when our \nforces will come out of Iraq or redeployed within Iraq. It is important \nnot only for Iraq, it is important for our security across the globe. \nHow can we defend ourselves in the future if we do not know if our \nforces will be freed up to respond to other crises? How can we pay for \nthese troops if we don't know when they will be coming out of Iraq? I \nthink it is important to do this and essential to any plan. I hope that \nis something we can agree on today.\n\n[[Page S12795]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 1 minute.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield a minute to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this debate today is going to be a \nsignificant debate because you are going to hear from both sides of the \naisle that we are voting for change. We will reject the status quo. We \nwill reject the President's call for blind loyalty to his policies in \nIraq because we cannot be blind to the fact that we have lost over \n17,000 American soldiers who have been killed and wounded. We cannot be \nblind to the fact that there is no plan for success in Iraq. We cannot \nbe blind to the fact that it does no favor to our troops and their \nfamilies to ignore the obvious.\n  We need new leadership and new direction. The vote today on the \nWarner amendment and the vote on the Levin amendment are both votes for \nchange. They are not votes to cut and run. Even though the Republicans \nhave done a cut-and-paste job on the Democratic amendment, both \namendments say to the administration: It is time to change the course \nfor success, to make certain that 2006 is a significant year, so that \nwe move toward a success and victory for our troops and for our Nation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's 1 minute has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I regret the term ``cut and paste'' was \nused. Senator Levin and I have worked together now for 27 years in the \nArmed Services Committee. I worked with him and told him we decided not \nto completely rewrite the amendment. This in an effort, as the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman, a member of our committee, so \neloquently stated, to reach a sense of bipartisanship at this very \ncritical time, on the eve of another and perhaps the most significant \nelection in Iraq, to show strong bipartisan support on those points on \nwhich we agree. And we agree almost on every point, with the exception \nof the last paragraph.\n  I was interested in listening to each of the debates thus far, and I \ndid not hear anyone on that side specifically reinforce this last \nparagraph, which we cannot accept, nor should the country have Congress \nsend across the airwaves of the world this message:\n\n       A campaign plan with estimated dates for the phased \n     redeployment of the United States Armed Forces from Iraq as \n     each condition is met, with the understanding that unexpected \n     contingencies may arise.\n\n  Therein is a short paragraph that could completely destabilize this \nforthcoming election on December 15, sending the wrong message. It is \nnot needed.\n  This amendment, as drawn, is a very powerful, very powerful statement \nby the Congress--hopefully, if the House adopts it, but certainly by \nthe Senate--of the need to tell the Iraqi people that we have done our \nshare, we are not going to leave them, but we expect from them equal, \nif not greater, support than they have given to this date.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment represents a significant \nchange in the course that we are on and so does the Republican \namendment. The title of both amendments is ``To clarify and recommend \nchanges to the policy of the United States on Iraq. . . .'' That is the \npurpose of my amendment. It is a purpose which is retained in the \nWarner amendment.\n  We lay out what those changes are. We agree on almost all of the \nchanges, that ``2006 should be a period of significant transition,'' \nthat there should be ``phased redeployment of United States forces.'' \nThat is on page 2. That is not paragraph 7. They accept the idea that \nwe should create the conditions for phased redeployment. They accept my \nidea and our idea that the United States ``should tell the leaders of \nall groups and political parties in Iraq that they need to make the \ncompromises necessary'' for a broad-based political settlement.\n  We need that political settlement. Our military leaders tell us, if \nthere is any chance of a military victory, you have to have a political \nsettlement. So we endorse paragraph 7. Senator Feingold read it. I have \nread it. We totally endorse it for what it says. It is not cut and run. \nIt is not a statement that we are going to withdraw on a fixed date.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will use leader time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator may use his leader \ntime.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today, Senate Democrats offer the most \nimportant amendment to this most important bill. Our amendment asks the \nBush administration to give our troops in Iraq a strategy that is \nworthy of their sacrifices and heroic service.\n  Three years ago, America invaded Iraq with the finest Armed Forces in \nthe world. Our military forces were unchallenged and unmatched, and \nthey remain so today. Unfortunately, the President and this \nadministration have not exercised the leadership our troops deserve. \nThey place our troops in harm's way without a plan for success and have \ndamaged our standing in the world.\n  It is long past time for the President, the Vice President, and the \nrest of the Bush White House to level with the American people and \npresent a winning plan and strategy for Iraq and our troops and for the \nAmerican people. They both deserve this, the troops and the American \npeople.\n  For the last 3 years, Democrats have stood with our troops and have \ntried to make certain we did everything we could to help them succeed. \nFrom the outset, we offered the administration concrete proposals that \nwould have greatly increased our prospects for success.\n  We called on the administration to put more troops on the ground, but \nthe administration rejected this call. We fought to provide more body \narmor and equipment for our troops, but the administration rejected \nthis call. We urged the administration to increase international \nparticipation to secure and rebuild Iraq, but the administration \nrejected this call. We stressed the importance of putting together a \nplan to win the peace, but the administration rejected this call.\n  Now, to remind my colleagues, it was not just the advice of Democrats \nthat the administration chose to ignore. It ignored the advice of our \nsenior generals, our friends and allies around the world, teams of \nweapons inspectors, and even senior officials in the previous Bush \nadministration.\n  The President and his team also chose to disregard the Powell \nDoctrine, which holds that military actions should be used only as a \nlast resort where there is a clear risk to national security.\n  According to this doctrine, if we do choose to fight, we should use \noverwhelming force, we should ensure that the conflict is strongly \nsupported by the American people, and we should develop a clear exit \nstrategy before we get into the conflict. That is the Powell Doctrine.\n  Before this administration took office, the Powell Doctrine was \nsupported by the previous two Presidents, our military leaders, and \ncongressional leaders from both sides of the aisle. But this \nadministration turned the Powell Doctrine upside down. They determined \nthat military action should be a first resort, not a last. When the \nrisk to our national security was not clear, they manipulated and \ncherry-picked intelligence to hype the threat. Instead of using \noverwhelming force, this administration rejected our senior military \nleaders' advice and deployed a smaller force. And as we all know, there \nwas not, and is not, an exit strategy to win the peace and bring our \ntroops home.\n  While we are determined to understand the mistakes this \nadministration made that brought us to this point, we are just as \ncommitted to finding a way forward to succeed in Iraq. Every day that \ngoes by, it becomes increasingly clear that the administration's Iraq \npolicy is adrift and rudderless. All they are offering is a bumper-\nsticker slogan: ``Stay the course.''\n  ``Staying the course'' is not a winning strategy. More than 2,050 \nsoldiers\n\n[[Page S12796]]\n\nhave died and about 16,000 have been wounded. Iraq now risks becoming \nwhat it was not before the war: a haven for international terrorists \nand, as we saw in Jordan, a new launching pad for terrorist attacks.\n  In addition, America's taxpayers have already contributed more than \n$250 billion and are spending an additional $2 billion every week this \nwar continues. In short, our troops deserve more than a slogan. They \ndeserve a real, clear strategy for completing their mission in faraway \nIraq.\n  Our amendment sets forth in the clearest terms the Democrats' view of \nwhat the President and the Iraqi people must accomplish to succeed in \nIraq and complete our mission.\n  First, it is time to see a significant transition toward full Iraqi \nsovereignty with Iraqi forces helping to create the conditions that \nwill eventually lead to the phased redeployment of U.S. Armed Forces. \nTwo thousand six should be a year we take the training wheels off the \nIraqi government and let the Iraqi people run their own country.\n  Second, the administration must tell the Iraqi people, clearly and \nunambiguously, that U.S. military forces will not stay indefinitely and \nthat Iraqis must achieve a broad-based and sustainable political \nsettlement that is essential for defeating the insurgency.\n  Third, the President must submit to the Congress and the American \npeople a plan for success in Iraq. The American people deserve to know \nthe conditions we seek to establish, the challenges we face in \nachieving these conditions, and the progress, if any, being made. As an \nexample, the administration said repeatedly that our forces can stand \ndown as Iraqi forces stand up. The American people deserve to know what \nthat means in real and clear terms. How many capable Iraqi security \nforces are needed so that we can begin phased redeployment of U.S. \nforces as our tasks are achieved? How long will it take? Is it no \nlonger acceptable that the President refuses? The answer is yes, it is \nno longer acceptable not to answer these and many other basic questions \nabout his policy in Iraq. It is not acceptable to this Member of \nCongress, and it is certainly not acceptable to our troops. Many of \nthose troops are serving their third tour of duty with no apparent end \nin sight.\n  With this amendment, Democrats are standing with our troops and the \nAmerican people, insisting that the President and the Republican-\ncontrolled Congress do their jobs. The President must be held \naccountable and tell our troops and the American people his plan for \nIraq and what additional sacrifices will be expected of our troops and \nthe American people. We must honor our troops. We must preserve our \nnational security. We must protect the American people. That is the \nleast we should expect from our Commander in Chief.\n  I am going to vote for both amendments. Understand that the \nDemocratic amendment and the Republican amendment have the same \npurpose. It is on both amendments. Purpose: To clarify and recommend \nchanges to the policy of the United States in Iraq and to require \nreports of matters relating to Iraq. That is the purpose.\n  Based on what I see here today, the Republicans have no plan and no \nend in sight. We want to change the course. We can't stay the course. I \nappreciate, though, the Republicans following the Democrats as far as \nthey have on this amendment. It is a tremendous step forward because we \nall agree--all 100 Senators, obviously--to clarify and recommend \nchanges in the policy of the United States on Iraq and to require \nreports on matters relating to Iraq. That is the purpose of both \namendments. We stand united. The Democrats stand united. We appreciate \nthe support of the Republicans in this amendment process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my understanding is that I have 2 minutes \nremaining on the 15-minute allocation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Given that we have no time to speak of before the \namendment of the Senator from South Carolina and Senator Levin, I yield \nmy 2 minutes for a matter other than the Iraqi debate, the habeas \ncorpus issue, to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2524\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from Virginia.\n  I just want to alert my colleagues to the fact that the amended \nGraham amendment, which is the subject of newspaper comment but hasn't \nbeen the subject of any hearings, apparently agreed to by Senator \nLevin, or at least with fewer objections, this amendment in its present \nform is blatant court stripping in the most confusing way possible. The \nlanguage of the amended Graham amendment says that there will be \nexclusive jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia Circuit.\n  If it means what it says, the Supreme Court of the United States \nwould not have jurisdiction. This language has not been subjected to \nany analysis or hearing. An earlier part of the amendment provides that \nno court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to consider the \napplication for writ of habeas corpus. The Supreme Court of the United \nStates, in three decisions handed down in June of last year, gave very \nsubstantial, articulated U.S. constitutional law as giving significant \nrights to the detainees to have an adjudication as to their status.\n  We have had many efforts at court stripping. Under the language of \nexclusive jurisdiction in the DC Circuit, the U.S. Supreme Court would \nnot have jurisdiction to hear the Hamdan case which came into sharp \nfocus because Chief Justice Roberts was on the panel there.\n  This is a sophisticated, blatant attempt at court stripping. It ought \nto be rejected, and we ought to have an opportunity to give it some \nthoughtful analysis before these fundamental changes are made.\n  I thank my colleague from Virginia.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 2518 and 2519\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Iraq amendment under consideration \ntoday constitutes no run-of-the-mill resolution and reporting \nrequirement. It is much more important than that, and likely to be \nwatched closely in Iraq--more closely there, in fact, than in America. \nIn considering this amendment, I urge my colleagues to think hard about \nthe message we send to the Iraqi people. I believe that, after \nconsidering how either version will be viewed in Iraq, we must reject \nboth.\n  Reading through each version, one gets the sense that the Senate's \nforemost objective is the drawdown of American troops. But America's \nfirst goal in Iraq is not to withdraw troops, it is to win the war. All \nother policy decisions we make should support, and be subordinate to, \nthe successful completion of our mission. If that means we can draw \ndown troop levels and win in Iraq in 2006, that is wonderful. But if \nsuccess requires an increase in American troop levels in 2006, then we \nshould increase our numbers there.\n  But that is not what these amendments suggest. They signal that \nwithdrawal, not victory, is foremost in Congress's mind, and suggest \nthat we are more interested in exit than victory. A date is not an exit \nstrategy. This only encourages our enemies, by indicating that the end \nto American intervention is near, and alienates our friends, who fear \nan insurgent victory. Instead, both our friends and our enemies need to \nhear one message: America is committed to success in Iraq and we will \nwin this war.\n  The Democratic version requires the President to develop a withdrawal \nplan. Think about this for a moment. Imagine Iraqis, working for the \nnew government, considering whether to join the police forces, or \ndebating whether or not to take up arms. What will they think when they \nlearn that the Democrats are calling for a withdrawal plan? The \nRepublican alternative, while an improvement, indicates that events in \n2006 should create the conditions for a redeployment of U.S. forces. \nAre these the messages we wish to send? Do we wish to respond to the \nmillions who braved bombs and threats to vote, who have put their faith \nand trust in America and the Iraqi Government, that our No. 1 priority \nis now bringing our people home? Do we want to tell insurgents that \ntheir violence has successfully ground us down, that their horrific \nacts will, with enough time, be successful? No, we must not send these \nmessages. Our exit strategy in Iraq is not the withdrawal of our \ntroops, it is victory.\n\n[[Page S12797]]\n\n  If we can reach victory in 2006, that would be wonderful. But should \n2006 not be the landmark year that these amendments anticipate, we will \nhave once again unrealistically raised the expectations of the American \npeople. That can only cost domestic support for America's role in this \nconflict, a war we must win.\n  I repeat that. This is a war we must win. The benefits of success and \nthe consequences of failure are too profound for us to do otherwise. \nThe road ahead is likely to be long and hard, but America must follow \nit through to success. While the sponsors of each version of this \namendment might argue that their exact language supports this view, \nperceptions here and in Iraq are critical. By suggesting that \nwithdrawal, rather than victory, is on the minds of America's \nlegislators, we do this great cause a grave disservice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I wish to speak on leader time.\n  Shortly, we will be voting on two amendments, one offered by Senators \nLevin and Reid, and the other proposed by Senator Warner and myself.\n  Our amendment, the Republican amendment, shows leadership, signals \nour commitment, and reflects an exit strategy we call victory. As \nChairman Warner just said a few moments ago, there are many \nsimilarities between the two amendments which reflect a lot of broad \nagreement that we have on the war, the progress to date, and the way \nahead.\n  Notwithstanding the Democrats' political carping of the last several \ndays, and really the last several weeks, these two amendments that we \nwill be voting on are forward-looking. They don't get into the issues \nthat were debated and decided a long time ago in the last election. \nThey are forward-looking. They don't try to rewrite history of how \nMembers voted, why they voted, or what they supposedly meant at the \ntime they voted when they spoke in support of the war.\n  There is a lot being made in the media about the requirement of a \nquarterly report, an update on the war's progress, allegations that \nthis in some way shows dissatisfaction with the administration. That is \nabsurd. It is ridiculous. The fact is that Congress, this body, is \ncharged with oversight of the executive branch regardless of which \nparty is in power at the time. This amendment is a continuation of that \noversight. It is not a change in policy. It is a continuation of that \noversight that we have been conducting for years in the Senate. That \nincludes whether we are looking at prewar intelligence issues or \ninvestigating the Abu Ghraib prison abuses or inquiring about the pace \nof reconstruction efforts in Iraq.\n  The Senate has been doing this for years. We are already getting much \nof the information from the administration, largely at the urging of \nthe Republican leadership.\n  There is a huge, important difference between the two amendments we \nwill be voting on. That main difference between these amendments is \nthat the Democrats' amendment requires a timeline, a plan for \nwithdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq. Some have referred to this as the \ncut-and-run provision; that is, pick an arbitrary timeline and get out \nof Iraq regardless of what is happening on the ground, regardless of \nthe security situation, regardless of the political developments \noccurring in Iraq. We believe that is dangerous. We believe that is \nirresponsible. It is irresponsible to tell the terrorists, who we know \nare waiting to take us out, what that timeline is because the timeline, \nonce exposed, simply says: All we have to do is wait and then we \nattack. Then we swoop in to overwhelm Iraq's fledgling democracy, once \nthose troops depart, turning Iraq into a safe haven and base of \noperations to export terrorism abroad.\n  That is why cut-and-run is the wrong policy. Such a scenario would \nplay very nicely into the plans that we know al-Qaida has. The recently \nintercepted letter between Zawahiri and Zarqawi laid out what that \nterrorists' strategy is, to force the United States out of Iraq and use \nthe media and public opinion against us, to turn Iraq into a safe \nhaven, and from there launch their twisted vision of establishing a \nradical caliphate throughout the Middle East. They laid it out. A cut-\nand-run strategy plays right into their hands.\n  That is why telling the enemy our plans is irresponsible and \ndangerous. That is why the votes on these amendments in a few moments \nare so important. It is dangerous for our troops in the region, for our \nNation, and for the American people.\n  Democrats want an exit strategy, thinking cut-and-run. What we are \nfor is a victory strategy. The President of the United States has laid \nthat strategy out clearly in four steps: First, defeat the insurgency \nusing military force while helping Iraq build its own security \ncapability; second, help Iraq rebuild its infrastructure and supporting \neconomy to promote growth and prosperity and hope; third, promote \ndemocracy in its institutions through a political process that \nculminates in an elected government that respects and represents the \nviews of all Iraqis; and fourth, integrate that new Iraq into the \ninternational community of civilized nations. Four steps, that is the \nvictory strategy.\n  We have already seen great progress by the Iraqis on each of these \nissues. As the President has said, U.S. forces will not stay one day \nlonger than necessary. Our troops will step aside as Iraqi forces stand \nup. Publishing a timeline for our retreat will encourage the \nterrorists. It will confuse the Iraqi people. It will play into the \nhands of the Zawahiri and Zarqawi letter. It will discourage our \ntroops, and it sends all the wrong signals to friends and foes alike in \nthis country and, indeed, around the world.\n  My colleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, made many of these \npoints a few moments ago and again last night when he so eloquently \nannounced his strong support for the Warner amendment. Yes, 2006 will \nbe a transition year for Iraq. We can celebrate that. With elections in \n6 weeks, 2006 will be the year a permanent democratically elected \ngovernment will finally take power, 31 months after the fall of Saddam \nHussein. This government will be guided by its recently approved \nconstitution. On October 15, 10.5 million people came out to ratify \nthat constitution. The government will represent the views and the \nbackgrounds and the beliefs and deeds of all peace-loving Iraqis. That \nis progress.\n  With Iraqi security forces now numbering 200,000, and their \nexperience and leadership growing every day, I believe we can continue \nhanding our security responsibilities over to Iraqi forces. I also \nbelieve that given the professionalism and courage of our Armed Forces, \nthe commitment of the Iraqi people, and the support of the American \npeople, we can achieve the vision. The vision is crystal clear. It is a \nfree, democratic, and prosperous Iraq that is governed by the rule of \nlaw, that protects the rights of all Iraqis, that is not a threat to \nits neighbors, and is a responsible international citizen.\n  Mr. President, the Republican amendment is not a change in policy. It \nis not a change in tone as has been suggested on the floor. Our \namendment reflects where this body has always been, supportive of the \nPresident and supportive of our troops overseas, forward-looking and \noptimistic, always conscious of the oversight responsibilities of this \ninstitution and our obligation as Senators to the American people. \nIndeed, I urge all of my colleagues to oppose the Levin amendment and \nto support the Frist-Warner amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. REID. I yield my leader time to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. I yield time to the Senator from Michigan. I think I have a \nminute or 2.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a minute.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the majority leader has railed against \nlanguage which does not exist in our amendment. Repeating over and over \nagain a cut-and-run strategy is wrong, he tries to create the \nimpression that that is what paragraph 7 proposes. It does not by its \nown terms. By repeating cutting and running enough I guess the hope is \nthat people who don't read this language will believe that that is the \nlanguage in paragraph 7. It is not.\n\n[[Page S12798]]\n\n  What we propose in paragraph 7 is that there be estimated dates, \nestimated dates if the conditions on the ground are met as the \nRepublican and Democratic amendment both propose occur. Then give us \nestimated dates for a phased redeployment--estimated dates--if those \nconditions are met and with the understanding that unexpected \ncontingencies may arise. That cannot be fairly characterized the way \nthe majority leader repeatedly characterized it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 1 minute.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Tennessee (Mr. Alexander).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. \nAlexander) would have voted ``nay.''\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the Warner \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, beginning with this vote, all remaining \nvotes will be 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, there is 2 minutes equally divided on the \nWarner amendment on which the yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am very grateful for the bipartisan \nsupport on this amendment. Our amendment is simply taking portions of \nthe Levin amendment, putting them into an amendment that we put \ntogether, rather than draw up a totally new amendment, so we can have \nthe maximum bipartisanship but carefully crafting the Warner amendment \nso that not any words can be construed to indicate there is a timetable \nfor the withdrawal of coalition forces, most particularly U.S. forces.\n  We are on the verge of an historic election in Iraq for a permanent \ngovernment in a matter of weeks, and thereafter they have 60 days in \nwhich to stand up that government. The next 120 days are absolutely \ncritical. The Warner amendment is forward-looking. It clearly sends a \nmessage to the Iraqi people that we have stood with them; we have done \nour part. Now it is time for them to put their government together, \nstand strong so that eventually they can exercise total sovereignty and \nselect their own form of democracy. We cannot allow any verbiage to \ncome out of the Congress of the United States that can be construed as \na timetable of withdrawal at this critical time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I intend to vote for the Warner amendment \nbecause it represents change, not as much change as we would have \nliked, and we have debated that and argued that. But there are \nsignificant changes that are being proposed in this amendment which we \nhave worked very hard to put in our amendment and we think would \nrepresent an improvement. We need to have 2006 be a year of transition. \nWe need to have the administration lay out a strategy. We need to state \nwhat our military states, which is that the Iraqis have to solve their \npolitical problems and come together and unify if that insurgency is \ngoing to be defeated. This amendment continues to say to the \nadministration they need to tell that to the Iraqis.\n  This amendment also sets up a schedule for conditions that are goals \nwe hope to be achieved on the ground. That ``schedule,'' which is the \nword that remains in this amendment, is an important schedule that \nneeds to be retained, and it is retained. It needs to be met, and if it \nis not met, we need to be told what has changed so that it can be met.\n  I support the Warner amendment as the second-best approach, but it \ncontinues to keep the purpose, to clarify and recommend changes to the \npolicy of the United States on Iraq. Keeping that purpose is critical.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. All time has \nexpired for debate.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Tennessee (Mr. Alexander).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. \nAlexander) would have voted ``yea.''\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, may we have order?\n  I ask the Presiding Officer to once again restate the sequence of \nvotes that are about to take place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n\n[[Page S12799]]\n\n  The upcoming amendment is the Bingaman amendment to the Graham \namendment. The previous order allows 2 minutes of debate.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Presiding Officer and again remind the \nSenators the votes are 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is correct. All \nvotes from here on are 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. The time reserved to me under the Bingaman amendment I \nyield to the distinguished Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, last week we had a debate and vote on \nwhether an enemy combatant terrorist al-Qaida member should be able to \nhave access to our Federal courts under habeas like an American \ncitizen. Senator Bingaman is trying to strip that part of the \namendment. He is consolidating the habeas petitions into the DC Court \nof Appeals, but habeas still lies with a standard you can drive a truck \nthrough. The court would look at the lawfulness of the detention which \nwould allow, in my opinion, the ability of a terrorist to go into the \nDC Circuit Court of Appeals and start asking for Internet access under \nthe right of counsel. It is a never-ending process that should never \nhave begun anyway.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote to make sure the right of appeal is consistent \nwith the law of armed conflict and we do not have unfettered right of \ncourt access by enemy combatants to sue us over everything to undermine \nthe war effort. I ask a ``no'' vote consistent with the last vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order. The Senator \nshould be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, last year the Supreme Court said that \nFederal courts have authority to consider petitions for a writ of \nhabeas corpus. This would apply to prisoners at Guantanamo. People \nshould not be imprisoned without having the ability to challenge the \nlegality of that imprisonment. That is the history of our common law \nsystem and our Constitution as well.\n  I will yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I support the Bingaman amendment and \noppose the Graham amendment because the Graham amendment is \nsophisticated court-stripping. On the face of the Graham amendment, it \nsays the DC Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction, and on the face of it, \nthat even takes away jurisdiction from the Supreme Court of the United \nStates.\n  To alter habeas corpus in the context where the Supreme Court last \nJune, 2004, found substantial rights of the detainees is court-\nstripping and would set a very bad precedent, not only for this factual \nsituation but in general.\n  I thank my colleague from New Mexico.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, last week I voted against an amendment \nintroduced by Senator Graham, No. 2515, which stripped the Federal \ncourts of their historic jurisdiction to hear applications for writs of \nhabeas corpus filed by or on behalf of detainees at Guantanamo Bay. I \ndid so because the amendment would have eliminated virtually all \njudicial review of combatant detentions, including review of the \ndecisions of military tribunals.\n  Today, I voted in favor of Senator Bingaman's amendment No. 2523, \nbecause it would have preserved judicial review in the most important \nareas while also preventing frivolous claims. When the Bingaman \namendment failed, I voted for a second-degree amendment No. 2524, which \nreflected the hard work of Senator Levin to provide another means to \npreserve some form of judicial review of the proceedings at Guantanamo \nBay. And, it is my understanding that, as Senator Levin stated on the \nfloor of the Senate just yesterday, ``this amendment will not strip \ncourts of jurisdiction over [pending] cases.''\n  The war on terror presents us with challenges unique in our Nation's \nhistory, requiring solutions that are sustainable over the long-term. \nWe have little reason to trust the administration's record on this \nscore. But with these provisions, the Senate declares it is our \npriority to prosecute the war on terror with every tool at the \ncountry's disposal including the rule of law. It remains my priority, \nand I know the priority of my colleagues, to win this war, to hunt down \nand destroy terrorists wherever they are, destroy their networks, and \nmake our world safe.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I support the Bingaman second-degree \namendment to the Graham detainee amendment.\n  The Senator from South Carolina has been a leader on the issue of \ndetention and interrogation policies. I share his goal of setting clear \nrules for the detention of enemy combatants.\n  This amendment would do some positive things that I support. It would \nrequire the Defense Department to report to Congress on the procedures \nfor determining the status of detainees held at Guantanamo Bay. It \nwould prohibit the Defense Department from determining the status of a \ndetainee based on evidence obtained from torture.\n  However, I am concerned that one section of the Graham amendment \nwould have very dramatic unintended consequences.\n  However, subsection (d) of the amendment would eliminate habeas \ncorpus for detainees at Guantanamo Bay. In so doing, it would overturn \nthe Supreme Court's landmark decision in Rasul v. Bush. It would strip \nfederal courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, of the right to hear \nany challenge to any practice at Guantanamo Bay, other than a one-time \nappeal to the D.C. Circuit Court on the limited question of whether the \nDefense Department is complying with its own rules for classifying \ndetainees. It applies retroactively, and therefore would also likely \nprevent the Supreme Court from ruling on the merits of the Hamdan case, \na pending challenge to the legality of the administration's military \ncommissions.\n  For these reasons, I am opposed to Senator Graham's amendment.\n  I will support Senator Bingaman's second degree amendment to the \nGraham amendment. It would preserve the positive elements of the Graham \namendment and would strike subsection (d) of the amendment. It would \nreplace subsection (d) with a streamlined judicial review system that \nwould preserve habeas for Guantanamo detainees, consolidate habeas \nclaims in the D.C. Circuit Court, allow claims challenging the legality \nof detention, and prohibit claims based on ``living conditions,'' e.g. \nthe type of food a person is provided. These restrictions would not \napply to people who have been charged by military commissions or who \nhave been determined not to be enemy combatants by a Combatant Status \nReview Tribunal, CSRT.\n  The Graham-Levin substitute amendment would somewhat improve the \nunderlying amendment by expanding the scope of review by the D.C. \nCircuit Court to include whether the CSRT's procedures are legal, but \nnot whether a particular detainee's detention is legal. It would also \nallow for post-conviction review of military commission convictions. \nHowever, the amendment would still eliminate habeas review and overrule \nthe Rasul case. As a result, I will oppose it.\n  No one questions the fact that the United States has the power to \nhold battlefield combatants for the duration of an armed conflict. That \nis a fundamental premise of the law of war.\n  However, over the objections of then-Secretary of State Colin Powell \nand military lawyers, the Bush administration has created a new \ndetention policy that goes far beyond the traditional law of war.\n  The administration claims the right to seize anyone, including an \nAmerican citizen, anywhere in the world, including in the United \nStates, and to hold him until the end of the war on terrorism, whenever \nthat may be.\n  They claim that a person detained in the war on terrorism has no \nlegal rights. That means no right to a lawyer, no right to see the \nevidence against him, and no right to challenge his detention. In fact, \nthe government has argued in court that detainees would have no right \nto challenge their detentions even if they claimed they were being \ntortured or summarily executed.\n  U.S. military lawyers have called this detention system ``a legal \nblack hole.''\n\n[[Page S12800]]\n\n  Under their new detention policy, people who never raised arms \nagainst the United States have reportedly been taken prisoner far from \nthe battlefield, including in places like Bosnia and Thailand.\n  Defense Secretary Rumsfeld has described the detainees as ``the \nhardest of the hard core'' and ``among the most dangerous, best \ntrained, vicious killers on the face of the Earth.'' However, the \nadministration now acknowledges that innocent people are held at \nGuantanamo Bay. In late 2003, the Pentagon reportedly determined that \n15 Chinese Muslims held at Guantanamo are not enemy combatants and were \nmistakenly detained. Almost 2 years later, those individuals remain in \nGuantanamo Bay.\n  Last year, in the Rasul decision, the Supreme Court rejected the \nadministration's detention policy. The Court held that detainees at \nGuantanamo have the right to habeas corpus to challenge their \ndetentions in federal court. The Court held that the detainees' claims \nthat they were detained for years without charge and without access to \ncounsel ``unquestionably describe custody in violation of the \nConstitution, or laws or treaties of the United States.''\n  The Graham amendment would protect the Bush administration's \ndetention system from legal challenge. It would effectively overturn \nthe Supreme Court's decision. It would prevent innocent detainees, like \nthe Chinese Muslims, from challenging their detention.\n  Yesterday, I received a letter from Colonel Dwight Sullivan of the \nU.S. Marine Corps. Colonel Sullivan is the Chief Defense Counsel in the \nOffice of Military Commissions. He and other military lawyers have gone \nto court to challenge the legality of the administration's detention \npolicies.\n  Colonel Sullivan opposes the Graham amendment. In his letter to me, \nhe said:\n\n       I am writing to call your attention to serious errors in \n     the arguments advanced by proponents of Amendment No. 2515 to \n     the FY 2006 DOD Authorization Act that would strip Guantanamo \n     detainees of habeas rights.\n       In his initial floor speech supporting the Amendment, \n     Senator Graham stated, ``Never in the history of the law of \n     armed conflict has an enemy combatant, irregular component, \n     or POW been given access to civilian court systems to \n     question military authority and control, except here.'' That \n     claim simply is not true. As discussed in greater detail \n     below, the Supreme Court considered habeas petitions filed on \n     behalf of seven of the eight would-be German saboteurs in Ex \n     parte Quirin and on behalf of a Japanese general who was a \n     prisoner of war in In re Yamashita.\n\n  Senator Graham stated:\n\n       Here is the one thing I can tell you for sure as a military \n     lawyer. A POW or an enemy combatant facing law of armed \n     conflict charges has not been given the right to habeas \n     corpus for 200 years because our own people in our own \n     military facing court-martials, who could be sentenced to \n     death, do not have the right of habeas corpus.\n\n  Again, Senator Graham's argument is factually incorrect. U.S. \nservicemembers do have a right to challenge court-martial proceedings \nthrough habeas petitions, in addition to the direct appeal rights.\n  Colonel Sullivan is not the only military leader who has raised \nconcerns about the Graham amendment. Yesterday, every member of the \nSenate received a letter from nine retired military officers, including \nseven Generals and one Rear Admiral. Here is what they said about the \nGraham amendment:\n\n       For generations, the United States has stood firm for the \n     rule of law. It is not the rule of law if you only apply it \n     when it is convenient and toss it over the side when it is \n     not.\n       The Great Writ of Habeas Corpus has been at the heart of \n     U.S. law since the first drafts of the Constitution. Indeed, \n     it has been part of Western culture for 1000 years, since the \n     Magna Carta . . . The restriction on habeas contemplated by \n     Amendment 2516 would be a momentous change. It is certainly \n     not a change in the landscape of U.S. jurisprudence we should \n     tack on to the Defense Department Authorization Bill at the \n     last minute.\n       The practical effects of Amendment 2516 would be sweeping \n     and negative. America's great strength isn't our economy or \n     natural resources or the essentially island nature of our \n     geography. It is our mission, and what we stand for. That's \n     why other nations look to us for leadership and follow our \n     lead. Every step we take that dims that bright, shining light \n     diminishes our role as a world leader. As we limit the rights \n     of human beings, even those of the enemy, we become more like \n     the enemy. That makes us weaker and imperils our valiant \n     troops. We are proud to be Americans. This Amendment, well \n     intentioned as it may be, will diminish us.\n\n  These American patriots, who served our country for decades, say it \nbetter than I ever could. This is not about giving rights to suspected \nterrorists. It is about American values. Secret indefinite detention is \nnot the American way. Eliminating habeas corpus is not the American \nway. I urge my colleagues to support the Bingaman second-degree \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Tennessee (Mr. Alexander).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. \nAlexander) would have voted ``no.''\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2524 to Amendment No. 2515\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is 2 minutes \nequally divided on the Graham amendment to the Graham amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \nminute to set the record straight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, is the \nSenator from South Carolina asking for a second minute for each side?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That would be fine. I would like an extra minute. Senator \nKerry gave me some very good advice, and I will take it if I am given \nthe time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to 4 minutes equally \ndivided?\n  Mr. SPECTER. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this is a serious and very important vote. \nDuring the debate last week, I made a statement about what rights our \ntroops would have. Our troops, once they are charged under the Uniform \nCode of Military Justice, get appeal rights under the military system, \nand they do have habeas rights about their criminal misconduct.\n  What I am trying to say--I got it wrong--is when our troops are enemy \nprisoners there is no right to appeal to\n\n[[Page S12801]]\n\nthe civil courts wherever they may be, nor has there ever been a right \nfor an enemy prisoner to go to our court. Senator Kerry gave me some \ngood advice. I misstated, and I am sorry. But the concept of an enemy \nprisoner or enemy combatant not having access to civilian courts has \nbeen the tradition of 200 years. We are about to end this whole \nendeavor on a high note. I thank Senator Kyl for being a very \nconstructive finder of solutions, and I thank Senator Levin for going \nthat extra mile to find a way we can leave this issue with honor.\n  This Levin-Graham-Kyl amendment allows every detainee under our \ncontrol to have their day in court. They are allowed to appeal their \nconvictions, if they are tried by military commissions--a model that \ngoes back for decades to the Federal courts of this country, if they \nget a sentence of 10 years or the death penalty.\n  We are going to have court review. An enemy combatant will not be \nleft at Guantanamo without a court looking at whether they are properly \ncharacterized. We are doing it in a way consistent with the law of \narmed conflict, in an orderly way.\n  I am proud that we are because this is a war of values. We can win \nthis war without sacrificing our values, and part of our values is due \nprocess, even for the worst among us.\n  I thank Senator Levin very much. Senator Specter's stated that the \nCircuit Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia is the primary \ncourt to hear these cases, but the Supreme Court can receive a \ncertiorari petition from that court.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a Senator seeking time in opposition?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, when the Senator from South Carolina says \nthe Supreme Court of the United States can take certiorari, it is at \nvariance with the plain language of the statute. The statute says:\n\n       The United States Court of Appeals for the District of \n     Columbia shall have exclusive jurisdiction.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. No. It means what it says.\n  I can't yield having only 2 minutes, but I would be glad to hear the \nSenator afterwards.\n  It means what it says--the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction.\n  The great difficulty with the Graham-Levin amendment is that it was \nworked out yesterday--sort of an affront to the Judiciary Committee, if \nI may say so--that there is no time for the Judiciary Committee to have \na hearing on the matter to consider it.\n  We are dealing with very fundamental rights, habeas corpus.\n  Another provision of the Graham-Levin amendment says there shall be \nno habeas corpus jurisdiction.\n  There have been repeated efforts in the history of our country to \ntake away the jurisdiction of the courts. Court stripping was a big \nissue in the confirmation process of Chief Justice Roberts. He ran from \nit like the plague. He had an early memo. He didn't want to be \nassociated with it.\n  These are weighty and momentous considerations that go far beyond the \ndetainees at Guantanamo. And we ought not to be deciding these \nquestions on an amendment, which was agreed to yesterday between \nSenator Graham and Senator Levin, and no one has had a chance to study \nor analyze--most of all the authors--which on the face takes away \njurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States. It is untenable \nand unthinkable and ought to be rejected.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend my colleagues across the aisle \nwho are attempting to address the treatment of detainees in U.S. \ncustody, despite resistance from members of their own party and the \nstrong opposition of the White House. I know Senator Graham has worked \nclosely with Senator McCain and others to give our troops the clear \nguidance they need to effectively detain and interrogate enemy \nprisoners, and I commend him for that. The legislative branch has not \nmet its obligation of oversight and policymaking in this area. For \nmonths, Senator Graham has been prodding the Congress to take action. \nHe is one of the few members of his party to forcefully speak out on \nthe need to change the administration's policies.\n  While I support Senator Graham's efforts on these issues, I cannot \nsupport his amendment to strip Federal courts of the authority to \nconsider a habeas petition from detainees being held in U.S. custody as \nenemy combatants.\n  The Graham amendment would deny prisoners who the administration \nclaims are unlawful combatants the right to challenge their detention. \nAt no time in the history of this Nation have habeas rights been \npermanently cut off from a group of prisoners. Even President Lincoln's \nsuspension of habeas was temporary. The Supreme Court has held numerous \ntimes that enemy combatants can challenge their detention.\n  Many of my colleagues across the aisle argue that terrorists do not \ndeserve access to our Federal courts. This argument would be far more \npersuasive if all of the detainees at Guantanamo Bay were terrorists. \nUnfortunately, many of them are almost certainly not. Numerous press \naccounts have quoted unnamed officials who believe that a significant \npercentage of those detained at Guantanamo do not have a connection to \nterrorism. And yet they have been held for years without the right to \nchallenge their detention in a fair and impartial hearing, a situation \nthat does significant harm to our Nation's reputation as a leader in \nhuman rights and which puts our own soldiers at risk.\n  Filing a writ of habeas corpus is often the detainee's only \nopportunity to openly challenge the basis for his detention. Providing \ndetainees this right is not about coddling terrorists--it is about \nshowing the world that we are a nation of laws and that we are willing \nto uphold the values that we urge other nations to follow. It is about \nhonoring and respecting the principles that are part of our heritage as \nAmericans and that have been a beacon to the rest of the world. \nAllowing a detainee to file a habeas petition provides legitimacy to \nour detention system and quells speculation that we are holding \ninnocent people in secret prisons without any right to due process.\n  Some Members of the Senate have argued that these prisoners should be \ntried in the military justice system. I think that we could all agree \non such a course if the administration had worked with Congress from \nthe start and established with our approval procedures that are fair \nand consistent with our tradition of military justice. I introduced a \nbill in the 107th Congress to do just that. So did Senator Specter. The \nfact is, that the system that has been established by the \nadministration to try individuals held at Guantanamo is not a system \nthat reflects our values. It does not give due process or independent \nreview.\n\n  Everyone in Congress agrees that we must capture and detain terrorist \nsuspects, but it can and should be done in accord with the laws of war \nand in a manner that upholds our commitment to the rule of law. The \nJudiciary Committee held a hearing on detainee issues in June. At that \nhearing, Senator Graham said that once enemy combatant status has been \nconferred upon someone, ``it is almost impossible not to envision that \nsome form of prosecution would follow.'' He continued, ``We can do this \nand be a rule of law nation. We can prove to the world that even among \nthe worst people in the world, the rule of law is not an inconsistent \nconcept.'' I agree with Senator Graham, but I strongly believe that in \norder to uphold our commitment to the rule of law, we must allow \ndetainees the right to challenge their detention in Federal court.\n  As Chairman Specter noted on the floor last week, there are existing \nprocedures under habeas corpus that have been upheld by the Supreme \nCourt that do not invite frivolous claims, and that are appropriate. \nSenator Graham's amendment would not only restrict habeas in a manner \nnever done before in our Nation, but, as the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee said last week, it would open a Pandora's box.\n  The chairman is right. He spoke forcefully again this morning about \nthe danger of such court stripping efforts. We must not rush to change \na legal right that predates our Constitution. Creating one exemption to \nthe ``great writ'' only invites more. The Judiciary Committee has \njurisdiction over habeas corpus and it should have the first \nopportunity to review any proposed changed carefully and thoroughly. \nAlthough congressional action on the\n\n[[Page S12802]]\n\nissue of foreign detainees is long overdue, we must not act hastily \nwhen the ``great writ''--something that protects us all--is at stake.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe deans of four of our Nation's most prestigious law schools that \narticulates the dangers of adopting the Graham amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                November 14, 2005.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: We write to urge that the Senate adopt \n     the amendment of Senator Bingaman removing the court-\n     stripping provisions of the Graham Amendment to the \n     Department of Defense authorization bill. As professors of \n     law who serve as deans of American law schools, we believe \n     that immunizing the executive branch from review of its \n     treatment of persons held at the U.S. Naval Base at \n     Guantanamo strikes at the heart of the idea of the rule of \n     law and establishes a precedent we would not want other \n     nations to emulate.\n       At the Guantanamo Naval Base, the Government has subjected \n     foreign nationals believed to be linked to Al Qaeda to long-\n     term detention and has established military commissions to \n     try a small number of the detainees for war crimes. It is \n     entirely clear that one of the Executive Branch's motivations \n     for detaining noncitizens at Guantanamo was to put their \n     treatment beyond the examination of American courts.\n       The Supreme Court rejected the Government's claim in Rasul \n     v. Bush that federal habeas corpus review did not extend to \n     Guantanamo. The extent of the rights protected by federal \n     habeas law is now before the Federal Court of Appeals for the \n     D.C. Circuit. Another challenge has been filed to the \n     authority of the President, acting without congressional \n     authorization, to convene military commissions at Guantanamo. \n     Just last week the Supreme Court announced that it would \n     review the case, Hamdan v. Rumsfeld.\n       The Graham Amendment would attempt to stop both of these \n     cases from proceeding and would unwisely interrupt judicial \n     processes in midcourse. Respect for the constitutional \n     principle of separation of powers should counsel against such \n     legislative interference in the ongoing work of the Supreme \n     Court and independent judges.\n       Unfortunately, the Graham Amendment would do much more. \n     With a minor exception, the legislation would prohibit \n     challenges to detention practices, treatment of prisoners, \n     adjudications of their guilt and their punishment.\n       To put this most pointedly, were the Graham Amendment to \n     become law, a person suspected of being a member of Al Qaeda \n     could be arrested, transferred to Guantanamo, detained \n     indefinitely (provided that proper procedures had been \n     followed in deciding that the person is an ``enemy \n     combatant''), subjected to inhumane treatment, tried before a \n     military commission and sentenced to death without any \n     express authorization from Congress and without review by any \n     independent federal court. The American form of government \n     was established precisely to prevent this kind of \n     unreviewable exercise of power over the lives of individuals.\n       We do not object to the Graham Amendment's procedural \n     requirements for determining whether or not a detainee is an \n     enemy combatant and providing for limited judicial review of \n     such decisions. This kind of congressional structuring of the \n     detention of military prisoners is long overdue, and it \n     highlights the absence of congressional regulation of \n     standards of detainee treatment and the establishment of \n     military commissions. Curiously, the Graham Amendment \n     recognizes the need for judicial review of the determination \n     of enemy combatant status, but then purports to bar judicial \n     review of far more momentous commission rulings regarding \n     determinations of guilt and imposition of punishment.\n       We cannot imagine a more inappropriate moment to remove \n     scrutiny of Executive Branch treatment of noncitizen \n     detainees. We are all aware of serious and disturbing reports \n     of secret overseas prisons, extraordinary renditions, and the \n     abuse of prisoners in Guantanamo, Iraq and Afghanistan. The \n     Graham Amendment will simply reinforce the public perception \n     that Congress approves Executive Branch decisions to act \n     beyond the reach of law. As such, it undermines two core \n     elements of the rule of law: congressionally sanctioned rules \n     that limit and guide the exercise of Executive power and \n     judicial review to ensure that those rules have in fact been \n     honored.\n       When dictatorships have passed laws stripping their courts \n     of power to review executive detention or punishment of \n     prisoners, our government has rightly challenged such acts as \n     fundamentally lawless. The same standard should apply to our \n     own government. We urge you to vote to remove the court-\n     stripping provisions of the Graham Amendment from the pending \n     legislation.\n     T. Alexander Aleinikoff,\n       Dean, Georgetown University Law Center.\n     Elena Kagan,\n       Dean and Charles Hamilton Houston Professor of Law, Harvard \n     Law School.\n     Harold Hongju Koh,\n       Dean and Gerard C. & Bernice Latrobe Smith Professor of \n     International Law, Yale Law School.\n     Larry Kramer,\n       Dean and Richard E. Lang Professor of Law, Stanford Law \n     School.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Graham amendment, which the Senate \napproved last Thursday, includes a prohibition on Federal courts having \njurisdiction to hear habeas petitions brought by aliens outside the \nUnited States who are detained by the Defense Department at Guantanamo \nBay, Cuba.\n  The Graham-Levin-Kyl amendment would make three significant \nimprovements to the underlying Graham amendment.\n  The habeas prohibition in the Graham amendment applied retroactively \nto all pending cases--this would have the effect of stripping the \nFederal courts, including the Supreme Court, of jurisdiction over all \npending case, including the Hamdan case.\n  The Graham-Levin-Kyl amendment would not apply the habeas prohibition \nin paragraph (1) to pending cases. So, although the amendment would \nchange the substantive law applicable to pending cases, it would not \nstrip the courts of jurisdiction to hear them.\n  Under the Graham-Levin-Kyl amendment, the habeas prohibition would \ntake effect on the date of enactment of the legislation. Thus, this \nprohibition would apply only to new habeas cases filed after the date \nof enactment.\n  The approach in this amendment preserves comity between the judiciary \nand legislative branches. It avoids repeating the unfortunate precedent \nin Ex parte McCardle, in which Congress intervened to strip the Supreme \nCourt of jurisdiction over a case which was pending before that Court.\n  The Graham amendment would provide for direct judicial review only of \nstatus determinations by combat status review tribunals, not to \nconvictions by military commissions.\n  The Graham-Levin-Kyl amendment would provide for direct judicial \nreview of both status determinations by CSRTs and convictions by \nmilitary commissions. The amendment does not affirmatively authorize \neither CSRTs or military commissions; instead, it establishes a \njudicial procedure for determining the constitutionality of such \nprocesses.\n  The Graham amendment would provide only for review of whether a \ntribunal complied with its own standards and procedures.\n  The Graham-Levin-Kyl amendment would authorize courts to determine \nwhether tribunals and commissions applied the correct standards, and \nwhether the application of those standards and procedures is consistent \nwith the Constitution and laws of the United States.\n  This amendment is not an authorization of the particular procedures \nfor the military commissions; rather it is intended to set a standard--\nconsistent with our Constitution and laws--with which any procedures \nfor the military commissions must conform.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in a series of votes last Thursday and \ntoday, the Senate has voted to deny the availability of habeas corpus \nto individuals held by the United States at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. I \nrise to explain my vote against the Graham amendment last week, and my \nvotes in favor of the Bingaman amendment and the Graham-Levin amendment \nearlier today.\n  First, let's put the whole issue of the rights of suspected \nterrorists in context. As Senator McCain said over the weekend, \nterrorists are ``the quintessence of evil. But it's not about them; \nit's about us.'' This debate is about respect for human rights and \nadherence to the rule of law. It is about the continued moral authority \nof this Nation.\n  For the past four years, the Bush administration has advocated a \npolicy of detaining suspects indefinitely and largely in secret, \nwithout access to meaningful judicial oversight. This policy is \ninconsistent with our core\n\n[[Page S12803]]\n\nvalues as Americans. In addition, a policy so inconsistent with human \nrights will further damage America's image abroad and provide more \nammunition for those who wish to do us harm.\n  The writ of habeas corpus is one of the pillars of the Anglo-American \nlegal system. It is the mechanism by which people who are held by the \ngovernment can seek an independent review of the legality of their \ndetention. Very often the people who rely on habeas corpus are \nunpopular, whether they are convicted criminals or suspected \nterrorists. But habeas corpus protects all of us--it is the way we \nensure that the executive branch acts within the bounds of the law.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Graham last week created an \nexception to the habeas corpus rights established in title 28 of the \nUnited States Code. It contained a separate, essentially hollow review \nof whether the Defense Department had complied with its own procedures \nin declaring someone an enemy combatant. In a practical sense, the \namendment put the actions of U.S. officials with respect to the \nGuantanamo detainees beyond the reach of the law, and created a legal \nno-man's land. I opposed the Graham amendment for this reason.\n  Nobody thinks that detainees should be able to file habeas petitions \nabout what kind of peanut butter they are served or whether they can \nwatch DVDs. That is not what this is about. This is about whether we \nare going to permit the President to detain a human being indefinitely \nwithout independent judicial review.\n  I want to draw the attention of my colleagues to an op-ed published \nin the Washington Post yesterday by one of the pro bono lawyers for the \nGuantanamo Bay detainees. The lawyer describes the importance of habeas \nreview for his client, who remains in jail despite the military's \ndetermination that his client was innocent and was not associated with \nal-Qaida or the Taliban.\n  The writ of habeas corpus is for people like this. It is for figuring \nout whether those held at Guantanamo are in fact terrorists--and \nwhether they are held lawfully and in accordance with the requirements \nof the Constitution.\n  In addition, the Senate recently passed, by a vote of 90 to 9, the \nMcCain amendment to prohibit the use of torture at Guantanamo and \nelsewhere. The Graham amendment would undermine this prohibition by \npreventing its enforcement by the Federal courts. The Federal courts \nexist to vindicate important rights. In general, this jurisdiction-\nstripping amendment would trample on the independence of the judiciary \nand violate principles of separation of powers.\n  Today the Senate voted on two amendments to improve the Graham \namendment. I supported the Bingaman amendment, because it would have \npreserved the fundamental right of habeas corpus, while at the same \ntime streamlining judicial review of Guantanamo cases and ensuring that \nonly the most serious cases are before the Federal courts. I applaud \nthe Senator from New Mexico for his defense of habeas corpus and I \nregret that his amendment did not pass.\n  I also voted in favor of the Graham-Levin amendment because it is an \nimprovement over the original Graham amendment, which, as the vote last \nweek demonstrated, would have passed the Senate with or without \nimprovements. Importantly, the Graham-Levin amendment would allow \ncourts to consider whether the standards and procedures used by the \nCombatant Status Review Tribunals are consistent with the Constitution \nand U.S. laws, and would allow for court review of the actions of \nmilitary commissions.\n  As a supporter of the Graham-Levin amendment, let me state my \nunderstanding of several important issues. First, I agree with Senator \nLevin that his amendment does not divest the Supreme Court of \njurisdiction to hear the pending case of Hamdan v. Rumsfeld. I believe \nthe effective date provision of the amendment is properly understood to \nleave pending Supreme Court cases unaffected. It would be highly \nirregular for the Congress to interfere in the work of the Supreme \nCourt in this fashion, and the amendment should not be read to do so.\n  Second, I do not understand this legislation to represent a \ncongressional authorization of the military commissions unilaterally \nestablished by the executive branch at Guantanamo Bay. We would hardly \nauthorize these commissions based upon a few hours of floor debate. \nInstead, I regard this legislation as establishing a process for the \nfederal courts to review the constitutionality of the commissions. To \nthe extent that question turns on whether Congress has authorized or \nrecognized the commissions, nothing we have done today lends support to \nthe argument that the commissions are a valid exercise of executive \nauthority.\n  Third, Senator Specter raised the question of whether the grant of \n``exclusive jurisdiction'' to the DC Circuit precludes Supreme Court \nreview of the DC Circuit's final orders in these cases. I do not \nunderstand the amendment to strip the Supreme Court of such appellate \njurisdiction. Congress often grants ``exclusive jurisdiction'' to one \ncourt or another, but that phrase is not understood to preclude appeals \nthrough the usual means.\n  Finally, there may be questions about what Congress meant when it \ndirects the courts to review ``whether subjecting an alien enemy \ncombatant to such standards and procedures is consistent with the \nConstitution and laws of the United States.'' In my view, the Federal \ncourt should hear any factual or legal challenge by a detainee who \ncontests being classified as an enemy combatant in the first place.\n  Even after adoption of the Graham-Levin amendment, the underlying \nGraham amendment still strips the courts of jurisdiction to hear habeas \ncorpus petitions. For this reason, I oppose the final Graham amendment \nas amended. I hope it is either improved in conference or deleted \naltogether.\n  But even if the Graham amendment is enacted into law, the Judiciary \nCommittee should hold hearings to define the rights of the detainees at \nGuantanamo with greater care and to develop sensible procedures for \nenforcing those rights. It is of the utmost importance that this \nCongress work to preserve the principles of human rights and the rule \nof law upon which this Nation was founded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we now turn to the underlying amendment. \nIt is my understanding the Senator from South Carolina has agreed to a \nvoice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2515, as amended.\n  The amendment (No. 2515), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time for \nthe recess, which is already part of the order of the Senate, be \nextended until 2:30. I am sure both caucuses have a lot of work to do, \nand we could convene at 2:30.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I presume, now that the quorum call has \nbeen withdrawn, that under the unanimous consent agreement, the Senate \nmay now move to third reading of the bill.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the chairman of the \nsubcommittee and the ranking member, Senators Shelby and Mikulski, for \nbeing understanding. I ask unanimous consent that the recess be \nextended until 2:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I think it is a reasonable request by the \nDemocratic leader so we can get on with this vote and go to our \ncaucuses. The reason there was an initial objection to it was because \nSenator Shelby, chairman of the committee, had something he had to \nmove. But we will work it out and start at 2:30. We will have plenty of \ntime for our caucus lunch.\n\n\n                        iraqi military equipment\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is in our Nation's interest and in our \nown troops' interests to ensure that Iraqi security forces, fighting \nside by side with America's soldiers and marines, are well-trained and \nwell-equipped. As the chairman of the Armed Services Committee has \nindicated, our capacity to transfer security responsibilities to the \nIraqis will chiefly rely on one thing--the ability of Iraqi forces to \nstand up and assume control over their nation's security.\n  To successfully complete the mission in Iraq and to bring our troops \nhome as quickly as possible, we need to ensure that lraq's soldiers and \npolicemen have the capacity to assume control over their nation's \nsecurity and law enforcement. And in the immediate term, as our troops \ndeploy on patrol with their Iraqi partners, they need to know that they \ncan rely on Iraqi forces to shoulder their share of combat operations.\n  Achieving this goal is not only a matter of training Iraq's soldiers \nand policemen. We need to also ensure that they are adequately equipped \nto perform their missions safely and effectively. Last week, the New \nYork Times reported on the difficulties Iraqi troops are facing in \nprocuring inadequate armor and safety gear. According to that article, \nthe biggest shortage is in fortified vehicles. Tragically, Iraqis are \nbeing required to patrol the same roads and marketplaces that are \nbesieged on a daily basis by improvised explosive devices and suicide \nbombers without any armored protection or heavy vehicles. With several \nhundred Iraqis operating in military vehicles, only three dozen such \nvehicles are outfitted with protective armor. We need to do better than \nthat if we expect Iraqi troops to have even a fighting chance. But at \nthe same time, we also need to recognize that the needs of our own \ntroops are of paramount concern. That is why, with the chairman's \nsupport, I offered an amendment to reimburse troops for protective gear \nthat they purchased; why we have supported rapidly fielding \nincreasingly more armored protection to U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen, \nand marines deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan; why the Senate supported \nthe chairman's amendment last July to add an additional 1,800 up-\narmored HMMWVs for the U.S. Marines Corps; and why, yesterday on the \nbill, we voted to add an additional $360 million for even more armored \nvehicles.\n  Members of this body have few higher priorities than the safety and \nwell-being of our troops deployed in harm's way. And there is no \ngreater champion of the American GI than the current chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee. Therefore, I am sure that he would agree that \nthe best way we can safeguard the safety and security of our troops is \nto ensure that U.S. forces can complete their mission and return home \nas soon as possible. Doing so will require well-equipped as well as \nwell-trained Iraqi forces to take over from U.S. forces the \nresponsibilities for maintaining peace and order through Iraq.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator from Connecticut. He has raised a \nsignificant concern that we both, and many others in this body, share. \nThere is no question we must continue to provide our magnificent \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines with the finest equipment \navailable to meet the mission requirements in Iraq and elsewhere around \nthe world. In Iraq, there is no doubt that efforts to train and equip \nIraqi Security Forces are decisive to Iraq's future and a major element \nin the policy of the United States. Lieutenant General Petraeus \nperformed masterfully as Commander of the Multi-National Security \nTransition Command in Iraq that was charged with training the Iraqi \nSecurity Forces and now Lieutenant General Dempsey has the reins on \nthis mission. During the most recent elections in Iraq, the performance \nof Iraqi Security Forces was an important contributor to that success. \nThe Iraqi Security Forces provided protection to more than 6,000 \npolling sites. That was a very positive step in the right direction, \nbut we still have some way to go in training and equipping the Iraqi \nSecurity Forces. As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I \nam monitoring the readiness of these Iraqi units. The viability of \nIraqi units must be measured by a series of indicators, including \nefforts to measure intangibles such as morale and unit cohesion, as \nwell as quantifying the military training of Iraqi Security Forces and \nthe distribution of weapons and equipment. As the Senator from \nConnecticut indicated, the quality of the weapons and equipment we \nprovide to the Iraqis must be of the caliber that contributes to the \ndiscipline, confidence, and morale of the Iraqis we are training. It is \nin the best interest of all that we move quickly to equip the Iraqi \nSecurity Forces with the proper equipment. We cannot ask the Iraqi \nSecurity Forces to conduct patrols or engage in battle in pickup trucks \nand SUVs while the embedded American forces are in up-armored HMMWVs \nand Bradley Fighting Vehicles. I am prepared to work with my colleague \nand the Secretary of Defense to provide suitable equipment for the \nIraqi Security Forces. I am also prepared to work with other elements \nof the administration to engage our Allies and partners in this effort. \nI, for one, do not believe we have time to build and then rebuild the \nIraqi Security Forces.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the chairman for his statement and applaud his \ncommitment to improving the availability of suitable equipment to the \nIraqi Security Forces. As I said before, I share his belief that our \nfirst obligation is to the safety and well-being of our men and women \ndeployed in harm's way. In that same token, I also appreciate his \nassertion that ensuring Iraqi troops have the equipment they need is in \nthe security interest of our Nation and our\n\n[[Page S12805]]\n\ntroops. I urge the administration to--make available to the Iraqis \nadequate force protection equipment as soon as possible to allow them \nto take the lead in Iraq, and, ultimately, operate independently in \nsecuring their own country.\n  As American forces upgrade their own armor and safety equipment, \nperhaps the Departments of Defense and State will consider making \navailable to Iraqi forces some of the older equipment of the United \nStates, to allow Iraqis the ability to operate side by side with \nAmerican forces. As U.S. forces upgrade their armored vehicles in Iraq, \nfrom what is called Level One protection to the more advanced Level Two \nprotection, we might wish to consider distributing these older vehicles \nto Iraqi forces. And perhaps, when American forces eventually withdraw \nfrom Iraq, the United States would further consider leaving their older \nLevel One armored fleet for use by the Iraqis. Another option might be \nto seek out other non-U.S. sources of armored vehicles to replace the \nsubstandard equipment that the Iraqis are currently using.\n  The sooner we can properly train and equip these Iraqi police and \nmilitary units, the sooner we can get our troops home safe and secure. \nAnd that must be our principal objective in completing Operation Iraqi \nFreedom.\n  I thank the Chairman for engaging in this colloquy.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to thank my colleagues, the \nsenior Senator from Virginia and the Senior Senator from Michigan, for \ntheir hard work in getting the fiscal year 2006 Defense authorization \nbill to the floor and for including in the bill two amendments I \noffered. These amendments will directly affect the quality of health \ncare we provide our Nation's armed forces.\n  As many of you know, the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, has \ncreated one of the most effective electronic medical records systems in \nthe Nation. Despite a number of problems at the VA--from funding \nshortfalls to delayed benefits--the electronic medical records system \nis one of the VA's great successes and serves as a national model. \nUnfortunately, the Department of Defense, DOD, has not created a \nsimilar system for members of the military.\n  Despite a significant expenditure of time and money, the Department \nof Defense appears to be far from completion of its system, the \nComposite Health Care System II, CHCS II. Consequently, we have \nsoldiers who have honorably served their country leaving the military \nand entering the VA system, and yet there is no easy way to transfer \ntheir medical records to the new health care system. This lack of \ncompatibility results in severe inefficiencies and delayed benefits for \nour veterans. This is a problem that the national veterans' service \norganizations have highlighted over the years, but despite their \nefforts, the Department of Defense is still lagging behind the VA.\n  The Government Accountability Office, in a report released last year, \nfound that one of the primary reasons for the Defense Department's \nsevere delays in producing a compatible medical records system is the \nlack of strong oversight of the process. My amendment is an effort to \nimplement some oversight. Pursuant to my amendment, 6 months after \nenactment of the bill, the DOD would be required to report to Congress \non the progress being made on the development of the CHCS II system, \nthe timeframe for implementation of the system, a cost estimate for \ncompletion of the system, and a description of the management structure \nused in the development of the system.\n  I also want to thank Senators Levin and Warner for accepting my \namendment requiring that DOD report to the Senate and House Armed \nServices Committees about its pandemic flu preparedness activities. \nWhen pandemic flu strikes, many of our military and civilian personnel \nwill be at high risk for infection, particularly those deployed in Asia \nwhere avian flu poses the greatest current risk; military and civilian \npersonnel in this country also will likely be involved in domestic \nresponse activities in the event of a pandemic. Our Nation's security \nis contingent on a healthy military, and we must ensure that these \nmembers will be protected.\n  It is Congress's duty to oversee the delivery of health care to our \nNation's soldiers, and these amendments will help in our efforts to \nexercise this oversight. I hope to work with the conferees on this \nauthorization bill to retain these provisions in conference.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, the Senate today is considering the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill for the 2006 fiscal year. As a \nmember of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I have attended numerous \nhearings and participated in the markup of this legislation. And I want \nto commend the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator \nWarner, and the ranking member, Senator Levin, for the serious, \nbipartisan approach they have taken in preparing this bill for \nconsideration on the Senate floor.\n  I just returned from an International Rule of Law symposium focusing \non the need to create an international rule of law movement. As we talk \ntoday about providing our troops with the support they need to serve \nour Nation, it is also important to recognize that we should be doing \nall we can to make sure that we are not tarnishing their service. As we \npromote the rule of law in other societies, we need to begin by \nrecognizing that the United States has a special heritage and a special \nresponsibility--a responsibility not to be perfect, for that is \nimpossible, but to admit our mistakes and use the rule of law to mend \nthem, not to cover them up. When we fail that standard, we harm the \nideals we most seek to promote--and undermine the foundations of our \nown society and our influence around the world.\n  That is why it is so important that we send a clear signal that the \nmistreatment of prisoners under our control was a mistake that will not \nhappen again. Our commitment to the rule of law demands it. The men and \nwomen who signed up to defend our country, not to defend accusations of \ntorture, deserve it.\n  It is very unclear whether any good information ever comes from \ntorture--many experienced intelligence officers say no. But it is \ncrystal clear that the bad consequences of this high-level political \ndecision will haunt us for years--in how hostile armies treat our \nsoldiers; how foreign governments judge our trustworthiness; and how \nforeign citizens respond to our best shared values, like faith in the \nrule of law.\n  This DOD authorization bill is critically important, particularly \nwith our service men and women serving bravely in Iraq, Afghanistan, \nand around the world. We owe it to our men and women in uniform to do \neverything we can to support them.\n  Back when we first considered the DOD authorization bill in July, the \nSenate accepted an amendment Senator Graham and I offered to make \nTricare available to all National Guard members and reservists.\n  This week, the Senate has accepted another amendment I offered--this \none with Senator Collins--that will improve financial education for our \nsoldiers. This is a problem that has plagued military service men and \nwomen for years: a lack of general knowledge about the insurance and \nother financial services available to them.\n  This amendment instructs the Secretary of Defense to carry out a \ncomprehensive education program for military members regarding public \nand private financial services, including life insurance and the \nmarketing practices of these services, available to them. This \neducation will be institutionalized in the initial and recurring \ntraining for members of the military. This is important so that we \ndon't just make an instantaneous improvement, but a truly lasting \nbenefit to members of the military.\n  This amendment also requires that counseling services on these issues \nbe made available, upon request, to members and their spouses. I think \nit is very important to include the spouses in this program, because we \nall know that investment decisions should be made as a family. Too many \ntimes, a military spouse has to make these decisions alone, while their \nhusband or wife is deployed.\n  This amendment requires that during counseling of members or spouses \nregarding life insurance, counselors must include information on the \navailability of Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance, SGLI, as well as \nother available\n\n[[Page S12806]]\n\nproducts. It requires that any junior enlisted member--those in the \ngrades of E1-E4--that they must provide confirmation that they have \nreceived counseling before entering into any new contract with a \nprivate sector life insurer. It is my expectation that this will help \nprevent our young troops from being taken advantage of by unscrupulous \ninsurance companies.\n  I am proud my fellow Senators support this legislation and I look \nforward to working hard during conference to ensure its incorporation \nin the final bill put before the President.\n  Today, I would also like to speak about several issues that, while \nunlikely to be brought up as amendments to this bill, we will have to \nseriously consider during conference.\n  The first is the extremely important issue of the role of women in \ncombat. In the House Armed Services Subcommittee markup of the Defense \nbill, a provision was inserted that would have turned back the clock on \nthe roles that women play in our military. The uproar over this \nprovision from the public and from the Pentagon was strong. General \nCody, the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, wrote a letter to the House \nArmed Services Committee explaining that such a provision would disrupt \nour forces serving overseas. The House Armed Services Committee \nwithdrew the offending provision and instead included a provision to \ncodify the Pentagon's 1994 policy regarding women in combat. I am \nuncertain that this policy needs to be codified and will be looking at \nthis language closely in conference.\n  Because of the House's efforts to restrict the role of women, I want \nto take a few minutes to recognize the enormous contributions that \nwomen have made and continue to make to our military.\n  Women have a long history of proud service in our Armed Forces. Women \nhave served on the battlefield as far back as the American Revolution, \nwhere they served as nurses, water bearers, cooks, laundresses, and \nsaboteurs. Since that time, opportunities have increased, especially \nsince 1948 when the Women's Armed Services Integration Act of 1948 was \npassed.\n  More than 200,000 women currently serve, making up approximately 17 \npercent of the total force. Thousands of women are currently serving \nbravely in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. During my own visits to \nIraq--and as I am sure that many of my colleagues who have also visited \nIraq can also attest--I witnessed women performing a wide range of \ntasks in a dangerous environment. In Iraq, the old distinctions between \nthe front lines and the rear are being blurred, and women are ably \nshouldering many of the same risks as men. And when I have met with \nwomen soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan, they have not complained that \nthey are being placed in harm's way. To the contrary, they have \nexpressed pride in being able to contribute to the mission.\n  At a time when our Armed Forces are struggling to meet recruiting and \nretention goals, it makes no sense to further restrict the role of our \nwomen in uniform. Doing so would only add to the strain on our Armed \nForces and undermine the morale of our service members.\n  Since September 11, our Armed Forces have stretched to meet new and \ngrowing needs. It is essential that we fu1ly utilize and retain \npersonnel. Women in uniform have increasingly served in the line of \nfire, performing honorably and courageously in service to our country. \nOver 100,000 women have been deployed in support of military operations \nsince September 11. Imagine the strain that our forces would suffer if \nmany of these women were suddenly deemed ineligible to serve in their \ncurrent roles.\n  Our soldiers, both men and women, volunteered to serve their Nation. \nThey are performing magnificently. There should be no change to \nexisting policies that would decrease the roles or positions available \nto women in the Armed Forces. Earlier this year, I introduced, along \nwith several of my colleagues, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution stating \nthat there should be no change to existing laws, policies or \nregulations that would decrease the roles or positions available to \nwomen in the Armed forces.\n  As we approach the conference, I will oppose any efforts that would \nsend a negative signal to women currently serving and I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in preserving the ability of women to fully \nserve their country.\n  As we talk about honoring those who serve, I would also like to draw \nthe attention of my colleagues to another piece of legislation that I \nhave introduced in the Senate, the Cold War Medal Act of 2005.\n  It is important that we remember and honor the contributions of all \nveterans, from our World War II veterans to those just returning from \nIraq. It is especially important that we not forget those who served \nduring the Cold War, a decades-long struggle that, even in the absence \nof a formal declaration of hostilities, was for nothing less than the \nfuture of the world.\n  Our victory in the Cold War was made possible by the willingness of \nmillions of Americans in uniform to stand prepared against the threat \nfrom behind the Iron Curtain.\n  That is why I have introduced legislation, S. 1351, the Cold War \nMedal Act of 2005, to create a military service medal to members of the \nArmed Forces who served honorably during the Cold War.\n  This is the companion bill to legislation that was introduced on the \nHouse side by Congressman Andrews. This legislation would establish a \nCold War Medal for those who served at least 180 days from September 2, \n1945 to December 26, 1991. About 4.8 million veterans would be eligible \nto receive this medal.\n  Our victory in the Cold War was a tremendous accomplishment and the \nmen and women who served during that time deserve to be recognized. \nThis legislation has been included in the House-passed version of the \nDefense authorization bill and I intend to encourage my colleagues in \nboth the House and Senate to support its inclusion in the bill that \nemerges from the House-Senate conference.\n  It is also important that we honor those men and women who are \ncurrently serving. One issue that has come to my attention is the \nstatus of National Guard members who served at Ground Zero in the \naftermath of September 11. In the rush to send National Guard members \nto Ground Zero immediately after the attacks on September 11, New \nYork's Governor activated them in their State status. However, many of \nthese Guard men and women ended up serving at Ground Zero for over a \nyear. Since they were in their State status, these Guard men and women \ndid not qualify for Federal retirement credits. However, other New York \nNational Guardsmen who were activated to protect Federal installations \nafter September 11 were activated in their Federal status. The result \nwas that two groups of Guardsmen were created. Each group served \nhonorably after September 11, but the Guardsmen serving at Ground Zero \ndid not earn retirement credit, while the Guardsmen protecting Federal \ninstallations did earn that credit. Several months ago, I introduced \nlegislation, S. 1144, to remedy this injustice. This legislation was \nincluded in the House's version of the Defense authorization bill and I \nwill once again urge my colleagues to support this in the House-Senate \nconference on the legislation.\n  One issue that is not addressed in either the House or the Senate \nversion of the Defense authorization bill is our spending priorities \nfor science and technology at the Defense Advanced Research Projects \nAgency, DARPA. I would like to use the remainder of my time to raise \nsome concerns that I have regarding the Department of Defense's \ninvestments in science and technology and disturbing trends in our \ninvestments in the longer term, basic research--investments that will \ndevelop the next generation of capabilities on which our military \nsuperiority will depend. To put it plainly, I am concerned that DARPA \nis losing its focus on basic and early stage research.\n  The Department's science and technology programs make investments in \nresearch at our nation's universities and innovative high-tech small \nbusinesses in areas such as robotics, artificial intelligence, and \nnanotechnology. In the past, we have seen these investments grow into \nrevolutionary capabilities that our military takes for granted today. \nWe have seen the fruits of these investments support our efforts in the \nglobal war on terrorism and operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n[[Page S12807]]\n\n  That is why I am concerned that the Department of Defense seems to be \nsystematically underinvesting in fundamental and long-term research \nprograms that will shape the military of the future. I note that the \nDepartment's science and technology request for 2006 was down $2.8 \nbillion from the 2005 appropriated level and even $28 million below the \noriginal 2005 budget request. In fact, the request is so low it has \ntriggered a congressionally mandated Defense Science Board review of \nthe effects of the lowered S investment on national security. I look \nforward to seeing the results of that review. I am pleased that this \nbill has increased those funding levels by over $400 million. While I \nunderstand the need to focus efforts on current events and operational \nissues--we cannot do it at the expense of sacrificing the research base \nthat shapes the military of the future.\n  Of particular concern to me are the trends in funding of DOD's \npremier research agency. DARPA has been the engine of defense \ninnovation for nearly 50 years--spawning innovations such as the \nInternet, unmanned air vehicles, and stealth capability--a record of \nunmatched technological accomplishments of which we should all be \nproud. However, I am concerned that in recent years--despite tremendous \noverall budgetary increases--DARPA has lost some of its unique, \ninnovative character and is no longer funding the ``blue sky'' research \nfor which it is famous.\n  Concern over DOD's, and especially DARPA's support for early stage \nresearch has come from a number of distinguished scientific circles. \nThe National Academy of Sciences, in a recent report requested by the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, recommended that ``DOD should redress \nthe imbalance between its current basic research allocation'' and its \nneeds to support new technology areas, new researchers, and especially \nmore unfettered or long-term research.\n  President Bush's own Information Technology Advisory Committee, \nPITAC, recently noted that DARPA had decreased funding in the critical \narea of cybersecurity research, stating, ``. . . very little, if any, \nof DARPA's substantial cybersecurity R investment was directed \ntowards fundamental research.'' They also noted a ``shift in DARPA's \nportfolio towards classified and short-term research and development \nand away from its traditional support of unclassified longer-term \nR''\n  The Defense Science Board has also raised concerns over DARPA's \nfunding of computer science, stating that DARPA has further limited \nuniversity participation in its computer science programs. These \nlimitations have arisen in a number of ways, including non-fiscal \nlimitations, such as the classification of work in areas that were \npreviously unclassified, precluding university submission as prime \ncontractors on certain solicitations, and reducing the periods of \nperformance to 18-24 months.'' That kind of short term-focus is not \nconducive to university programs or to addressing broad, fundamental \ntechnical challenges--especially when research in computer science is \nhelping develop and shape our networked forces of the future.\n  I know that our chairman, Senator Warner, is also a great supporter \nof DOD research programs and the committee has taken a number of steps \nto ensure that these programs are well-managed and adequately funded. \nIn addition to the National Academy study that I mentioned above, the \nSenate Armed Services Committee has initiated a Defense Science Board, \nDSB, review of the position of the Director of Defense Research and \nEngineering. This position also serves as the Chief Technology Officer \nof DOD, and the head of all science and technology programs. The \ncommittee has been concerned that the position does not have adequate \nauthority to advocate for S budgets or ensure that Services and DARPA \nprograms are well-coordinated into a broader defense technology \nstrategy. I understand that the DSB should report out its findings \nsometime later this year.\n  I hope the members of the Armed Services Committee, and indeed the \nentire Senate, will consider carefully the findings of these expert, \nindependent studies and reports. At a time when we are so dependent on \ntechnologies to combat IEDs, treat battlefield injuries, and defend our \nhomeland, we should make sure that DOD's science and technology \norganizations--especially DARPA--are adequately funded, well managed, \nand investing in the development of capabilities for the battlefields \nof both today and tomorrow.\n  I look forward to working with the committee to look closely at DARPA \nand the entire DOD S program. Although we should be clearly focused \non the issues our troops are facing here at home, in Iraq, Afghanistan \nand elsewhere, we cannot afford to lose sight of the important role \nthat scientific research plays in developing the military of the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with my colleagues in the \nArmed Services committee and in the Senate as well as the House on the \nissues that I have discussed today.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise to support the Defense \nauthorization bill for the 2006 fiscal year, and to comment on several \namendments to the bill that build on the good work of the Armed \nServices Committee under the leadership of Chairman Warner and Ranking \nMember Levin.\n  I am pleased that this bill includes an amendment I offered to create \na grant program for employment services provided to the spouses of \ncertain members of the Armed Forces. Many of our men and women in \nuniform change duty stations every 2 to 5 years, wreaking havoc on \ntheir spouses' careers. Additionally, when Reservists and National \nGuardsmen are called to active duty, many of their spouses enter the \nworkforce to make up the difference between civilian and military pay.\n  It is not just those in uniform who make sacrifices for this country. \nMilitary families need our support as well. My amendment would create a \nDoD grant program for workforce boards established under the Workforce \nInvestment Act of 1998. Many of these centers already provide \nemployment services for military spouses through the National Emergency \nGrant fund under the Department of Labor, but this fund has been \nseverely strained.\n  This DOD grant program will provide assistance to spouses who have \nlost their job to accommodate a servicemember's permanent change in \nduty station. It will also assist spouses who have experienced a \nreduction in family income due to a servicemember's deployment, \ndisability, death or the activation of a National Guardsman or \nReservist.\n  Helping our military families cope with the disruption that comes \nwith deployment cycles and frequent moves is the least we can do, and I \nthank the managers for including my amendment.\n  I have also cosponsored an amendment with Senator Landrieu that will \nallow up to $10 million under Title VI, the Defense Health Program, to \nbe used for mental health screenings for members of the Armed Forces.\n  Mental health experts predict that because of the intensity of \nwarfare in Iraq and Afghanistan 15 percent or more of the \nservicemembers returning from these conflicts will develop post-\ntraumatic stress disorder, PTSD. This nearly equals the PTSD rate for \nVietnam War veterans, and the Veterans Affairs' National Center for \nPost Traumatic Stress Disorder estimates rates of PTSD could reach as \nhigh as 30 percent.\n  Additionally, concussions both small and large can cause what is \nknown as Traumatic Brain Injury, or TBI. While there are no service-\nwide figures available on how many troops are affected by TBIs, doctors \nat Walter Reed found that 67 percent of the casualties they treated in \na 6-month period had brain injuries. This is far higher than the 20 \npercent figure that military doctors documented in Vietnam and other \nmodern wars. Because of the number of soldiers affected by TBIs they \nare being called the ``signature injury'' of the war.\n  Rates of TBI in Iraq and Afghanistan are high because of soldiers' \nfrequent exposure to improvised explosive devices. Thanks to dramatic \nimprovements to body armor and vehicle armor in recent years, these \nexplosions, thankfully, often do not kill a soldier. But the blast jars \ntheir brain, often causing bruising or permanent damage. Studies of \nveterans who suffered TBIs\n\n[[Page S12808]]\n\nin previous wars indicate that they experience cognitive deficits in \nsocial behavior, reasoning, attention, and planning that need effective \ndiagnosis and rehabilitation.\n  Without more mental health screenings, too many of these injuries \nwill continue to go undiagnosed. This amendment will help to diagnose \nsoldiers earlier, and improve their long-term quality of life. I am \npleased that it has been included in the bill.\n  This bill also includes an amendment I authored to allow the Office \nof Special Events within the Department of Defense to provide more \nsupport to paralympic competitions in the United States. This is a \nmatter of basic fairness. The Pentagon currently supports Olympic and \nother international games. This amendment just makes it easier for the \nPentagon to support such competitions and this is especially important \nnow, as so many of our seriously injured servicemembers are working to \nrebuild their lives and find new outlets for their drive and \ndetermination.\n  This bill also contains an amendment I authored as a result of a \nletter I received from one of my constituents. He is an Army specialist \nand is currently deployed to Iraq. He wrote to me because one of his \nfriends was killed by an IED while sitting in the exposed gunner's seat \nof a Humvee. His letter reads as follows:\n\n       Two days ago a good friend of mine was killed in action \n     when an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) detonated next to \n     his M1114 Humvee. He was sitting in the gunner seat and \n     pulling rear security. I have seen automated guns that can go \n     on the top of these same Humvees. These guns are controlled \n     from inside the vehicle. Why are these guns not on every \n     Humvee? I do not have the time or the resources over here to \n     check, but if you were to look into it I believe you would be \n     shocked at the percentage of KIA's that were sitting in the \n     gunner's seat of Humvees since OIF 1 in 2003. All I do know \n     is that the four people that were inside the vehicle were \n     physically unharmed. If the answer is money, then I would \n     really like to know how much my friend's life was worth.\n\n  Since receiving that letter I have been in close contact with the \nPentagon about the technology this young specialist is referring to. \nThe Common Remotely Operated Weapons Station, known as CROWS, can move \nour soldiers out of the exposed gunner's seat and inside the protective \nshell of an up-armored Humvee.\n  In a CROWS-equipped vehicle, the gunner controls a powerful weapons \nplatform through a computer screen. The system can be mounted on a \nvariety of platforms, and it gives a solder the capability to acquire \nand engage targets while protected inside the vehicle, out of range of \nenemy fire or IED attacks.\n  Right now we have a few of these systems deployed in Iraq, and I am \ntold that our soldiers ``hot seat'' them, which means that when one of \nthese Humvees comes back from a patrol or an escort mission, another \ngroup of soldiers takes the vehicle out again as soon as they can gas \nit up.\n  My amendment would express the sense of the Senate that the \nadministration should ask for full funding of this program in their \nnext supplemental budget request. I appreciate the managers' support \nfor my efforts to send a strong signal to the Pentagon about this \nimportant priority.\n  Another amendment, which I cosponsored, will resolve the last \nremaining obstacle to the creation of the Rocky Flats National Wildlife \nRefuge. The amendment authorizes the Department of Energy to spend up \nto $10 million to acquire the mineral interests on four parcels of land \nwithin the tentative boundaries of the refuge. These mineral interests \nwould be acquired from willing sellers. The Departments of Energy and \nInterior agree that these four parcels represent the areas which \ninclude sand and gravel deposits of sufficient value that future mining \nis possible and which also include significant and unique ecological \nvalues that should be protected as part of the refuge.\n  This amendment also resolves the potential claims for natural \nresource damages that might arise in the future as a result of releases \nof hazardous substances that have already been identified in the \nlengthy administrative record of the Rocky Flats cleanup. The State of \nColorado trustees with responsibility to pursue such claims, the \nColorado attorney general, the director of the Colorado Department of \nNatural Resources, and the director of the Colorado Department of \nPublic Health and the Environment, all agree that the expenditure of \n$10 million to acquire these mineral interests is fair compensation for \nthe waiver of potential Natural Resource Damage claims. The release of \nhazardous materials not previously identified would not be waived by \nthis amendment, and the Department of Energy would remain liable for \nsuch releases, if any.\n  As our brave men and women in uniform continue to perform so \nadmirably in tremendously difficult conditions, and as their families \ncontinue to make their own sacrifices, it is vitally important that the \nSenate has finally acted on this bill. I am committed to continuing to \nwork with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to give our troops \nthe support that they deserve.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate was finally \nable to debate and pass the Defense authorization bill. It was \ninexcusable that this bill that is so critical to our men and women in \nuniform was allowed to languish for over half a year. Vital defense \npolicies are set every year in the authorization bill, including \npolicies with a direct impact on military families such as pay and \nbenefits. I am very pleased that we were able to include a 3.1 percent \npay raise for all of our men and women in uniform and am proud of the \nSenate's strong bipartisan efforts to make TRICARE available for the \nGuard and Reserve. I was pleased to support these efforts and the \nsuccessful efforts to eliminate the SBP-DIC offset and reduce the \nretirement age for those in the Reserve component.\n  One of the key policy debates that took place during the Senate's \nconsideration of this bill involved our Nation's Iraq policy. For \nmonths, I have been calling on the President to provide a flexible, \npublic timetable for completing our mission in Iraq and for withdrawing \nour troops once that mission is complete. I am not calling for a rigid \ntimetable I mean one that is tied to clear and achievable benchmarks, \nwith estimated dates for meeting those benchmarks. I worked with some \nof my distinguished Democratic colleagues in the Senate to draft an \namendment that demanded just that, and I am pleased that 40 Members of \nthe Senate agreed that we need a flexible timetable for achieving our \nmilitary mission in Iraq and withdrawing our troops. They recognize \nwhat increasing numbers of military leaders and experts are saying, \nthat having such a timeline will help us defeat the insurgency.\n  Our servicemembers deserve to know what their military mission is and \nwhen they can expect to achieve it. And the American people deserve to \nknow that we have a plan, tied to clear benchmarks, for achieving our \nmilitary goals and redeploying our troops out of Iraq so we can focus \non our most pressing national security priority, defeating the global \nterrorists who threaten this country. I will keep fighting for a \ntimeframe for our military mission and I am heartened by the fact that \nan increasing number of my Senate colleagues agree with me, and with \nthe American people, on the need for such a timeframe.\n  I am pleased that the Senate passed my amendment to enhance and \nstrengthen the transition services that are provided to our military \npersonnel by making a number of improvements to the existing transition \nand post-deployment/pre-discharge health assessment programs. My \namendment will ensure that members of the National Guard and Reserve \nwho have been on active duty continuously for at least 180 days are \nable to participate in transition programs and requires that additional \ninformation be included in these transition programs, such as details \nabout employment and reemployment rights and a description of the \nhealth care and other benefits to which personnel may be entitled \nthrough the VA. The amendment also requires that demobilizing military \npersonnel have access to follow-up care for physical or psychological \nconditions incurred as a result of their service. In addition, the \namendment requires that assistance be provided to eligible military \npersonnel to enroll in the VA health care system. I thank the chairman \nand the Ranking Member for their assistance on this important issue.\n  This bill also contains a provision I authored establishing the \nCivilian Linguist Reserve Corps, CLRC, pilot project. It became \nabundantly clear\n\n[[Page S12809]]\n\nafter the attacks of September 11, 2001, that the U.S. Government had a \ndearth of critical language skills. The 9/11 Commission report \ndocumented the disastrous consequences of this deficiency that, \nunfortunately, we still have not made enough progress in addressing 4 \nyears after the 9/11 tragedy.\n  CLRC is designed to address the Government's critical language \nshortfall by creating a pool of people with advanced language skills \nthat the Federal Government could call on to assist when needed. The \nNational Security Education Program completed a feasibility study of \nCLRC and concluded that the concept was sound and ``an important step \nin addressing both short- and long-term shortfalls related to language \nassets in the national security community.'' It also recommended that a \n3-year pilot project be conducted to work out any potential problems. \nMy amendment establishes this pilot project. I want to thank the \nmanagers of the bill for working with me to include this worthwhile \nmeasure and thank Senator Coleman for cosponsoring my amendment.\n  I also want to thank the bill managers for continuing to work with me \nin assisting the families of injured servicemembers. I was pleased that \nCongress included my amendment on travel benefits for the family of \ninjured servicemembers in the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act \nfor Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Tsunami Relief of 2005, P.L. \n109-13. My amendment corrected a flaw in the law that unintentionally \nrestricted the number of families of injured servicemembers that \nqualify for travel assistance. Too many families were being denied help \nin visiting their injured loved ones because the Army had not \nofficially listed them as ``seriously injured,'' even though these men \nand women have been evacuated out of the combat zone to the United \nStates for treatment. The change in the law now ensures that families \nof injured servicemembers evacuated to a U.S. hospital get at least one \ntrip paid for so that these families can quickly reunite and begin \nrecovering from the trauma they have experienced. I introduced my \namendment to this bill because the family travel provision in P.L. 109-\n13 was sunset at the end of the 2005 fiscal year by the conferees. I \nthank the Senate for adopting my amendment that will make the provision \npermanent.\n\n  The Senate also adopted an amendment I authored requiring the \nDepartment of Defense to report on the steps it is taking to clearly \ncommunicate the stop-loss policy to potential enlistees and re-\nenlistees. One of my constituents, a sergeant in the Army, wrote to me \nearlier this year articulating his frustration with the Army's stop-\nloss policy. He had been scheduled to be released from service prior to \nhis unit's deployment to Iraq but the stop-loss order kept him in \nuniform making him feel that his service was completely unappreciated. \nPart of this sergeant's frustration and the frustration experienced by \nothers who have been put under stop-loss orders stems from the fact \nthat many don't know that the military can keep them beyond their \ncontractual date of separation. They may find out about this policy \nonly shortly before they are deployed to a war zone, as was the case \nwith my constituent. This situation is simply unacceptable.\n  The sergeant who shared his story with me was killed in Iraq only \ndays after he wrote his letter. With thousands of soldiers still on \nstop-loss, I am certain that similar tragic stories have played out \nmany times over the last few years. The very least we owe those who \nvolunteer to serve our Nation is full disclosure of the terms under \nwhich they are volunteering. My amendment includes a finding that \nstates exactly that. I hope that, by pushing the Department to report \non the actions it is taken to ensure that potential recruits know the \nterms of their service, the Department will take quick action to do \njust that. One good place for it to start would be to revise DOD Form \n4/1, Enlistment/Reenlistment Document, the service contract new \nenlistees and reenlistees must sign to join the military. Form 4/1 does \nnot currently include information that tells those joining the active \ncomponent that they may be kept on stop-loss during partial \nmobilizations. The Department must immediately fix this flaw and take \nother steps to clearly communicate to our men and women in uniform the \nterms under which they are volunteering to serve.\n  Congress has a crucial role in defense oversight and I am \ndisappointed that the Senate has again failed to adopt Senator Dorgan's \namendment that would have created a Truman Committee to oversee our \nefforts in Iraq. This measure was a commonsense way to assure that we \ncarry out our policies in the most effect way possible and not, as now, \nwaste millions if not billions of taxpayer dollars. After all, our \nshared goal is to get needed resources to our troops and rebuilding \nefforts not to profiteers.\n  One measure the Senate adopted that should assist in our oversight \nresponsibilities is my amendment requiring DOD to report on how it will \naddress deficiencies related to key military equipment. According to a \nrecent GAO report, DOD has not done a good job in replacing equipment \nthat is being rapidly worn out due to the military's high operational \ntempo or even tracking its equipment needs. Military readiness has \nsuffered as a result. My amendment requires DOD to submit a report in \nconjunction with the President's annual budget request that details \nDOD's program strategies and funding plans to ensure that DOD's budget \ndecisions address these equipment deficiencies. Specifically, the \nDepartment must detail its plans to sustain and modernize key equipment \nsystems until they are retired or replaced, report the costs associated \nwith the sustainment and modernization of key equipment, and identify \nthese funds in the Future Years Defense Program. Finally, if the \nDepartment chooses to delay or not fully fund their plan, it must \ndescribe the risks involved and the steps it is taking to mitigate \nthose risks.\n  Although I am voting for the Department of Defense authorization \nbill, I am disappointed with the mixed messages that the Senate \ncontinues to send to the administration and the country on issues \nrelated to the detainees held at Guantanamo Bay. Even as the Senate \npassed the important McCain amendment on torture, the Senate also \nincluded in this bill the Graham amendment, which even as modified \nwould still eliminate habeas review for detainees at Guantanamo Bay. \nThe modification worked out by Senators Graham and Levin would provide \ndetainees with only limited review in the DC Circuit of the procedures \nfor determining whether they are enemy combatants and the procedures \nthe military commissions used to try them. This is an improvement over \nthe original amendment offered by Senator Graham, but it would not \nallow a court to review any claim that an individual detainee is not, \nin fact, an enemy combatant. I was very disappointed that this became \npart of this bill, although I am pleased with the amendment's ban on \nthe use of evidence obtained by undue coercion. It is troubling that \nafter 4 years of congressional acquiescence to the administration on \nthis issue, it took a Supreme Court decision allowing habeas review for \nthe Senate to take action. It is good that the Senate is finally paying \nattention to this issue, but this amendment is the wrong result. It \nsends the wrong message about this country's commitment to basic \nfundamental fairness and the rule of law.\n  I must also note with some disappointment that this bill continues \nthe wasteful trend of spending billions of dollars on Cold War era \nweapons systems while at the same time not fully funding the needs of \nthe military personnel fighting our current wars. I think the Senate \nmissed some opportunities when it rejected amendments that could have \nmade the bill better. However, on balance this legislation contains \nmany good provisions for our men and women in uniform and their \nfamilies and that is why I support it.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to speak in support of the important \namendment on Iraq offered by my colleague Senator Levin. I am pleased \nto have worked with many of my Democratic colleagues on this amendment \nand to be an original cosponsor.\n  Mr. President, 2006 will be the pivotal year in determining whether \nwe can successfully complete our mission in Iraq and bring our troops \nhome in a reasonable amount of time. As we enter this make or break \nperiod, the\n\n[[Page S12810]]\n\nadministration must finally adopt a realistic, clear, and comprehensive \nstrategy.\n  This Democratic amendment lays out many of the principles that should \nguide that strategy, including using all of our diplomatic, military, \npolitical and economic leverage to defeat the insurgency, getting \ngreater international support for the reconstruction effort, \nstrengthening the capacity of Iraq's governing ministries, and training \nIraqi security forces. And it requires the administration to regularly \nreport back to Congress and the American public on the status of \nimplementing the measures necessary to complete the mission.\n  As we know from painful experience, no President can sustain a war \nwithout the support of the American people. In the case of Iraq, their \npatience is frayed nearly to the breaking point because Americans who \ncare deeply about their country will not tolerate our troops giving \ntheir lives without a clear strategy, and will not tolerate vague \nplatitudes when real answers are needed.\n  The Democratic amendment addresses that by calling on the \nadministration to give Congress and the American public a target \nschedule for achieving the conditions that will allow for the phased \nredeployment of U.S. troops, the status of efforts meet that schedule, \nand the estimated dates for such redeployment.\n  Let's be very clear on this point: the Democratic amendment does not \ncall for setting any arbitrary deadlines for withdrawal of U.S. troops. \nIt envisions redeployment of U.S. forces as conditions allow. But it \nrejects the administration's hollow, vague declaration to just ``stay \nas long as it takes'' by calling on the administration to give target \ndates and regular updates on reaching those conditions.\n  For far too long, Congress and the American public have been left in \nthe dark when it comes to Iraq. We have repeatedly been asked by the \nadministration to take their word that they have a strategy for \nsuccess, without being given any sense of what that is or when our \ntroops will be home. It is past time for Congress and the American \npeople to be fully informed about what our strategy is, the progress \nthat is being made in implementing it, and when we might expect to see \nour troops redeployed. That is what the Levin amendment will do.\n  While the Democratic amendment and the Republican amendment offered \nby Senators Warner and Frist are a wakeup call to the Bush \nadministration that there is an overwhelming bipartisan majority with \ndeep concerns about the administration's aimless course in Iraq, I will \nnot support the Warner-Frist amendment because it stripped out two of \nthe key provisions of the Democratic amendment. The first is the sense \nof the Senate that America should let the Iraqi people know that we \nwill not stay in Iraq indefinitely, which will send an important \nmessage about our intentions while reducing the sense of U.S. \noccupation. The second is the requirement that the administration \nprovide a report to Congress that includes estimated dates for the \nredeployment of U.S. troops as specific conditions are met, which is \nnecessary to keep Congress and the American public informed about our \nprogress towards the ultimate goal of finishing our mission and getting \nour troops home. These provisions are an essential part of a real \nstrategy for success in Iraq. We owe our troops and the country nothing \nless.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the passage of the bill, as \namended.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Together they have led a dedicated professional \nstaff, all of whom deserve credit and recognition in helping Members \nreach agreements and to prepare all types of information needed by the \nMembers, and I may say to give good, sound advice. I have always \nencouraged that of our staff. They are not just to be there to be \n``yessayers'' or naysayers.

Mr. President, as we stand in this great Chamber, I \nmarvel at the work conducted by the Armed Services Committee since the \nbeginning of the 109th Congress. The committee has conducted 46 \nhearings and received numerous policy and operational briefings on the \nPresident's budget request for 2006 and related defense issues. Since \nthe committee reported out this important legislation on May 12, the \nSenate has debated many important provisions contained in this \nlegislation. Along the way, there have been many contentious issues to \nresolve, such as detainee policy, missile defense, BRAC, and many \nothers.\n  After a total of 12 days of debate on the Senate floor, we have now \nresolved them. I am proud we have achieved our goal of passing this \nimportant bill. This marks the 46th year the Senate has passed a \nnational defense authorization bill. I thank particularly my ranking \nmember and my colleagues for their support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we would not be at this point in our \ndeliberations, we could not have arrived at this point on the road \nwithout our chairman, Senator John Warner, who is not only a person who \nis eminently fair--he is invariably that, fair--he is unflappable. \nDespite his passion for the men and women of the military, he is \nunflappable when it comes to getting things done in a very calm, \ndeliberative, and bipartisan manner. I am proud to serve in this Senate \nfor many reasons but not the least of them is being able to be a friend \nand colleague of John Warner of Virginia, truly a gentleman.\n  Our staff, as he has pointed out, has made it possible for us to be \nhere as well. We function on a bipartisan basis. We obviously have \ndisagreements at times. We are always able to work those out in an \nagreeable way or disagree in an agreeable way. We have been able to \nbring the bill to the floor again with the help of our bipartisan \nstaff. We are glad Charlie Abell is back on our side of the Potomac \nagain where he belongs. Dick DeBobes, as the chairman pointed out, \nleads our minority staff with distinction. I probably should not single \nout any other member of our staff, but I want to mention Peter Levine \nbecause of the unusual circumstance we found ourselves in where his \nparticular expertise made it possible for us to resolve this issue \nrelative to detainees. It is most needed and appreciated by all of us.\n  I think I can speak for both Senator Warner and myself when I say \nthat our staffs not only work together, as Senator Warner has \nindicated, but make it possible for us to reach the point where we are.\n  I wanted to add my thanks, and now on to conference, which is always \nfun. We have had more bumps on the road this year than I can remember \nin any prior year for an authorization bill. We were on the floor, off \nthe floor, on the floor, off the floor for various reasons which we \ndon't need to recount. Hopefully, the road ahead of us will be smoother \nand we can come out of conference, I guess now would be early in the \nnext year.\n\n[[Page S12812]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we won't make any predictions. We will get \nstarted and do our best. I thank my good friend and look forward to \nworking with him again next year. We have truly formed a unique \npartnership, the two of us together. I thank so many Senators who \nrecognize that he and I have a trusting partnership and resolved a lot \nof problems that otherwise could prove contentious and maybe not had a \nresolution. So to the next year.\n  I must say, I have consulted with the Senator from Michigan. Both of \nus have great concern about the IED problem. We are going to have one \nmore hearing, in all probability a closed hearing, on this subject, \nlistening to some viewpoints in the private sector. We regularly meet \nwith those in the Department of Defense who have the primary \njurisdiction over this problem. This is one issue on which I am gravely \nconcerned and over which I lose sleep at night, as I am sure all of us \ndo, about the frightful weaponry the insurgents are employing and how \nbest we can put the entire country to work to resolve this problem.\n  I thank my good friend.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if I may very briefly respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I commend our chairman for the initiative \nwhich he has shown on the IED issue. We had a hearing a few weeks ago \non this issue which was one of the most fascinating and I think one of \nthe most important hearings our committee has held, at least that I can \nremember, exclusively on the IED issue. It was under the chairman's \nleadership that we did this. I think it was a significant hearing.\n  This committee has been absolutely dedicated to doing everything we \npossibly can in addressing this threat. We have done everything we know \nhow to do, but we still have not solved the problem. As the chairman \nmentioned, we are looking for additional technologies, additional ways \nin which this problem can be addressed.\n  I did want to mention that hearing because I thought it was unusually \nimportant.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my good friend; again, a \npartnership effort to achieve that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/15/senate-section/article/S12812-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 2862\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report to accompany H.R. 2862, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2862) making appropriations for Science, the Departments of \n     State, Justice, and Commerce, and related agencies for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 2006, and for other \n     purposes, having met, have agreed that the House recede from \n     its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate to the text, \n     and agree to the same with an amendment, and the Senate agree \n     to the same, that the Senate recede from its amendment to the \n     title of the bill, signed by a majority of conferees on the \n     part of both Houses.\n\n  (The conference report was printed in the House proceedings of \nNovember 7, 2005.)\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I would like to begin by thanking Senator \nMikulski, the distinguished ranking member of this subcommittee. The \nSenator from Maryland and I have worked in a bipartisan manner to \nproduce the bill that is now before the Senate.\n  I thank Chairman Wolf and Congressman Mollohan. They have worked with \nus to resolve some considerable differences in our two bills, and I \ncommend them for their efforts.\n  Finally, I thank Chairman Cochran, the chairman of the full \nAppropriations Committee.\n  The bill before us today is the conference report for H.R. 2862, the \nScience, State, Justice and Commerce appropriations bill. Overall, this \nis a very good bill. Make no mistake, this was a lean year, a very lean \nyear. The subcommittee's 302(b) allocation did not account for several \nsizeable programs which were proposed for termination in the \nadministration's budget, which this subcommittee restored.\n  In the Senate, the subcommittee that I chair is called the Commerce, \nJustice, Science and Related Agencies, CJS, Appropriations \nSubcommittee. The Senate CJS Subcommittee no longer has jurisdiction \nover the operations budget of the State Department, which has been \nmerged with the Foreign Operations Subcommittee. Under a previous \narrangement, however, the State Department is being considered under \nthe House framework, therefore the bill before the Senate is the \nScience, State, Justice and Commerce Appropriations conference report.\n  The bill that we are considering today provides a total of $61.8 \nbillion in budget authority to agencies under the bill's jurisdiction, \nincluding the State Department. For those agencies under the Senate \nsubcommittee's jurisdiction--the Departments of Commerce and Justice, \nNASA, NSF, and others--approximately $52.2 billion in budget authority \nis provided.\n  The bill includes an increase of just over $1 billion above the \nbudget request for the Department of Justice. The bulk of this increase \nis due to the restoration of many of the proposed cuts to State and \nlocal law enforcement grant programs.\n  The bill provides $6.5 million for the Department of Commerce. \nSeveral programs within the Department of Commerce were proposed for \ntermination in the President's fiscal year 2006 budget. This bill \nrestores funding for these programs, among them the Economic \nDevelopment Administration and the Public Telecommunications \nFacilities, Planning and Construction grants.\n  The bill provides increases for NASA to move forward with the vision \nthe President has proposed, while fulfilling our commitments to \nimportant existing programs.\n  At a time when there are so many demands being made on scarce Federal \ndollars, difficult decisions had to be made. We have tried to address \nthe priorities that so many of our colleagues brought to our attention. \nThough we were able to accommodate many of our colleagues' requests, we \nwere obviously not able to do everything everyone has requested.\n  I believe that we endeavored to produce a bill that is bipartisan and \nthat, we feel, serves the need of this country and we were successful.\n  I yield to Senator Mikulski, my esteemed ranking member, for her \nstatement.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, Senator Shelby and I have worked on a \nbipartisan basis to bring this bill back to the floor as a conference \nreport. We are in agreement with the principles of the bill so we are \nable to bring the bill forward. On our side, we estimate that we have \nthree other speakers. We note the Senator from Minnesota is in the \nChamber and he wishes to speak. There are two others whom we expect to \nspeak.\n  This is a new subcommittee. The VA-HUD Subcommittee on Appropriations\n\n[[Page S12813]]\n\nwas dismantled and farmed out to different subcommittees, so some parts \ncame to the Commerce Committee and the Justice Committee, and now we \ncall it the Science Committee. It has a fantastic jurisdiction. Its \njurisdiction is focused on saving lives and saving livelihoods. It is \nabout investing in innovation through science and technology for our \ncountry's future, and it is about looking out for our communities and \njustice system.\n  Despite a tough allocation, I believe this bill, as completed, is \nfair and we have done the best we could. The Commerce Department \noversees many agencies, some of which are very important Federal labs \nsuch as NOAA and the National Institute of Standards. The Department of \nJustice is on the front line. It funds the FBI, DEA, the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the U.S. Marshals Service, and the U.S. \nAttorneys.\n  These are not just agencies; these are men and women who every single \nday are trying to find those people who are often criminals in our \ncountry, those who have committed terrible acts of arson. In my own \nhome State, they detected the sniper who held the capital region at bay \na few years ago. It is our U.S. attorneys, America's DAs, who are \nprosecuting drug dealers, organized crime, and white-collar crime, and \nalso chairing the task forces on homeland security.\n  The Justice Department tries to protect us from terrorists and \nprotect our neighborhoods and our communities. It also provides grants \nto State and local law enforcement and helps fight gang violence. This \nyear, this bill provides $21 billion to the Justice Department. That is \n$800 million more than last year. The Justice Department accounts for \nalmost 50 percent of the entire cost of our bill. The FBI, with \ntremendous responsibility to fight both crime and to find terrorists, \nwill receive $5.7 billion. This is a $500 million increase over last \nyear. It will focus on things such as counterterrorism, in which we \nthen try to use this as a domestic agency to fight terrorists.\n  We also remember we have other obligations, particularly for missing \nand exploited children. We are working very closely with the President \nof the United States and our Attorney General to make sure we have a \nhotline and a way to identify those sexual predators who have been \nreleased from prison who come back to our communities, and also to \nrecover missing children and to prevent abduction and sexual \nexploitation, whether it is on the Internet or in our communities. They \nare doing a great job.\n  Also, they have been used to identify those children who were missing \nafter Katrina. So we not only look for the kids on AMBER alert--as \nterrible and as chilling as that could be--but after the hurricanes hit \nwe could not find a lot of our children. Moms and dads put their \nchildren on some of the last buses leaving Louisiana and now, thanks to \nthe way we work, we have helped bring about family unification.\n  At the same time, we have a new menace sweeping our country and that \nis gangs. We have certainly seen an increase in my own home State. We \nare providing Federal funds for initiatives, particularly focused in \nMontgomery County and Prince George's County.\n  Our way of fighting gangs is going to follow a three-point strategy \nof suppression, intervention, and prevention. We believe this bill will \nwork with law enforcement in our communities and community support \ngroups to do that.\n  At the same time, we have substantial funding to deal with the \nmethamphetamine scourge that is sweeping our country. Many of my \ncolleagues have spoken about that.\n  While we are busy fighting criminals, though, we also have to protect \nthe judges as we bring those criminals to justice. We are all aware of \nthe great threat that often happens to our judges as they try to do \ntheir duty. So we have increased the funding for the Marshals Service \nto capture fugitives and protect judges in our Federal court system. \nJust this past week, the marshals captured a convicted murderer who \nescaped from a prison in Texas.\n  Where we had a tough fight was in State and local law enforcement. \nThe President's budget cut that by $1.4 billion. Working on a \nbipartisan basis, we did increase that budget by $1.1 billion, but that \nleft us $300 million down. I am sorry that had to happen. We did the \nbest we could, and I know others will talk about it.\n  We put a great deal of effort into making sure we have a national \neffort that will be funded locally for the growing problem of \nmethamphetamine--and, gosh, how it is affecting not only urban but \nrural communities is shocking--and also to fund counterterrorism and \ncounterintelligence. These growing problems are facing us. We did the \nbest we could.\n  I know some of our colleagues will ask: Senator Mikulski, how did it \nall work out with the methamphetamine in conference? When the bill left \nthe Senate, it was pretty good.\n  I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, we have provided a \nrecord amount of money, over $60 million, to fight meth abuse. Meth \nabuse is one of our biggest problems and we hope this is a significant \ndownpayment in dealing with this problem.\n  While we are busy fighting crime, we also want to fight for America's \nfuture. We believe we need to focus more on innovation. A country that \ndoes not innovate stagnates. We are worried that we are losing ground \nin terms of our ability to innovate. We believe one of the ways to \nstrengthen innovation is through our Federal laboratories. That is why \nthis year we have funded an increase of $62 million at the National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology, raising their appropriations to \n$761 million. The NIST partners, working with industry, develop new \ntechnologies and new breakthroughs that create jobs. At the same time \nit creates standards for new products coming to the marketplace so they \ncan file patents, they can be exported, and they can meet the demands \nof the EU and the WTO.\n  In terms of our Federal labs, we want not only new ideas but also \nthose ideas that protect America. So this year we have increased \nfunding for NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \nEverybody knows NOAA; they are known for their weather reports. We know \nthem for their hurricane reports. We know them for their tsunami \nalerts. NOAA generally saves lives and saves livelihoods.\n\n  The weather service has given us important forecasts and warnings so \nwe can secure our property and get people out of harm's way. Also, we \nmade a particular note that the conference prohibits the consolidation \nor reducing of hours of those weather forecast offices. For us coastal \nSenators, it supports our fisheries which are critical to our economy.\n  While we are busy working on some of the new ideas, such as at NASA \nand the National Science Foundation, which I will talk about in a \nminute, I want to talk about the issue of intellectual property, as I \nhave talked about NIST. In America, we often invent great ideas. We win \nthe Nobel Prizes, but we have to win not only the Nobel Prizes, we have \nto win the markets. When we go out there to win those markets, we have \nto protect our intellectual property. It is as important as defending \nthe homeland because it is our jobs, our future, and our source of \nrevenue. All around the world, particularly in southeast Asia, they are \ntrying to steal our ideas. Well, we are not going to allow it. We have \nto make sure we fight it in our trade agreements, we have to fight it \nin our trade enforcement, but we have to begin at home to make sure we \nhave a patent office that protects this intellectual property. We have \nincreased their funding 30 percent to reduce the backlog of over \n500,000 patents.\n  Who knows what those patents are. It could be the next generation of \npacemaker. It could be the next generation of hybrid for an automobile \nor for a truck. Most of all, it is going to be the next generation that \nhopefully keeps jobs, and jobs in manufacturing, in the United States \nof America.\n  So while we talk about labs, this is not some wonky legislation. We \nbelieve it is our ideas that are saving lives, saving property, and \nsaving jobs.\n  We do know we need to be on the cutting edge of science. We believe \nthat cutting edge comes from the National Science Foundation, which we \nhave funded at $5.6 billion, $180 million more than last year. The \nNational Science Foundation funds a lot. It funds our basic research in \nchemistry, biology, and in physics. We all know about the National \nInstitutes of Health and salute them, but at the same time we\n\n[[Page S12814]]\n\nneed to know it is the NSF that is doing the basic science and also \nbreakthrough science such as in nanotechnology and in global warming. \nIt also funds the post-doctorates and the graduate school stipends so \nour young people can go on to graduate school. That is that next \ngeneration.\n  Then, of course, near and dear to my heart is NASA. This year, we \nhave provided $16.4 billion, $260 million over last year. I know many \npeople are wondering what is going to happen to the Hubble. Is the \nHubble going to run out of steam? Will the Hubble stop discovering all \nthat wonderful new science?\n  Hang on. Hope and help is on the way. We have increased the funding \nfor the Hubble budget to accommodate a servicing mission into space to \nrescue the Hubble. It will take new batteries. It will take new \noperating and optical equipment. What we do need, though, is to make \nsure the shuttle makes two more flights so it is safe for the \nastronauts to go up. We are helping our astronauts. We are providing \nfull funding for the Space Shuttle, the space station, and the \ndevelopment of crew exploration vehicles. All science programs are \nfunded at the President's request.\n  We also have funded the Census Bureau at $812 million, which allows \nthe census to move forward with the 2010 census. The census is \nAmerica's database, and we need to keep it contemporary.\n  What I have just given sounds like an accountant. I will submit a \nstatement later on that will talk about what this means in terms of \ninnovation. But today Senator Shelby wanted to brief our colleagues on \nthe numbers and on the money.\n  We think we have done a good job. What we have done is take our \nappropriations allocation, put 50 percent of our money into protecting \nAmerica from terrorists, from crooks, from thugs, and from the \nexploiters of children. At the same time, we have used the other 50 \npercent to promote innovation in science and technology and also to \nprotect our intellectual property. We think we have done a very good \njob.\n  I thank at this time my very good friend, Senator Shelby. Senator \nShelby and I came to the House of Representatives together and served \nwith the Energy and Commerce Committee. We came to the Senate at the \nsame time. He is an excellent colleague to work with. We share the same \npriorities for this country. I want America to know that we do work \ntogether, and when we work together we always do better.\n  I thank staffs who really function with collegiality and with great \ncivility. I thank the Shelby staff: Katherine Hennessey, Art Cameron, \nJoe Long, Christa Crawford, and Allan Cutler.\n  My own staff who worked so hard, I thank Paul Carliner, Gabrielle \nBatkin, Alexa Sewell, and Kate Fitzpatrick for all of the hard work \nthey have done.\n  This is kind of a thumbnail sketch for our bill in the interest of \ntime. There will be Senators who will be coming to speak on the bill.\n  I will yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Dayton. \nLater on in the afternoon I will yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, Mr. Dorgan; to Senator Obama, from Illinois, for 5 \nminutes; and 5 minutes to Senator Sarbanes, my esteemed and cherished \ncolleague from Maryland.\n  I now yield the floor to our excellent colleague from Minnesota, \nSenator Dayton, who, himself, has been an enormous advocate for local \nlaw enforcement and has been a real strong voice for increasing funding \nfor fighting the meth scourge. We are so sorry it is going to be his \nlast year with us, the great guy that he is. We know he will do well. \nWe certainly wish him well, and I look forward to hearing him this \nafternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the distinguished ranking member, the Senator \nfrom Maryland, for her kind words. I commend her and the chairman of \nthe committee, Senator Shelby, for their outstanding work on this \nconference report. I know it was under very difficult circumstances.\n  There are many good features to the report, as the Senator has just \ndescribed. Again, I thank her for her leadership and her tenacious \nfighting on behalf of these efforts, whether they were successful or \nwhether they were not.\n  Tragically, however, the House and the administration largely \nprevailed in this conference report in cutting funding for the law \nenforcement programs to only 38 percent of the Senate's position. \nSenator Chambliss from Georgia and I cosponsored a bipartisan amendment \nto the Senate bill that passed the Senate unanimously, which increased \nthe Byrne grant funding from $900 million for fiscal 2006. Yet the \nHouse and administration, in the conference, slashed that \nappropriations to $416.4 million, which is a one-third reduction from \nfiscal year 2005.\n  Byrne grants fund local law enforcement to combat the most urgent \npublic safety problems in their own communities. In my own State of \nMinnesota, Byrne grant programs have provided the critically important \nfunds to fight the scourge of methamphetamine, which is an illegal drug \ncrisis in many States, as the distinguished ranking member has \noutlined. She has been in the forefront in efforts to increase the \nFederal funding to fight this catastrophe that is afflicting our \ncitizens, afflicting people of all ages--I am told by chiefs of police, \nthose as young as 10, and senior citizens in their eighties, from all \nparts of Minnesota and from all walks of life and backgrounds. While \nthe burdens on local police and sheriffs and other local law \nenforcement officials have been increasing, Byrne grants to Minnesota \nhave decreased from over $8 million in 2000 to $7.5 million last year. \nThis year's cut in this conference report will mean that Minnesota's \nshare of Byrne grant funding will drop to less than $5 million next \nyear, which is a 40-percent reduction from the year 2000.\n\n  In addition, the COPS grants in this report are cut from $606 million \nto $416 million, another one-third reduction, with zero dollars \nprovided for the hiring of new law enforcement officers, which was the \nprogram's original goal. Byrne grants and COPS are the two most \nimportant sources of Federal funds to boost police and sheriff forces \nthroughout our country, to increase the drug prevention programs or \ndrug court interdictions. They are programs that keep our neighborhoods \nsafer, our communities safer, and our rural counties safer.\n  Why do the administration and the House want to drastically cut \nFederal support from local law enforcement; to cut funds from the brave \nmen and women who are on the frontlines against the forces of evil in \nour society, who are risking their lives day and night to defeat the \nevil predators who are destroying the lives of our citizens? Why? It is \nunconscionable, it is incomprehensible that the House and the \nadministration are defunding local law enforcement.\n  Here we have an administration that preaches national security but \nwill not fund it at home. It is an administration that preaches the war \nagainst terrorism but will not fund the war against drug-dealing and \ndrug-pushing terrorists on our streets and in our schools. How \nmistaken, how shortsighted, how wrong-directed could anyone be?\n  Again, I thank the Senate's chairman and ranking member for doing \ntheir best against the administration, which would like to eliminate \nthese programs because they were the good ideas of the previous \nadministration and their allies in the House. Congress should be \nproviding more money, not less, but more money to strengthen local law \nenforcement in their fight against organized crime, drug dealers, and \nother predators. For that reason, I regretfully cannot support this \nreport.\n  The citizens of America deserve better law enforcement and more \nFederal support to make it possible--not the lower, the cut position of \nthe House and administration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized for up \nto 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, first, I commend both Senator Shelby, \nthe chairman of the subcommittee, and my colleague from Maryland, \nSenator Mikulski, the ranking member, for their hard work in bringing \nthis conference report to the Senate this afternoon. I do want to \nexpress my regret that this report does not contain an important \nprovision, to provide emergency housing vouchers to victims of the \nrecent hurricanes.\n\n[[Page S12815]]\n\n  On September 14 of this year, the Senate unanimously approved an \namendment to this bill to provide $3.5 billion in emergency spending to \nbe used to ensure that any person displaced as a result of the \nhurricanes could receive a housing voucher. These emergency housing \nvouchers would have enabled displaced families to find and afford safe, \ndecent, and stable housing.\n  While FEMA and HUD are providing some housing assistance to evacuees, \nit is clear from news reports, as well as from people in the affected \nareas, that the promises of housing assistance from the Federal \nGovernment are falling far short of what is necessary. Just in the past \nweek, there have been articles about the lack of stable housing for \nevacuees. The titles alone indicate the stress evacuees are under. For \nexample:\n\n       Hurricane Evacuees Face Eviction Threats At Both Their Old \n     Homes and New;\n       Displaced in Crisis of Affordable Housing;\n       FEMA Housing Slow In Arriving.\n\n  The administration's housing policy for the victims of the recent \nhurricanes is unclear and inadequate. HUD is only assisting people who \nwere assisted by HUD previously in the disaster areas, while FEMA has \nthe responsibility for the vast majority of the evacuees. FEMA, an \nemergency management agency which is overwhelmed in the face of this \nunprecedented disaster, is now being tasked with the job of housing \nhundreds of thousands of people. This is not a job for FEMA. FEMA has \nprovided people with 3-months' worth of rental assistance. However, it \nis clear that not all evacuees have received this assistance. Second, \nit is also not clear how evacuees and the landlords renting to them can \nbe guaranteed that rental assistance will continue. Indeed, some \nKatrina victims are being threatened with eviction. FEMA seems to be \nhandling the continuation of rental assistance on a case-by-case basis, \nwith no clear rules or principles guiding these critical decisions.\n\n  In the words of an editorial in yesterday's New York Times:\n\n       The woefully inadequate program for housing put forward by \n     the administration is tantamount to stonewalling the Katrina \n     victims.\n\n  The emergency housing voucher proposal, which was adopted by the \nSenate, was, regrettably, not included in the conference report now \nunder consideration. The Senate conferees met implacable resistance, \napparently, from the House conferees and from the administration, as I \nunderstand it. But the emergency housing voucher proposal which this \nbody adopted would have ensured that every evacuee in need would \nreceive at least 6 months of rental assistance with an additional 6 \nmonths of assistance available if necessary. The assistance would have \nbeen distributed by HUD and the existing housing network, which houses \nmillions of people around the Nation. There is extensive experience at \nHUD.\n  I am disappointed, very disappointed that this critical assistance is \nnot included, and I hope that we can find some other way to provide the \nneeded housing assistance to hurricane victims.\n  Again, I commend my colleagues, Senators Shelby and Mikulski, for \ntheir successful completion of this report. I again underscore that \nthis emergency housing voucher provision was included in the bill which \npassed the Senate under the leadership of Chairman Shelby and Ranking \nMember Mikulski. I regret that they met this resistance in conference \nand were not able to include it in the final version. It is the \nevacuees of the hurricanes who, unfortunately, will pay the price.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Before the senior Senator returns to the Banking \nCommittee, I want him to know that I, too, regret that we could not do \nthe housing vouchers, the small business administration loans, as well \nas the economic development assistance Katrina amendments. These would \nhave really helped rebuild communities and rebuild lives. But the House \nwas so resistant we could not. We were defeated on a voice vote.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the ranking member for that observation. I \nsimply point out, as further stories are heard about the inability to \nget people back up on their feet and address their needs, it should be \nremembered that there were provisions in the Senate-passed bill which, \nif included in this conference report and therefore enacted into law, \nwould have provided very important measures of assistance in a very \ntimely fashion. I, too, regret very much that has not taken place.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have addressed this Chamber several \ntimes on the subject of global warming. Many times, over and over in \nthe past few years in those speeches I have presented well-documented \nfacts regarding the science and economics of the global warming issue \nthat, sadly, many of my colleagues in the public heard for the first \ntime.\n  Today, I will discuss something else--scientific integrity and how to \nimprove it. Specifically, I will discuss the systematic and documented \nabuse of the scientific process by an international body that claims it \nprovides the most complete and objective scientific assessment in the \nworld on the subject of climate change--the United Nations-sponsored \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC. I will conclude \nwith a series of recommendations as to the minimum changes the IPCC \nmust make if it is to restore its credibility.\n  When I became chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works, one of my top three priorities was to improve the quality \nof environmental science used in public policymaking by taking the \npolitics out of science. I have convened hearings on this subject and \nthe specific issue of global warming science.\n  I am a U.S. Senator and a former mayor and businessman. I am not a \nscientist. But I do understand politics. And the more I have delved \ninto the issue, the more convinced I have become that science is being \nco-opted by those who care more about peddling fear of gloom and doom \nto further their own, broader agendas than they do about scientific \nintegrity.\n  I am committed to shining a light on their activities. Global warming \nalarmists will undoubtedly continue to accuse me of attacking the \nscience of global warming--that is part of their game. But nothing \ncould be further from the truth. I support and defend credible, \nobjective science by exposing the corrupting influences that would \nsubvert it for political purposes. Good policy must be based on good \nscience, and that requires science be free of bias, whatever its \nconclusions might be.\n  As nations meet again next month in Montreal to discuss global \nwarming, the pronouncements of the IPCC leaders will gain renewed \nattention as they continue their efforts to craft a fourth assessment \nof the state of global warming science. If the fourth assessment is to \nhave any credibility, fundamental changes will need to be made.\n  The flaws in the IPCC process began to manifest themselves in the \nfirst assessment, but did so in earnest when the IPCC issued its second \nassessment report in 1996. The most obvious was the altering of the \ndocument on the central question of whether man is causing global \nwarming.\n  Here is what Chapter 8--the key chapter in the report--stated on this \ncentral question in the final version accepted by reviewing scientists:\n\n       No study to date has positively attributed all or part [of \n     the climate change observed to date] to anthropogenic causes.\n\n  But when the final version was published, this and similar phrases in \n15 sections of the chapter were deleted or modified. Nearly all the \nchanges removed hints of scientific doubts regarding the claim that \nhuman activities are having a major impact on global warming.\n  It removes these doubts that were specific in the study.\n  In the Summary for Policymakers--which is the only part of the report \nthat reporters and policymakers read--a single phrase was inserted. It \nreads:\n\n       The balance of evidence suggests that there is a \n     discernible human influence on global climate.\n\n  The lead author for chapter 8, Dr. Ben Santer, should not be held \nsolely accountable. According to the journal Nature, the changes to the \nreport were made in the midst of high-level pressure from the Clinton/\nGore State Department to do so. I understand that\n\n[[Page S12816]]\n\nafter the State Department sent a letter to Sir John Houghton, co-\nchairman of the IPCC, Houghton prevailed upon Santer to make the \nchanges. The impact was explosive, with media across the world, \nincluding heavyweights such as Peter Jennings, declaring this as proof \nthat man is responsible for global warming.\n  Notably, polls taken shortly afterwards showed scant support for the \nstatement. The word ``discernible'' implies measurable or detectable, \nand depending on how the question was asked, only 3-19 percent of \nAmerican scientists concurred. That is the very best scenario--less \nthan 20 percent.\n  In 2001, the third assessment report was published. Compared with the \nflaws in the third assessment, those in the second assessment appear \nmodest. The most famous is the graph produced by Dr. Michael Mann and \nothers. Their study concluded that the 20th century was the warmest on \nrecord in the last 1,000 years, showing flat temperatures until 1900 \nand then spiking upward--in short, it looked like a hockey stick. It \nachieved instant fame as proof of man's causation of global warming \nbecause it was featured prominently in the summary report read by the \nmedia.\n  Let us take a look at this chart. This is the blade of the hockey \nstick, and this is what Michael Mann tried to show. Since then, the \nhockey stick has been shown to be a relic of bad math and impermissible \npractices.\n  This chart starts the year 1000, 1200, and so forth. If they had \nincluded the three centuries prior to that, that was the time called \nthe medieval warming period. In the medieval warming period, you would \nfind another blade such as this where temperatures were actually higher \nthan they are in this exhibit.\n  Since then, the hockey stick has been shown to be a relic of bad math \nand impermissible practices. Dr. Hans von Storch, a prominent German \nresearcher with the GKSS Institute for Coastal Research--who, I am \ntold, believes in global warming--put it this way:\n\n       Methodologically it is wrong: Rubbish.\n\n  In fact, a pair of Canadian researchers showed that when random data \nis fed into Michael Mann's mathematical construct, it produces a hockey \nstick more than 99 percent of the time, regardless of what you put into \nit. Yet the IPCC immortalized the hockey stick as the proof positive of \ncatastrophic global warming.\n  How can such a thing occur? Sadly, it is due to the institutional \nstructure of the IPCC itself--it breeds manipulation.\n  First, the IPCC is a political institution. Its charter is to support \nthe efforts of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, which \nhas the basic mission of eliminating the threat of global warming. This \nclearly creates a conflict of interest with the standard scientific \ngoal of assessing scientific data in an objective manner.\n  The IPCC process itself illustrates the problem. The Summary Report \nfor Policymakers is not approved by the scientists and economists who \ncontribute to the report.\n  In other words, the Summary Report for Policymakers is the one for \npolicymakers and for the press. That is how people pick up their \nimpressions as to what was in the report. However, the scientists and \nthe economists who contributed to the report never did approve the \nSummary Report for Policymakers. It is approved by intergovernmental \ndelegates--in short, politicians. It doesn't take a leap of imagination \nto realize that politicians will insist the report support their \nagenda.\n  A typical complaint of scientists and economists is that the summary \ndoes not adequately reflect the uncertainties associated with tentative \nconclusions in the basic report. The uncertainties I identified by \ncontributing authors and reviewers seem to disappear or are downplayed \nin the summary.\n  A corollary of this is that lead authors and the chair of the IPCC \ncontrol too much of the process. The old adage ``power corrupts and \nabsolute power corrupts absolutely'' applies here. Only a handful of \nindividuals were involved in changing the entire tone of the second \nassessment. Likewise, Michael Mann was a chapter lead author in the \nthird assessment.\n  One stark example of how the process has been corrupted involves a \nU.S. Government scientist who is among the world's most respected \nexperts on hurricanes--Dr. Christopher Landsea. Earlier this year, Dr. \nLandsea resigned as a contributing author in the upcoming fourth \nassessment. His reason was simple--the lead author for the chapter on \nextreme weather, Dr. Kevin Trenberth, had demonstrated he would pursue \na political agenda linking global warming to more severe hurricanes.\n  Trenberth had spoken at a forum where he was introduced as a lead \nauthor and proceeded to forcefully make the link. He has spoken here in \nthe Senate as well, and it is clear that Trenberth's mind is completely \nclosed on the issue. The only problem is that Trenberth's views are not \nwidely accepted among the scientific community. As Landsea put it last \nwinter:\n\n       All previous and current research in the area of hurricane \n     variability has shown no reliable, long-term trend up in the \n     frequency or intensity of tropical cyclones, either in the \n     Atlantic or any other basin.\n\n  When Landsea brought it to the attention of the IPCC, he was told \nthat Trenberth--who as lead author is supposed to bring a neutral, \nunbiased perspective to his position--would keep his position. Landsea \nconcluded that:\n\n       Because of Dr. Trenberth's pronouncements, the IPCC process \n     on our assessment of these crucial extreme events in our \n     climate system has been subverted and compromised, its \n     neutrality lost.\n\n  Landsea's experience is not unique. Richard Lindzen, a prominent MIT \nresearcher who was a contributing author to a chapter in the third \nassessment, among others has said that the Summary did not reflect the \nchapter he contributed to. But when you examine how the IPCC is \nstructured, is it really so surprising?\n  Second, the IPCC has demonstrated an unreasoning resistance to \naccepting constructive critiques of its scientific and economic \nmethods, even in the report itself. Of course, combined with my first \npoint, this is a recipe for delegitimizing the entire endeavor in terms \nof providing credible information that is useful to policymakers.\n  Let me offer a few examples of what I am talking about.\n  Malaria is considered one of the four greatest risks associated with \nglobal warming. But the relationship between climate and mosquito \npopulations is highly complex. There are over 3,500 species of \nmosquito, and all breed, feed, and behave differently. Yet the nine \nlead authors of the health section in the second assessment had \npublished only six research papers on vector-borne diseases among them.\n  Dr. Paul Reiter of the Pasteur Institute, a respected entomologist \nwho has spent decades studying mosquito-borne malaria, believes that \nglobal warming would have little impact on the spread of malaria. But \nthe IPCC refused to consider his views in its third assessment, and has \ncompletely excluded him from contributing to the fourth assessment.\n  Here is another example: To predict future global warming, the IPCC \nestimated how much world economies would grow over the next century. \nThey had to somehow tie this into the economic activity. Future \nincreases in carbon dioxide emission estimates are directly tied to \ngrowth rates, which in turn drive the global warming predictions.\n  Unfortunately, the method the IPCC uses to calculate growth rates is \nwrong. It also contains assumptions that developing nations will \nexperience explosive growth--in some cases, becoming wealthier than the \nUnited States. These combine to greatly inflate even its lower-end \nestimates of future global warming.\n  The IPCC, however, has bowed to political pressure from the \ndeveloping countries that refuse to acknowledge the likelihood they \nwill not catch up to the developed world. The result: Future global \nwarming predictions by the IPCC are based on a political choice, not on \ncredible economic methodologies.\n  Likewise, the IPCC ignored the advice of economists who conclude \nthat, if global warming is real, future generations would have a higher \nquality of life if societies maximize economic growth and adapt to \nfuture warming rather than trying to drastically curb emissions. The \nIPCC turns a deaf ear.\n  This problem with the economics led to a full-scale inquiry by the \nUK's House of Lords' Select Committee on Economic Affairs. The ensuing \nreport\n\n[[Page S12817]]\n\nshould be required reading. The committee identified numerous problems \nwith the IPCC.\n  In fact, the problems identified were so substantial, it led Lord \nNigel Lawson, former Chancellor of the Exchequer and a member of the \ncommittee, to recently state--in fact, he was here and testified before \nthe committee I chair here in the Senate--Lord Lawson said:\n\n       I believe the IPCC process is so flawed, and the \n     institution, it has to be said, so closed to reason, that it \n     would be far better to thank it for the work it has done, \n     close it down, and transfer all future international \n     collaboration on the issue of climate change. . . .\n\n  To regain its credibility, the IPCC must correct its deficiencies in \nall of the following areas before it releases its fourth assessment \nreport. Structurally, there are four ways we suggest changes be made.\n  The first is to adopt procedures by which scientific reviewers \nformally approve both the chapters and the Summary Report for \nPolicymakers. Government delegates should not be part of the approval \nprocess.\n  The second thing is to limit the authority of lead authors and the \nChair to introduce changes after approval by the reviewers.\n  The third is to create an ombudsman for each chapter. These ombudsmen \nshould consult with reviewers who believe valid issues are not being \naddressed and disseminate a report for reviewers prior to final \napproval which is made part of the final document.\n  Fourth is to institute procedures to ensure that an adequate cross-\nsection of qualified scientists wishing to participate in the process \nis selected based on unbiased criteria. The ombudsmen should review \ncomplaints of bias in the selection process.\n  That is structurally what the IPCC should do.\n  Now, there are many specific issues that the IPCC must address as \nwell. For instance, the IPCC must ensure that uncertainties in the \nstate of knowledge are clearly expressed in the Summary for \nPolicymakers. When you read the Summary for Policymakers, which is not \napproved by the scientists and the economists, it does not say anything \nabout the fact that there are doubts in these areas. That should be a \npart of it.\n  The IPCC must provide highly defensible ranges of the costs of \ncontrolling greenhouse gas emissions. They have to talk about how this \nis going to be done.\n  They must defensibly assess the effects of land-use changes in \ncausing observed temperature increases. In other words, there are a lot \nof things we hear about, we are aware of; that is, the heat island \neffect that takes place in a lot of the major cities, the various \nagricultural changes where trees are cut down and crops are planted. \nThese need to be considered.\n  Fourth is to provide highly defensible ranges of the benefits of \nglobal warming. If we know the cost that is going to be incurred, as we \nlearned in the Wharton econometric survey--that for each family of four \nin America, it would cost them about $1,715 a year in the cost of \nelectricity, the cost of fuel; everything just about doubling--then \npeople need to know what kinds of benefits the global warming will \nproduce.\n  The fifth thing is to examine the costs and benefits of an adaptive \nstrategy versus a mitigation strategy.\n  Sixth is to adequately examine studies finding a cooling trend of the \nContinental Antarctic for the last 40 years, as well as increases in \nthe Antarctic ice mass.\n  Seventh is to adequately explain why the models predict greater \nwarming than has been observed, avoiding the use of selective data \nsets.\n  Eighth is to ensure an unbiased assessment of the literature on \nhurricanes.\n  Ninth is to ensure adequate review of malaria predictions by a range \nof specialists in the field, ensuring all views are expressed.\n  Going back to No. 8, I am reminded every time something happens--it \ncan be a hurricane or a tornado--there is always somebody standing up \nand saying: Aha, it is due to global warming. It is a level of \ndesperation that I cannot believe people are becoming subjected to.\n  There are dozens more issues, most of which are as important as the \nones I have just raised. Instead of trying to list them all here, I \nintend to post on my committee's Web site this winter a more exhaustive \nand detailed list of issues that must be addressed in the fourth \nassessment.\n  In conclusion, I quote from an article in Der Speigel by Dr. von \nStorch and Dr. Nico Stehr, who is with Zeppelin University. They wrote:\n\n       Other scientists are succumbing to a form of fanaticism \n     almost reminiscent of the McCarthy era. . . . Silencing \n     dissent and uncertainty for the benefit of a politically \n     worthy cause reduces credibility, because the public is more \n     well-informed than generally assumed. In the long term, the \n     supposedly useful dramatizations achieve exactly the opposite \n     of what they are intended to achieve. If this happens, both \n     science and society will have missed an opportunity.\n\n  It is my solemn hope that the IPCC will listen to the words of Dr. \nvon Storch and Dr. Stehr and not miss the opportunity to reestablish \nits credibility, which I believe is totally lost at this time. Only \nthen will its work product be useful to policymakers. If the IPCC \nremains committed to its current path, however, then Lord Lawson's \nsolution is the only viable one--the IPCC should be disbanded.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my remarks not be charged \nagainst the time on the CJS appropriations conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, as my colleagues know, we continue to \ndiscuss the Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations conference report. \nWe note that our colleague from Illinois wishes to speak, and I yield \nto Senator Obama 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I thank Senator Mikulski.\n  Mr. President, I know I speak for all Members of the Senate when I \nsay we wholeheartedly support our Nation's law enforcement officers and \nwe want to do every single thing possible to assist their efforts to \nkeep our communities safe. Unfortunately, the Commerce-Justice-Science \nconference report before this body today does not send this message. In \nfact, it sends the exact opposite message.\n  The conference report provides important funding for programs such as \nthe Office on Violence Against Women, the National Science Foundation, \nand important juvenile justice programs. But I am very troubled by the \ndrastic cuts it makes to an important law enforcement program, the \nByrne Justice Assistance Grant Program.\n  This bill further eviscerates a program that has suffered significant \ncuts in the last few years, despite providing real results and benefits \naround the country. The conference report cuts the Byrne Program from \nthe $900 million we passed in the Senate to $416 million, which is a \n34-percent cut from the fiscal year 2005 funding level.\n  Now, in Illinois, these cuts will have an immediate and direct effect \nbecause law enforcement has been using Byrne grant funds to fight one \nof the gravest drug threats facing the Nation today--methamphetamines.\n  In downstate Illinois, as in other rural communities all across the \ncountry, there has been a tremendous surge in the manufacture, \ntrafficking, and use of meth. Illinois State Police encountered 971 \nmeth labs in Illinois in 2003, more than double the number uncovered in \n2000.\n  According to the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority, the \nquantity of meth seized by the Illinois State Police increased nearly \ntenfold between 1997 and 2003. This surge is placing enormous burdens \non smalltown police forces, which are suddenly being confronted with a \nlarge drug trade and the ancillary crimes that accompany that trade.\n  These police departments rely on Byrne grant funding to participate \nin meth task forces, such as the Metropolitan Enforcement Group or the \nSouthern Illinois Enforcement Group. These task forces allow police in \ndifferent communities to combine forces\n\n[[Page S12818]]\n\nto battle a regional problem. There are a total of seven meth task \nforce zones in Illinois, and these task forces have seen real results \nwith Byrne grant funding.\n  In 2004, the Southern Illinois Enforcement Group accounted for more \nthan 27 percent of the State's reported meth lab seizures. This group \npays 5 of its 12 agents through Byrne grants.\n\n  In towns such as Granite City and Alton, cuts in Byrne grant funding \nwill force them to make difficult choices about how to allocate already \nscarce police resources. Indeed, the chief of police in Granite City \ntold my staff yesterday that cuts in Byrne grant funding will threaten \nthe viability of his meth task force. At a time when meth use is \ngrowing, it is inconceivable to me that we would be cutting the \nresources needed by law enforcement to fight crime and clean up the \nstreets.\n  This is yet another example of the misplaced priorities of our \ncountry. We all know that we are facing a real budget crisis. The \ndeficit is growing, and we need to enforce some fiscal discipline. But \nI don't believe we should be balancing the budget on the backs of our \nNation's law enforcement officers who keep our families and communities \nsafe each and every day.\n  I am disappointed by this bill. I hope next year we will be able to \nfind the necessary funding that local law enforcement needs. I would \nask those who are on the conference and who are looking at this to \nrecognize that it is going to have an impact not just in Illinois but \nin rural communities all across the country, particularly farming \ncommunities in the Midwest that have been devastated by the plague of \nmeth. This has been primarily a program to help prevent it. It is being \ncut drastically in this bill. It is a bad decision and reflective of \nmisplaced priorities by this Senate.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Since the war in Iraq began, 2,067 Americans have died; \n15,568 have been wounded. Today, I joined my colleagues, Senators \nLevin, Biden, Harry Reid, and others, in offering an amendment to honor \ntheir sacrifice and service and to seek a new course in Iraq in the \ncoming year. I was proud to cosponsor the Levin amendment. I thought it \nmade three critical policy statements about Iraq.\n  First, the amendment demanded that the administration provide \nCongress and the American people with a plan for success and a \ntimetable with estimated dates for the phased redeployment of American \nforces. Second, the amendment makes it clear that 2006 will not be just \nanother year on the calendar when it comes to the war in Iraq. The next \nyear represents a critical transition period for Iraq, when a newly \nelected government, as of this December, will take office and must \nassume the authority and responsibility that comes with sovereignty. \nThis is the year when Iraqi forces must help create the conditions that \nwill finally lead to the phased redeployment of U.S. troops.\n  The Levin amendment also stated that the administration had to make \nit crystal clear to the Iraqi people that we were not in Iraq \nindefinitely. We are neither permanent occupiers nor are we a permanent \npolice force for the Iraqi people. That is a job for Iraq, not for the \nUnited States. Building a broad-based and sustainable political \nsettlement is also essential for defeating the insurgency and it, too, \nis an Iraqi responsibility, not an American responsibility.\n  President Bush has said over and over again, as the Iraqis stand up, \nwe will stand down. The amendment we offered asked the basic question, \nWhen are they going to have capable forces so that American troops can \nstand down? How many are standing now? How well is the Iraqi Government \ndoing in defending and caring for its people and training its own \nmilitary and security forces?\n  This isn't the first time we have asked these questions. Over 40 of \nus have asked the President over and over again for a report on this \nwar. Sadly, we are still waiting for an answer, unless you count the \nreply we received from someone at a lower level in the White House \nstating that he had received the letter and would send it to the \nappropriate person to take a look at. That was over a month ago. That \nis not the answer that Senators were looking for. It is certainly not \nthe answer the American people were looking for. The amendment required \nanswers in an unclassified report because we want the American people \nto know what is going on in Iraq--the challenges, the progress, and, \nfrankly, if there are contingencies we had not anticipated, let us know \nthat.\n  What we were seeking to do with this amendment was finally to \nestablish that 2006 will not be just another year. I am hoping that no \nSenator will stand on the floor a year from now and recount that we \nhave lost hundreds more of our best and bravest in Iraq, thousands more \ninjured, wondering if there is any end in sight.\n  The amendment made it clear as well that we were holding Iraqis \nresponsible. It is their country. It is their future. They need to take \ncontrol of their own fate and future with their own security force and \na political arrangement that works.\n  Third, we want accountability from this President. It is not good \nenough for the President to make speeches about staying the course when \nthe course has led to so many lives being lost, so many dollars being \nspent. Senators Warner and Frist saw our amendment when it was offered. \nIt is interesting because I think what they did is probably a very \npositive thing. They took the amendment, which we had prepared, and \nbasically made changes on its face. If you take a look at this \namendment, this is what we offered. Senators Warner and Frist scratched \nout the names of all the Democratic sponsors and put their own names on \nthere on the Republican side. Then they went through, without even \nretyping, and made handwritten changes on the Democratic amendment. \nSome of the changes are innocuous, but some are not.\n\n  One of the changes is significant. We made it clear, in language the \nIraqis and the American people could understand, what the future course \nwill be. Let me read what Democratic language said:\n\n       The United States military forces should not stay in Iraq \n     indefinitely and the people of Iraq should be so advised.\n\n  Simple and declarative. The Republican change: They struck the word \n``indefinitely.'' Now it reads:\n\n       The United States military forces should not stay in Iraq \n     any longer than required and the people of Iraq should be so \n     advised.\n\n  That is quite a difference. Our sentence was clear and more decisive. \nTheirs is ambiguous, leaving open the possibility of American permanent \nmilitary bases in Iraq, something I hope does not occur. But the most \nimportant thing that they did was to delete the last paragraph of this \namendment. In the last paragraph, we have asked for President Bush, \nevery 3 months, to report to the American people on scheduled changes \nin Iraq: How many soldiers were to be trained to replace American \nsoldiers; how many policemen were to be prepared to provide for the \ndefense of and order in their country; what progress is being made when \nit comes to basic human services, whether it is electricity, water, \nemployment, the guideposts that we use to determine whether we are \nestablishing a civil society, a stable society.\n  The Republicans accepted most of those, but they did not accept what \nI consider to be one of the key paragraphs of the Democratic amendment. \nThat said: We expect a report from the President of a campaign plan \nwith estimated dates for the phased redeployment of the United States \nArmed Forces from Iraq as each condition is met, with the understanding \nthat unexpected contingencies may occur.\n  That was critical because it says to the President and to the \nadministration: Let us start talking now about bringing our soldiers \nhome. We are not setting a date to cut and run, which the critics said, \nbut we are saying to the President: We have to take seriously the \n161,000 Americans risking\n\n[[Page S12819]]\n\ntheir lives every single day, and many--sadly, too many--losing their \nlives and being injured in the process.\n  It is interesting to me that this morning's news tells us that the \nIraqis are now saying to the British: You can start thinking about \ngoing home now. That is great. I am glad they can. I am glad that they \nwill return to the safety of their families and their homes. Shouldn't \nthat same conversation be taking place about American troops, and \nshouldn't the President be telling us that we are going to move forward \nin a phased, orderly redeployment of our troops back home, as the \nIraqis take over responsibility of their own country?\n  That is what the Democrats offered. That is what the Republicans \nrefused. The vote came down. There were about 40 who voted for the \nDemocratic amendment. Then there was a following vote. That vote is \nsignificant. It was a vote on the Warner-Frist amendment, an amendment \nwhich was offered to the Defense authorization bill. It is true that it \nwas an amendment which was a cut-and-paste job on the original \nDemocratic amendment. I have in my hand the original amendment and the \nchanges that were made. It didn't go as far as I would like to have \ngone. It didn't say American troops will not stay in Iraq indefinitely. \nIt didn't talk about the phased redeployment of American forces. But it \ndid say several important things that were included in the original \nDemocratic amendment.\n  It did say 2006 is a year of significant transition. It did serve \nnotice on the Iraqis that they have to accept responsibility for their \nown fate and future. And significantly, this Republican amendment \ncalled on their President in the White House to report to the American \npeople, on a quarterly basis, as to the progress being made in Iraq so \nwe can monitor whether the President truly has a plan that can lead to \nsuccess.\n  That is significant, maybe historic. The President's own party \noverwhelmingly voted today for this amendment, an amendment which \nstarted on the Democratic side but became bipartisan in the end, an \namendment which calls on this administration to be held more \naccountable in terms of this war in Iraq.\n\n  Now, the President did something on Veterans Day which is unusual. \nThe President used Veterans Day, of all days, to make a political \nspeech. He criticized the Democrats who were not agreeing with his war \npolicy, on Veterans Day. I can tell you that I was back in my home \nState of Illinois visiting communities with Veterans Day celebrations \nin Carlysle, in Flora, and in Paris, IL. It didn't even cross my mind \nto make a partisan speech. You don't do that on Veterans Day, for \ngoodness' sake. We don't ask our soldiers their political affiliation. \nWe don't designate on their tombstones what political party they \nbelonged to. Soldiers and veterans serve their country regardless of \npolitical affiliation.\n  But the President used Veterans Day to raise a political issue, and \nthen flew to Alaska yesterday and repeated it, saying that his critics \nare somehow undermining the morale of the troops and showing they don't \nappreciate the contributions of the troops. Nothing could be further \nfrom the truth. Whether you are Democrat or Republican, whether you \nvoted for the war or against it, as I did--I have given this President \nevery single penny he has asked for for our troops. I have always \nthought in the back of my mind if it were my son or my daughter in \nuniform, I would want them to have everything they needed to be safe, \nto come home with their mission truly accomplished. So for the \nPresident to suggest that anyone who questions his foreign policy is \nnot respectful of our troops is just plain wrong.\n  It is up to us as policymakers to make critical decisions about the \npolicy of this country. But we have learned through bitter experience \nthat even if you disagree with the policy of this country, for \ngoodness' sake don't take it out on the troops and, I might say the \nflip side of that, don't use the troops as a shield so that you don't \nhave to defend your own public policies. This administration has to \nstand up to defend those policies for what they are.\n  So this amendment, with some changes, passed. And what does it say? \nWell, the purpose of the amendment as it passed says to clarify and \nrecommend changes to the policy of the United States on Iraq. It is \nsignificant. For those who said stay the course, make no changes, they \nlost today. For those who wanted change on both sides of the aisle, we \nprevailed. I think that is important. I think the national dialog is \ngoing to change because of this vote. I sincerely hope it is a good-\nfaith effort. I hope it doesn't go into a conference committee and \ndisappear. I hope it is part of the Defense authorization bill \nultimately signed by the President.\n  There is another thing that concerns me as we get into this whole \ndebate, and that is this question about intelligence. You may recall \nthat when we decided to invade Iraq it was not just the decision to \ninvade that country but to change America's foreign policy. The Bush \nadministration, for the first time in our history, said we can no \nlonger afford a policy of defense. We can no longer say to the world, \nIf you attack us, we will attack you back tenfold. We have to be \npreemptive, have a policy of preemption.\n  What is the difference? The difference is the President believes we \nshould be prepared to attack countries even before they attack or \nthreaten us. Well, that is a new course in American foreign policy and \none which is dangerous. It is dangerous if the information you are \nreceiving about potential threats and potential enemies is wrong. And \nwhat happened when it came to the invasion of Iraq? Virtually all of \nthe intelligence was wrong.\n  It is true we knew Saddam Hussein was a dictator and a butcher and a \ntyrant, that he had precipitated a war against Iran that went on for \nyears, claiming thousands of lives. We knew that he invaded Kuwait. All \nof that was part of history. But before the invasion of Iraq we were \ntold by this administration that based on the intelligence that they \ngathered, there were other compelling reasons for us not to wait for \nthe United Nations, not to wait for other allies, not to wait and \nexhaust all possibilities but to move decisively and invade.\n  What were those reasons? Weapons of mass destruction, which we later \nlearned didn't exist; the possibility that Iraq was becoming a nuclear \npower, as Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said, mushroom clouds in \nthe Middle East and around the world from Saddam Hussein's nuclear \nweapons; the aluminum tube controversy, evidence that they imported \naluminum tubes which the administration said was proof positive that \nthey were reinstituting, reconstituting their nuclear weapons program; \nconnections with Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden. It was \nargued that \n9/11 and Iraq were the same story.\n  All of these were given to us together with the assertion that \nsomehow the Iraqis were importing this yellow cake from Niger in Africa \nto make nuclear weapons. We were told all these things to reach a high \nlevel of intensity and anxiety to lead to an invasion of Iraq. We found \nafter the invasion virtually every single statement was false, was not \ntrue.\n\n  We analyzed what the intelligence agencies did in the first phase of \nour investigation and found utter failure. The agencies we most counted \non to tell us of threats against America and how we could defend \nagainst them completely dropped the ball. I was part of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee at the time, and I listened as our staff people \nwent over and reported to us about what they found at these \nintelligence agencies.\n  In the ordinary course of events, before you invade a country there \nis a very careful analysis of intelligence data. You just don't start a \nwar without looking at every possibility and understanding information \nthat has been collected.\n  Well, that National Intelligence Estimate was not even prepared when \nthe administration started talking about the invasion of Iraq. It was \nordered, prepared in a manner of 2 or 3 weeks, just a fraction of the \ntime usually required, and when we finally saw it in the Senate \nIntelligence Committee, it was embarrassing. It was a report given to \nus which really didn't carefully evaluate the intelligence data that \nhad been collected, and it is one of the reasons we made this colossal \nerror in judgment when it came to evaluating intelligence.\n  That was the Senate Intelligence Committee investigation. The \nPresident has been saying repeatedly that\n\n[[Page S12820]]\n\nthose who are critical of his decision to invade Iraq today had the \nsame intelligence he had, and so if he made a mistake, they made a \nmistake, too. I disagree. The President of the United States receives \nwhat is known as the daily briefing. Each day he sits down with \nintelligence officials, including the head of the CIA and others at the \nhighest level, for a briefing about intelligence gathered around the \nworld and what the threat is to America on that given day. He has more \ninformation than anyone, as he should, as President, as Commander in \nChief. By the time you come to Congress, that information has been \nfiltered and chopped and divided and diced and very little of it makes \nit to Congress. Most of it comes to the Intelligence Committees. Then \nit goes to the chairman, ranking member, and then down the chain less \ninformation is given to members of the Senate Intelligence Committee \nand even less to the regular rank-and-file Senators and Congressmen. \nThat is just the food chain, if you will, on intelligence data.\n  So for the President to suggest that Members of Congress had the same \ninformation he did is just not factual. He is given much more \ninformation. He was before Iraq; he is every single day given more \ninformation. So if Members of the Senate relied on the President's \nrepresentation, the President's statement, the Vice President's \nstatement, and they were misled into it, it is because they believed \nthe President and Vice President had more information about it than \nthey did.\n  Now, I sat on the Senate Intelligence Committee shaking my head day \nin and day out listening as the members of the administration would \ndebate issues like nuclear weapons. This is all unclassified now, but \nthere was a serious disagreement between the Department of Defense and \nthe Department of Energy as to what those aluminum tubes meant. The \nDepartment of Energy said: We don't think they have anything to do with \nnuclear weapons. The Department of Defense said: Oh, yes, they do. And \nthe two of them would have at it in front of us. Then I would walk \noutside the Intelligence Committee room and hear Vice President Cheney \nand Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice saying aluminum tubes equal \nnuclear weapons, and I am thinking to myself: They are not suggesting \nthere is a difference of opinion even in their own administration.\n  It was frustrating because serving on that Intelligence Committee I \ncould not discuss what was being debated in that room, but I knew in my \nheart of hearts that many things being told to the American people were \njust not backed up with sound, concrete evidence, and that is what is \nat issue here.\n  We believe the American people deserve the truth, and the truth comes \ndown to this: The Senate Intelligence Committee promised us over 20 \nmonths ago that they would do a thorough investigation to see if any \nelected official made a statement about the situation in Iraq that \ncould not be substantiated with background intelligence. In other \nwords, did any elected official in this administration, or even in this \nCongress, deliberately or recklessly mislead the American people?\n  Is that important? It could not be more important. I cannot think of \na greater abuse of power in a democracy than to mislead the people into \na war, and to ask the people of a country to offer up the people they \nlove--their sons, their daughters, their husbands, their wives, their \nfriends and their relatives--in defense of the facts.\n  That is what this investigation is about. We have been waiting 20 \nmonths, 20 months for it to take place. I don't know what it will find. \nThere is certainly a lot of questions that need to be asked and \nanswered about statements made by members of the administration. But as \nof today, we still don't know. We are not certain as to whether that \ninvestigation will take place.\n  I would like to know why, on February 7, 2003, Defense Secretary \nDonald Rumsfeld told the U.S. troops in Aviano, Italy:\n\n       It is unknowable how long that conflict in Iraq will last. \n     It could last 6 days, 6 weeks. I doubt 6 months.\n\n  Secretary Rumsfeld, February 2003. That was over 2\\1/2\\ years ago. \nThe Defense Secretary was not just overly optimistic, he was profoundly \nwrong. His failure to plan for the conflict that could last years and \nnot weeks has had tragic consequences.\n  On my first visit to Walter Reed Hospital to visit a soldier whose \nleg had been amputated, who was from an Ohio Guard unit I asked: What \nhappened?\n  Well, I was in one of those humvees, Senator. It didn't have any \narmor plating on either side, and one of those homemade bombs went off \nand blew off my leg.\n  Were we ready? Did we have a plan to win, to protect that soldier and \nothers? Clearly not. It was not until recently, and all of our findings \nafter 3 years they finally had the armor plating they needed.\n  On May 1, 2003, that banner on the aircraft carrier proclaimed that \nthe Iraqi mission was accomplished and President Bush landed on the \ncarrier and celebrated the end of the war.\n  Tragically, at that time the real war was just beginning. Of those \nAmericans who paid with their lives in this war, only 140 were killed \nduring the phase the President called major combat. We have lost almost \n2,000 since then. That means 93 percent of our troops who have been \nkilled in Iraq died after Saddam Hussein was overthrown and his army \ndefeated and since that banner was displayed on that aircraft carrier.\n\n  Last May, Vice President Cheney said the Iraqi insurgency was in its \ndeath throes. Well, I can tell you, as we see the casualty reports \ncoming from Iraq, it is clear that the insurgency is not in its death \nthroes. I truly wish it were. Our generals don't agree with that \nstatement. I do not understand what the Vice President used as his \nbasis for making it.\n  There is one other element I would like to raise which is \ncontemporary, timely, and troubling. For the last week we have had a \nvisit by a foreign Head of State. His name is Ahmed Chalabi. Mr. \nChalabi is rather well-known in Washington circles. For years and years \nhe was an Iraqi expatriate who was critical of Saddam Hussein, and he \ncreated an Iraqi national congress organization of defectors and those \nwho felt as he did that Hussein should be replaced. That is a good \nthing. I don't know of anyone who was applauding Hussein in those \nyears, and certainly Chalabi was on the right track in that area.\n  He ingratiated himself to some of the leaders in this administration, \npeople making policy in this administration, and became, sadly, a \nsource of information. I say ``sadly'' because we have come to learn \nthat much of the information given by Mr. Chalabi to members of our \nadministration turned out to be just plain wrong.\n  Ahmed Chalabi helped weave a web of deceit about what turned out to \nbe nonexistent weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. He helped provide \nthe infamous and aptly named source known as ``Curveball,'' who \nfabricated information about biological weapons labs. This information \nbecame a cornerstone, sadly, of Secretary of State Colin Powell's \nspeech and slide show to the United Nations, and it turned out to be \nall wrong. I suspect that in his decades of distinguished service to \nthe United States there are very few moments that Secretary Powell \nregrets more than being led into repeating some of these assertions by \nAhmed Chalabi and his followers. Chalabi seems to have no such regrets.\n  I took a look at Mr. Chalabi, who was confronted recently. It was in \nFebruary of last year, as a matter of fact. He was confronted with the \nfact that many of the things he told the United States about Iraq \nturned out to be false, completely false. And here is what they wrote \nin this article on February 19 of 2004 in the London Telegraph:\n\n       Mr. Chalabi, by far the most effective anti-Saddam lobbyist \n     in Washington, shrugged off charges that he deliberately \n     misled U.S. intelligence. ``We are heroes in error,'' he told \n     the Telegraph in Baghdad.\n\n  He goes on to say, and I quote Mr. Chalabi:\n\n       As far as we're concerned we've been entirely successful. \n     That tyrant Saddam is gone and the Americans are in Baghdad. \n     What was said before is not important. The Bush \n     administration is looking for a scapegoat. We are ready to \n     fall on our swords, if he wants.\n\n  Unrepentant, giving bad information to the American Government, which \nit followed in planning this invasion of Iraq. Ahmed Chalabi, no \nregrets. He achieved what he wanted to achieve: Saddam Hussein is gone. \nThe Americans are in Baghdad. The fact that the\n\n[[Page S12821]]\n\nAmerican people were misled obviously does not trouble him, but it \nshould trouble others.\n\n  What about Mr. Chalabi today? He has a title. He is Deputy Prime \nMinister in Iraq, and he received a hero's welcome from this \nadministration over the last 7 days.\n  The other part of this story I haven't mentioned is that on May 20 of \nlast year, the Iraqi security forces raided Mr. Chalabi's home in Iraq, \nseizing documents and other evidence, and charging him with having sold \nAmerican secrets to Iran, one of the countries in President Bush's axis \nof evil, a code that could have endangered American troops and American \nsecurity.\n  That is a high crime, as far as I am concerned, the kind of thing \nwhich no one can excuse or overlook. In fact, the FBI initiated an \ninvestigation of Chalabi for selling or giving those secrets to Iran, \nand twice last week the FBI told us it was a continuing active \ninvestigation. It is ironic they told us that while Mr. Chalabi was the \ntoast of the town in Washington, moving from one Cabinet official to \nanother, from Treasury Secretary Snow to Secretary of State Condoleezza \nRice, where he was greeted as warmly as a dignitary from overseas, and \nthen going to visit with Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and \nfinally, of course, with Vice President Cheney.\n  This man under active investigation by the FBI was being warmly \nreceived as a Head of State in these agencies. Why, one might ask, \nisn't the FBI doing its job? Why aren't they calling him in for \ninformation, whether he sold secrets that could have endangered \nAmerican lives? Mr. Chalabi is no hero to me. He seems to be one to \nsome members of the Bush administration. This is a man who should not \nbe treated like a hero. He ought to be treated like a suspect. That is \nwhat the FBI said he was last week. The fact he is being vetted by \nhigh-ranking officials rather than being questioned by the FBI speaks \nvolumes. Mr. Chalabi went on to say when he was asked about this during \nhis visit to Washington:\n\n       As far as we're concerned, we have been entirely \n     successful. That tyrant Saddam is gone and Americans are in \n     Baghdad.\n\n  He said: Let's look to the future. Let's not look to the past.\n  I think it is clear, as the New York Times editorial stated on \nNovember 10, 2005:\n\n       Mr. Chalabi is not just any political opportunist. He more \n     than any other Iraqi is responsible for encouraging the Bush \n     administration to make two disastrous mistakes on the Iraqi \n     intervention. Basing its justification for war on the false \n     premise that Saddam Hussein had active unconventional weapons \n     programs and falsely imagining that the Iraqi people would \n     greet the invasion with undiluted joy.\n\n  Even after the invasion when people were beginning to ask where are \nthese weapons of mass destruction, Chalabi insisted the U.S. forces \nwere simply in the wrong places and asking the wrong people.\n  In spite of all these transgressions, Mr. Chalabi is being warmly \nreceived by this administration.\n  Mr. President, I know Senator Stevens is on the floor to deliver a \neulogy for our former Sergeant at Arms, and in deference to him and his \npurpose for coming----\n  Mr. STEVENS. No, I am not going to deliver a eulogy.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will close and give the floor to Senator \nStevens for whatever purpose brings him here.\n  We believe what happened on the floor of the Senate is significant. \nWe said there must be a change of course in Iraq; we cannot continue. \nThis failed policy brought us to this point. We owe it to our \nservicemen and their families and the American people to have a plan \nfor success that will bring stability to Iraq on a timely basis, give \nthem responsibility for their own future, and start to bring American \ntroops home.\n  Our critics say we want to cut and run. No, we want to stop the loss \nof life by Americans in Iraq. We want to make sure the Iraqis know it \nis their responsibility for their future.\n  I certainly believe, as others do, that someone such as Ahmed Chalabi \nis one of the reasons we made fatal errors in the beginning of this \ninvasion of Iraq. He should not be treated as a hero. I didn't vote for \nthis war. In the fall of 2002 when we were debating use of force, I \noffered an amendment to defend the United States from an imminent \nattack by Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. That amendment got to the \nheart of the matter with the intelligence of weapons of mass \ndestruction so cloudy. It would have raised the threshold for war. It \nfailed.\n  Now we have to move forward making certain that we keep in mind first \nand foremost our commitment to our troops and our commitment to our \nmission. This is a historic vote today with the adoption of the \nDemocratic amendment as changed by Senators Warner and Frist. I \nsincerely hope this vote will mean a change in policy to bring our \ntroops home safely.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for his \ncourtesy. I do intend to attend the ceremony to eulogize the former \nSergeant at Arms of the Senate.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Stevens pertaining to the introduction of S. 2012 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nRepublican-controlled time on the Commerce-Justice-Science \nappropriations conference report be reserved for later in the day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             War On Terror\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I was just across the way in my office \nworking on several things that I think are important to the country. We \nwere working on a bill to stop the increases in taxes that will occur \nunless we act immediately. This is another bill that the Democrats are \ntrying to obstruct, but it is critically important that we pass this \nstop-the-tax-increase bill in order to keep our economy growing and to \nkeep creating jobs in this country.\n  I was also working in my office, with some of my staff, on some of \nthe things we can do to move this country more toward energy \nindependence. But I kept listening to my distinguished Democrat \ncolleague from Illinois and heard him talking about our President and \nthis war. The more I listened, the more frustrated I became. As a \nmatter of fact, I would have to say I became very angry because what I \nwas hearing was baseless accusations and shameless criticisms, things \nthat were said that I think diminish the Senate as an institution, \nwhich I feel must be refuted.\n  I am afraid that my Democratic colleagues are playing the war on \nterror similar to a political game. It is a dangerous game that \nendangers our troops, and it is a dangerous game that the Democrats \nhave played before. Over the last 25 years, terrorist attacks in this \ncountry and around the world have increased. During the Clinton \nadministration, Americans were killed in our embassies, on our warships \nand even in New York City when the World Trade Center was attacked by \nterrorists. From the Democrats and the Clinton administration, there \nwas a lot of talk, but there was no action. It was all left to the next \nPresident to deal with. Instead of dealing with it in a way that would \nhelp secure our future, the Clinton administration instead decimated \nour intelligence network with politically correct ideas that greatly \nreduced our ability to gather intelligence in difficult places around \nthe world. John Deutsch, President Clinton's Director of the CIA \ncreated rules that hurt our intelligence community's ability to gather \nhuman intelligence.\n  Now my Democrat colleagues accuse President Bush of using poor \nintelligence to do what they said needed to be done before he was even \nelected President.\n  In 1998, with President Clinton's leadership, we supported regime \nchange in Iraq. This was something that was determined as a national \npolicy years before President Bush took office. There are some reasons \nwe did this. Saddam Hussein had demonstrated that he was a danger to \ncivilization years before \n9/11. He not only attacked Kuwait and tried to assassinate an American \nPresident, he committed mass murder all over his country using weapons \nof mass destruction. He was a deadly killer.\n\n[[Page S12822]]\n\n  He supported terrorism in other countries. If a terrorist in Israel \nblew himself up and killed Israelis, the family of that terrorist would \nreceive a check from Saddam Hussein.\n  To suggest that Iraq was not supporting terrorists is not true. \nSaddam Hussein, as part of the original gulf war settlement, agreed to \ndocument and prove the destruction of his weapons of mass destruction, \nwhich he acknowledged he had. But he did not disarm. He did not \ndocument the destruction. The inspectors had to play a cat-and-mouse \ngame with him. The world did not know what Saddam Hussein had. Our \ndecimated intelligence network had to guess whether he had them. \nPresident Bush made the only decision he could.\n  Knowing the history of Saddam Hussein, having a national policy that \nwas written by the Democrats to remove him from power, he made a \ndecision to take action instead of talking about it. The justification \nfor removing Saddam Hussein from power happened before President Bush \nwas elected and had been supported by Democrats. But now they come down \nto the Senate floor and suggest that because the President had some bad \ninformation that he rushed us to war. In fact, leaving Saddam Hussein \nin power would not have been acceptable to any administration that \nlooked at the facts.\n\n  This country cannot allow murderous dictators who have attacked our \nallies, threatened civilians and destabilized the Middle East to stay \nin power.\n  Now we have Democrats, whose attitude basically embolden terrorists \nfor a decade during the 1990s by talking but not doing, on the Senate \nfloor attacking our President for doing what we knew had to be done. \nBut this is the Democrat pattern. They say anything, but they do \nnothing.\n  We are dealing with a serious energy situation in this country today, \nbut for the last decade they have obstructed any development of our own \ndomestic energy supplies. Now they are on the floor blaming President \nBush for the high energy prices, while the President and the Republican \nCongress have managed, despite the Democratic obstruction, to pass an \nEnergy bill that will move us toward energy independence.\n  The Democrats are on the floor often complaining about American job \nlosses, but when we try to pass legislation that improves the business \nclimate in this country, they obstruct. They obstructed passing our \nelimination of junk lawsuits and the elimination of fraudulent \nbankruptcies. They tried to stop that, voting en bloc against it. But \nthe President and the Republicans have been able to pass that and move \nus along.\n  There are a whole list of things that Republicans, with the \nPresident's leadership, have done from the Energy bill, to class action \nand bankruptcy reform. We have passed a budget that reduced the growth \nin spending. We have passed a number of things that improve vocational \ntraining. There is a huge list.\n  On the back side of this list is what America needs to know about: \nThe Democrat agenda, of which they have none. The reason they are \nmisleading the American people about our President and the importance \nof winning the war on terror is they have no agenda. They are not \nwilling to step out and take any leadership on any issue. So all they \ndo is obstruct, attack, distort, and complain with their ``do nothing'' \nagenda.\n  It is hard for some of us, as we try to go about our work, to move \nAmerica forward and address the difficult problems of today and create \nmore opportunities for tomorrow, when we have to carry a concrete block \nwe call the Democrat Party. But when they go across the line and start \nmisleading America about the importance of this war on terror and \ntreating it akin to some kind of political game, when we and our \nchildren and future generations are in danger, as is the rest of the \nworld. As we see almost every day, this war on terror is real--we \ncannot treat it as some kind of silly political debate where they are \ntrying to give the Commander in Chief of this country a time line as to \nwhen our troops need to go home. It is like they have not bothered to \ngo to Iraq themselves and meet with the troops, as I have had the \nchance to do twice this year, and talk with the generals. The President \nhas met every deadline he set for elections, to approve the \nconstitution, and we are moving exactly as he said we would move, to \nturn more of the defense of that country over to their military. That \nis happening. They are opening businesses, schools, and hospitals, and \nwe are helping them along the way. When we get them to the point where \nthey can defend themselves, the President will bring our troops home, \nbut continue to stand firm against terror, wherever it exists around \nthe world.\n  This is not a game. Terror is a real enemy, and many Americans have \nalready died because we did not take the war on terror seriously. It is \ntime to take it seriously and to stop playing political games with the \nmost important issue of our generation.\n  I do not think we as a Nation should ever yield to terror or the type \nof rhetoric we have had to listen to today.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Defense Authorization Bill\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly about the events \nthis morning, the votes we had prior to our adoption of the Defense \nDepartment authorization bill, particularly on the Frist, Warner, and \nLevin amendments, and try to put this in some context.\n  First of all, I think we would all agree that our young men and women \nin uniform who are fighting for freedom's cause in Iraq and Afghanistan \nand elsewhere are doing a magnificent job, one that they have \nvolunteered to do since we no longer have had the draft. Only people \nwho want to be in our military join our military. Certainly we have \nnothing but honor and respect for those who put themselves in harm's \nway in order to make us safer and, beyond that, to engage in the noble \ncause of delivering the blessings of liberty to those who have known \nnothing more than the boot heel of a tyrant, as 25 million or so have \nin Iraq, and those who lived under the Taliban--a similar number--where \nal-Qaida trained, recruited, and exported its terror in Afghanistan \nbefore we were able to turn both of those countries toward the path of \ndemocracy and self-determination as peaceful states.\n  I regret that this war in which we are engaged, the global war on \nterror, with its central front being in Iraq today, has become such a \npolitical football. Unfortunately, we see it is just too tempting a \ntarget to partisans, some partisans, to try to engage in revisionist \nhistory in order to score political points or, as we have seen this \nmorning, an attempt to impose an arbitrary deadline on the withdrawal \nof our troops in a way that would jeopardize everything that we have \ninvested in terms of our young men and women, the lives lost, the \ninjuries sustained, and the treasure we have invested in an effort to \ntry to restore Iraq to a self-governing democracy.\n  I wish to be clear that I am not questioning the patriotism of those \nwho supported this arbitrary timetable for withdrawal in voting for the \nLevin amendment, but I am questioning their judgment. I think it is \nsimply too important for us to engage in the partisan push and shove \nhere on the floor of the Senate when there is so much at stake. To me \nit seems clear that a vote on the Levin amendment today was a \nbipartisan rejection of an artificial timetable for withdrawal.\n  I have already seen some of the Web sites and even fundraising \nappeals that have taken place ever since these amendments were voted \non. That is the kind of world we live in here in Washington, inside \nthis big fishbowl where politics sometimes overtakes people's common \nsense or sense of duty. This clearly was not a Democrat victory, to \nchange Iraq policy as some have already suggested, the spin doctors, \nthose who attempt to spin the message of what happens here on the floor \nfor some partisan advantage. I regret that some are attempting to use \nthis message for political gain. This should not\n\n[[Page S12823]]\n\nbe about whether Republicans have scored points or whether Democrats \nhave scored points. Rather, this should be about our military strategy \non the ground in Iraq that is being implemented as we speak to restore \nIraq to a self-governing democracy.\n  How are we doing that? By a three-pronged plan that, No. 1, says we \nneed to train the Iraqis to provide the security necessary so democracy \ncan flourish; No. 2, to build basic infrastructure so the quality of \nlife in Iraq is such that people feel they have a stake in the outcome, \nthe success of this new democracy; and No. 3, to build democratic \ninstitutions, beginning with the passage of a constitution on October \n15 and now leading up to election of their permanent government on \nDecember 15.\n  The people of Iraq have been through a lot in these last years. They \nhave been through, even since the fall of Saddam, a lot of turmoil \nsince government after government has been created in this transition \nto permanent self-government. It is a shame, it seems to me, that there \nare those who would call for an artificial deadline for withdrawal, \nunfortunately to try to generate public opinion in a way that breaks \nour resolve and increases the likelihood that we will leave before we \nget the job done.\n  I am grateful that a bipartisan majority of the Senate rejected that \nartificial timetable for withdrawal and made a commitment, as I see it, \nto stay and get the job done until Iraq gets back on its feet and has a \nreasonable chance of succeeding as a peaceful and democratic country.\n  Last week, our country celebrated Veterans Day, last Friday, the day \nwe set aside each year to honor the bravery and the sacrifice of our \nmen and women in uniform who serve our country. I had the chance, as \ndid many of us, to return to my home State. I returned to Texas. I went \nto a ceremony at the Brazos Valley Veterans Memorial to honor these \nbrave men and women. I have must say, I was struck once again at the \ngreat chasm that seems to separate the rest of America from the echo \nchamber here inside the beltway in Washington, DC. I was reminded of \nthe differences in perception of what it is we are about and the \nobligation we have to support those men and women in uniform who are \nfighting for what we believe in. We know they are fighting for what \nthey believe in, and they do so even when the going gets tough. They do \nnot cut and run when it becomes politically expedient to do so.\n\n  I had the chance to look across that audience. We had a large \ncollection of World War II vets, people like my dad who flew in the \nArmy Air Corps out of Molesworth, England, flying a B-17. Ultimately he \nwas shot down and captured and spent 4 months in a German prison camp \nbefore General Patton and his colleagues came along and liberated him \nand his fellow POWs. But as I looked across that audience, I saw people \nlike my dad, a generation that is certainly getting older and \nunfortunately leaving us at a relatively rapid pace. There were those \npresent who had previously served, and there were some there who \ncurrently are serving. There were family members of loved ones who are \nnow overseas and families of those who had paid the ultimate sacrifice.\n  Although the circumstances differed from person to person there in \nthat audience, they all had several profound things in common. I don't \nknow that I could tell you that every single person at that veterans \nevent was in complete agreement with the decision of this President or \nthis Congress to authorize the use of force to remove Saddam Hussein, \nbut what I can tell you is that these people were all patriots. They \nsupport our troops 100 percent, and they support the ideals upon which \nour country was founded 100 percent. They know the contributions of our \ntroops represent the Iraqi people's best hope for freedom and for \ndemocracy.\n  So while there may be some here in Washington--in fact, there are--\nwho, of course, criticize what we are about and armchair generals who \nwant to direct our combatant commanders and those who actually have the \nresponsibility of conducting our national security and national defense \noperations, I thought it appropriate to point out that even though \nthere are those who dramatically undervalue our efforts in Iraq, there \nis a huge chasm, it seemed to me, between what I saw there in Bryan-\nCollege Station at the Brazos Valley Veterans Memorial Friday night and \nwhat I hear argued in the halls of the U.S. Congress, including this \nmorning. I am glad to report the obvious to all of us who live and \nrepresent constituencies around the country, that patriotism is alive \nand well, and our fellow citizens realize that we must continue to \nsupport our men and women in uniform in their brave and selfless and \nnoble efforts.\n  I have come to this Chamber several times during the past few weeks \nto speak about the situation in Iraq and to do my small part in \nrefuting the false charges by some partisans that the administration \nhas manipulated intelligence in the lead-up to the war. I wish to \nreiterate my view that we must not let the politics of the moment \nundermine the path to democracy in Iraq. Such a decision, such yielding \nto such a temptation would be incredibly shortsighted considering how \nmuch has been accomplished in a relatively short period of time and how \ndear our investment has been, both in terms of the lives lost and the \nmoney the American taxpayer has committed to this noble effort. We must \nstay the course in Iraq.\n  If our troops were to leave prematurely, what would happen? It is \nlikely that the country would collapse into chaos. Terrorists such as \nAyman al-Zawahiri, al-Qaida's No. 2 operative and Osama bin Laden's \ndeputy, and Abu Masab al-Zarqawi, al-Qaida's chief terrorist in Iraq \nand the one principally responsible for the terrorist attacks we saw \nlast week in Jordan at the wedding reception that killed other innocent \ncivilians--these are individuals who vowed to destroy America and \neveryone who stands in their way in their attempt to seize power.\n  A letter from Zawahiri and Zarqawi makes this threat exceedingly \nclear. If there is any doubt about who our enemy is and what their \ngoals are--on which there should not be after September 11--all one \nneeds to do is read this letter. It is easily available to anyone who \nwants to read it. It is found in full on the Web site of the Director \nof National Intelligence. That is www.dni.gov. In that letter, Zawahiri \nclearly describes al-Qaida's vision to establish an Islamic caliphate \nthat would rule the Middle East, destroy Israel, and threaten the very \nexistence of our way of life.\n  The consequences of a United States pullout from Iraq should not be \nin question, either. In this letter, Zawahiri tells Zarqawi that when \nthe United States leaves Iraq, al-Qaida must be prepared to claim the \nmost political territory possible in the inevitable vacuum of power \nthat would arise.\n  Yes, that is right; a premature withdrawal of our troops from Iraq \nwould create a safe haven for al-Qaida. Iraq would be more dangerous--\nnot less--if we fail to finish the job. An early arbitrary withdrawal \nfrom Iraq would empower and embolden the sworn enemies of America and, \nindeed, all civilization and anybody who disagreed with them. Failure \nto stay the course and continuing to lay the foundations of a \nfunctioning democracy would result in more--not less--terrorist \nattacks.\n  Let me say that again because there are actually some who make the \nspecious argument that our very presence in Iraq results in more \nterrorist attacks. But the failure to stay the course, the failure to \nfinish the job that we started in Iraq, and to continue to lay the \nfoundations of a functioning democracy, would result in more--not \nless--terrorist attacks.\n  This letter from Zawahiri to Zarqawi makes that clear. Once they see \nAmerica leave Iraq, once they fill the vacuum that exists, that is \nwhere they would continue to train, that is where they would continue \nto recruit, and that is where they would continue to export terror. \nAnyone who believes there would not be a greater probability of our \nsustaining another 9/11 on our own soil is kidding themselves.\n  Some of the administration's critics are now arguing, as we heard \nthis morning, for a timetable to withdraw from Iraq. Their actions are \nnothing more than an attempt to gain the attention of a concerned \nnation for political advantage rather than a serious strategy for \nvictory. Armchair generals in Washington, DC, are hardly in a position \nto know what is the best military strategy in Iraq. We ought to listen \nto our combatant commanders,\n\n[[Page S12824]]\n\nsuch as General Abizaid, the CENTCOM commander, and General Casey, who \nis in charge of coalition forces in Iraq. They have told us we have to \nfinish the job, that we can finish the job, that there is no military \non the face of the Earth that can defeat the United States of America; \nthat the only one who can defeat the United States of America is the \nUnited States itself--by losing our resolve, by prematurely \nwithdrawing, by cutting and running, and leaving the Iraqis to fend for \nthemselves in what would surely descend into chaos.\n  Our withdrawal from Iraq should be determined by the military \ncommanders on the ground and our Commander in Chief. All of us who have \nbeen to Iraq to visit our troops on the ground are confident that over \ntime the 210,000 or so Iraqis who have now been trained to provide \nsecurity for their own people sooner or later will be able to take this \njob upon themselves and we can begin to gradually, as circumstances \ndictate on the ground, bring our troops home.\n  Do all of us wish our troops could come home sooner rather than \nlater? You bet we do. We want them to come home as soon as we can get \nthem home, consistent with our duty to finish the job we started in \nIraq. But we should not under any circumstance impose an arbitrary \ntimetable on our forces, signaling weakness to our enemy, emboldening \nthem to stay with their strategy because it must be working, and we \nmust keep going even though it is tough. Our troops in Iraq are \ncommitted to victory.\n  I mentioned the chasm that separates Washington, DC, and these \nChambers from the rest of America when it comes to the perception of \nwhat we are about in Iraq and the fight for freedom's cause. There is \nalso a huge difference when you travel to Iraq and talk to our troops. \nThey wonder at some of the news reports and some of the \npoliticalization of what they are about, that they aren't confused \nabout their job, they aren't confused about the nobility of their cause \nand the importance of what they are about. Our troops in Iraq are \ncommitted to victory. I hope our elected officials would show the same \nresolve here at home.\n  As every one of our military personnel in Iraq understands, Americans \ndo not cut and run, Americans do not abandon their commitments, and \nAmericans do not abandon their friends.\n  We must remember that it is in the absence of democracy, in the \nabsence of the rule of law that extremism appears. When the rule of law \nis implemented, when people have a forum by which to redress their \ngrievances as we do in democratic circumstances, this is when the \nradical ideologues are stifled and even extinguished.\n\n  We have to remember how far the Iraqi people have come in such a \nrelatively short time--from a time when they were ruled by a dictator \nwho cared nothing for human life and who used weapons of mass \ndestruction on his own people. I have seen, as have others in this \nbody, the mass graves where at last count at least 400,000 Iraqis lie \ndead because of the ruthlessness of this blood-thirsty dictator. It was \nonly 2 short years ago that the people of Iraq were oppressed by this \nbrutal dictator. Those who privately yearned for freedom kept silent \nout of fear for their lives and the lives of their family and other \nloved ones. But that is no longer the case.\n  We have seen and continue to see that our strategy is working. The \nIraqi people will vote in elections next month. I make a prediction \nthat their turnout in these elections will be broad-based, across all \nthe sects in Iraq, and their turnout will exceed the turnout we see in \nthis country in our national elections. We saw that happen with, I \nbelieve, the 63-percent turnout in the vote to ratify the Constitution. \nIt now appears that the Sunnis, many of whom boycotted that election, \nwill finally participate in full force in electing their first leaders \nin a permanent government.\n  I hope the Members of this body who yield to the temptation to \npoliticize this issue realize their remarks run the real risk of not \nonly dividing Americans but undermining the resolve for the important \ntask we have at hand, and devalue the sacrifice of our brave men and \nwomen in uniform and the noble cause they are about.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/15/senate-section/article/S12824-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I rise to express my deepest \ncondolences to the families of the innocent victims of the brutal \nterrorist attacks that occurred in Amman, Jordan, last Wednesday. \nHomicide bombers, wearing deadly explosives under their clothes, \nentered three popular and crowded hotels and detonated themselves. \nJordanian authorities have determined the attack was the work of al-\nQaida.\n\n  So far, 57 are thought dead, among them a number of children; many \nmore are injured. A wedding reception was underway in one of the \nhotels, and on the day after what should have been the happiest day of \ntheir lives, a young Jordanian bride and her groom each had to bury \ntheir slain fathers.\n  I know my colleagues join me in completely condemning the terrorists \nbehind this attack. America will never give in to terrorists and their \nmurder of innocents. Unthinkable evil like that only strengthens our \nresolve to fight terror and bring those who practice it to justice.\n  According to our great ally King Abdullah II of Jordan, the targets \nof these Muslim terrorists were not Americans, but fellow Muslims. The \nhotels were well known to be frequented by Jordanians and Iraqis.\n  The terrorists' hope is that by attacking America's allies, like \nJordan, they can frighten those countries into abandoning the War on \nTerror, and divide the grand coalition of free nations who oppose them. \nThat appears to have been the purpose of the Amman attacks.\n  Well, the terrorists will not get what they want. I wish to bring to \nmy colleagues' attention the inspired words of His Majesty King \nAbdullah, given shortly after the terrorists struck. Before this \nbombing, King Abdullah was America's steadfast partner in the War on \nTerror. Today, if possible, he stands even more aligned with our effort \nto fight terror.\n  King Abdullah and the Jordanian people will not be swayed by the \nterrorists.\n  In fact, we saw the demonstrators in the streets of Jordan--not \nagainst the King but against the terrorists.\n  The day after the bombings, the King declared: ``We will not be \nintimidated into altering our position, nor will we abandon our \nconvictions or forfeit our role in the fight against terrorism in all \nits forms.'' He continued, ``To the contrary, every act of terrorism \nstrengthens our resolve to adhere to our convictions, and to confront, \nwith all the means at our disposal, those who seek to undermine the \nsecurity and stability of this country.''\n  We all applaud King Abdullah for his strength and commitment to this \nfight. He refuses to bend to fear. His vision of a Jordan that rejects \nterror strengthens the will of every Jordanian, even those who emerged \nbloody and scarred from these atrocious attacks, to see this struggle \nthrough.\n  King Abdullah also deserves praise for his message that Islam is a \nreligion of peace, and that the terrorists are not protectors of the \nMuslim faith but defilers of it. He is one of the world's foremost \nvoices for moderation and tolerance in Islam. He understands that the \nWar on Terror is not a war between America and Islam, as some of the \nmost radical terrorists try to paint it, but actually a war between a \nsmall, fringe faction of violent extremists on one hand and a coalition \nof all freedom-loving peoples, Muslim, Christian,\n\n[[Page S12825]]\n\nJewish and Hindu among them, on the other.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that the entirety of King Abdullah's \nstatement on the Amman bombings of last week be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n His Majesty King Abdullah's Address to the Nation Following the Amman \n               Bombings, November 10, 2005, Amman, Jordan\n\n       I would like to begin by extending my profound condolences \n     to the families of all the innocent victims who were killed, \n     and we are praying for a swift recovery for all of those who \n     were injured.\n       This is not the first time that Jordan has been a target of \n     terrorism. It is also not the only country that has been a \n     victim of terrorism; there have been many countries in the \n     region and throughout the world which have been similarly \n     terrorized by attacks of greater scope and intensity.\n       We know, however, that Jordan has been targeted more than \n     any other country for several reasons, among them, its role \n     and its message defending the essence of Islam--the religion \n     of moderation and tolerance that abhors the terrorists who \n     kill innocents in Islam's name, even as Islam is innocent of \n     such crimes.\n       Let it be clear to everyone that we will pursue these \n     terrorists and those who aide them; we will reach them \n     wherever they are, pull them from their lairs and submit them \n     to justice.\n       Jordan does not bow to coercion. We will not be intimidated \n     into altering our position, nor will we abandon our \n     convictions or forfeit our role in the fight against \n     terrorism in all its forms. To the contrary, every act of \n     terrorism strengthens our resolve to adhere to our \n     convictions, and to confront, with all means at our disposal, \n     those who seek to undermine the security and stability of \n     this country.\n       Our confidence in the security services and their ability \n     to protect the security of this country and its stability \n     remains unwavering. We have succeeded in preventing many \n     planned attacks on this country. For every infrequent success \n     terrorists have had in carrying out one of their crimes, we \n     have had many more successes in foiling their plots.\n       I appeal to every citizen--man and woman--of this country \n     to consider himself or herself a soldier and a security \n     officer. Each one of you has a responsibility to protect your \n     country. Circumstances require each and every citizen to be \n     cautious and vigilant, and to cooperate with the security \n     services to prevent any attack on the security and stability \n     of this country. We must be united in confronting these \n     terrorists, who have neither a religion nor a conscience.\n       I am confident that the patriots of Jordan--men and women--\n     will maintain, as they always have, a watchful eye over the \n     country and its security, and will be the first line of \n     defense in protecting Jordan and its achievements. Jordan \n     will continue, with the help of God and the determination of \n     its people, to overcome evil.\n       Finally, all my thanks and appreciation go to our security, \n     military and civil institutions, as well as to the citizens \n     of Jordan who have acted as one in confronting the attacks on \n     our precious capital, Amman.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, President Bush arrived in Japan today \nand will meet tomorrow with Prime Minister Koizumi. Later this week, he \nwill travel to China to meet with their President as well. It is time \nthat we insist that the President use this opportunity, this important \nopportunity, to demand changes, changes in our economic relationship \nwith China and with Japan. The President needs to say, as he is there \nwith those leaders, that we will no longer accept their illegal trade \npractices that are costing American jobs, and we demand that changes be \nmade; we no longer accept the fact that China and Japan manipulate \ntheir currency, which means their products are artificially lower than \nours when they sell them into this country; we no longer accept that \nthey are stealing our patents and our intellectual property.\n  Last week, I was pleased to author a letter to the President with \nthat very message on behalf of myself and 14 other Senators, urging him \nto make 2 major changes in our relationship with these important \nnations: No. 1, we need to end the rampant counterfeiting of American \nproducts that is occurring in China. It is estimated that 7 percent of \nworld trade is in counterfeit goods, that the counterfeit market is \nworth $350 billion. It is estimated that in the auto industry alone, we \nlose over $12 billion annually to counterfeit auto parts, parts that \nare unsafe as well as costing us jobs. If you stop this illegal \nactivity, the auto industry could hire an additional 200,000 workers--\n200,000 workers in Michigan. That would equal our ability to cut our \nunemployment rate by two-thirds--200,000 people who are now challenged \nwith losing their way of life, trying to figure out what they are going \nto do if they are making half or a third less of what they used to make \nbecause of what is happening in manufacturing in our country. People \nare paying more for health care and may very well lose their pension.\n  We can do something about this if we simply change our relationship \nand send a strong message that we are going to put American businesses \nand American workers first. Our middle class clearly was built on \nmanufacturing, and our manufacturers are having a hard time these days.\n  It is critical that we continue to manufacture in this country. Is it \nchanging? Has it changed? Of course, it is now high-tech manufacturing. \nWhen you walk into an automobile factory, it looks very different--\nquiet, clean, computers, highly skilled workers--but we have to \nmaintain a strong, vibrant manufacturing economy. We cannot just step \nback and say we are going to be a service economy now and let the rest \nof the world make things and grow things. That will lead to what is now \nbecoming a race to the bottom for American families.\n  The Economist Magazine recently reported a disturbing fact. This \nyear, manufacturing jobs in the United States dropped below 10 percent \nof the population for the first time in history. This is not acceptable \nif we are going to continue to have our way of life in this country, \nand it is not necessary. If anyone believes that the middle class in \nthis country can survive without a vibrant manufacturing sector, they \nare mistaken. As I indicated, we must make things in this country and \nadd value to it as we do so, as well as grow things. That is a \nfoundation of our economy, and that is what has created the wonderful \nmiddle class and the wonderful way of life we have enjoyed for so long \nas Americans.\n\n  We can do better than this policy that is currently in place.\n  The President must demand that China and Japan stop manipulating \ntheir currency. When they undervalue their currency, it makes U.S. \nexports to China artificially more expensive and places U.S. \nmanufacturers at an unfair disadvantage in the Chinese market. It also \nmakes their imports to us artificially less expensive, hurting \nmanufacturers and costing American jobs. When they undervalue their \ncurrency, it is essentially an illegal subsidy of imports from China \nand a large tax on U.S. exports to China, and we need to call it the \nway it is. The President needs to be in China and call it for what it \nis.\n  We are projected to finish this year with a record trade deficit of \nmore than $700 billion. That is more than the budget deficit, up $100 \nbillion over the record $618 billion last year. China accounts for $200 \nbillion of this deficit, more than a quarter of the total trade deficit \nin our country. China is the largest contributor to the U.S. current \naccount trade deficit, and therefore adjustment of its currency has to \nbe a part of anything we do in revitalizing the manufacturing sector.\n  China is not the only offender here. In 2003, the Bank of Japan spent \n$190 billion in global currency markets in order to manipulate and \nartificially weaken the yen. Japan continues this practice today by \ntalking down the value of their currency, promising intervention if the \nyen moves out of a predetermined trading range.\n  The President must insist that this stop if we are going to continue \nto have a relationship, an economic relationship with both of these \ncountries. In\n\n[[Page S12826]]\n\nfact, we can do something about currency manipulation right now. Every \n6 months, the Secretary of the Treasury submits a report to us as to \nwhether countries are manipulating. We expect to have a report in front \nof us this month, the month of November. Unfortunately, I expect it to \nsay what it has always said, which is technically they are doing what \nwe all know that they are doing, we all know. Any businessperson in my \nState can tell you that China is manipulating their currency. Talk to \npeople in the auto industry, they will talk about Japan. And yet our \nown Treasury Secretary will not certify it is happening, giving us the \ntools to enforce against this illegal trade practice.\n  Let me be very clear. Currency manipulation kills American jobs, and \nit is illegal, it is illegal under the WTO and IMF obligations. China \nsays they want to be a part of the world community, the world \nmarketplace. They have been allowed to do that. We now need to say to \nthem very strongly, with this opportunity comes the responsibility to \nfollow the rules.\n  One of the things that is extremely concerning to me, when you look \nat currency manipulations, we have lost over 1.5 million manufacturing \njobs because of this one policy that is illegal. The Treasury Secretary \ncan do something about that by simply certifying that it is happening, \nand the President of the United States right now this week can look the \nPresident of China in the eye and say this is no longer going to be \ntolerated by the United States of America, we will not continue to lose \nmanufacturing jobs and our quality of life in this country because they \nare not following the rules. Cheating is no longer allowed by China and \nby Japan.\n  The bottom line is we can no longer continue to sit on the sidelines \nwhile our trading partners continue to artificially control prices, \nlook the other way when it comes time to enforce intellectual property \nrights, and fail to live up to their obligations under the WTO and the \nIMF. It is not acceptable to say that we are going to throw open our \neconomy in the international marketplace and not care what the rules \nare.\n  Every other country cares what the rules are. The European Union took \nus to court because they felt we were unfairly subsidizing our \nbusinesses. They won. We changed our tax laws. We are the only country \nthat does not seem to have policies that get it. This administration \ndoesn't understand they are supposed to be on the same side of the \ntable with American workers and American businesses. It is time for \nthat to happen. I urge the President to act now before our \nmanufacturing economy and our middle-class way of life is taken from \nus.\n  Current Federal policies are based on a philosophy that says to \nAmericans, you are on your own in a global economy; you are on your \nown, good luck. To American manufacturers, you are on your own; \nAmerican workers, you are on your own.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe that we are in this thing together, and \nAmericans understand that we have a stake in what the rules are and an \neconomy that works for everybody, an economy that puts Americans and \nAmerican businesses first so that we can continue the great way of life \nthat we have had in this country. Americans know that we are in it \ntogether and that together America can do better. I call upon the \nPresident to join us in the fight for our way of life in America.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Today is the opening day for the new Medicare \nprescription drug plan D, and it is a day of great concern across \nAmerica for millions of senior citizens who want to get it right. They \nbelieve, as I do, that Medicare should include a prescription drug \nbenefit. It is almost hard to believe that a program that has been in \nexistence for 40 years basically does not provide prescription drug \ncoverage, but it started in a day when there were not that many \nprescription drugs and they were not as good. Today, we realize that \noften taking the right medication can make a person independent, \nstrong, and living the life they want to live and avoiding doctors' \ncare and hospital care.\n  So it is certainly the thing to do. We have known it for a long time. \nWe have talked about it for a long time. We debated it over 2 years ago \nand decided to pass this approach to Medicare prescription drug \nbenefits. I do not think we could have dreamed up a more complicated \napproach for a benefit that is basically pretty straightforward. Many \nof us thought the plan we passed here in Congress was just a sop or a \nfavor for the pharmaceutical industry. They wanted to be able to offer \nplans all across America and say to seniors: Come and figure out which \none is best for you. Well, the problem, of course, is that there are \nhundreds and hundreds of plans across America. And now senior citizens, \nsome of whom are not in the best shape physically, are forced to make a \ncall.\n  A fellow in Springfield, IL, told me about his 80-year-old mother who \ncalled him really concerned. She said: You know, I am supposed to pick \na prescription drug plan, and they tell me to go to the Internet. What \ndoes that mean? You see, three-fourths of senior citizens have never \nlogged on, they have never been on the Internet. They go to the \ntraditional sources of information that you might expect--someone they \ntrust. She went to her son and said: Can you help me through this? And \nher son came to me and said: Senator, what have you done to us? I just \ntook a look at the Internet, and my mom has 40 choices. I now have to \nline up her prescription drugs and figure out which plan covers those \ndrugs and how much they charge, and then I have to figure out which \nplan will work with the drugstore that she is comfortable with, the one \nshe trusts. I have to put that all together and make a decision for \nher, and I better do it quickly. I have until May 16, and if I wait \nuntil after that, then I am going face a penalty.\n  She is lucky. She had her son to call. Some seniors don't have \nanybody to call. But there are people calling them. Do you know who is \ncalling them? The insurance companies that want to sell these plans, \nsome of the pharmaceutical companies, some of the drug companies, they \nare calling the senior citizens and telling them: We have a deal for \nyou. And many of these people, bewildered by what they are facing, \nreally don't know where to turn. You can't walk into a drugstore in my \nhometown of Springfield, IL, without having somebody go up to a senior \ncitizen and say: Let me talk to you about this prescription drug \nbenefit.\n  Think about that. Some people have knocks on the door and phone calls \nwith folks saying: We have the best plan in the world for you. In fact, \nthe Attorney General of Illinois, Lisa Madigan, had a press conference \nwith us a few weeks ago. They are finding evidence of rampant fraud \nwhen it comes to companies that are sadly taking advantage of our \nseniors. They are calling them and saying: Incidentally, will you give \nus your Social Security number so we can log you into the system? These \npeople unwittingly give their Social Security number that can open up \nso many elements of their personal life they should not be advertising \nand publicizing.\n  How did we ever reach this point? Is this the best we can do? I don't \nthink so. When it comes to helping our seniors with a real prescription \ndrug benefit, America can do better--a lot better--than what we are \nasking the seniors to go through right now. American seniors are \nconfused about this plan, and Congress needs to give them at least more \ntime to figure it out.\n  Let me show a chart that explains part of it. ``Understanding How the \nBenefit Will Be Administered.'' They asked seniors:\n\n       To the best of your knowledge, do seniors in the \n     traditional Medicare Program have to sign up with a private \n     plan to get the new Medicare drug benefit or not?\n\n  Yes, 35 percent; no, 32 percent; don't know, 33 percent.\n\n       Do seniors have to enroll in a Medicare PPO or HMO to get \n     the new Medicare drug benefit or not?\n\n  Yes, 17 percent; no, 40 percent; don't know, 42 percent.\n  According to a poll released by the Kaiser Family Foundation last \nweek,\n\n[[Page S12827]]\n\ntwo-thirds of seniors don't even know they have to choose a private \nplan. One-third of seniors think they are going to get their drugs \nthrough Medicare, and that is wrong. That is the proposal we suggested \non the Democratic side of the aisle to make this simple and \nstraightforward, a Medicare plan where the Federal Government would \nbargain with the pharmaceutical companies to get bulk discounts and low \nprices, saving seniors money and saving taxpayers money. But the \npharmaceutical companies wanted no part of it. They want to be able to \ncharge the highest prices they can. They want the smallest bargaining \nunits they can come up with: groups of seniors rather than all Medicare \nseniors.\n  Let me show another chart which spells out some of the problems with \nthe current approach seniors are facing. This chart--and this was part \nof a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, Harvard School of Public \nHealth, on awareness and use of the Medicare Web site, medicare.gov. \nThey asked seniors:\n\n       Have you ever heard of the Web site medicare.gov?\n\n  Two-thirds said no.\n\n       Have you ever looked for information on medicare.gov?\n\n  Three-fourths of them have never been online.\n  Let me show some other statistics that show the gravity of this \nproblem that faces seniors as they have to make literally life-and-\ndeath decisions.\n  The Kaiser Family Foundation asked in a survey, ``Seniors' Beliefs \nabout Enrollment'':\n\n       Do seniors generally need to sign up to get the new \n     Medicare prescription drug benefit or will coverage \n     automatically begin by January 1, 2006?\n\n  Have to sign up, 64 percent; 10 percent said it will begin \nautomatically; 25 percent, don't know. That was in October 2005.\n  We are finding fewer and fewer seniors understand the obligation and \nresponsibility they currently have. If a senior does not sign up for a \nMedicare drug plan in 2006 but wants to enroll in a future year, which \nof the following is true: He or she will face a financial penalty? \nThirty-six percent said yes; 27 percent said don't know; 19 percent \nsaid no penalties; 17 percent said maybe.\n  Most alarming, 63 percent of seniors don't know they will face \nfinancial penalties if they don't sign up by May of next year. If a \nsenior decides in June of next year to go back and try to sign up, they \nwill have to wait until November of that same year for the next open \nenrollment period. Boy, you have to read the fine print. And to think \nwe are putting millions of seniors through this is hard to believe.\n  I would say this: If you enjoy doing your tax returns, you are going \nto love signing up for this program because this is going to confront \nyou with more choices and more new information and more fine print that \ncan get you in trouble than most seniors could ever imagine. For every \nmonth a senior waits, they will pay a penalty of 1 percent on the \nnational base premium. That penalty is added to their premium every \nmonth for the rest of their lives. So by May, if you haven't figured it \nout and you want to wait until October or November, you now have \nincurred a penalty of 1 percent a month which you now will have to pay \nas long as you are part of the program, and the penalty can increase \neach year as premiums increase. This is some punishment for not signing \nup.\n\n  Let me talk about my State of Illinois. There are 17 insurance \ncompanies offering 84 different Medicare HMO or PPO plans. There are 16 \nprescription drug organizations offering 52 different prescription drug \nbenefits, for a total of 136 plans in my State of Illinois. In Cook \nCounty alone, there will be 64 different Medicare drug plans.\n  I asked my staff to act as if they are a senior signing up for this \nplan and find out what they can. You won't be able to make much of this \nif you are following this debate. But if you think that is a big, long \nlist of plans to choose from in the State of Illinois, that is half the \nstory. Here is the whole story. This is what your mother and \ngrandmother, your father and grandfather will have to sort through. \nThey will have to figure out what the premium might be, what the \ndeductible is, what is the copay, whether they are going to fill the \ndonut, which is another problem with this plan, whether it covers your \ndrug.\n  Incidentally, you know what we found out, even if you get on their \nWeb site, you can't find out if the most common drugs are going to be \ncovered by these plans. We tried to find out if Zocor, a common drug \nfor cholesterol, would be covered by these plans. Not in a single \ninstance could we gather that information off the Web site. You have to \ncall the plan. You are put into voice mail. You have to wait patiently \nuntil your turn comes to ask whether one of these plans is the best \nplan for you.\n  This chart is what a Cook County senior who doesn't have any \nextenuating circumstances would have to evaluate. What I mean by \n``extenuating circumstances'' is whether they face factors that make \nthe comparison of these plans even more difficult. This person I am \ntalking about is not in a nursing home, not eligible for State \nassistance through Illinois Cares Rx or Medicaid, not eligible for \nFederal low-income assistance, nor is she on Social Security \ndisability.\n  We assume she is taking four drugs: Zocor for cholesterol, Nexium for \nchronic heartburn, Fosomax for osteoporosis, and Relafen for arthritis.\n  Because the formularies--the list of drugs you can receive under each \nplan--are not listed in the ``Medicare and You'' handbook she received \nlast week, she has to call every single plan to find out if her drugs \nare covered, or she can go out to the Web site, if she is one out of \nfour seniors who have ever done that in their life, for companies.\n  First, she has to find the Web site because they are not listed in \nthe Medicare handbook sent to seniors. Once she knows which companies \ncover the drugs, she will have to add up the copays, deductibles, and \npremiums to determine the best deal. Is that the kind of assignment you \nwant to give to your mother in a nursing home? Is that the kind of \nassignment you want to give to seniors perhaps dealing with their own \nchallenges and problems in their life?\n  Unfortunately, that is the assignment this bill does give. When the \nKaiser Family Foundation told seniors they would have more than 40 \nplans to choose from, 70 percent of seniors said more plans make the \nprogram confusing, and that is obvious.\n  Sally Moss from Jacksonville, IL, wrote to me and said:\n\n       On my kitchen bar sits material I have received in the mail \n     from Social Security, AARP, and companies advertising their \n     plans.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has exceeded the \ntime allotted in morning business.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 8 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Sally Moss wrote:\n\n       On my kitchen bar sits materials I received in the mail \n     from Social Security, AARP, and companies advertising their \n     plans.\n       Periodically, I sit down to try to make sense of it, \n     knowing that I need to make a decision before long. This idea \n     of having to select a drug insurance plan from the private \n     sector is the most ludicrous thing. . . . I am only 66 years \n     old, with a major in business administration and a minor in \n     computer science, and have only been retired for 16 months. \n     If I am frustrated and confused, imagine those who are much \n     older and less educated.\n\n  What can seniors do at this point if they don't have someone in their \nfamily they can turn to, whom they can trust, who will help them work \nthrough this morass of Government redtape to get to the plan for them? \nTurn to a group that doesn't have a financial interest in your \nsituation. Never, ever give out your Social Security number. Go to \nGovernment agencies such as the Senior Health Insurance Program in my \nhome State of Illinois, but be prepared for a long wait. We had our \noffice call on behalf of some seniors to find out how long it would \ntake to get information, and it turns out you are put in voice mail and \nyou could wait for a long time.\n  In Peoria, IL, there are 23 volunteers answering the phones. They \ntell us they need 100 to get the job done in that one town.\n  It is not uncommon for seniors to attend two or three informational \nsessions because this benefit is so complicated. Some seniors get \npretty emotional. They don't want to make the wrong decision.\n\n[[Page S12828]]\n\n  In DeKalb County, there are four counselors for the whole county. Bob \nRosemier is so concerned about the lack of staff that he is trying to \nget the DeKalb County Board to put on counselors to explain this \ncomplicated Federal program.\n  I am cosponsoring with Senator Nelson and Senator Schumer a bill \ncalled the Medicare Informed Choice Act of 2005. I ask any of my \ncolleagues in the Senate who are receiving phone calls from seniors in \ntheir State facing the same problems I just described--finding it \nalmost impossible to wade through this information and make the right \nchoice, concerned they won't be able to do it even in the few months we \nhave given them, worried over the penalties that could be assessed \nagainst them if they miss the next May 16 deadline--to help us pass \nthis bill before we go home for Thanksgiving.\n  This bill does three things. It delays the late enrollment penalties \nfor an additional 6 months so people have an entire year to sign up \nwithout penalty. It gives every Medicare beneficiary the opportunity to \nmake a one-time change in plan enrollment at any point in 2006, so if a \nsenior makes a mistake and chooses the wrong plan, it can be remedied. \nIt also protects employees from being dropped by their former \nemployer's plan during the first year of implementation so that \nbeneficiaries have time to correct enrollment mistakes.\n  The Medicare Informed Choice Act is a modest, time-limited step we \ncan take to ease the pressure on our senior citizens so that in the \nfirst year they get the decision made and made right, and if they make \na mistake, they will not be penalized for it.\n  I urge all my colleagues, if you believed passionately in this bill \nas it was passed--and I did not--at least be sensitive to the people \nback home who are struggling to make sense out of this complicated \nmeasure. I urge all my colleagues to join me in the effort with Senator \nNelson and others to help protect Medicare beneficiaries during the \nbenefits implementation period.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/15/senate-section/article/S12828-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1841\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, Senator DeMint and I are here tonight to \ntalk about an issue that has drifted to the back burner of American \npolitical discourse. It is unfortunate that it has. It is an issue that \nboth the Senator and I, and I know many others on this side of the \naisle, have worked to accomplish diligently now for many years, for me \nsince 1995, trying to grapple with the shifting demographics and the \nchanges that are coming to this country when it comes to the issue of \nentitlement programs.\n  There is no more important entitlement program that we have to \npreserve and protect and save than the Social Security system. It is \nthe bedrock upon which our seniors have the security to meet the needs \nthey have in their later years in life.\n  We understand this demographic timebomb of the baby boom generation, \npeople living longer, lower birth rates, all of those things come \ntogether to create a demographic perfect storm that causes the Social \nSecurity not to be able to pay for the benefits promised to future \nretirees. We have tried to put forward solutions. I put forward \nsolutions. Senator DeMint has put forward more than one solution. Other \npeople on this side of the aisle have done so. The House has done so. \nThe President has put forward ideas on how to address this problem. We \nhave done so because we believe it is important for us to step up to \nthe plate and be serious about addressing this serious concern that \nmillions of Americans who are retired, near retirement, and even \nyounger Americans have about their ability to collect their Social \nSecurity check.\n  We fought hard to bring this debate to a head on the floor of the \nSenate. Unfortunately, we have not succeeded. We have not succeeded \nbecause we have been met with a partisan obstructionism that is as rock \nsolid as the marble before me on the rostrum.\n  The fact is, we have seen no cooperation at all from the other side \nof the aisle. Unfortunately, we have not seen any attempt to come to \nthe table and try to solve the problems of Social Security that all \nsides of the spectrum admit is looming for future generations of \nretirees. That is unfortunate. It is unfortunate because we have had an \nopportunity this year to address an important issue before the crisis \nstrikes.\n  One of the great complaints that Americans have about Congress is \nthat we wait until the problem is almost overwhelming us before we do \nanything to react to it and therefore end up with less-than-optimal \nsolutions.\n  We have an opportunity now, as the crisis looms but far enough away, \nto be able to address it in a way that can spread out the burden and \ncreate better opportunities for future generations of retirees, and \njust as importantly, future generations of taxpayers and American \nfamilies trying to keep the quality of life and, in fact, improve the \nquality of life that we have in America. But we did not get that \naccomplished.\n  What Senator DeMint and I have decided to do, in cooperation with our \nleadership in the Senate, is to try to take a first step. Using \nfootball analogies, which I know the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Allen, \nloves to use, we tried to throw the long ball and march down the field, \nbut we are going to try to run off tackle here and see if we can pick \nup a yard or two to move the ball down the field to get to the goal of \nproviding retirement security for future generations and saving and \nstrengthening the Social Security system.\n  The first play in trying to accomplish that is legislation that I \nhave introduced called the Social Security Guarantee Act of 2005. As I \nmentioned before, Americans work very hard and pay a lot of money. It \nis the biggest tax that most Americans pay. The overwhelming majority \nof Americans, the biggest tax they pay is the Social Security tax. From \nthe tax they pay, they expect that benefit to be there when they \nretire.\n  The point is, for those who are at or near retirement, the answer is \nthat it will be there. In fact, in looking at the long-term problems of \ndealing with Social Security, there is nothing this Congress should do \nto affect the near-term retirees and those who are retired today. We \nhave said over and over again, those of us who have been advocates for \nstrengthening the system, whether it is the President or Senator DeMint \nor Senator Frist or others, that we do not want to do anything to \nimpact those who are near-term retirees and those who are already in \nthe system.\n  The reason is twofold. No. 1 is we do not have to. The system is \nsolvent. In other words, there is more money coming in than we need to \npay out over the next 15-plus years. Therefore, we do not need to have \nany kind of fixes for those in the short term. The problem is out in \nthe long term.\n  The second reason is a matter of fairness and equity. To change the \ngame literally before someone crosses the finish line, to move the \nfinish line--or even the people who have already crossed that finish \nline and have ended up in Social Security, to move it back would simply \nbe inequitable. People would not have the opportunity to plan for that, \nand it could be very disruptive to their retirement.\n  So what Senator DeMint and I have suggested in the Social Security \nGuarantee Act is that we put in writing in the statute what everyone \nhas sort of agreed to in casual conversation and even beyond casual \nconversation. If we can put that chart up, the Senate recently, March \n15 of this year, all 100\n\n[[Page S12829]]\n\nSenators, including every Senate Democrat, in a rollcall vote, voted \nfor the Graham-Santorum amendment to the budget resolution. If we look \nat the language, I will point to the part A. It says that Social \nSecurity reform ``must protect current and near term retirees from any \nchanges to Social Security benefits.''\n  So what the Social Security Guarantee Act does, which I am proposing, \nis to actually make it a Federal law, not just a resolution, something \nthat we all think is a good idea, which is what a resolution is, but \nactually put legislative language in place, put something in law that \nsays that your benefits are guaranteed, your cost-of-living increases \nare guaranteed in the Federal law which, contrary to what most seniors \nbelieve, is not the case. There is a Supreme Court case from 1960 which \nsays that there is, in fact, no legal right that you have.\n  Obviously, there are claims that can be made in the political process \nto those rights, but as far as legal rights in the statute, there is no \nguarantee to that cost of living.\n  It would be vitally important for us, as we head into hopefully a \nlonger term and more complete look at the Social Security system and \nsaving that system, that we start from the ground that we are not going \nto affect anyone who was born before 1950. That is basically people 55 \nand older in our society today, we are going to say, If you were born \nbefore 1950, you are off the table; we are not going to discuss it. We \nare not going to play politics with you. We are not going to scare you. \nWe are not going to threaten you. We are going to take these benefits \nand we are going to enshrine them in the law to protect them from \nanyone playing politics with them or even trying to include them in any \nkind of reform down the road.\n  This is a first step. It is a small step, but it is an important one \nfor our Nation's seniors. I am hopeful we will be able to get that done \nmaybe even this evening.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am not going to spend much time, \nfrankly.\n  (Several Senators addressed the Chair.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator \nfrom South Carolina control the time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Pennsylvania if I \nmay have 5 minutes. I have to leave very quickly.\n  Mr. DeMINT. We have been waiting for several days to do this. We will \nkeep the time.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would be happy to yield. I will yield 5 minutes to \nthe Senator from Montana, the ranking member of the Finance Committee.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am not going to spend a lot of time on \nthis because this is just ``kabuki'' tonight. Everyone knows this is \nnot a serious effort. Everyone knows that this is an attempt, frankly, \nto make a statement to the press and the people back home. It is very \ndisingenuous, in this Senator's view, because it is not serious, and it \nis playing with the lives of a lot of senior citizens who wonder what \nis going on.\n  This consent asks the Finance Committee to be discharged of the \nlegislation. I do not understand that at all. If this is such an \nimportant issue, why doesn't the Finance Committee deal with that? I \nthink the answer to that is because there are not the votes in the \nFinance Committee. The majority of Republicans would not support this \nin the Finance Committee. They know privatization of Social Security is \none of the worst ideas that has come out of this body by any group of \nSenators in a long time. Why? The DeMint bill increases the Federal \ndebt held by the public by $1 trillion in current dollars in the first \n10 years. It increases the Federal debt by $1.7 trillion the first 20 \nyears. By 2080, the debt will be higher under current law by more than \n$800 billion. So it is a massive increase in the Federal debt.\n  Secondly, it will cause a huge increase in the annual budget deficits \nfor the same reasons.\n  Third, what does it do? It means a reduction in benefits that would \notherwise go to Social Security recipients. Why is that? Because the \nmoney taken out of Social Security would not be available to pay for \nSocial Security benefits. That will reduce the benefit payments out of \nSocial Security.\n  The argument is private accounts would offset that. All studies show, \nat best, that is barely a wash, probably worse than that because the \nprivate accounts would be subject to the vagaries of the markets. Over \nthe long haul, seniors would not be doing very well at all.\n  Add to that, it usually creates a huge risk. More than that, it \ncreates a very large administrative cost not recognized by the authors.\n  Jason Furman, from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, \nestimates the plan would have administrative costs of at least $25 \nbillion over the first 10 years. That is above what is paid now in the \ncurrent Social Security system.\n  Also, the DeMint proposal would treat individuals with different \nyears of birth in different ways. It would cause an inequity among \nbenefits of Social Security recipients.\n  So I am not going to say much more about this. It is flawed. Frankly, \nit is a phony gimmick. One has to call a spade a spade around here \nsometimes and not be too deferential, not be too nice, too courteous, \nbut to call it a spade. This is a fraudulent effort to play with \npeople's lives, and at the appropriate time, it will be appropriately \nobjected to.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, while I was trying to be courteous in \nyielding to my colleague, I want to make a couple of comments about \nwhat the Senator from Montana said. I would hope he would go back and \nread the Social Security Guarantee Act of 2005 because it does not do \nanything the Senator from Montana spoke of. What this bill simply does \nis guarantee benefits in the law for people who were born before 1950. \nIt does not set up any kind of personal account system. It does not do \nall of the things that the Senator from Montana said.\n  The Senator from South Carolina will talk about his Stop the Raid \nbill, which simply takes money out of the surplus and puts it into \naccounts for holders to make sure that that money is spent on Social \nSecurity benefits but no administrative costs. All the things the \nSenator from Montana talked about do not apply to either one of our \nbills.\n  I understand there may be an objection, but I would caution the \nSenator from Montana that the objection cannot be under those terms \nbecause the objections that the Senator from Montana cited are not in \neither one of the bills. I yield to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I say to Senator Santorum, as he can tell, I was \noriginally hesitant to yield to our distinguished Democratic colleague, \nbut I am now so grateful that the Senator did yield because it made the \ncase of why we need to guarantee benefits and why we need to stop the \nraid on the Social Security surplus.\n  Practically all the information that we heard is untrue as it relates \nto my bill, but the misleading information is the best case for the \nGuarantee Act that Senator Santorum has proposed. It is so important, \nwhen people are getting untruths and so much misinformation that is \nintended to confuse them, that we reassure the American people that \nregardless of how we change Social Security to benefit future workers, \nthat we are not going to change anything about the benefits of anyone \nwho was born before 1950.\n  I am honored to be presenting these ideas with Senator Santorum \ntoday. There is no one in this Congress and probably no one in this \ncountry who has done more to protect Social Security for this \ngeneration or the next than has Senator Santorum.\n  I am also supporting this Guarantee Act because Americans know that \nwe have a problem with Social Security. It is disingenuous for any \nMember of the Senate to suggest otherwise. So we must guarantee in the \nface of these folks knowing we have a problem, but we also must begin \nnow the process of fixing the Social Security system so it will be \nthere for younger Americans. We can do that by, first, stop spending \nSocial Security on other things. That is what we are doing right now as \nI speak.\n\n[[Page S12830]]\n\n  Americans know why we have a problem with Social Security. Maybe \nSenator Santorum can add more later since he has done so many \ntownhalls. There are many Congressmen and Senators who have gone out to \ntalk about Social Security, and they have had many people stand up and \nsay, Social Security would be fine if you folks in Congress would stop \nspending Social Security on other things. They figured out that every \ndime that comes in for Social Security that is not needed for today's \nretirees is spent on other programs.\n\n  If we could look at the next slide, since the mid-1980s we have had \n$1.7 trillion of Social Security taxes that have come in that were not \nneeded to pay benefits. Our colleagues will say that that is safe and \nsound in the trust fund but, frankly, if there is one fact that is true \non this floor tonight, it is that every dime has been spent on \nsomething else. Not one penny has been saved for Social Security for \ntoday's retirees or for tomorrow's retirees.\n  What we are proposing is to stop that raid on Social Security. We are \nnot proposing a comprehensive change in the Social Security system. In \nfact, Americans would see no difference in the Social Security system. \nWhat we would start doing is to take the money that is not needed for \nSocial Security today and save it so that it would not be spent on \nother things.\n  Here is the proposition: Between now and 2017, we are going to spend \nanother $775 billion of Social Security money on other things unless we \npass this Stop the Raid on Social Security bill. We can see it year to \nyear. This year it is almost $70 billion that came in for Social \nSecurity that was spent on other things. Next year it will be well over \n$80 billion, and it will continue until it disappears in 2017. At that \npoint, there will not be enough Social Security taxes to pay benefits, \nand we will have to start moving money from the general fund to make \nsure every American gets their Social Security check.\n  The Stop the Raid bill would take all of this money, $775 billion, \nand put it in Treasury bills so that it could not be spent on other \nthings. Instead of the government owning it, the people who send the \nmoney for Social Security would own it.\n\n  My Democrat colleagues oppose ownership. They do not want the \nAmerican people to own their own Social Security system. They want the \nGovernment to own it, and they want the Government to continue to spend \nit on other things. We want to stop that raid on Social Security. The \nDemocrats, as we have heard tonight, will say that if we stop spending \nthis Social Security money on other things, it is going to increase the \ndeficit. Again, that is not true. All it does is make us honest with \nour accounting.\n  Right now, the $1.7 trillion we have already spent, and this 775 \nbillion additional dollars is spent without any recognition that we are \ncreating a debt. If we save this money in Treasury notes where there is \nno risk to the American people, we have to start counting it as debt if \nwe continue to spend it. This is a secret slush fund that Congress has \nused for many years--$1.7 trillion plus $775 billion. Congress, every \nyear, spends this money on other things and does not count it as debt. \nIf we start saving it for Social Security, it will be a debt if we \ncontinue to spend it.\n  Only in Washington--and I am afraid only my Democrat colleagues--\ncould say that saving money creates a debt. I am afraid only a \nDemocratic colleague at this point could say that saving $775 billion \nof Social Security money for Social Security actually weakens the \nprogram. Their intent is to oppose ownership by the American people who \nshould own Social Security. Their intent is to spend this $775 billion \non something else.\n  I have heard my Democrat colleagues over the last couple of weeks \ntalk about stopping the raid. They want to stop the raid by increasing \ntaxes. They have said that they stopped the raid. That has never \nhappened, and that is not true because even when we were in surpluses \nas a nation a few years ago, every dime of Social Security was spent. \nSome of it was spent to pay down debt, but it was all spent. And not \none penny, even when the Nation was in surplus, was saved for Social \nSecurity. We need to stop that practice and be honest with the American \npeople.\n  My Democrat colleagues have said interesting things about stopping \nthe raid. Our distinguished minority leader has said he supports the \nraid. He called stopping the raid a ``bad idea'' that will ``threaten \nbenefits and increase the debt and weaken Social Security.'' Get that. \nWe are going to save Social Security for Social Security and that \nweakens Social Security. It is amazing.\n  Let's look at another comment from Democrat leaders. This comes from \nour colleague in the House, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi:\n\n       There is nothing wrong with Social Security lending money \n     with the prospect of returning it.\n\n  One more quote, and then I know Senator Santorum has probably some \nquestions for me. This is from our colleague, Charlie Rangel, the House \nWays and Means ranking member. When talking about the raid, he says:\n\n       There is nothing wrong with that.\n\n  But let be read his whole statement. He said:\n\n       Would you have any problem if you put your money into a \n     bank and they just took your money and invested it and you \n     went to the bank and they gave you your money when you needed \n     it? There is nothing wrong with that.\n\n  The problem is, that is the core of the misinformation we are hearing \nfrom Democrats, that our money from Social Security is actually saved \nin a bank; that it is actually there. But that is not true. It is not \nfair to tell the American people that it is true. There is no bank. \nThere is no money. We need to start today to stop the raid on Social \nSecurity money.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask the Senator from South Carolina, one of the \nthings I hear, and I think you were alluding to this, is that some \npeople believe that they actually have an account at Social Security \nwhere this money they contribute is sort of there--that is maybe what \nCongressman Rangel was alluding to--for them to sort of pay their \nbenefits out. Is that the fact, first and foremost? Then I will ask my \nfollowup.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I have had people back home, when we are talking about \nsaving Social Security and putting it in personal accounts, tell me \nthat is what they thought was already happening. They thought we were \nsaving their money because we talk about a trust fund. But the more \npeople find out about the truth, when we say there is not any money in \nthe trust fund, first people smile and think I am not telling them the \ntruth. We need to tell Americans the truth.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Senator got into something that is a rather complex \nconcept, but it is really important for understanding the difference \nbetween what he wants to accomplish and what goes on in the current \nsystem. That is, what your bill does is it creates an explicit debt. \nHow is that different? What is the difference to the average person, \nthat they have a specific account with that money as opposed to just \nsort of the general money that is owed to the Social Security trust \nfund? What is the difference?\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Right now the largest tax most Americans pay is the 12.5 \npercent for Social Security. That is thousands of dollars for the \naverage American family every year. It comes into the Social Security \nsystem. It is credited to a trust fund. Then it is spent either on \nSocial Security benefits or spent on other things.\n  We have made Americans believe we are saving that money for them, but \nit is all passing through. The only thing that is in the Social \nSecurity trust fund is IOUs. Our President, who has been a leader on \nthis issue, actually went and opened the file cabinet where these IOUs \nare.\n  The problem, Senator, as you know, is we cannot pay future benefits \nfrom IOUs. But we can from real money if we start saving it. There is \nnothing risky about saving this money in Treasury notes so it cannot be \nspent on other things. But you asked an important question. Right now, \nthe Government owns the Social Security benefit and politicians control \nit. If we start saving Social Security in personal accounts--we are not \ntalking about taking it out of the Social Security system. It is still \njust as much a part of the Social Security system as what we have \ntoday, only it is real money and people own it, which means they have\n\n[[Page S12831]]\n\na legal right to it, which they do not today. In the future, \npoliticians cannot build their whole election campaign around \nfrightening seniors that we are going to take their Social Security.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. What is the impact? Let's take it a step further. Let's \nassume we were successful tonight in getting the Stop the Raid bill \npassed and every American would have their own personal retirement \naccount with the money from the Stop the Raid bill, and 15 years go by \nand that money has built up. What is the practical effect on the \naverage citizen of what your bill does versus the current system?\n  Mr. DeMINT. This bill alone would not change anyone's benefits. In \nfact, it includes, as yours does, a guarantee. People will continue to \nget the benefit they have been promised. Only part of their benefit \nwould be paid by the traditional system and part from real money. Our \nhope is, as you mentioned before, this is a first step. We need to move \npast the first step of saving the $775 billion and go back and get the \nGovernment to pay back what they have already borrowed from Social \nSecurity, invest that in those accounts and let them earn interest, and \nit grows. It is a large step toward solving the future problems of \nSocial Security.\n  It is going to take several steps to fix it, but this is the most \nimportant first step. If we cannot stop spending Social Security on \nother things we cannot go to the American people and honestly tell them \nwe have a solution, not if we cannot even stop spending it on something \nelse.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would just ask the Senator from South Carolina, this \nbill has something to do with something else I hear a lot about, which \nis honest accounting. One of the things I hear a lot of my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle talk about is that the deficit is really \nmuch bigger than the deficits reported because the Social Security \nsurplus hides the deficit.\n  Will your bill cure that problem?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Only if we slow our spending as a government.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Would it cure the problem of hiding the deficit?\n  Mr. DeMINT. It is definitely an honest accounting bill. Right now \nthis money goes on the table and the Government secretly sweeps it away \nand spends it.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. And lowers the deficit as a result, correct?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Right. We are going to take it off the table and save it. \nSo the whole point is, if you want to keep spending that money as a \nCongress, we are going to have to recognize it as debt and admit to the \nAmerican people that we are spending more than we told them we were \nspending.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. So this is not just a Stop the Raid bill. This is a \ntruth in accounting bill? This basically says: Here is how much money \nwe are taking in. Here is the obligations that the Federal Government \nhas with this money we are taking in. In fact, we are taking that \nobligation and realizing it, in other words putting it into an account \nthat actually could pay that obligation. Is that correct?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Exactly right. We will also be honest about telling the \nAmerican people we have not been saving the money, but we are going to \nstart saving their money and we are going to figure out a way to go \nback and get what has been borrowed from Social Security and put it \nback so that Social Security will be there for your children and mine \nand our grandchildren.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from South Carolina for, not just \nthe work he has done on the Stop the Raid bill, but I want to thank him \nfor the other ideas he has put forward. He is one of three Senators on \nthis side of the aisle who have put forward comprehensive bills, along \nwith Senator Sununu and Senator Hagel. They have put forth ideas to try \nto move the ball forward, down the field substantially. I will not \nspeak for the Senator from South Carolina, but I think what he has \nrealized is that the opportunity for us to do that this session of \nCongress is probably dramatically diminished. So we are both looking at \ntrying to move the ball forward, trying to take a vital first step, or \nfirst two steps, in assuring the American public that those who are the \nmost vulnerable, their benefits are safe; and for those concerned about \nthe resources being there to be able to pay benefits in the future, we \nare going to make sure that money is set specifically aside and given \nto them to make sure that money is there and promised by the Federal \nGovernment to pay in the future.\n\n  By the way, the Senator from South Carolina is not the only one who \nhas introduced comprehensive legislation. Over in the House, \nCongressman Kolbe, Congressman Johnson, Congressman Shaw, and \nCongressman McCrery on our side of the aisle have put forward \ncomprehensive proposals on dealing with the long-term issues.\n  So we have made the case. We have worked hard to try to move this \nissue before the American public but have met a stonewall here on the \nother side. I suspect, unfortunately, tonight we will probably continue \nto see that stonewall appear when we ask for unanimous consent to move \nforward on this legislation. I will certainly make my commitment that \nthis is an issue I feel very passionate about. This is a issue that is \nimportant to my State. We have the second largest percentage of seniors \nin our population. We have a little over 16 percent of our population \nwho are people over the age of 65. That is second only to the State of \nFlorida.\n  It is important for my State to have the peace of mind for my \nseniors. I always say we may have fewer as a percentage of our \npopulation, we may have fewer seniors than the State of Florida, but my \nseniors need Social Security more than those in the State of Florida \nbecause all my rich seniors moved to Florida. The folks who are still \nin Pennsylvania are getting through those tough winters, in some cases \nthey need and rely on their Social Security benefits.\n  So as a Senator from Pennsylvania I will tell you that this is a high \npriority for me, to make sure that not only this generation of seniors \ngets the benefits they deserve but future generations of seniors get \nthose benefits as well. I think this one-two of the Social Security \nGuarantee Act and the Stop the Raid bill will go a long way in helping \ncreate the atmosphere to get real long-term responsible reform of the \nSocial Security system for future generations in place so they will \nhave a strong and solvent system going forward.\n  I yield for the close to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I say to the Senator, I know you want to make a motion. \nBut it is important that you and our colleagues know what we are asking \nfor. We are not asking to pass a bill tonight. We are asking to move \nthe bill into the debate process so that the American people can find \nout more about where we are and how this Guarantee Act and this Stop \nthe Raid Act can secure their future.\n  I yield back to the Senator to make the motion.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from South Carolina for taking the \ntime to have this important debate. I appreciate the indulgence of the \nDemocrat leader for his time.\n  What this unanimous consent will do, as the Senator from South \nCarolina has just stated--it will not be to pass the bill tonight. This \nis not an idea and we are just going to have unanimous consent and pass \nthe bill. What we want to do is engage in a real debate about these two \nvery important issues. So we are going to ask consent, at the time to \nbe determined by the leader, to have a full debate. I am suggesting in \nthis unanimous consent request that we have 10 hours of debate on both \nof these bills before we move forward and pass them, and obviously here \nin the next few weeks the chances of finding time to do that is going \nto be pretty limited. We will be happy to schedule it in January or \nFebruary of next year so there is plenty of time for the American \npublic to participate in this debate and to have a real discussion \nabout whether we want to protect the benefits that are promised to \nthose who are born before 1950 and whether we want to create the \nopportunity for honest accounting and for stopping the raid on the \nSocial Security system, to make sure that money stays in the Social \nSecurity system and is there to pay benefits for the people who pay \nmoney into the system.\n  That is what this bill does. It stops the raid, it stops that money \nbeing used and taken by the Federal Government to pay for other \nprograms and keeps that money--it is vitally important to understand--\nkeeps the money in the system but creates an explicit debt of the \nFederal Government that\n\n[[Page S12832]]\n\nmust be paid. It is a public debt. It is not one of these privately \nheld little debt transfers from one pocket to another but an explicit \ndebt that is owed to an individual. That is about as explicit as you \ncan get. It is a debt that has your name on the assets--Treasury bills. \nIt is vitally important to have that ownership because it guarantees a \nlegal right to a benefit for those taxes that are being paid in excess \nof what we need to pay for the Social Security system.\n  I see the Democrat leader is here. I will propound the unanimous \nconsent.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be \ndetermined by the majority leader after consultation with the \nDemocratic leader, the Finance Committee be discharged from further \nconsideration of S. 1750, the Social Security Guarantee Act of 2000; \nprovided further that the Senate then proceed to its immediate \nconsideration and there be 10 hours for debate equally divided in the \nusual form, no amendments or motions be in order, and that following \nthe use or yielding back of time, the bill be read a third time, and \nthe Senate proceed to a vote on passage of the bill, with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following that vote, the Finance \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 1302, the Stop \nthe Raid on Social Security Act of 2005, and the Senate then proceed to \nits consideration; provided further that there be 10 hours of debate \nequally divided in the usual form, no amendments or motions be in \norder, and that following the use or yielding back of time, the bill be \nread a third time and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage of the \nbill, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CHAMBLISS). Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, first of all, \nI will say regarding S. 1750, I will use different words than the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Finance Committee, the Senator from \nPennsylvania. My words are as follows: This legislation is a sham, s-h-\na-m. Social Security benefits are guaranteed today in the United States \nCode, the law of the land. To meet that legal commitment, we are saving \nenough in Social Security to pay full benefits for a long time into the \nfuture. The only threat to that guarantee is posed by Republicans who \nwant to undermine Social Security, slash benefits, and privatize the \nprogram.\n  I object to S. 1750.\n  I reserve my right to object to S. 1302 as follows:\n  Mr. President, I heard my friend, the distinguished Senator from \nSouth Carolina, talk about raiding the Social Security trust funds. \nThis message should be delivered at 16th and Pennsylvania Avenue. \nDuring the Clinton years, remember, we weren't doing that. We weren't \nusing the Social Security surplus to mask the deficit. So he should \ndirect those remarks to this administration.\n  Do not be fooled. This is simply another bill to privatize Social \nSecurity. The American people have already rejected this tired \napproach, and for very good reason. Just like President Bush's \nprivatization plan, the DeMint bill would require deep cuts in benefits \nand a massive increase in debt. Under the bill, those who divert funds \ninto privatized accounts would have their benefits cut automatically \nthrough a privatization tax--even if the value of their account has \ncollapsed. The bill would also require $1.7 billion in additional \nborrowing over the next 20 years. The bill would do nothing to \nstrengthen Social Security--quite the contrary--and it certainly \nwouldn't extend the program's solvency. In fact, diverting money from \nthe trust fund accelerates insolvency and makes matters worse.\n  Despite the claims of its proponents, this bill itself amounts to a \nmassive raid on Social Security and would cut the funds available to \npay guaranteed benefits. Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, if I may address just briefly the \ncomments made by the Democrat leader before I propound one final \nunanimous consent request, the Senator from Nevada suggested that there \nis a legal right to Social Security benefits in the law. The fact is \nthat a Supreme Court decision--Nestor v. Fleming, 1960--said that \n``Americans have no legal right to their Social Security benefits.''\n  While the Senator from Nevada can say those rights are guaranteed, \nthere may be, certainly, a claim on those benefits, and the claim is a \npolitical one for anyone in Washington, DC, who would try to change \nthose benefits. But there is no legal right in the law to payment of \nthose benefits. There is no guarantee in the law to the payments of \nthose benefits. The Supreme Court has said so. This would change that.\n\n  This particular group of retirees that is being frightened that \nsomehow or another any change in Social Security will mean their \nbenefits are going to be reduced--even for those who are in retirement \nat this point--we want to take that tactic as well as the fear that \ngoes with it off the table for our seniors and near-term seniors.\n  With respect to the Stop the Raid bill, the characterization that \nthat bill somehow is taking money out of the Social Security system, I \nthink I made it very clear in the discussion, the fact that the bill is \ncrystal clear with respect to the money that is going into these \npersonal accounts is invested in Treasury bills. They are obligations \nof the Federal Government and will be used to pay benefits to the \nextent that is humanly possible. This money is legally bound to the \nindividual who put the money there, and they have their name on this \naccount. They own the Treasury bills that are in that account. That is \nabout as rock-solid a commitment to pay benefits--more rock-solid \ncommitment than promises by future generations of politicians who do \nnot pay them.\n  When you have an obligation of the Federal Government with your name \non it, that is a pretty good obligation and it would require a default \nof the Federal Government not to have it paid, as opposed to Social \nSecurity benefits in a Social Security trust fund, which is a promise \nto pay by future generations of politicians. I suggest that this idea \nthat somehow or another this would cut benefits--in fact, you could \nmake the argument that the benefit created by these accounts is the \nonly real guaranteed benefit that an individual has going forward in \nthe system. Nevertheless, the Democrat leader objected, and I certainly \nrespect that.\n  I will make one last attempt to see if we can get an agreement on \njust one bill.\n  I remind Members here that earlier this year, in March, we passed the \nresolution that every Member of the Senate--Democrats and Republicans, \nall 100 voted for--which said that Social Security reform must protect \nfull-term and near-term retirees--I will underscore that, italicize \nit--from any changes to Social Security benefits. This bill \naccomplishes what we voted for.\n  I assume we voted for it because we thought we needed to communicate \na message--that it was important that we wanted to communicate a \nmessage--to the American public that we meant this, that we actually \nbelieved we should not do this. And the way to accomplish that, \ncontrary to what the Senator from Nevada said, is to put a guarantee in \nlaw.\n  Mr. President, I renew my request just for S. 1750, the Social \nSecurity Guarantee Act. I can ask unanimous consent, but it is \nidentical to the request which I read earlier.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, first of all, \nunderstand that when the Constitution was written, it didn't talk about \nSocial Security in the Constitution. But we in Congress have given \nSocial Security to the American people. We did it back in the 1930s \nunder the direction of Franklin Roosevelt. That is the Court decision \nto which my good friend referred. The Court didn't question Americans' \nrights to Social Security benefits. In effect, the Court said Congress \ncan change the law if it chooses. But there is no question that under \ncurrent law, Americans do have a legal right to the benefits they have \nearned. There is no question about that.\n  I simply say that these are some of the old arguments--I guess the \nPresident is out of town, and they dug up some of his old stuff and \nbrought it up to Capitol Hill today--the old stuff on\n\n[[Page S12833]]\n\nSocial Security that the American people have determined is not good \nfor them. Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have listened with some interest and \ncuriosity over in my office to this fascinating discussion about Social \nSecurity, especially the chart about the trust fund.\n  I would like to take my colleagues on a short visit back to the year \n2001 when, in fact, we had surpluses. The surpluses came from a fiscal \npolicy that looked truth straight in the eye and put this country back \non track. Big budget surpluses were beginning to develop, and my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle said: You know something, \neven before these surpluses exist, for 10 years let us pretend they do, \nand let us start getting rid of the money and give big tax cuts, most \nof which will go to wealthy Americans, by the way. And now we end up \nyears later with very large deficits.\n  We will borrow $550 billion this year. My colleague seems surprised \nby that. Somehow it didn't work out quite the way it was supposed to, \nand somebody is now using the Social Security trust fund.\n  Interesting. I know who is using the trust funds. It is when the \nPresident sends a budget down here with the biggest deficit in history, \nand he is taking Social Security trust funds to finance the tax cuts. \nYes. He is taking money from Uncle Harold and Aunt Gladys to provide \nsome of the biggest tax cuts ever given to the wealthiest Americans. \nThat is the fact. Everybody is entitled to their own opinions in this \nChamber. Not everybody is entitled to their own set of facts.\n  I wish to spend a little time talking about the history because I \nthink it is important for people to know. There are important \nstatistics, useful statistics, truthful statistics.\n\n  I remember I was at a town meeting once, and I used kind of a \nthrowaway piece of information. An old fellow in the front row stood \nup. I said to this group of senior citizens: Do you know that there are \n4 women for every man over the age of 85 living in the United States? \nSome old codger in the front row got up, leaned forward on his cane, \nand said: Young man, that is the most useless statistic I have ever \nheard given.\n  Well, there are useless statistics and then good statistics. There is \nthe truth, and then there is stretching the truth.\n  Let me talk a moment about where we find ourselves and why. What \nfascinated me is these charts coming from people who want to take apart \nthe Social Security system, the chart that comes to the floor this \nevening that suggests somehow they are the ones that really support \nthis.\n  I will tell how the Social Security system got started and \nsupported--a man named Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n  By the way, when he died, there was a poignant story written about \nthe long lines of people waiting to see the body of Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt then lying in State. It was written that a news reporter \nwalked up to a man, a working man who had waited hours in line with his \nhat in his hand, and the reporter, as this man was waiting to file past \nthe coffin of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, said to this fellow: Did you \nknow the President? Do you know Franklin Delano Roosevelt? This man \nsaid: No. I didn't, but he knew me. He knew me.\n  What he meant is this President knew the American people, knew and \nunderstood working men and women, cared about retired folks.\n  Yes. He knew me.\n  It was under this President that we decided to stop what was \nhappening with senior citizens in this country. They reached retirement \nage--and at that point one-half of the senior citizens in America were \nliving in poverty. They reached that age where their incomes declined, \nthey could no longer work, and one-half of them were living in poverty \nin this country, this great country.\n  Franklin Delano Roosevelt and others said, We can do better than \nthat, we can do something about that, and created Social Security. \nControversial? You bet your life it was controversial. There were some \nin this Chamber who said it is socialism, it is going to wreck this \ncountry, it is going to throw this country into bankruptcy. Guess what. \nNow less than 10 percent of our senior citizens live in poverty; 90 \npercent of them don't. Do you know why?\n  Social Security. The word ``security'' means something. It is there. \nIt is what they can count on when they retire. We have folks all around \nthis Senate, particularly the other side, who think we should privatize \nit, take it apart. Some of them never liked it. Take it apart and \nprivatize it and stick it in the stock market, in fact.\n  There are a lot of people in this country who rely on Social \nSecurity, whose lives are enriched and made better by Social Security. \nThere aren't perhaps many in this Senate who understand its value \nbecause perhaps none here will find themselves at the end of their \nincome-producing years having to rely only on Social Security. I know \nplenty of people who do. I wish more people understood the consequences \nof that in this Senate.\n  Someone once asked a question: If a person died and you knew nothing \nabout them, had never met them, and you only had their check register \nas a piece of information about their life, what could you write as an \nobituary about that person? What would a check registry tell you about \na person you have never met if you had to write the obituary? It would \ntell you plenty. What did they think was important? What did they spend \nmoney on? What were their investments? How did they live their life?\n  The same can be said of a country. Look at what we do, what we think \nis important, what we invest in, what we spend money on. It will tell \nsomething important about the character of this country. What do we \nsupport? Do we support the fundamental promise of Social Security? Do \nwe stand for it and believe in it? Do we believe it has strengthened \nthis country?\n  I see Members serving who do not believe that. They come to the \nSenate with big charts, save the Social Security trust fund. Really? \nPerhaps the time to have thought about that was when they were called \non to vote in the Senate and they decided to provide very substantial \ntax cuts for the highest income Americans with money we did not yet \nhave. And now we have very large Federal budget deficits.\n  Let me give a couple statistics. Twenty years ago American \ncorporations paid one-sixth of our income taxes. Twenty years later, \nthey are bigger, much bigger, and more profitable, and they now pay \none-tenth of this country's income taxes. Guess who makes up the \ndifference. Yes, real people.\n  Let me give another statistic. There are 400 Americans who are the \nwealthiest Americans--who file income tax returns, in any event--and \ntheir average yearly income is $110 million. About 8 years ago their \ntax rate was 30 percent to the Federal Government. Now it is 22 \npercent. It has dropped nearly 25 percent. I am talking now about the \nwealthiest of all Americans, those who have been most generously \ntreated by this country, many of whom are brilliant, I am sure. They \nmake a good deal of money. Good for them. I hope they expect and want \nto pay taxes to pay for the common needs of this country--defense, \nroads, bridges, education; you name it.\n  The point is, those very people who now say they are the ones who \ncare about the trust fund of Social Security are the ones who voted to \nbe able to take money out of the Social Security system, take money out \nof the Social Security trust fund so they can provide a tax cut for \nsomebody who gets $110 million a year in income.\n  It is unbelievable. Just own up to it, in my judgment. If that is \nwhat you did, own up to it. Do not bring a big chart to the Senate \nsaying save the trust fund. There was a time to save the trust fund, \nand you did not do it.\n  Let me take you back to 1993. This country inherited then the biggest \ndebt, which is now small by comparison from the first President George \nBush. I recall that President Bush came to office and he proposed a \nvery controversial fiscal policy. It was cut some spending, it was \nraise some taxes. It raised taxes, by the way, on the wealthiest \nAmericans. But it was tough. It was a hard vote for a lot of Members. \nIncidentally, in this Senate, when the roll was called--because we were \noff track and headed down the wrong direction with budget deficits\n\n[[Page S12834]]\n\nthat were increasing that had now reached the highest level in \nhistory--when the roll was called, there wasn't one Member of what is \nnow the majority party, not one Member in the Senate of that side of \nthe aisle who was willing to vote for it. It passed by one vote. A new \nfiscal policy, a new direction got one vote--One vote in the Senate and \none vote in the House.\n  Guess what. With all of that controversy--and man, there was plenty--\n8 years later, we were on track. Instead of having record Federal \nbudget deficits, we had no budget deficits. We had surpluses. Those \nbudget surpluses gave us the opportunity to begin putting this country \non a solid foundation, a solid financial foundation for Social Security \nand for many other needs. The estimate was we would have surpluses as \nfar as the eye could see. In fact, Alan Greenspan, who is about to \nretire as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, was worried we would \nhave too much of a surplus. I remember what he said because I thought--\nI know he is not a drinker so I was trying to figure out where this \ncame from. He said: I worry we are going to pay down our debt too fast.\n  Oh, really? Where does that worry come from? Do you have a crystal \nball, a strange-looking sort of crystal ball? He was an enabler. As an \nenabler, he gave permission, gave aid and comfort to the majority that \nsaid, you know what, let's take surpluses for the long term that do not \nyet exist, that are simply projections, and decide we will give them \naway in the form of tax cuts tilted toward the wealthiest Americans. \nAnd they did. So here we are, now 5 years later, borrowing $550 billion \nthis year to this country's debt.\n  The other day I went through the speeches I made at that time. I \nsaid, what if something happens and we do not get the surpluses, if \nthere is an unforeseen event? Should we be a bit conservative? Don't \nworry, the sky is the limit. Things are fine. Be happy.\n  So what happened? They passed their big tax cuts tilted toward the \nwealthy Americans and then all of a sudden we had a recession. Then we \nhad a terrorist attack; a war in Afghanistan; a war in Iraq; natural \ndisasters. Things went off track. Now we have very large Federal budget \ndeficits.\n  Then we are told, one of the ways to deal with that is to privatize \nSocial Security. The President said, I am taking Air Force One, I am \ngetting that old plane up and I am going across this country. I am \ngoing to sell this program. Privatize Social Security. And it did not \nsell. It did not sell. Because people know better. The word \n``security'' means something to people. Social Security works. It has \nworked for decades, and it will work for decades to come.\n  One of my colleagues says the genesis of this notion of privatizing \nSocial Security is the phrase ``we're all in this alone.'' But in fact \nwe are not. As a country, part of the genius of Social Security is to \nunderstand we are all in this together. We have real challenges to try \nto hang on to the Social Security system with a President who wants to \nprivatize it, with Members of the Senate who come to the floor with big \ncharts talking about raids on Social Security.\n  I didn't bring a chart tonight because I wasn't aware we were going \nto talk about raids on Social Security. But I would love to give a \nhistory lesson on who has been raiding Social Security. Paint that \nmoney purple and I will point you to the purple pockets in this Senate. \nI will tell you who has been raiding Social Security funds right along. \nIt is a fact that hooking up a pipe to the Social Security trust fund, \nhook up the pipe on one end and hook it to pockets at the top of the \nincome ladder for corporations, because that is where the money is \ngoing--big, old tax cuts.\n  The philosophy is trickle down. Pour it in on top and somehow it all \ntrickles down and even the people at the bottom are helped. One day a \nfellow said to me, I have heard about this trickledown for 8 or 10 \nyears and I ain't even damp yet.\n  I happen to think there is a better approach called ``percolate up.'' \nGive the American families something to work with, good jobs and an \neconomy that expands opportunity, and things do pretty well in this \ncountry.\n  It is fascinating to watch this discussion, especially given the \nhistory of where we have been in recent years, a discussion about \npeople who have embraced a fiscal policy that has injured the \nfoundation of this country's finances, who now suggest they are the \nones who want to protect Social Security. That is a curious thing to \nwatch. It is a little like an illusion in an amateur magic act. It is \nan illusion that is attempted, but you can see all the moves so it does \nnot look like magic, does it?\n  My understanding is the President has now parked Air Force One, at \nleast with respect to Social Security, and has decided not to continue \nto try to push that. My hope is that we as a Congress will decide, \nRepublicans and Democrats together, that Social Security is something \nworth saving. Should we stop the raid on the trust fund? You bet your \nlife we should. We have been trying to do that for a long time. But \nthose who aid and abet the raid on the trust fund by hooking that hose \nup to the trust fund and giving it out in big tax cuts do no favor to \nsenior citizens.\n  This country has many challenges. It will not be made a better \ncountry by taking apart the Social Security system. Let me say those \nwho come to the Senate and say the Social Security system is broken, it \nis bankrupt, it is busted--in fact, President George W. Bush said in \n1978 when he ran for Congress, Social Security is busted and it will be \nbankrupt in 10 years, so we have to privatize it. That was in the year \n1978, which tells you this is not about economics, it is about \nphilosophy. Those who say Social Security is bankrupt or busted should \nremember this: Social Security will pay full benefits under every \ncircumstance without any alteration or any change of any type until \nGeorge W. Bush is 106 years old. That is hardly a crisis.\n  People are living longer and healthier lives. Does that mean we have \nto make some adjustments in Social Security from time to time? You bet. \nOf course we do. We have, and we will. But the basic framework and \npromise of Social Security, if we have the people with the courage and \nstrength in this Senate to protect it, will be there for the next \ncentury and the century beyond.\n  I understand part of the success of Social Security and Medicare in \nour country has been the increased longevity of people living longer. I \nhave spoken of my Uncle Harold before in the Senate. My Uncle Harold \ndid not discover he could run until he was 72 years old. But at age 72 \nhe went to these State meets where you have races in various events for \npeople of different ages. He discovered there was a category age 70 and \nabove. He entered three races. He entered the 400 meter, the 800 meter, \nand the 3K. He entered three events. The first time he and his wife \nEvelyn took the RV and parked it and he entered three races at age 72. \nHe won all three easily. And he thought, this is amazing. I am faster \nthan people my age. So pretty soon he started going elsewhere to run. \nHe went to Minnesota. He entered the Minnesota Senior Games Races. He \nwent to South Dakota. He entered South Dakota races. Pretty soon he was \nrunning in California, running in Arizona. He became a 400 meter \nspecialist, and at age 82 my uncle had 43 gold medals and can probably \noutrun about 80 percent of the Senators--at age 82.\n  People live longer, healthier lives. Thirty years ago he would have \nbeen on a Lazy Boy because at age 65 you are supposed to retire, get a \nLazy Boy recliner, and stay at home--and do not drive, by the way. \nThings have changed. People are leading active, wonderful lives. That \nis born of success, success by increasing the longevity of the American \npeople. My Uncle Harold is one example of that.\n  Are there some strains on Social Security and Medicare from time to \ntime? Yes, a few. Nothing we cannot handle, and nothing that would \njustify anybody coming along and saying, by the way, let's take Social \nSecurity apart. That is a philosophy rooted half a century ago. It is \none that those who never liked it cannot seem to overcome.\n  There was a fellow at a meeting I held some months ago with Senator \nReid, the minority leader. At the end of this meeting on Social \nSecurity, this old fellow, in his eighties, blind, aided by someone \nwalking beside him holding his arm, came up to me and he said: I am \nold, I am blind, and Social Security is the only thing I have. This 80-\n\n[[Page S12835]]\n\nplus-year-old man came to that meeting just to deliver that message: I \nam old, I am blind, and Social Security is the only thing I have.\n  It is so important. This is not just some usual debate. This debate \nabout Social Security is about who we are as a country; about whether \nwe will stand up for things that matter; whether we are going to stand \nup for people who have lived their lives in this country and helped \nbuild America and now reach declining income years and are told they \ncan count on Social Security. Yes, they can count on it, as long as we \ndon't let those who come along and decide they want to privatize it \nbegin to take it apart because they never liked it in the first place.\n\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague is waiting to speak. I was not even \nintending to come over until my attention was piqued by a big, old sign \nthat said, ``Stop Raiding Social Security Trust Funds,'' and I thought: \nWell, that is a curious message from those who supported a fiscal \npolicy that helped drain the trust funds in the first place. I thought \nI would mention that and talk a little about how important this Social \nSecurity fight has been and why the American people--not the Congress, \nwhy the American people--have said no to the President and others who \nwant to privatize this important program.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I join my colleague in coming here to \nspeak for a moment about Social Security. Just as my esteemed colleague \nfrom North Dakota said he had not originally intended to speak tonight, \nI did not intend to speak as well. But for all of us who are so proud \nof the great American success story called Social Security, and for all \nof us who understand how it does represent the best about us, we want \nto have an opportunity to say that tonight because there has been a lot \nof misinformation, unfortunately, I believe, a mischaracterization on \nthe other side of the aisle.\n  The fact is, Social Security is based on what is best about us: You \nwork all your life. You pay into a system. And then you know you have \ndignity in your retirement. You also know, because this is really an \ninsurance policy, that if you become disabled, Heaven forbid, Social \nSecurity can step in for you, for your family. If the wage earner in \nthe family loses their life, Heaven forbid, their children, their \nspouse are able to receive assistance to be able to help them from \nmoving back into poverty, because it is an insurance system. It is \nbasically an economic insurance policy. And it has been one of the \ngreat American success stories.\n  The reality is, without Social Security, about 48 percent of those \nwho are now on Social Security would be in poverty. Today, with Social \nSecurity, about 9 percent of older Americans and the disabled are in \npoverty. We know this number needs to be lower. But this is a great \nAmerican success story.\n  At a time when there is so much upheaval in so many people's lives--I \nknow in my home State of Michigan, my great State of Michigan, there \nare so many families today that feel the rug is being pulled out from \nunder them because the jobs they have had and worked hard at all their \nlives are either going overseas or they are being told they are going \nto have to work for $9 or $10 an hour. Their health care costs are \ngoing up or maybe they are losing their insurance. Their pensions are \nthreatened or maybe gone because of the bankruptcies of companies that \nhave then dumped the pensions into a pension guaranty fund.\n  With all of this insecurity and challenge families face in fighting \nto keep the American dream and the American way of life, the one \nconstant we have had is knowing that there is Social Security, that we \nhave paid into a system, and that it will be there for us. There is \nabsolutely no reason that Social Security will not be there for us, as \nlong as we do not privatize it or undermine it, as has been proposed by \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  We are in a situation today where Social Security and the security of \nSocial Security is needed more than ever. I will never forget talking \nwith a group of people who were mid-level executives at Enron--I know, \nunfortunately, this story can be told and will be told across Michigan \nas well--folks who worked all their lives, invested in the company, as \nthey were told to do, did all the right things, they are near \nretirement, and now it is gone.\n  One gentleman, with tears in his eyes, said to me: Thank God for \nSocial Security; that is all I have left. Too many Americans find \nthemselves in that situation now. I believe we should be doing \nsomething about that as well. Earlier this evening, I spoke on the \nfloor about what we need to do to turn that around: enforcing trade \npolicies, changing the way we fund health care, investing in education \nand innovation, protecting the pensions of those who have worked hard \nall their lives. But the reality is, Social Security is a very \nimportant part of that picture.\n  Now, it is a value as well as a program. It represents what is best \nabout us. And we have choices about whether we want to keep it secure \nand keep it as a priority. Back during the budget debate this year, our \nranking member, Senator Conrad, and I offered an amendment to secure \nSocial Security first before going on with other tax cuts that have \nbeen proposed for those most blessed in our country, those, in fact, \nwho do not have to worry about whether Social Security will be there \nfor them.\n  We indicated, as you can see by looking at this chart, that in order \nto keep Social Security secure for the next 75 years, it will cost $4 \ntrillion. That is compared to the President's tax cuts: If they are \nmade permanent--the overwhelming majority of them going to the top \n``incomers,'' those most blessed economically in our country--it will \ncost $11.6 trillion, if we decide as the majority, our Republican \ncolleagues, appear to be doing, to extend these tax cuts permanently.\n  If we instead were to say, wait a minute, we are going to fully fund \nSocial Security first before any of this happens--even if we said to \nthose most blessed in our country, instead of $11.6 trillion in tax \nbreaks, let us take $4 trillion off of that--they would have $7.6 \ntrillion. It seems to me, at a minimum, that would be a choice worth \nmaking in order to make sure every single American knows that Social \nSecurity is secure.\n  All of the decisions we make in this Chamber are based on our values \nand our philosophy. Social Security represents our basic belief that we \nare in it together as a country, that it does matter what happens to \nother people. We are not in it alone.\n  I believe the efforts being proposed on the other side of the aisle \nrepresent a very different philosophy that says: You are on your own, \nbuddy, unless you are our buddy.\n  The reality is that Social Security represents a value that says we \nare in it together and that together America can do better. That is \nwhat Social Security is about. It has worked. It has proved the \nphilosophy that together America does better.\n  So I am hopeful our colleagues will choose, in the waning days of \nthis session, to move on to join us in the great debate of keeping \nAmerican jobs in America, supporting our American businesses, our \nAmerican manufacturers that need our help now, and making sure we have \na pension bill that works for all of our businesses and all of our \nworkers, showing that we value and want to make sure the promises of \npensions, which so many workers have paid into all of their lives, are \nkept. Let's work on that rather than undermining a great American \nsuccess story called Social Security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/15/senate-section/article/S12835-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12835-S12836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               DAVID GUNN\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, last week the Amtrak Board of Directors \nvoted to remove Antrak's president, David Gunn. I think that action is \nregrettable, and I commend Mr. Gunn for his leadership during his 3\\1/\n2\\ years at Amtrak's helm.\n  Amtrak has always been a money-losing proposition. I am afraid that \nit may always be so. But no one should hold Amtrak's, president \naccountable entirely for this fact. Congress and the administration are \nalso accountable. Despite repeated efforts to reauthorize and reform \nthis money-losing proposition, we have not had the collective will to \nmake the hard decisions that need to be made to finally turn Amtrak \naround--and that includes altering\n\n[[Page S12836]]\n\nAmtrak's route system so that it operates where it actually attracts \nridership.\n  I have known many of Amtrak's presidents over the years and in my \njudgment, David Gunn was one of the most capable. Not only did he hold \nan impressive and lengthy career in the rail industry prior to coming \nout of retirement to take the Amtrak job, I found him to be a man of \nintegrity.\n  When he testified before hearings I chaired in the Senate Commerce \nCommittee, Mr. Gunn didn't mince words. When I first asked him about \nthe so-called ``glidepath to self-sufficiency'' which his predecessor \ncontinually touted, David Gunn didn't hesitate to inform the committee \nthat it was a sham.\n  Mr. Gunn and I didn't always see eye-to-eye. Indeed, I disagreed \nstrongly with his unyielding views about the continuation of Amtrak's \nlong distance trains. But I respected the fact that he always spoke his \nviews even when it meant he wouldn't be telling people what they wanted \nto hear. He faced head on the many problems with Acela and he was \ncommitted to getting Amtrak's escalating costs under control. Again, he \nis a man of integrity and I commend him for his service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/15/senate-section/article/S12836-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On January, 25, 2000 in New York City, NY, Melissa Hart had just left \na local hotel when eight men threw her to the ground and attacked her. \nOne of the assailants held Ms. Hart by her throat and beat her head \nagainst the sidewalk, while the other assailants beat her with their \nfists. The attackers stripped her of her coat, and stole her cell phone \nand approximately $350 from her purse. According to police, the \nmotivation for the attack was that Ms. Hart was a transgender person.\n  I believe that our Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nin all circumstances, from threats to them at home. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a major step forward in achieving that \ngoal. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current \nlaw, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/15/senate-section/article/S12836-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            FISCAL YEAR 2006 ENERGY AND WATER APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, although I recognize the important \nprograms funded by the fiscal year 2006 Energy and Water appropriations \nconference report, on balance, I could not support the bill. The \nconference report provides $50 million in funding for the Department of \nEnergy to develop a plan for reprocessing spent nuclear fuel and to \nselect sites suitable for housing reprocessing facilities. This \nprovision was not in the Senate version of the bill and thus was not \ndebated in the Senate.

Mr. President, I rise today to announce the beginning of \nNational American Indian Heritage Month. This November we will honor \nthe achievements made by American Indians and Alaskan Natives \nthroughout the history of our country.\n  For many years, Native Americans strived for an official recognition \nof their people. The first observance of a day celebrating the \ncontributions of American Indians occurred on the second Saturday of \nMay 1916 in New York State. In 1990, Congress, with my support, passed \na joint resolution declaring November 1990 as National American Indian \nHeritage Month, dedicated to appreciating the impact of Native \nAmericans on the foundation and development of our Nation.\n  Rooted in the history and culture of South Dakota, as well as the \nUnited States, lies the steadfast influence of the Native American \npeople. The Great Sioux Nation of South Dakota consists of nine \nseparate tribes, the Cheyenne River Sioux, the Crow Creek Sioux, the \nFlandreau Santee Sioux, the Lower Brule Sioux, the Oglala Sioux, the \nRosebud Sioux, the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate, the Standing Rock Sioux, \nand the Yankton Sioux. I would like to pay tribute to the more than \n62,000 Native Americans in South Dakota and the Native Americans \nthroughout our country whose presence and traditions have enriched our \ncommunities.\n  With the commencement of National American Indian Heritage Month, we \nhave been given an excellent opportunity to educate ourselves about the \ncultural and historical influence of American Indians and Alaskan \nNatives. In November, I encourage everyone to join South Dakota in our \nreverence of Native Americans with the hope that our Government can \ncontinue to make the concerns of American Indians a priority and to \nensure that their freedoms and way of life are preserved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/15/senate-section/article/S12836-4", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         HONORING PAULA YEAGER\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart to \nhonor the life of a great woman, Paula Yeager, who died last Wednesday \nafter a long battle with cancer. For 6 years, Paula served the State of \nIndiana as the executive director of the Indiana Wildlife Federation, \nIWF. She was a true conservationist, a dedicated public servant and a \nwonderful mother. Her colleagues, friends, and family will miss her \ndearly, and I know that sentiment is shared by countless others across \nIndiana and the country.\n  A career travel agent, Paula first applied for a job with the IWF in \norder to work on meaningful issues--a decision influenced by her \nexperience with breast cancer. During her 6-year tenure with the group, \nPaula overcame her relative inexperience and became a successful \nactivist in conservation issues through hard work, an unwavering \ncommitment to diplomacy and tireless advocacy. As executive director, \nPaula mended the State federation's relationship with the National \nWildlife Federation, NWF, improved the group's profile with lawmakers, \nand confronted many important issues, including mercury contamination \nand wetlands preservation.\n  Her ability to unite people with differing interests earned her a \nreputation for diplomacy, and that effort paid off when the Indiana \nDepartment of National Resources, IDNR, banned fenced deer hunting in \nAugust. The former IDNR director called Paula the person ``most \nresponsible in Indiana for leading the effort to ban canned hunting.''\n  Honored twice with the IWF's Presidents Award, Paula was named the \nConservationist of the Year in 2001 by the IDNR, and this past summer \nthe NWF recognized Paula with their Conservation Service Citation.\n  There is a saying that life is not about what you take out of it but \nwhat you put back in. Paula lived that sentiment to the fullest. Her \nwork made Indiana a better place to live for all of us. For that, we \nwill always be grateful to the courageous travel agent who decided it \nwas time to make a difference through the IWF.\n  Indiana lost a great citizen last week. It is my sad honor to enter \nthe name of Paula Yeager in the Record of the Senate for her service to \nIndiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/15/senate-section/article/S12836-5", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12836-S12837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO DR.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment today \nto honor Steve Pilcher, a leader in the Montana livestock industry. At \nthe end of this year, Steve will retire from his years of service as \nexecutive vice president of the Montana Stockgrowers Association. His \nservice will be missed, but the values and leadership Steve brought to \nthe organization will continue on.\n  Many American children grew up with the Saturday Western matinee as \nthe high point of their week. The ideals shared by those men in their \nwhite Stetsons were strong, moral, and enduring. There were some great \nrules to live by that were shared by the cowboys on the Silver Screen.\n  Steve took every one of those lessons to heart. He not only believes \nin the ``Code of the West'' those cowboys shared with us, he continues \nto live it, both in his personal life and his professional life.\n  Hopalong Cassidy had a Creed for American Girls and Boys. The first \nrule in his creed was, ``The highest badge of honor a person can wear \nis honesty, be mindful at all times.'' Regardless of the fallout, Steve \ndoes not believe in bandying the truth. He is always a square shooter. \nHe has taken the heat many times for standing by the truth, but Steve \nis a man of honor. He knows the truth is worth whatever adversity it \nbrings from others who do not feel the same way.\n  Gene Autry offered the Ten Commandments of the Cowboy. The first \ncommandment said, ``A cowboy never takes unfair advantage.'' Steve has \nalways worked hard to prove that the ranchers in Montana expect only \nwhat they earn. He knows that you have to work those extra hours to \nmake sure things are fair. Nothing is given to you.\n  Also, there was the Lone Rangers Creed. Perhaps the part Steve took \nto heart the most was, ``God put the firewood here but every man must \ngather and light it himself.'' There is no doubt Steve Pilcher has been \ngathering the firewood for the Montana Stock-growers. He has worked \ntirelessly for this industry and I know he will continue to light that \nfire.\n  As we recognize Steve Pilcher for his major contributions to not only \nMontana's livestock community but the Nation's, there is one more thing \nthat I must add: Happy Trails my friend, until we meet again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/15/senate-section/article/S12837-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING A GREAT IDAHOAN\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I would like to offer a few words \ntoday recognizing the full and joyful life of a remarkable Idahoan, \nRobert Bershers. Although Bob and his wife Louise traveled extensively, \nIdaho was home. He lived and worked in Coeur d'Alene where he was \nactive on the Kootenai County Fair Board from 1983 to 2001, and he \nowned and operated a successful construction business for many years. \nBob lived vigorously, enjoying the life of a businessman and rancher \nand, according to his daughter Khris, was the kind of man ``whose idea \nof going to the fair was getting there on Wednesday just before it \nopened and staying through the last spin of the ferris wheel on \nSunday.''\n  North Idaho was the home of his heart--from the chilly, grey and wet \nwinters to the warm and bright summer days in the mountains and by the \nlake; he and Louise never stayed away too long. But for Bob, it was \nIdahoans who made our State truly great. According to his family, Bob \nloved Idaho because people take the time to be friendly. And Bob not \nonly loved that in others, he lived it himself, taking in those in \nneed, either four-footed or two. Louise reminisced recently that when \nhis children were still at home, the house had a revolving door of kids \nand animals, all finding refuge in their home when they needed it most.\n  Bob never failed to tell his children and family that he loved them. \nIndeed, his unfailing dedication to family and community are true \nmeasures of a good and honorable man. Bob will be sorely missed by all \nwho knew him, but those same people will carry on the blessings his \nlife brought to them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/15/senate-section/article/S12837-3", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT OF THE INTENTION TO ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE EUROPEAN \nUNION, JAPAN, THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA, AND TAIWAN ON TARIFF TREATMENT FOR \n                 MULTI-CHIP INTEGRATED CIRCUITS--PM 31\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Consistent with section 2103(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 2002, I am \npleased to notify the Congress of my intention to enter into an \nagreement with the European Union, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and \nTaiwan on tariff treatment for multi-chip integrated circuits.

A bill to improve cargo security, and for other purposes; \nread the first time.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I'm pleased to introduce the \nbipartisan GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act with the chair of the \nHomeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, Senator Susan \nCollins.\n  We've worked together to create an innovative bill that will protect \nthe American people and protect our economy from terrorist threats.\n  Our bill will help close one of the most dangerous vulnerabilities \nfacing our nation--a terrorist organization using cargo containers to \nbring weapons and terrorists into the United States.\n  For decades, industry leaders in my home state of Washington and \naround the world have worked hard to create an open, efficient trading \nsystem. That system relies on cargo containers to move the vast \nmajority of the world's commerce from factory to market.\n  The cargo container has reduced the cost of trade--helping American \nbusinesses and creating American jobs. We can be proud of the \nefficiency and speed of our container trading system.\n  But that system was designed for a different time--before terrorist \nattacks on American soil and before fanatics took jetliners and turned \nthem into missiles.\n  Our bill addresses those concerns. Our bill increases scrutiny of \nshipments. It provides benefits to shippers but only after we have \nverified that they have improved security. And it ensures we keep \ntesting the system to make sure it stays secure.\n  Let me quickly summarize the benefits of the GreenLane Act. It gives \nU.S. officials in foreign ports the authority to inspect suspicious \ncontainers before they are loaded for departure into the United States. \nThe GreenLane Act makes the haystack of containers smaller so that the \nsearch is smaller. It allows the Government to focus on suspicious \ncargo. It ensures that we are inspecting and stopping cargo that poses \na threat. And it cuts down smuggling of weapons, people, drugs or other \nillegal cargo.\n  A smaller haystack and strict overseas security measures will allow \nthe United States and foreign officials to better stop criminal actions \nand threats to our national security. The GreenLane Act protects \nAmerica's economy in the event of a terror attack, and it provides a \nsecure, organized way to quickly resume cargo operations after any \nemergency shutdown. Because any shutdown of ports has the potential to \ncost the U.S. economy billions of dollars a day, the GreenLane Act will \nminimize the economic impact of a terrorist attack. And the GreenLane \nAct creates market incentives for everyone in the supply chain to \nimprove security and take responsibility for the cargo they handle.\n  Today we have a choice in how we deal with the cargo security \nchallenges that face us. But if we wait for a disaster, we will not \nhave a choice. If we all agree on a system now, we will have a role in \nshaping what it looks like and making sure it is sensitive to the need \nfor free-flowing commerce. I am here to say, along with Senator \nCollins, that we need to make these changes on our terms now before \nthere is an incident. If we wait until after there is an incident, we \nrisk drastic actions that will hurt everyone. With the GreenLane Act we \nintroduce today, we have the opportunity to create effective, efficient \nsystems and put them in place now.\n  I invite anyone who cares about our security and our economy to join \nSenator Collins and me in this effort. If anybody would like more \ninformation, visit my Web page at Murray.Senate.Gov/GreenLane.\n  I thank Senator Collins for her tremendous leadership and partnership \nin developing this legislation. She brings tremendous experience and \nexpertise to one of America's biggest threats. It has been a pleasure \nto work with her in developing this critically important bill. I look \nforward to working with her, and anyone else here, to help turn the \nideas of this bill into laws that will protect the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Murray, in introducing today the GreenLane Maritime Cargo \nSecurity\n\n[[Page S12841]]\n\nAct. It has been a great pleasure to work with my colleague on this \nimportant issue. Senator Murray has been an early leader in the call \nfor greater port security. I am pleased we were able to join our \nefforts in a bipartisan bill to provide long overdue improvements in \nmaritime security.\n  Our comprehensive legislation would help build a coordinated approach \nto maritime and port security across all levels of government and with \nour overseas trading partners. It would improve our Nation's security \nas it expedites trade with those governments and businesses that join \nus in this goal. It would encourage innovation, and it would provide \nfinancial assistance to our ports as they strive to strengthen their \nterrorism prevention and response efforts.\n  This legislation would provide the structure and resources needed to \nbetter protect the American people from attack through these vital yet \nextremely vulnerable points of entry and centers of economic activity.\n  Coming from a State with three international cargo ports, including \nthe largest port by tonnage in New England, I am keenly aware of the \nimportance of our seaports to our national economy and to the \ncommunities in which they are located. In addition to our ports' \nobvious economic significance, the link between maritime security and \nour national security has been underscored time and again by terrorism \nexperts, including the 9/11 Commission. It is easy to see why, if you \nlook at the statistics.\n  In 2003, more than 6,000 ships made nearly 57,000 calls on American \nports. They carried the bulk of approximately 800 million tons of goods \nthat came into our country, including more than 9 million containers. \nWe know that al-Qaida has the stated goal of causing maximum harm to \nthe American people and maximum disruption to our economy. Therefore, \nwhen you look at what could achieve those goals, you are instantly \ndrawn to our cargo ports.\n  We already have a glimpse of the staggering damage a terrorist attack \non a cargo port could produce. In the fall of 2002, the west coast dock \nstrike cost our economy an estimated $1 billion a day for each of the \n10 days that the work stoppage lasted. It not only brought those \nwestern coast ports to a halt but also harmed businesses throughout the \ncountry. That astonishing amount of harm, $10 billion worth, was the \nresult of an event that was both peaceful and anticipated. Think of \nwhat the impact of a terrorist attack would be.\n  More recently, Hurricane Katrina brought the port of New Orleans and \nseveral other gulf coast ports to a standstill. Fortunately, much of \nthis cargo was able to be diverted to other ports undamaged by the \nstorm. In the aftermath of a terrorist attack, however, it is likely \nthat an attack on one port would result in the closure, at least \ntemporarily, of all ports. All of us remember in the wake of 9/11 that \ncommercial aircraft were grounded across this country for a number of \ndays. It is logical to assume that all of the ports would be closed in \nthis country if there were a terrorist attack on one port.\n  In addition to the threat of a direct attack on one of our ports, any \none of the more than 9 million containers that enter the United States \neach year has the potential to be the Trojan horse of the 21st century. \nWhen we look at these huge cargo ships unloading thousands of \ncontainers every day, we think: Oh, that contains consumer goods, maybe \ntelevision sets or toys or clothing or sneakers. Fortunately, in the \nvast majority of cases, that is exactly what is in those containers. \nBut a container could include terrorists themselves, biological or \nchemical agents, or even a small nuclear weapon.\n  For years, criminals have used cargo containers to smuggle narcotics, \nfirearms, and people into the United States. These containers may come \nfrom anyone of 1,000 ports overseas, ports that have varying degrees \nand levels of security. They could also be intercepted or tampered with \nalong the way.\n  Earlier year this year, I toured the ports of Los Angeles and Long \nBeach. The sheer size of these facilities and the activities that are \ngoing on every day are startling. So, too, are the risks and the \nvulnerabilities that they offer for terrorists to exploit. By \ncoincidence, my visit came days before 32 Chinese nationals were \nsmuggled into the port of Los Angeles in two cargo containers. \nFortunately, that Trojan horse held people who were simply seeking a \nbetter way of life, albeit illegally, and they were not terrorists \nseeking to destroy our way of life. They were caught. But what is \nparticularly disturbing to me, and speaks to the weaknesses and \nvulnerabilities of the current system, is they weren't caught through \nany security measure. It wasn't the container security initiative or \nthe C-TPAT Program or any other new initiative that resulted in these \n32 Chinese nationals being caught. Instead it was an alert crane \noperator who happened to see them crawling out of the containers.\n  We cannot continue to rely on luck or even alert crane operators to \nprovide for the security of our seaports, our Nation, and our people.\n  In August, the President issued the National Security Strategy for \nMaritime Security. It warns of the probability of a hostile state using \na weapon of mass destruction sometime in the next decade, and it \nidentifies the maritime sector as most likely to be used to bring a \nweapon of mass destruction into the United States. In addition, the use \nof ``just in time'' inventories, which are now used by most industries, \nmeans that a disruption of our ports would have catastrophic \nrepercussions for our entire economy.\n  A fundamental goal of port security is to head off trouble before it \nreaches our shores. Current supply-chain security programs within the \nFederal Government, however, were separately conceived and managed by \ndifferent agencies, rather than woven together into a layered, \nconsistent approach. The result of that, the Government Accountability \nOffice tells us, is that only 17.5 percent of high-risk cargo \nidentified by our own Customs agents was inspected overseas. I am \ntalking about cargo that has been identified as high risk, and yet we \nare inspecting less than 20 percent of high-risk cargo. We found that \nthe current programs lack standards, lack staffing, and lack the \nvalidation of security measures that are necessary for their success.\n  We cannot remove the risk of a terrorist attack, but the better \nsecurity measures outlined by the Murray-Collins bill can build a \nstronger shield against terrorism without hampering trade.\n  This legislation provides the tools to construct a more effective \nsecurity system. It was developed in close consultation with key \nstakeholders including port authorities, major retailers and importers, \ncarriers, supply chain managers, security and transportation experts, \nand Federal and State agencies.\n  First, it addresses the problem of uncoordinated supply-chain \nsecurity efforts by directing the Secretary of Homeland Security to \ndevelop a strategic plan to strengthen international security for all \nmodes of transportation by which containers arrive in, depart from or \nmove through seaports of the United States. This plan will clarify the \nroles, responsibilities, and authorities of government agencies at all \nlevels and of private sector stakeholders. It will establish clear, \nmeasurable goals for furthering the security of commercial operations \nfrom point of origin to point of destination. It will outline \nmandatory, baseline security measures and standards and provide \nincentives for additional voluntary measures.\n  The new Office of Cargo Security Policy, established in our \nlegislation, would ensure implementation of the strategic plan. This \nimportant office will report to the Department's Assistant Secretary \nfor Policy in order to better coordinate maritime security efforts \nwithin the Department of Homeland Security and among our international \nand private-sector partners.\n  This legislation also gives the Secretary 6 months to establish \nminimum standards and procedures for securing containers in transit to \nthe U.S., based on the Department's experience with current cargo \nsecurity programs. All containers bound for U.S. ports of entry must \nmeet those standards no later than 2 years after they are established. \nCurrently, DHS has been too slow to implement certain vital security \nmeasures. For example, the Department has been working on a regulation \nsetting a minimum standard for mechanical seals on containers for\n\n[[Page S12842]]\n\nmore than 2 years. Such delays are unacceptable. This legislation would \nset clear timelines to ensure steady progress.\n  The Department has also pledged to deploy radiation detection \nequipment at all ports of entry in the U.S. to examine 100 percent of \ncargo. The zero tolerance policy for radiation has been discussed since \n2002, though less than a quarter of the detection equipment deemed \nnecessary for domestic coverage had been deployed as of last month. \nEven more frustrating is that the Department has changed the target for \nsystem deployment multiple times. The Department's new Domestic Nuclear \nDetection Office is beginning to take hold of this critical issue, yet \nthe need for a comprehensive plan for the deployment of radiation \ndetection equipment is evident. Our legislation requires this plan be \ndeveloped and that 100 percent incoming containers to the U.S. be \nexamined for radiation no later than 1 year after enactment.\n  I want to thank Senator Coleman for his efforts in this area. These \nprovisions address concerns that have been identified through our joint \ninvestigative work on programs protecting our nation against weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  For the first time, this legislation would authorize the Container \nSecurity Initiative. Ongoing, predictable funding--$175 million a year \nfor the five years beginning in 2007--is essential for this crucial \nprogram to succeed. In addition to providing funding, the bill lays out \nrequirements for CSI ports and a process for designating new ports \nunder CSI. The Secretary must undertake a full assessment of the \npotential risk of smuggling or cargo tampering related to terrorism, \nbefore designating a port under CSI. This authorization also will \nenable our CSI partners to strengthen anti-terrorism measures and to \nimprove training of personnel.\n  We would authorize C-TPAT at $75 million per year for that same 5-\nyear period, and we clearly outline the certification and validation \nrequirements and the benefits associated with meeting those \nrequirements. Our legislation directs the Secretary to correct the \ndeficiencies of the program, and, within one year, to issue guidelines \nthat will be used to certify a participant's security measures and \nsupply chain practices.\n  In addition, we would create a new, third tier of C-TPAT, called the \nGreenLane, which offers additional benefits to C-TPAT participants that \nmeet the highest level of security standards. Cargo in transit to the \nU.S. through the GreenLane would be more secure through the use of \ncontainer security devices and stronger supply chain security practices \nin all areas, such as physical, procedural and personnel security. The \nlegislation directs the Secretary to develop benefits that may include \nfurther reduced inspections, priority processing for inspections, and, \nmost significantly, preference in entering U.S. ports in the aftermath \nof a terrorist attack. Senator Murray, who developed this concept, will \ndescribe GreenLane in greater detail.\n  The bill also places a greater emphasis on communications among \ngovernment and industry players in responding to an incident and \nsettles the critical question of ``who's in charge.''\n  Technology plays an important role in maritime and cargo security. \nThe Department of Homeland Security has scattered efforts to deploy \nexisting technologies, to enhance those tools and to develop new ones. \nIt is critical that these efforts be undertaken in a more coordinated \nfashion. In addition, the Government must work closely with and \nencourage the ingenuity of the private sector in developing the \ntechnologies that will improve both security and trade.\n  Let me close by saying that this legislation recognizes that \nAmerica's ports, large and small, are our partners in keeping our \nNation safe and our economy moving. Our Port Security Grant Program \nwill help our ports make the investments needed to meet the threat of \nterrorism. The global maritime industry is crucial to our Nation's \neconomy, and our ports are undoubtedly on the front lines of the war \nagainst terrorism. This legislation would set clear goals for improving \nthe security of this vital sector, and it would provide the resources \nto meet and achieve those goals.\n  I again thank my colleague, Senator Murray, for her hard work and \ninitiative on this legislation. We are pleased to be joined as original \ncosponsors by Senators Norm Coleman and Joe Lieberman. That is \nindicative of the kind of bipartisan support this legislation enjoys, \nand it is my hope that many more of our colleagues will join us in \nbringing this legislation to enactment early next year. Our container \ntrading system was designed for a world before September 11.\n  Now, here we are, 4 years later, and we still have not made our \nmaritime cargo system as secure as it needs to be. Six months after the \nSeptember 11 attacks, I held a hearing to exam the vulnerability of \ncargo security. Many of the concerns that were raised at that hearing \nare still dogging us today.\n  One of the challenges we face is how we can make trade more secure \nwithout slowing it to a crawl. If we have absolute security, we will \ncurtail trade. If we have completely open trade, we will not have \nenough security.\n  For the past few years, I have been meeting with leaders in \nGovernment and industry to figure out how we can strike the right \nbalance. One thing I know for sure is, it is better for us to work \ntogether now to design a security system on our own terms than to wait \nfor an attack and force a security system in a crisis atmosphere.\n  I have spent several years exploring this challenge and meeting with \nstakeholders to get their ideas. Senator Collins, as chair of the \nSenate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, has held \nhearings on this issue and has introduced legislation.\n  As a result of our work, Senator Collins and I have developed the \nGreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act. It provides, for the first time, \na comprehensive blueprint for how we can improve security while keeping \ntrade efficient. At its heart, this challenge is about keeping the good \nthings about trade--speed and efficiency--without being vulnerable to \nthe bad things about trade--the potential for terrorists to use our \nengines of commerce.\n  There is an incident that occurred a few years ago that shows just \nhow serious a threat we are facing. Four years ago, in Italy, \ndockworkers noticed something strange about one of the cargo \ncontainers. They opened it up and found an Egyptian man inside. But \nthis was not your average stowaway. This man was a suspected al-Qaida \nterrorist, and he had all of the tools of the trade with him. His cargo \ncontainer had been outfitted for a long voyage with a bed, a heater, \nand water. He had a satellite phone and a laptop computer. He also had \nsecurity passes and mechanic certificates for four U.S. airports.\n  Now, that happened in 2001. It can still happen today. But don't take \nmy word for it. The Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection said:\n\n       [T]he container is the potential Trojan Horse of the 21st \n     century.\n\n  The 9/11 Commission said terrorists may turn from targeting aviation \nto targeting seaports because ``opportunities to do harm are as great, \nor greater, in maritime or surface transportation.''\n  As we all know, our Government has uncovered al-Qaida training \nmanuals, and some of these books suggest that terrorists try to recruit \nworkers at borders, airports, and seaports.\n  There are two main scenarios we need to think about.\n  First, a group like al-Qaida could use cargo containers to smuggle \nweapons and personnel into the United States. They could split up a \nweapon and ship it to the U.S. in separate containers. And those pieces \ncould be reassembled anywhere in the United States. So the first danger \nis that terrorists could use these cargo containers to get dangerous \nweapons into the United States.\n  Secondly, terrorists could use a cargo container as a weapon itself. \nA terrorist could place a nuclear, chemical, or biological weapon \ninside a container and then detonate it once it reaches a U.S. port or \nanother destination inside the United States.\n  This week, the 9/11 Commission said we have not done enough to \nprevent terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. One \nstudy said if a nuclear device was detonated at a major seaport, it \ncould kill up to a million people.\n\n[[Page S12843]]\n\n  Now, many of our ports are located near major cities. Others are \nlocated near key transportation hubs. For example, if a chemical weapon \nwere detonated in Seattle, the chemical plume could contaminate the \nrail system, Interstate 5, and SeaTac Airport, not to mention the \nentire downtown business and residential areas.\n  Terrorists could also detonate a dirty bomb or launch a bioterror \nattack. Any of those scenarios would impose a devastating cost in human \nlives, but that is not all.\n  We also know that al-Qaida wants to cripple our economy. Cargo \ncontainers could offer them a powerful way to do just that, and the \ndamage goes beyond lives. An attack launched through our ports would \nalso have a devastating economic impact. That is because after an \nattack the Federal Government is likely to shut down our ports to make \nsure that additional hazards weren't being brought into the country--\nsimilar to what we did with airplanes after 9/11.\n  When we stopped air travel then, it took us a couple of days to get \nback up to speed. And as we all remember, it cost our economy a great \ndeal. But if you stopped cargo containers without a resumption system \nin place, it could take as long as 4 months to get them inspected and \nmoving again. That would cripple our economy, and it could even spark a \nglobal recession.\n  Today, our cargo containers are part of the assembly line of American \nbusiness. We have just-in-time delivery and rolling warehouses. If you \nshut down the flow of cargo, you are shutting down the economy. If our \nports were locked down, we would feel the impact at every level of our \neconomy.\n  Factories would not be able to get the raw materials they need. Many \nkeep small inventories on hand. Once those inventories run out, \nfactories would be shut down and workers laid off. We would also see \nthe impact in stores. Merchants would not be able to get their products \nfrom overseas. Store shelves would go bear, and workers, again, would \nbe laid off.\n  One study, in fact, concluded that if U.S. ports were shut down for \n12 days, it could cost our economy $58 billion. In 2002, we saw what \nclosing down a few ports on the west coast would do. When west coast \ndockworkers were locked out, it cost our economy about $1 billion a \nday. Imagine if we shut down all our ports, not just those on the west \ncoast.\n  Dr. Stephen Flynn, who is a national security expert, has said that a \n3-week shutdown could spawn a global recession. It is clear that we are \nvulnerable and that an attack could do tremendous damage.\n  If our ports were shut down today, we do not have a system in place \nfor getting them started again. There is no protocol for what would be \nsearched, what would be allowed in, and even who would be in charge.\n\n  Now, I want to acknowledge that we have made some progress since 9/\n11. We have provided some funding to make our ports more secure. I have \nfought for port security grants to make sure we are controlling access \nto our ports, and our local ports are on the cutting edge of security. \nWe have implemented the 24-hour rule so we know what is supposed to be \nin a container before it reaches the United States. We are adding some \nmore detection equipment to American ports, but, remember, once a \nnuclear device is sitting on a U.S. dock, it is too late. Customs \ncreated a program that works with foreign ports to speed some cargo \ninto the United States. It is a good idea, but to date it has not been \nimplemented well.\n  In May, the Government Accountability Office issued a very troubling \nreport. It found that if companies applied for C-TPAT status, we gave \nthem less scrutiny simply for submitting paperwork. We never checked to \nsee if they actually did what they said they were going to do. We just \ninspected them less. One expert called that approach ``trust, but don't \nverify.''\n  Even when U.S. Customs inspectors do find something suspicious at a \nforeign port, they cannot force a container to be inspected today. They \ncan ask the local government, but those requests are frequently \nrejected.\n  So because we cannot enforce those agreements through our State \nDepartment, our Customs officials do not have the power they need, and \npotentially dangerous cargo can arrive at U.S. ports without being \ninspected overseas.\n  I am deeply concerned about this issue because I know that maritime \ncargo, especially container cargo, is a critical part of our economy. \nMy interest in trade goes back to my childhood. My dad ran a small dime \nstore. He relied on imports to stock the shelves in his store. \nInternational trade put food on our table, and I have never forgotten \nthat. So I want to make sure we close the loopholes that threaten our \nability to trade, while we protect our lives and our economy.\n  I have worked on this challenge for several years. I have held \nhearings. I wrote and funded Operation Safe Commerce. And I have been \nmeeting with various stakeholders.\n  I know this proposal has to work for everyone in the supply chain: \nimporters, freight forwarders, shippers, terminal operators, and \nworkers such as longshoremen, truckdrivers, and port employees--all the \npeople who are on the frontlines as our eyes and our ears. They need to \nbe part of the solution because they would be among the first to be \nhurt if an incident occurred.\n  Senator Collins and I have worked together to get input from \nstakeholders, and with that we have crafted a bill that I believe \nstrikes the right balance. Our proposal is built around five \ncommonsense ideas.\n  It has been over 4 years since the tragedy of September 11, and some \nof our most vulnerable assets--our ports and our maritime cargo \nsystem--still do not have a coordinated security regime. So the \nGreenLane Act will take that first step and ensure minimum security \nstandards are in place for all container cargo entering our ports.\n  Secondly, because there are so many cargo containers coming into our \ncountry, we need to make that haystack smaller. We need to do a better \njob in front-loading our inspections overseas before the cargo ever \ngets loaded on a ship that is headed for the United States. Then, \ninstead of focusing on a small percent of all containers, we can \nseparate the most secure containers from the ones that need more \nsecurity.\n  Third, we need to give businesses incentives to adopt better \nsecurity. Companies are going to do what is in their financial \ninterest, and we can use market incentives to make the entire industry \nmore secure.\n  Fourth, we need to minimize the impact of any incident. Right now, if \nthere were a terrorist attack through one of our ports, there would be \nan awful lot of confusion. So we need to put one office in charge of \ncargo security policy. We need to create protocols for resuming trade \nafter an incident occurs. And we need to establish joint operations \ncenters to help make local decisions that will get our trade moving \nagain.\n  We cannot afford to leave cargo on the docks for weeks. We need a \nplan that tells us in advance what cargo will be unloaded first, and \nhow we will get this system back on its feet.\n  Finally, we need to monitor and secure cargo from the factory floor \noverseas until it reaches our own shores. There are vulnerabilities at \nevery step of the supply chain. A secure system is going to start at \nthe factory overseas and continue until that cargo reaches its final \ndestination.\n  I want to detail how our bill will make the American people safer. \nFirst of all, it raises the security standards for everyone across the \nboard and directs the Department of Homeland Security to take all of \nthe best practices and lessons learned and create new standards that \nwill establish a new baseline of security for everyone.\n  Secondly, it creates the GreenLane. If shippers agree to follow the \nhigher security standards of the GreenLane, they get a series of \nbenefits.\n  To be designated as GreenLane cargo, importers have to ensure that \nall entities within their supply chain are validated C-TPAT \nparticipants; access to the cargo and containers is restricted to those \nemployees who need access and we are assured of their identification; a \nlogistics system is in place that provides the ability to track \neverything loaded into a GreenLane container back to the factory; and, \na container security device, such as an e-seal, is used to secure the \ncontainer.\n  Remember, GreenLane is optional. No one has to participate. I believe \ncompanies will want to participate because they will get benefits in \nreturn.\n  What are those benefits? Their bonding requirements could be reduced \nor\n\n[[Page S12844]]\n\neliminated. Instead of paying customs duties on every shipment, they \ncould be billed monthly or quarterly. Their cargo will be subject to \nfewer searches and will be released faster upon entering the United \nStates. They will lose less cargo to theft, and they will have the \nstability that comes from having one uniform standard to plan around.\n  Finally, the GreenLane Act sets up a plan so that trade can be \nresumed quickly and safely if an attack occurs. Today, there are no \nprotocols. There is no guide on how to get the system going again. Our \nbill will create one, and it will let the most secure cargo--the \nGreenLane cargo--be released first.\n  Our bill creates joint operations centers to ensure a coordinated, \nmeasured response and the resumption and flow of commerce in the event \nof an incident or heightened national security threat level.\n  Our bill takes other steps. It expands port security grants. It makes \nsure we continue to monitor our security system to make sure it is \nworking. It makes sure that a company's cargo data is not available to \ncompetitors. It sets a uniform standard for security so shippers and \nothers have some certainty, rather than a hodgepodge of different \nstandards.\n  There have been a lot of commissions and studies on port security, \nand we have worked to address their recommendations in our bill.\n  The 9/11 Commission said we need ``layered'' security, that we need \nto centralize authority so we can have more accountability, and that \nFederal agencies need to share information better. Our bill implements \nall of those recommendations.\n  The Government Accountability Office looked at current Customs \nprograms and identified some troubling shortcomings.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MARTINEZ (for himself and Mr. Nelson of Florida):\n  S. 2009.

A bill to amend the Social Security Act to enhance the \nSocial Security of the Nation by ensuring adequate public-private \ninfrastructure and to resolve to prevent, detect, treat, intervene in, \nand prosecute elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, with my good friend and colleague, Senator \nBlanche Lincoln, I rise to introduce the Elder Justice Act of 2005. We \nare joined in this effort by Senator Gordon Smith, the chairman of the \nAging Committee, and Senator Herb Kohl, the ranking minority member of \nthat committee.\n  As my colleagues may recall, Senator John Breaux and I introduced \nsimilar legislation in both the 107th and 108th Congresses, with the \nstrong support of Senators Lincoln, Smith and Kohl. The bill was \nreported by the Finance Committee last year, but unfortunately it was \nnot approved before we adjourned.\n  Although the number of older Americans is growing at a rapid pace, \nthousands of cases of elder abuse go unaddressed every day. The problem \nof elder abuse, neglect and exploitation has long been invisible and is \nprobably one of the most serious issues facing seniors and their \nfamilies.\n  Research in the field is scarce, but, by some estimates, up to five \nmillion cases of elder abuse, neglect and exploitation occur each year. \nWithout more attention and more resources, far too many of these cases \nof abuse, neglect and exploitation will go unaddressed and far too many \nolder Americans will suffer.\n  Few pressing social issues have been as systematically ignored as \nelder abuse. In fact, 25 years of congressional hearings on the \ndevastating effects of elder abuse have found this problem to be a \n``disgrace'' and a ``burgeoning national scandal.'' Yet, to date, no \nfederal legislation has been enacted to address elder abuse in a \ncomprehensive manner.\n  During that same time period, Congress passed comprehensive bills to \naddress child abuse and crimes against women, yet there is not one \nfull-time Federal employee working on elder abuse in the entire Federal \nGovernment.\n  The cost of elder abuse is high. This is true in terms of needless \nhuman suffering, inflated health care costs, limited Federal resources \nand the loss of one of our greatest national assets--the wisdom and \nexperience of older citizens.\n  S. 2010 is designed to create a national focus on elder abuse to \nincrease detection, prevention, prosecution and victim assistance. It \nensures that states, communities, consumers and families will have \naccess to the information and resources they need to confront this \ndifficult issue.\n  By addressing law enforcement, social service and public health \nconcerns, our bill uses the proven approach Congress has adopted to \ncombat child abuse and violence against women.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to describe our legislation in \nmore detail.\n  The Elder Justice Act establishes dual Offices of Elder Justice at \nthe Departments of Justice, DOJ, and Health and Human Services, HHS, to \ncoordinate Federal, State and local efforts to combat elder abuse in \nresidential and institutional settings. In addition, an Elder Justice \nCoordinating Council will be established to make recommendations to the \nHHS Secretary and the Attorney General on coordinating activities of \nFederal agencies related to elder abuse. This Council is specifically \nmandated to advise us on legislation, model laws and other appropriate \naction on addressing elder abuse.\n  The bill creates an Advisory Board on Elder Abuse, Neglect and \nExploitation to establish a short-term and long-term multi-disciplinary \nstrategic plan for expanding the field of elder justice. The board \nwould make recommendations to HHS, DOJ, and the Elder Justice \nCoordinating Council and submit to HHS, DOJ, and Congress information \nand recommendations on elder justice programs, activities and \nlegislation.\n  The Elder Justice Act also directs the HHS Secretary to establish an \nElder Resource Center to develop ways to collect, maintain and \ndisseminate information relevant to consumers, families and providers \nin order to protect individuals from elder abuse and neglect. It is our \nhope that this Center will improve the quality, quantity and \naccessibility of information available on elder abuse. In addition, the \nbill establishes a National Elder Justice Library within the Center to \nserve as a centralized repository for materials on training, technical \nassistance and promising practices related to elder justice.\n  S. 2010 also improves, streamlines and promotes uniform collection \nand dissemination of national data related to elder abuse, neglect and \nexploitation. Today, data on elder abuse are very limited. The Director \nof the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, is directed to \ndevelop a method for collecting national data regarding elder abuse and \nthen create uniform national data reporting forms to help determine \nwhat a reportable event on elder abuse is.\n  The legislation includes several grants to combat elder abuse \nincluding grants to improve data collection activities on elder abuse \nprevention and prosecution of elder abuse cases. These grants would \nestablish five Centers of Excellence nationwide to specialize in \nresearch, clinical practice and training related to elder abuse.\n  In addition, the HHS Secretary will award safe haven grants to six \ndiverse communities to examine elder shelters to test various models \nfor establishing safe havens. Elder victims' needs, which are rarely \naddressed, will be better met by supporting the creation of safe havens \nfor seniors who are not safe where they live. Development of safe haven \nprograms which focus on the special needs of at-risk elders and older \nvictims are needed and necessary.\n  The legislation directs the HHS Secretary to award training grants to \ngroups with responsibility for elder justice, eligible entities to \nprovide care for those with dementia and certain entities to make \nrecommendations on caring for underserved populations of seniors living \nin rural areas, minority populations, and Indian tribes. Training to \ncombat elder abuse, neglect and exploitation will be supported both \nwithin individual disciplines and in multi-disciplines such as public \nhealth, social service and law enforcement settings.\n  In addition, our bill directs the Secretary to award fellowships to \nindividuals so they may obtain training in both forensic pathology and \ngeriatrics. An individual receiving such a fellowship shall provide \ntraining in forensic geriatrics to interdisciplinary teams of health \ncare professionals. Grants also would be awarded to create programs to \nincrease the number of health care professionals with geriatric \ntraining. Finally, the Elder Justice Act directs the HHS Secretary to \naward grants to conduct a national multimedia campaign to raise \nawareness on elder abuse.\n  Our legislation also requires a number of studies on elder abuse \nincluding one on the responsibilities of federal,\n\n[[Page S12848]]\n\nstate and local governments in response to reports of elder abuse. This \nstudy would be to improve response time to elder abuse and reduce elder \nvictimization.\n  In addition, the CDC Director is directed to conduct a study on the \nbest method to address elder abuse from a public health perspective, \nincluding reducing elder abuse, neglect and exploitation committed by \nfamily members. Current statistics indicate that only 20 percent of \nelder abuse occurs in long-term care facilities and institutions--80 \npercent of elder abuse is committed in the home.\n  The bill also establishes new programs to assist victims and provides \ngrants for education and training of law enforcement and prosecutors. \nIt requires reporting of crimes in long-term care settings, creates a \nnational criminal background check program for those employed by long-\nterm care providers--something strongly advocated by Senator Kohl--and \nestablishes a national nurse aide registry program based on \nrecommendations by HHS.\n  Senior citizens cannot wait any longer for this legislation to pass.\n  More and more of us will enjoy longer life in relative health, but \nwith this gift comes the responsibility to prevent the needless \nsuffering too often borne by our frailest seniors.\n  In closing, I must note that our legislation has been endorsed by the \nElder Justice Coalition, a national membership organization dedicated \nto eliminating elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation in America. This \ncoalition, which has been a strong advocate and supporter of the Elder \nJustice Act, has 397 members.\n  This Congress, one of my top priorities is to get this bill signed \ninto law, once and for all, so that elder justice will become a reality \nfor those Americans who need it most. Our seniors deserve no less.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Hatch, to introduce the Elder Justice Act of 2005. I \nam pleased that Senate Special Committee on Aging Chairman Smith and \nRanking Member Kohl are joining us as original cosponsors of this \nimportant legislation.\n  I have been a cosponsor of the Elder Justice Act since Senator Breaux \nand Senator Hatch introduced the original bill in 2002. I joined them \nagain as a cosponsor in 2003 and helped pass a version of the \nlegislation out of the Senate Finance Committee in late 2004.\n  Unfortunately and regrettably, the Elder Justice Act failed to become \nlaw last year, despite the incredible leadership by Senator Breaux and \nSenator Hatch. It has yet to become law despite the fact that our \nNation continues to grow older and despite the fact that the tragedy of \nelder abuse, neglect, and exploitation continues.\n  Abuse of our senior citizens can be physical, sexual, psychological, \nor financial. The perpetrator may be a stranger, an acquaintance, a \npaid caregiver, a corporation, and sadly, even a spouse or another \nfamily member. Elder abuse happens everywhere, at all levels of income \nand in all geographic areas. No matter how rich you are, and no matter \nwhere you live, no one is immune.\n  Congress must make our seniors a priority and pass the Elder Justice \nAct as soon as possible.\n  This bill represents the culmination of 25 years of congressional \nhearings on the distressing effects of elder abuse. It represents a \nconsensus agreement developed by the Elder Justice Coalition, a \nnational organization dedicated to eliminating elder abuse, neglect, \nand exploitation in America. This bill reminds us of the fact that \nCongress has already passed comprehensive bills to address child abuse \nand violence against women but has continued to ignore the fact that we \nhave no Federal law enacted to date on elder abuse.\n  Every older person has the right to be free of abuse, neglect, and \nexploitation. And the Elder Justice Act will enhance our knowledge \nabout abuse of our seniors in all its terrible forms. It will elevate \nelder abuse to the national stage. Too many of our seniors suffer \nneedlessly. Each year, anywhere between 500,000 and 5 million seniors \nin our country are abused, neglected, or exploited. And, sadly, most \nabuse goes unreported.\n  This historical problem will only get worse as 77 million baby \nboomers age.\n  The Elder Justice Act confronts elder abuse in the same ways we \ncombat child abuse and violence against women: through law enforcement, \npublic health programs, and social services at all levels of \ngovernment. It also establishes research projects to assist in the \ndevelopment of future legislation.\n  The Elder Justice Act will take steps to make older Americans safer \nin their homes, nursing home facilities, and neighborhoods. It enhances \ndetection of elder abuse and helps seniors recover from abuse after it \nstarts. It increases collaboration between federal agencies and between \nFederal, State, local, and private entities, law enforcement, longterm \ncare facilities, consumer advocates, and families to prevent and treat \nelder abuse.\n  Each of us will grow older, and if we're lucky, we will live for a \nvery long time. A baby girl born today has a 50 percent chance of \nliving until she is 100 years old. What will we gain if we fail to \nensure that baby girl ages with dignity, free of abuse, neglect, and \nexploitation? As Hubert Humphrey said, ``The moral test of government \nis how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life, the \nchildren; those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those \nwho are in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy, and the \nhandicapped.''\n  It is time for Congress to pass the first comprehensive federal law \nto address elder abuse, the Elder Justice Act of 2005, to ensure that \nthose in the twilight of life are protected from abuse that threatens \ntheir safety, independence, and productivity.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Elder Justice Act.\n  My job as a Senator is to help protect and defend the freedoms of all \nAmericans. As the Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee it is an \nexpressed duty of mine to focus on one of our more vulnerable \npopulations, older Americans.\n  All too often we concentrate our efforts to stop crime on crimes that \nare reported or easy to identify. However, crimes against the elderly \nare often never reported or identified. Many older Americans find \nthemselves reliant on a caregiver or close one who is taking advantage \nof them physically or monetarily and have no means to take action \nagainst this individual. This scary and sad scenario happens more often \nthen we would like to admit.\n  According to the best available estimates, between 1 and 2 million \nAmericans age 65 or older have been injured, exploited, or otherwise \nmistreated by someone on whom they depended for care or protection. Too \nmany older Americans suffer from the various forms of abuse and the \nlegislation we are introducing today will take very important steps to \nstop the long ignored problem of elder abuse. The Elder Justice Act \nprevents and treats elder abuse by:\n  Improving prevention and intervention through funding projects to \nmake older Americans safer in their homes, facilities, and \nneighborhoods. The bill specifically enhances long-term care staffing.\n  Creating forensic centers and targeting funding to develop expertise \nin the detection of signs of elder abuse.\n  Targeting funding to efforts to better find ways to mitigate the \nconsequences of elder mistreatment.\n  Enhancing collaboration by supporting coordination between federal \nand local entities including consumer advocates, long-term care \nfacilities and most importantly families.\n  My home state of Oregon has been a leader in many of these efforts. \nOne program, the Elder Safe program IN Washington County, helps victims \naged 65 and older after a crime is reported to police and continues to \nhelp them through the criminal justice system. Based at the Sheriff's \nOffice, Elder Safe collaborates with the District Attorney's Office and \nthe Department of Aging and Veterans' Services and all city police \ndepartment to coordinate services to help seniors read legal documents \nor travel to the courthouse. Assistance from the Elder Safe program is \ntailored to the unique circumstance of each victim and may include \npersonal support, court advocacy, or help filling out forms. It is \nimportant that we support programs, like the Elder Safe program, \nnationally. The Elder Justice Act will be a huge boost to our efforts. \nI urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this \nimportant bill.\n\n[[Page S12849]]\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the Elder \nJustice Act. I applaud the leadership and commitment that Senator Hatch \nand Senator Lincoln have shown to protecting our Nation's senior \ncitizens by reintroducing this legislation. As Ranking Member of the \nSpecial Committee on Aging, I am pleased to join Senator Smith, our \nChairman, as an original cosponsor of this important bill.\n  I also want to commend the bipartisan Elder Justice Coalition for its \nrole in developing and moving this bill forward. In particular, I would \nlike to acknowledge the contributions of Wisconsin members of the \nCoalition, including the Coalition of Wisconsin Aging Groups, the \nWisconsin Association of Area Agencies on Aging, and the Wisconsin \nBoard on Aging and Long Term Care, among many others. Passage of the \nElder Justice Act is long overdue, and we look forward to working with \nthe Coalition to ensure that it becomes law as soon as possible.\n  In the past forty years, our Nation has made great strides to address \nthe ugly truth of child abuse and domestic violence in our society. We \nhave made a difference by making comprehensive legislation designed to \ncombat these terrible issues a top priority. Today, I ask the Congress \nto once again focus on the issue of abuse only this time, to focus on \nthe grim reality of elder abuse, neglect and exploitation.\n  For the past 25 years, Congress has held hearings on the devastating \neffects of elder abuse; yet no comprehensive action has been taken. \nAbuse of the elderly is certainly nothing new, but as our Nation has \naged and the Baby Boom generation stands on the cusp of retirement, the \nprevalence of elder abuse will only get worse. The time to act is now. \nThe shame and scandal of abuse, neglect and exploitation of our \nNation's seniors can no longer be ignored or tolerated.\n  I am pleased that the Elder Justice Act includes one of my top \npriorities--a provision mandating a national criminal background check \nsystem for nursing home, home health and other long-term care \nemployees. While the vast majority of employees are hardworking, \ndedicated and professional, it is simply too easy for people with \nabusive and criminal backgrounds to find work in long term care.\n  Today, seven States, including my home State of Wisconsin, are \nengaged in a pilot project to require FBI criminal background checks \nbefore hiring a new employee. The Elder Justice Act will ensure that \nonce the pilot is over, we will move to a national criminal background \ncheck system so seniors in all fifty states will be protected. I want \nto thank Senators Hatch and Lincoln and their staff for working with me \nto once again include this provision as a key part of the Elder Justice \nAct. I very much appreciate their efforts and look forward to working \nwith them to see that it becomes law.\n  In addition to the background check provision, the Elder Justice Act \ntakes a number of steps to prevent and treat elder abuse. First, it \nwill improve prevention and intervention by funding State and local \nprojects that keep older Americans safe.\n  Second, it will improve collaboration by bringing together a variety \nof different Federal, State, local, and private entities to address \nelder abuse. The bill ensures that health officials, social services, \nlaw enforcement, long-term care facilities, consumer advocates and \nfamilies are all working together to confront this problem.\n  Third, it will develop expertise to better detect elder abuse, \nneglect and exploitation, by training health professionals in both \nforensic pathology and geriatrics.\n  Fourth, it will develop victim assistance programs for at-risk \nseniors and create ``safe havens'' for seniors who are not safe where \nthey live.\n  Finally, it will give extra resources to law enforcement officials to \ninvestigate cases of elder abuse and make them a top priority.\n  Once again, I thank Senators Hatch and Lincoln for bringing the issue \nof elder abuse to the forefront by re-introducing this important \nlegislation. I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 2011. A bill to require the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency to establish performance standards for fine \nparticulates for certain pulp and paper mills, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Tire Derived \nFuel Safety Act of 2005 to ensure that Americans living near pulp and \npaper mills that burn tires for energy are protected from the potential \nharmful effects of air pollutants such as fine particulates.\n  As the price of oil and natural gas continues to rise, U.S. \nmanufacturing facilities are seeking alternative energy sources. Pulp \nand paper mills, in particular, are replacing these high cost energy \nsources with lower cost tire derived fuels or TDF due to its high-\nenergy value.\n  The burning of tires results in the emissions of particulates, carbon \nmonoxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, \nPCBs, arsenic, cadmium, nickel, zinc, mercury, chromium and vanadium. \nThese air pollutants can have serious health impacts on the people \nliving downwind of facilities when effective emissions control \ntechnologies are not used.\n  Luckily, most U.S. pulp and paper mills that burn TDF have already \ninstalled electrostatic precipitators or fabric filters to control for \nfine particulate emissions. And, in fact, EPA's 1997 ``Air Emissions \nFrom Scrap Tire Combustion'' report states that it is not likely that a \nsolid fuel combustor without add-on particulate controls--such as an \nESP or fabric filter--could satisfy air emissions regulatory \nrequirements in the United States.\n  Yet, that hasn't stopped International Paper from proposing to burn \n72 tons a day of tires at its Ticonderoga, NY mill without the addition \nof commonly accepted emissions control technologies. Doing so \njeopardizes the health of Vermonters and New Yorkers alike.\n  My bill requires EPA to issue performance standards for fine \nparticulates for pulp and paper mills that switch to tire-derived fuels \nto ensure that all communities across United States are equally and \nfairly protected.\n  My bill also requires EPA to study and report to Congress on the \nhealth impacts of increased emissions, particularly fine particulates, \nfrom the use of TDF. It also requires EPA to work with Health and Human \nServices to document the rates of childhood diseases--particularly \nrespiratory diseases--of children that live or attend school within a \n20-mile radius of a pulp and paper mill burning TDF.\n  I invite my colleagues to join me in my efforts to ensure that all \nAmericans are equally protected from the harmful effects of the burning \nof tire-derived fuel without adequate air pollution controls. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2011\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Tire-Derived Fuel Safety Act \n     of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to authorize appropriations to the Secretary of \nCommerce for the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management \nAct for fiscal years 2006 through 2012, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I come to the Senate, along with my \ngood friend and coauthor, Senator Dan Inouye of Hawaii, to introduce a \nbill to reauthorize the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Conservation and \nManagement Act.\n  This legislation reauthorizes the law that manages and regulates \nfisheries in the United States exclusive economic zone. It is \ncosponsored by Senators Snowe, Cantwell, and Vitter.\n  The law was originally enacted in 1976. A that time it was titled the \nFishery Conservation and Management Act. Senator Warren Magnuson and I \ndeveloped the law after Warren sent me to monitor the law of the sea \nnegotiations, which took place all over the world. A concept considered \nduring these negotiations was the expansion of a coastal nation's \nsovereignty over its seaward waters out to 200 miles.\n  Warren and I took a bipartisan approach to the legislation and \ndeveloped a bill that established our country's exclusive right to \nharvest fishery resources from 3 to 200 miles and put in place one of \nthe most successful Federal-State management systems. This system \nrecognized the complexity of our differing fish stocks and the unique \nregional approaches needed to manage these resources.\n  This is now the seventh authorization of the act we created over 30 \nyears ago. It is the first reauthorization I have been a part of as \nchairman of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, which \nhas jurisdiction over this legislation.\n  The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 2005 \nimplements many of the recommendations made by the U.S. Commission on \nOcean Policy--the first such commission authorized by Congress to \nreview our nation's ocean policies and laws in over 35 years. This was \ncoauthored by my great friend from South Carolina, Senator Ernest \nHollings. The Commission's recommendations were important to the \ndevelopment of this act we present to the Senate today.\n  The intent of this legislation is to authorize these recommendations \nand to build on some of the sound fishery management principles we \npassed in the Sustainable Fisheries Act in 1996, which was the last \ntime we reauthorized the act.\n  Our bill will preserve and strengthen the regional fishery management \ncouncils. The eight regional councils located around the United States \nand Caribbean Islands are a model of Federal oversight benefiting from \nlocal innovation and management approaches. This reauthorization \nestablishes a council training program designed to prepare members for \nthe numerous legal, scientific, economic, and conflict of interest \nrequirements which apply to the fishery management process. In \naddition, this reauthorization addresses concerns over the transparency \nof the regional council process--it provides additional financial \ndisclosure requirements for council members and clarifies the act's \nconflict of interest and recusal requirements.\n  In order to prevent overfishing and preserve the sustainable harvest \nof fishery resources in all eight regional council jurisdictions, this \nbill mandates the use of annual catch limits which shall not be \nexceeded. Under the 1996 Sustainable Fisheries Act, overfishing of \noverfished stocks was to end. To meet this goal, we required the \nimplementation of rebuilding plans which would restore any overfished \nspecies to sustainable levels. It has been almost 10 years since we \npassed the Sustainable Fisheries Act and overfishing of overfished \nstocks remains a significant problem. The legislation we are \nintroducing today requires every fishery management plan to contain an \nannual catch limit which is set at or below optimum yield, based on the \nbest scientific information available.\n  This bill also requires that any harvests exceeding the annual catch \nlimit be deducted from the annual catch limit for the following year.\n  An important recommendation from the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy \nwas to establish national standards for quota programs. Our legislation \nestablishes national guidelines for the harvesting of fish for limited \naccess privilege programs, which are also called LAPPs. These \nguidelines would require that any LAPP must accomplish important \nobjectives, including: assisting in rebuilding an overfished fishery; \nreducing capacity in a fishery that is overcapitalized; promoting the \nsafety of human life at sea; promoting conservation and management; and \nproviding a system for monitoring, management, and enforcement of the \nprogram.\n  The regional councils, the administration, and to a lesser extent the \nU.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, all recommended we address the \ninconsistencies between the Magnuson-Stevens Act and the National \nEnvironmental Protection Act. They recommended we resolve timeline or \n``process'' issues which have required councils to spend much of their \ntime and funding developing litigation-proof environmental impact \nstatements and environmental assessments under NEPA.\n  This bill provides a uniform process under which councils can \nconsider the substantive requirements of NEPA while adhering to the \ntimelines found in Magnuson-Stevens when they are developing fishery \nmanagement plans, plan amendments, and regulations.\n  Several of the provisions in this bill strengthen the role of science \nin council decisionmaking, which was another strong recommendation made \nby the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy. Our bill specifies that the \nscientific and statistical committees, called SSCs, are to provide \ntheir councils with on-going scientific advice needed for management \ndecisions. This may include\n\n[[Page S12851]]\n\nrecommendations on acceptable biological catch or optimum yield, annual \ncatch limits, or other mortality limits. The SSCs are also expected to \nadvise the councils on a variety of other issues, including stock \nstatus and health, bycatch, habitat status, and socioeconomic impacts.\n  We have enhanced the overall effectiveness of this act by improving \ndata collection and management. Our legislation authorizes a national \ncooperative research and management program, which would be implemented \non a regional basis and conducted through partnerships between Federal \nand State managers, commercial and recreational fishing industry \nparticipants, and scientists. This will improve data related to \nrecreational fisheries by establishing a new national program for the \nregistration of marine recreational fishermen who fish in Federal \nwaters. Our legislation also directs the secretary, in cooperation with \nthe councils, to create a regionally based bycatch reduction \nengineering program which will develop technological devices and \nengineering techniques for minimizing bycatch, bycatch mortality, and \npost-release mortality.\n  The Magnuson-Stevens Act has worked well. It has enabled effective \nconservation and management of our fishery resources and allowed for \nsustainable harvests. Both the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy and the \nPew Oceans Commission singled out the fisheries managed by the North \nPacific Council--which does not have an overfished or endangered \nspecies of fish--as an example of proper fisheries management.\n  Let me say that again. They singled out the fisheries management by \nthe North Pacific Council, which does not have an overfished or \nendangered species of fish, as an example of proper fisheries \nmanagement.\n  The council consistently sets an optimum yield far below the \nacceptable biological catch, and the fisheries in its jurisdiction have \nremained sustainable and abundant. That is the North Pacific Council, \nMr. President. Our goal is to build upon this success and ensure the \nsustainability of this resource for generations to come.\n  Unfortunately, management internationally and especially on the high-\nseas is lacking. Industrial foreign fleets continue to expand and fish \nin remote and deep parts of the oceans. When we first developed this \nlegislation over 30 years ago, such practices were unimaginable. The \nillegal, unreported, and unregulated--we call this IUU--fishing on the \nhigh-seas now threatens the good management taking place in U.S. waters \nthat we control.\n  Our bill strengthens U.S. leadership in international conservation \nand management. It requires the Secretary of Commerce to establish an \ninternational compliance and monitoring program and to provide Congress \nwith reports on our progress in reducing IUU fishing. This bill also \nrequires the Secretary to promote international cooperation and \nstrengthen the ability of regional fishery management organizations to \ncombat IUU and other harmful fishing practices. In addition, this \nlegislation allows the use of measures authorized under the High Seas \nDriftnet Act to force compliance in cases where regional or \ninternational fishery management organizations are unable to stop IUU \nfishing.\n  I have been pleased with the bipartisan approach we have taken on \nthis bill. My co-chairman, Senator Inouye, and I have worked together \non this reauthorization, and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on the Commerce Committee to move this legislation forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 2013. A bill to amend the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 to \nimplement the Agreement on the Conservation and Management of the \nAlaska-Chukotka Polar Bear Population; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I introduce today a bill to implement the \nprovisions of the ``Agreement Between the Government of the United \nStates of America and the Government of the Russian Federation on the \nConservation and Management of the Alaska-Chukotka Polar Bear \nPopulation''. This bill is co-sponsored by Senator Inouye.\n  The United States-Russia Polar Bear Conservation and Management \nImplementation Act of 2005 will amend the Marine Mammal Protection Act \nadding provisions to create a binational U.S. and Russian Polar Bear \nCommission. This commission will be authorized to determine annual take \nlimits and the adoption of other measures to restrict the taking of \npolar bears for subsistence purposes. The Commission will also identify \npolar bear habitats and ``develop recommendations for habitat \nconservation measures.'' Additionally, it prohibits the possession, \nimport, export, transport, sale, receipt, acquisition, or purchase of \nany polar bear, or any part or product thereof, that is taken in \nviolation of the Agreement.\n  This bill will simultaneously support the conservation of U.S. and \nRussian Polar Bear populations and the historical traditions of \nindigenous peoples in the arctic region.\n  This implementing legislation for the Polar Bear Treaty is necessary \nto establish the needed regulatory and management entities in both the \nU.S. and Russia. The shared population of Polar Bears that migrate \nbetween our two nations deserve the added protections and conservation \nthis bill will provide.\n  The U.S.-Russian Polar Bear Treaty was completed and signed by both \ncountries on October 16, 2000. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nheld a hearing on the treaty in June of 2003, and reported it out \nfavorably on July 23, 2003. The full Senate agreed to the resolution of \nadvice and consent on the treaty on July 31, 2003. This legislation is \nneeded for the U.S. to ratify and implement the treaty. The \nadministration is supportive of the treaty and the proposed \nlegislation, as are Alaska Natives, the State of Alaska, and \nconservation groups.\n  Russia has indicated that once the U.S. ratifies the treaty, it will \npromptly do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/15/senate-section/article/S12851-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12851-S12852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 312--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \nNEED FOR THE UNITED STATES TO ADDRESS GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGH THE \n      NEGOTIATION OF FAIR AND EFFECTIVE INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTS\n\n  Mr. LUGAR (for himself and Mr. Biden) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 312\n\n       Whereas there is a scientific consensus, as established by \n     the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and confirmed \n     by the National Academy of Sciences, that the continued \n     buildup of anthropogenic greenhouse gases in the atmosphere \n     threatens the stability of the global climate;\n       Whereas there are significant long-term risks to the \n     economy and the environment of the United States from the \n     temperature increases and climatic disruptions that are \n     projected to result from increased greenhouse gas \n     concentrations;\n       Whereas the potential impacts of global climate change, \n     including long-term drought, famine, mass migration, and \n     abrupt climatic shifts, may lead to international tensions \n     and instability in regions affected and thereby have \n     implications for the national security interests of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the United States, as the largest economy in the \n     world, is also the largest greenhouse gas emitter;\n       Whereas the greenhouse gas emissions of the United States \n     are currently projected to continue to rise;\n       Whereas the greenhouse gas emissions of developing \n     countries are rising more rapidly than the emissions of the \n     United States and will soon surpass the greenhouse gas \n     emissions of the United States and other developed countries;\n       Whereas reducing greenhouse gas emissions to the levels \n     necessary to avoid serious climatic disruption requires the \n     introduction of new energy technologies and other climate \n     friendly technologies, the use of which results in low or no \n     emissions of greenhouse gases or in the capture and storage \n     of greenhouse gases;\n       Whereas the development and sale of climate-friendly \n     technologies in the United States and internationally \n     presents economic opportunities for workers and businesses in \n     the United States;\n       Whereas climate-friendly technologies can improve air \n     quality by reducing harmful pollutants from stationary and \n     mobile sources, and can enhance energy security by reducing \n     reliance on imported oil, diversifying energy sources, and \n     reducing the vulnerability of energy delivery infrastructure;\n\n[[Page S12852]]\n\n       Whereas other industrialized countries are undertaking \n     measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which provides \n     the industries in those countries with a competitive \n     advantage in the growing global market for climate-friendly \n     technologies;\n       Whereas efforts to limit emissions growth in developing \n     countries in a manner that is consistent with the development \n     needs of those countries could establish significant markets \n     for climate-friendly technologies and contribute to \n     international efforts to address climate change;\n       Whereas the United States is a party to the United Nations \n     Framework Convention on Climate Change, done at New York May \n     9, 1992, and entered into force in 1994 (hereinafter referred \n     to as the ``Convention'');\n       Whereas the Convention sets a long-term objective of \n     stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere \n     at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic \n     interference with the climate system;\n       Whereas the Convention establishes that parties bear common \n     but differentiated responsibilities for efforts to achieve \n     the objective of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations;\n       Whereas an effective global effort to address climate \n     change must provide for commitments and action by all \n     countries that are major emitters of greenhouse gases, \n     developed and developing alike, and the widely varying \n     circumstances among the developed and developing countries \n     may require that such commitments and action vary; and\n       Whereas the United States has the capability to lead the \n     effort against global climate change: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     United States should act to reduce the health, environmental, \n     economic, and national security risks posed by global climate \n     change and foster sustained economic growth through a new \n     generation of technologies, by--\n       (1) participating in negotiations under the United Nations \n     Framework Convention on Climate Change, done at New York May \n     9, 1992, and entered into force in 1994, and leading efforts \n     in other international fora, with the objective of securing \n     United States participation in agreements that--\n       (A) advance and protect the economic and national security \n     interests of the United States;\n       (B) establish mitigation commitments by all countries that \n     are major emitters of greenhouse gases, consistent with the \n     principle of common but differentiated responsibilities;\n       (C) establish flexible international mechanisms to minimize \n     the cost of efforts by participating countries; and\n       (D) achieve a significant long-term reduction in global \n     greenhouse gas emissions; and\n       (2) establishing a bipartisan Senate observer group, the \n     members of which shall be designated by the chairman and \n     ranking member of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the \n     Senate, to--\n       (A) monitor any international negotiations on climate \n     change;

Res. 313\n\n       Whereas methamphetamine is a highly addictive, man-made \n     drug that can be injected, snorted, smoked, or ingested \n     orally, the effects of which include feelings of euphoria \n     that last for up to 24 hours and psychotic behavior such as \n     auditory hallucinations, mood disturbances, delusions, and \n     paranoia, potentially causing the user to experience \n     homicidal or suicidal thoughts as well as violent behavior \n     and brain damage;\n       Whereas the number of admissions to treatment in which \n     methamphetamine was the primary substance of abuse increased \n     exponentially from 20,776 in 1993 to 116,604 in 2003;\n       Whereas methamphetamine is easily produced in clandestine \n     laboratories, known as ``meth labs'', using a variety of \n     volatile and toxic ingredients available in stores, and \n     presents a danger to the individual preparing the \n     methamphetamine, the community surrounding the laboratory, \n     and the law enforcement personnel who discover the \n     laboratory;\n       Whereas the Drug Enforcement Administration reports that \n     domestic meth lab seizures have increased from 7,438 in 1999 \n     to 17,170 in 2004;\n       Whereas studies have found that methamphetamine use is \n     strongly linked to identity theft, domestic violence, overall \n     crime rates, child abuse, and child neglect;\n       Whereas the National Association of Counties has conducted \n     surveys with law enforcement and child welfare officials in \n     more than 500 counties, and found that 87 percent of all law \n     enforcement agencies surveyed reported increases in \n     methamphetamine-related arrests in recent years, and 40 \n     percent of all the child welfare officials in the survey \n     reported increased out-of-home placements of children due to \n     methamphetamine use;\n       Whereas methamphetamine use and production is prevalent \n     around the world;\n       Whereas approximately 65 percent of the methamphetamine \n     supply in the United States is trafficked in the form of a \n     finished product from other countries;\n       Whereas the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime \n     reports that more than 30,000,000 people around the world use \n     amphetamine-type stimulants, a number that eclipses the \n     combined global use of cocaine and heroin;\n       Whereas methamphetamine and narcotics task forces, judges, \n     prosecutors, defense attorneys, substance abuse treatment and \n     rehabilitation professionals, law enforcement officials, \n     researchers, students and educators, community leaders, \n     parents, and others dedicated to fighting methamphetamine \n     have a profound influence within their communities; and\n       Whereas the establishment of a National Methamphetamine \n     Prevention Week would increase awareness of methamphetamine \n     and educate the public on effective ways to help prevent \n     methamphetamine use at the international, Federal, State, and \n     local levels: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) a National Methamphetamine Prevention Week should be \n     established to increase awareness of methamphetamine and \n     educate the public on effective ways to help prevent \n     methamphetamine use at the international, Federal, State, and \n     local levels; and\n       (2) the people of the United States and interested groups \n     should be encouraged to observe National Methamphetamine \n     Prevention Week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/15/senate-section/article/S12852-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 314--DESIGNATING THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 2005, AS \n                       ``FEED AMERICA THURSDAY''\n\n   Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Bennett) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 315\n\n       Whereas, on January 18, 1803, President Thomas Jefferson \n     began an extraordinary journey by sending a secret message to \n     Congress requesting approval and funding to establish the \n     ``Corps of Volunteers for Northwest Discovery'' to explore \n     the most direct and practical water route across the \n     continent of the United States all the way to the Pacific \n     Ocean;\n       Whereas, on May 14, 1804, the journey up the Missouri River \n     and across the vast and newly acquired Louisiana Territory \n     began at Camp Dubois, Illinois, led by Captain Meriwether \n     Lewis and Second Lieutenant William Clark;\n       Whereas after a long year and a half and 4,133 arduous \n     miles, the expedition endured a dangerous storm of wind, \n     rain, and waves for 6 days at Clark's Dismal Nitch;\n       Whereas, on November 13, 1805, the Corps of Discovery moved \n     further west to Station Camp and beheld their first \n     comprehensive view of the Pacific Ocean, and thereby began\n\n[[Page S12853]]\n\n     the realization of the vision of President Jefferson of a \n     country ``from sea to shining sea'';\n       Whereas Station Camp also marks the occurrence of a \n     historical democratic vote to determine where to stay for \n     winter that included all members of the expedition, including \n     Sacagawea, an Indian woman, and York, an African American \n     slave;\n       Whereas, on November 19, 1805, Clark and 11 of his men set \n     out on an ocean excursion, hiking 25 miles to Cape \n     Disappointment to get a complete view of the Pacific Ocean \n     and reach the furthest western point of the expedition;\n       Whereas the expedition built their winter camp on the south \n     side of the Columbia River at Fort Clatsop, Oregon, named in \n     honor of the friendly local Clatsop Indians, and the 33 \n     member party spent 106 days among lush old-growth forest, \n     wetlands, and wildlife preparing for their long journey back \n     to St. Louis, Missouri;\n       Whereas Lewis and Clark's Corps of Discovery produced \n     detailed journals with maps, charts, samples, and \n     descriptions of the previously undocumented western \n     geography, climate, plants, animals, and native cultures from \n     which the Nation continues to benefit today;\n       Whereas the Lewis and Clark Expedition marks a significant \n     benchmark in American history and a crucial step in securing \n     the claim and the eventual creation of all the States in the \n     Pacific Northwest;\n       Whereas the exploration of the western frontier of our \n     fledgling Nation was the great odyssey of America, symbolic \n     of the core values of teamwork, courage, perseverance, \n     science, and opportunity held by the United States;\n       Whereas, on October 30, 2004, President George W.

Res. 316\n\n       Whereas market-based policies and private sector leadership \n     have given the Internet the flexibility to evolve;\n       Whereas given the importance of the Internet to the global \n     economy, it is essential that the underlying domain name \n     system and technical infrastructure of the Internet remain \n     stable and secure;\n       Whereas the Internet was created in the United States and \n     has flourished under United States supervision and oversight, \n     and the Federal Government has followed a path of \n     transferring Internet control from the defense sector to the \n     civilian sector, including the Internet Corporation for \n     Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) with the goal of full \n     privatization;\n       Whereas the developing world deserves the access to \n     knowledge, services, commerce, and communication, the \n     accompanying benefits to economic development, education, and \n     health care, and the informed discussion that is the bedrock \n     of democratic self-government that the Internet provides;\n       Whereas the explosive and hugely beneficial growth of the \n     Internet did not result from increased government involvement \n     but from the opening of the Internet to commerce and private \n     sector innovation;\n       Whereas on June 30, 2005, President George W. Bush \n     announced that the United States intends to maintain its \n     historic role over the master ``root zone'' file of the \n     Internet, which lists all authorized top-level Internet \n     domains;\n       Whereas the recently articulated principles of the United \n     States on the domain name and addressing system of the \n     Internet (DNS) are that--\n       (1) the Federal Government will--\n       (A) preserve the security and stability of the DNS;\n       (B) take no action with the potential to adversely affect \n     the effective and efficient operation of the DNS; and\n       (C) maintain the historic role of the United States \n     regarding modifications to the root zone file;\n       (2) governments have a legitimate interest in the \n     management of country code top level domains (ccTLD);\n       (3) the United States is committed to working with the \n     international community to address the concerns of that \n     community in accordance with the stability and security of \n     the DNS;\n       (4) ICANN is the appropriate technical manager of the \n     Internet, and the United States will continue to provide \n     oversight so that ICANN maintains focus and meets its core \n     technical mission; and\n       (5) dialogue relating to Internet governance should \n     continue in multiple relevant fora, and the United States \n     encourages an ongoing dialogue with all stakeholders and will \n     continue to support market-based approaches and private \n     sector leadership;\n\n       Whereas the final report issued by the Working Group on \n     Internet Governance (WGIG), established by the United Nations \n     Secretary General in accordance with a mandate given during \n     the first World Summit on the Information Society, and \n     comprised of 40 members from governments, private sector, and \n     civil society, issued 4 possible models, 1 of which envisages \n     a Global Internet Council that would assume international \n     Internet governance;\n       Whereas that report contains recommendations for relegating \n     the private sector and nongovernmental organizations to an \n     advisory capacity;\n       Whereas the European Union has also proposed transferring \n     control of the Internet, including the global allocation of \n     Internet Protocol number blocks, procedures for changing the \n     root zone file, and rules applicable to DNS, to a ``new model \n     of international cooperation'' which could confer significant \n     leverage to the Governments of Iran, Cuba, and China, and \n     could impose an undesirable layer of politicized bureaucracy \n     on the operations of the Internet that could result in an \n     inadequate response to the rapid pace of technological \n     change;\n       Whereas some nations that advocate radical change in the \n     structure of Internet governance censor the information \n     available to their citizens through the Internet and use the \n     Internet as a tool of surveillance to curtail legitimate \n     political discussion and dissent, and other nations operate \n     telecommunications systems as state-controlled monopolies or \n     highly-regulated and highly-taxed entities;\n       Whereas some nations in support of transferring Internet \n     governance to an entity affiliated with the United Nations, \n     or another international entity, might seek to have such an \n     entity endorse national policies that block access to \n     information, stifle political dissent, and maintain outmoded \n     communications structures;\n       Whereas the structure and control of Internet governance \n     has profound implications for homeland security, competition \n     and trade, democratization, free expression, access to \n     information, privacy, and the protection of intellectual \n     property, and the threat of some nations to take unilateral \n     actions that would fracture the root zone file would result \n     in a less functional Internet with diminished benefits for \n     all people;\n       Whereas the Declaration of Principles of the First World \n     Summit on the Information Society, held in Geneva in 2003, \n     delegates from 175 nations declared the ``common desire and \n     commitment to build a people-centered, inclusive and \n     development oriented Information Society, where everyone can \n     create, access, utilize and share information and \n     knowledge'';\n       Whereas delegates at the First World Summit also \n     reaffirmed, ``as an essential foundation of the Information \n     Society, and as outlined in Article 19 of the Universal \n     Declaration of Human Rights, that everyone has the right to \n     freedom of opinion and expression'' and that ``this right \n     includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to \n     seek, receive and import information and ideas through any \n     media and regardless of frontiers'';\n       Whereas the United Nations Secretary General has stated the \n     objective of the 2005 World Summit on the Information Society \n     in Tunis is to ensure ``benefits that new information and \n     communication technologies, including the Internet, can bring \n     to economic and social development'' and that ``to defend the \n     Internet is to defend freedom itself''; and\n       Whereas discussions at the November 2005 World Summit on \n     the Information Society may include discussion of \n     transferring control of the Internet to a new \n     intergovernmental entity, and could be the beginning of a \n     prolonged international debate regarding the future of \n     Internet governance: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) calls on the President to continue to oppose any effort \n     to transfer control of the Internet to the United Nations or \n     any other international entity;\n       (2) applauds the President for--\n       (A) clearly and forcefully asserting that the United States \n     has no present intention of relinquishing the historic \n     leadership role the United States has played in Internet \n     governance;

THE UNITED STATES-CHINA ECONOMIC AND SECURITY REVIEW \n                   COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The 2004 Report to Congress of the United States-China \n     Economic and Security Review Commission states that--\n       (A) China's State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) lack adequate \n     disclosure standards, which creates the potential for United \n     States investors to unwittingly contribute to enterprises \n     that are involved in activities harmful to United States \n     security interests;\n       (B) United States influence and vital long-term interests \n     in Asia are being challenged\n\n[[Page S12858]]\n\n     by China's robust regional economic engagement and diplomacy;\n       (C) the assistance of China and North Korea to global \n     ballistic missile proliferation is extensive and ongoing;\n       (D) China's transfers of technology and components for \n     weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their delivery systems \n     to countries of concern, including countries that support \n     acts of international terrorism, has helped create a new tier \n     of countries with the capability to produce WMD and ballistic \n     missiles;\n       (E) the removal of the European Union arms embargo against \n     China that is currently under consideration in the European \n     Union would accelerate weapons modernization and dramatically \n     enhance Chinese military capabilities;\n       (F) China is developing a leading-edge military with the \n     objective of intimidating Taiwan and deterring United States \n     involvement in the Strait, and China's qualitative and \n     quantitative military advancements have already resulted in a \n     dramatic shift in the cross-Strait military balance toward \n     China; and\n       (G) China's growing energy needs are driving China into \n     bilateral arrangements that undermine multilateral efforts to \n     stabilize oil supplies and prices, and in some cases may \n     involve dangerous weapons transfers.\n       (2) On March 14, 2005, the National People's Congress \n     approved a law that would authorize the use of force if \n     Taiwan formally declares independence.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--\n       (1) Plan.--It is the sense of Congress that the President \n     should take immediate steps to establish a coherent and \n     comprehensive plan to address the emergence of China \n     economically, diplomatically, and militarily, to promote \n     mutually beneficial trade relations with China, and to \n     encourage China's adherence to international norms in the \n     areas of trade, international security, and human rights.\n       (2) Contents.--The plan should contain the following:\n       (A) Actions to address China's policy of undervaluing its \n     currency, including--\n       (i) encouraging China to continue to upwardly revalue the \n     Chinese yuan against the United States dollar;\n       (ii) allowing the yuan to float against a trade-weighted \n     basket of currencies; and\n       (iii) concurrently encouraging United States trading \n     partners with similar interests to join in these efforts.\n       (B) Actions to make better use of the World Trade \n     Organization (WTO) dispute settlement mechanism and \n     applicable United States trade laws to redress China's trade \n     practices, including exchange rate manipulation, denial of \n     trading and distribution rights, insufficient intellectual \n     property rights protection, objectionable labor standards, \n     subsidization of exports, and forced technology transfers as \n     a condition of doing business. The United States Trade \n     Representative should consult with our trading partners \n     regarding any trade dispute with China.\n       (C) Actions to encourage United States diplomatic efforts \n     to identify and pursue initiatives to revitalize United \n     States engagement in East Asia. The initiatives should have a \n     regional focus and complement bilateral efforts. The Asia-\n     Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) offers a ready \n     mechanism for pursuit of such initiatives.\n       (D) Actions by the administration to work with China to \n     prevent proliferation of prohibited technologies and to \n     secure China's agreement to renew efforts to curtail North \n     Korea's commercial export of ballistic missiles.\n       (E) Actions by the Secretaries of State and Energy to \n     consult with the International Energy Agency with the \n     objective of upgrading the current loose experience-sharing \n     arrangement whereby China engages in some limited exchanges \n     with the organization, to a more structured arrangement.\n       (F) Actions by the administration to develop a coordinated, \n     comprehensive national policy and strategy designed to \n     maintain United States scientific and technological \n     leadership and competitiveness, in light of the rise of China \n     and the challenges of globalization.\n       (G) Actions to review laws and regulations governing the \n     Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), \n     including exploring whether the definition of national \n     security should include the potential impact on national \n     economic security as a criterion to be reviewed, and whether \n     the chairmanship of CFIUS should be transferred from the \n     Secretary of the Treasury to a more appropriate executive \n     branch agency.\n       (H) Actions by the President and the Secretaries of State \n     and Defense to press strongly their European Union \n     counterparts to maintain the EU arms embargo on China.\n       (I) Actions by the administration to discourage foreign \n     defense contractors from selling sensitive military use \n     technology or weapons systems to China. The administration \n     should provide a comprehensive annual report to the \n     appropriate committees of Congress on the nature and scope of \n     foreign military sales to China, particularly sales by Russia \n     and Israel.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2536.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON LIMITATION ON TRANSFER OF \n                   UNITS FROM CLOSED AND REALIGNED MILITARY \n                   INSTALLATIONS PENDING READINESS OF RECEIVING \n                   LOCATIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       (1) The Commission on Review of Overseas Military Facility \n     Structure of the United States, also known as the Overseas \n     Basing Commission, transmitted a report to the President and \n     Congress on August 15, 2005, that discussed considerations \n     for the return to the United States of up to 70,000 service \n     personnel and 100,000 family members and civilian employees \n     from overseas garrisons.\n       (2) The 2005 Base Closure and Realignment Commission \n     released a report on September 8, 2005, to the President that \n     assessed the closure and realignment decisions of the \n     Department of Defense, which would affect 26,830 military \n     personnel positions.\n       (3) Both of these reports expressed concerns that massive \n     movements of units, service personnel, and families may \n     disrupt unit operational effectiveness and the quality of \n     life for family members if not carried out with adequate \n     planning and resources.\n       (4) The 2005 Base Closure and Realignment Commission, in \n     its decision to close Fort Monmouth, included a provision \n     requiring the Secretary of Defense to provide a report that \n     ``movement of organizations, functions, or activities from \n     Fort Monmouth to Aberdeen Proving Ground will be accomplished \n     without disruption of their support to the Global War on \n     Terrorism or other critical contingency operations, and that \n     safeguards exist to ensure that necessary redundant \n     capabilities are put in place to mitigate potential \n     degradation of such support, and to ensure maximum retention \n     of critical workforce''.\n       (5) The Overseas Basing Commission found that ``base \n     closings at home along with the return of yet additional \n     masses of service members and dependents from overseas will \n     have major impact on local communities and the quality of \n     life that can be expected. Movements abroad from established \n     bases into new locations, or into locations already in use \n     that will be put under pressure by increases in populations, \n     will impact on living conditions.''\n       (6) The Overseas Basing Commission notes that the four most \n     critical elements of quality of life as they relate to \n     restructuring of the global defense posture are housing, \n     military child education, healthcare, and service member and \n     family services.\n       (7) The Overseas Basing Commission recommended that \n     ``planners must take a `last day-first day' approach to the \n     movement of units and families from one location to \n     another'', meaning that they must maintain the support \n     infrastructure for personnel until the last day they are in \n     place and must have the support infrastructure in place on \n     the first day troops arrive in the new location.\n       (8) The Overseas Basing Commission further recommended that \n     it is ``imperative that the `last day-first day' approach \n     should be taken whether the movement is abroad from one \n     locale to another, from overseas to the United States, or \n     from one base in CONUS [the continental United States] to yet \n     another as a result of base realignment and closures''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the Secretary of Defense should not transfer any unit from a \n     military installation closed or realigned due to the \n     relocation of forces under the Integrated Global Presence and \n     Basing Strategy or the 2005 round of defense base closure and \n     realignment until adequate facilities and infrastructure \n     necessary to support the unit's mission and quality of life \n     requirements for military families are ready for use at the \n     receiving location.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2555.

The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of a Senate \nresolution commemorating the bicentennial of Lewis and Clark's \nremarkable arrival on the Pacific Coast. I am pleased that Senators \nMurray and Wyden are original cosponsors of the resolution.\n  Meriwether Lewis and William Clark's epic journey explored and \ncharted the western frontier of our fledgling Nation.\n  This journey was America's great odyssey. It marked our Nation's \ncoming of age and represents its core values: courage, innovation, \nperseverance, and opportunity.\n  And two centuries ago, they reached their destination. On Nov. 7 \n1805, William Clark wrote in this in his journal:\n\n       Great joy in camp, we are in View of the Ocean, this great \n     Pacific Ocean which we been so long anxious to See and the \n     roaring or noise made by the waves breaking on the rocky \n     Shores may be heard distinctly.\n\n  It's no wonder he was so excited. Their expedition began a year and \nhalf earlier and 4,000 meandering miles east.\n  President Thomas Jefferson had charged them with finding the most \ndirect, practical water route across the continent.\n\n[[Page S12870]]\n\n  When Clark wrote that they had seen the Pacific on that day, 200 \nyears ago, he was slightly off target. They were actually 25 miles \naway, in the Columbia's widening estuary.\n  Dangerous storms, wind, rain, and waves battered them without relent. \nThey were trapped for 6 days and forced to hunker down at the spot we \nnow call Clark's Dismal Nitch.\n  When the weather finally cleared, they moved west to Station Camp. \nThey set down for ten days and got their first real glimpse of the \nPacific.\n  Expedition-member Sgt. Patrick Gass wrote: ``We could see the waves, \nlike small mountains, rolling out in the ocean.''\n  Station Camp also marks the spot where Lewis and Clark held a \nhistoric democratic vote among all of the group's members--including \nSacagawea and the African American slave, York--to determine where the \nexpedition should stay for the winter.\n  On November 19, William Clark took 11 expedition members from Station \nCamp on an excursion beyond camp, and for the first time saw a full \nview of the Pacific Ocean.\n  That land, now called Cape Disappointment, marks the westernmost \npoint of their journey. Its name belies the great hope and joy that \nmoment inspired in our travel-worn heroes.\n  Today, in Washington State, you can visit these historic locations \nand find that hope again. Dismal Nitch, Station Camp, Cape \nDisappointment: In addition to Oregon's Fort Clatsop and other nearby \nstate parks, they comprise America's newest national park.\n  I introduced legislation with Representative Brian Baird to create \nthe Lewis and Clark National Historic Park: to preserve those beautiful \nand precious lands, to build local tourism, and to educate future \ngenerations.\n  Last November, President Bush signed it into law. This November, we \ncelebrate an incredible bicentennial.\n  Lewis and Clark produced the first maps and charts of a previously \nundocumented region.\n  They created an invaluable record of the native cultures, the flora, \nand the fauna they encountered on their journey.\n  Prior to the expedition, the United States' claim to the Pacific \nNorthwest, was tenuous at best, based on American sea captain Robert \nGray's discovery of the Columbia River in 1792.\n  And so: Lewis and Clark's expedition, more than a decade later, was \ncrucial to securing the claim. It was crucial to the eventual creation \nof all the States in the Pacific Northwest.\n  More fundamentally though: their task was to explore the unknown. In \ndoing so, they expanded the boundaries of our Nation and pushed the \nlimits of what we were capable, as a people.\n  It was not easy for them; it rarely is. But many have come after \nLewis and Clark. Inspired by their spirit, we have transformed our \ngreat Nation many times over in those 200 years.\n  We would be wise to turn to Lewis and Clark again, as we confront so \nmany critical challenges before us today.\n  Only by truly reaching beyond our grasp, can we make our Nation \ngreat, as Thomas Jefferson said: ``from Sea to Shining Sea.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and any statements relating thereto be printed in the \nRecord, without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 315) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 315\n\n       Whereas, on January 18, 1803, President Thomas Jefferson \n     began an extraordinary journey by sending a secret message to \n     Congress requesting approval and funding to establish the \n     ``Corps of Volunteers for Northwest Discovery'' to explore \n     the most direct and practical water route across the \n     continent of the United States all the way to the Pacific \n     Ocean;\n       Whereas, on May 14, 1804, the journey up the Missouri River \n     and across the vast and newly acquired Louisiana Territory \n     began at Camp Dubois, Illinois, led by Captain Meriwether \n     Lewis and Second Lieutenant William Clark;\n       Whereas after a long year and a half and 4,133 arduous \n     miles, the expedition endured a dangerous storm of wind, \n     rain, and waves for 6 days at Clark's Dismal Nitch;\n       Whereas, on November 13, 1805, the Corps of Discovery moved \n     further west to Station Camp and beheld their first \n     comprehensive view of the Pacific Ocean, and thereby began \n     the realization of the vision of President Jefferson of a \n     country ``from sea to shining sea'';\n       Whereas Station Camp also marks the occurrence of a \n     historical democratic vote to determine where to stay for \n     winter that included all members of the expedition, including \n     Sacagawea, an Indian woman, and York, an African American \n     slave;\n       Whereas, on November 19, 1805, Clark and 11 of his men set \n     out on an ocean excursion, hiking 25 miles to Cape \n     Disappointment to get a complete view of the Pacific Ocean \n     and reach the furthest western point of the expedition;\n       Whereas the expedition built their winter camp on the south \n     side of the Columbia River at Fort Clatsop, Oregon, named in \n     honor of the friendly local Clatsop Indians, and the 33 \n     member party spent 106 days among lush old-growth forest, \n     wetlands, and wildlife preparing for their long journey back \n     to St. Louis, Missouri;\n       Whereas Lewis and Clark's Corps of Discovery produced \n     detailed journals with maps, charts, samples, and \n     descriptions of the previously undocumented western \n     geography, climate, plants, animals, and native cultures from \n     which the Nation continues to benefit today;\n       Whereas the Lewis and Clark Expedition marks a significant \n     benchmark in American history and a crucial step in securing \n     the claim and the eventual creation of all the States in the \n     Pacific Northwest;\n       Whereas the exploration of the western frontier of our \n     fledgling Nation was the great odyssey of America, symbolic \n     of the core values of teamwork, courage, perseverance, \n     science, and opportunity held by the United States;\n       Whereas, on October 30, 2004, President George W. Bush \n     signed into law legislation creating the Lewis and Clark \n     National Historical Park which preserves these 3 Washington \n     State sites integral to the dramatic arrival of the \n     expedition at the Pacific Ocean, and incorporates Fort \n     Clatsop of Oregon and important State parks for the benefit \n     and education of generations to come; and\n       Whereas, during November 2005, Washington and Oregon are \n     hosting, ``Destination: The Pacific'', a unique commemoration \n     of the 200 year anniversary of the arrival of the Corps of \n     Discovery in the Pacific Northwest: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commemorates the bicentennial anniversary of the \n     arrival of Lewis and Clark at the Pacific Ocean; and\n       (2) recognizes that by exploring the unknown frontier, \n     Lewis and Clark expanded the boundaries of our great Nation \n     and pushed the limits of what we are capable of as citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/15/senate-section/article/S12870-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RECOGNIZING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WHITE HOUSE FELLOWS PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

Res. 252\n\n       Whereas Zebulon Montgomery Pike was born January 5, 1779, \n     in Lamberton, New Jersey, to a military family, which quickly \n     was on the move across the Nation with Pike growing up on \n     frontier military posts;\n       Whereas Zebulon Montgomery Pike served the United States \n     with distinction, initially as a commissioned First \n     Lieutenant in the First Infantry Regiment of the United \n     States Army, later as a Captain, further as a Colonel of the \n     15th Regiment during the War of 1812, and ultimately as a \n     Brigadier General in 1813;\n       Whereas in July of 1806, Zebulon Montgomery Pike was given \n     the assignment of leading an expedition west from present-day \n     St. Louis, Missouri, up the Arkansas River to its source in \n     the highest of the Rocky Mountains, then into Colorado's San \n     Luis Valley;\n       Whereas Zebulon Montgomery Pike and his expedition traveled \n     through the present day states of Missouri, Nebraska, Kansas, \n     and Colorado observing the geography, natural history, and \n     population of the country through which he passed;\n       Whereas Zebulon Montgomery Pike and his expedition reached \n     the site of present day Pueblo, Colorado on November 23, \n     1806, and, fascinated with a blue peak in the Rocky Mountains \n     to the west, Pike set out to explore the mountain;\n       Whereas Zebulon Montgomery Pike was prevented from \n     completing the ascent due to waist-deep snow, inadequate \n     clothing, and sub-zero temperatures, and so chose to turn \n     back for the safety of his expedition;\n       Whereas Zebulon Montgomery Pike never set foot on ``Pike's \n     Peak'' but did contribute significantly to the interior \n     west's early exploration through the headwaters of the \n     Arkansas River;\n       Whereas Zebulon Montgomery Pike and his expedition found \n     the area of present day Great Sand Dunes National Park in \n     Colorado and the headwaters of the Rio Grande, which he \n     mistakenly thought was the Red River; and\n       Whereas on April 27, 1813, Zebulon Montgomery Pike died in \n     valiant service to his country, leading an attack on York, \n     later to become Toronto, during the War of 1812: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the year 2006 as the 200th anniversary of \n     Zebulon Montgomery Pike's discoveries throughout the American \n     West; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     and celebrate his contributions to our Nation's history with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities throughout the year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/15/senate-section/article/S12871-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HEROES EARNED RETIREMENT OPPORTUNITIES ACT\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.
