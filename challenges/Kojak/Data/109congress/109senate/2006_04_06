The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this morning, the time until 10:30 will be \nequally divided for debate prior to the vote on invoking cloture on the \nSpecter substitute to the border security bill. I now ask unanimous \nconsent that the final 20 minutes before the vote be divided so that \nthe Democratic leader has 10 minutes, to be followed by the majority \nleader for the final 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I don't believe that cloture will be \ninvoked today on the chairman's substitute. Therefore, we have two \nadditional cloture motions pending to the border security bill. There \nis a cloture motion to the Hagel-Martinez language that was offered \nyesterday and a cloture motion to the underlying border security bill. \nWe will announce the exact timing of those votes a little later as we \ngo through the morning and see how we progress. It is unfortunate that \nwe had to set up these procedural challenges, but given the lack of \nprogress and cooperation on getting amendments up and voted on, it was \nthe only way to move ahead.\n  We have very important Department of Defense nominations that have \nbeen pending on the calendar since last\n\n[[Page S3168]]\n\nyear. I have consulted with the Democratic leader, and I have scheduled \ncloture votes on those nominations this week to allow the Senate to \nvote on these important Department of Defense nominees.\n  Needless to say, we have a lot to do before the Easter-Passover \nadjournment.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am going to suggest the absence of a \nquorum so the leader and I may speak for a couple minutes before the \ndebate starts.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time on our side be divided between \nSenators Durbin, Leahy, and Kennedy, each 8 minutes; Senators Salazar \nand Menendez, each 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. It has already been suggested by the Republican leader that \nour time would follow the hour time that is allotted under the rule, a \nhalf hour on each side, and then I would speak, and then the \ndistinguished Republican leader would end the debate. Is that \nappropriate?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair is informed that the Senator \nfrom Nevada, the distinguished Democratic leader, has suggested more \ntime than is available to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 10 minutes \nfor me and the 10 minutes for the majority leader be under leader time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. And I ask unanimous consent that the time not start running \nuntil we finish our personal colloquy.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There is now 60 minutes equally divided. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, today the Senate has a historic \nopportunity with this cloture vote to move forward with tough, smart, \nand comprehensive immigration reform that secures our Nation's borders \nor to maintain the status quo of failed laws and a broken immigration \nsystem that is weak on enforcement and leaves our borders and our \ncitizens unsecured.\n  A vote for invoking cloture is a vote for an increase of 1,250 \nCustoms and Border Protection officers, 2,500 port-of-entry inspectors, \n1,000 personnel dedicated to the investigation of alien smuggling, \n25,000 investigators, 12,000 new Border Patrol agents, 10,000 worksite \nenforcement agents, 5,000 fraud detection agents, and the acquisition \nof 20 new detention facilities to accommodate at least 10,000 detainees \nto ensure that we have tightened our border security and workplace \nenforcement.\n  A vote for invoking cloture is a vote to create an equal playing \nfield and ensure that American workers' wages, benefits and health and \nsafety standards are not undercut.\n  A vote for invoking cloture is also a vote to realize the economic \nrealities in our society in which undocumented workers are bending \ntheir backs every day, picking the fruits and vegetables that end up on \nour kitchen tables, digging the ditches that lay the infrastructure for \nthe future, cleaning the hotel and motel rooms for our travelers, \nplucking the chicken or deboning the meat that we had for dinner last \nnight, and helping the aged, the sick and disabled meet their daily \nneeds.\n  This vote ensures that they are brought out of the darkness and into \nthe light of America's promise. A vote for invoking cloture is a vote \nto create the possibility for those who contribute to our country a \npathway to earn legalization--but only after they pay thousands of \ndollars in fines and fees, pass a criminal background check, go to the \nback of the line behind all applicants waiting for green cards, pay any \nand all back taxes, remain continuously employed going forward, pass a \nmedical exam, and learn English and U.S. History and Government.\n  A vote for cloture gives us greater security. But unlike the House \nbill, it doesn't criminalize innocent U.S. citizens--those, for \nexample, like Catholic Charities--who give advice to immigrants, like \nthose who give help to a rape victim or a battered woman. That is why I \nurge our colleagues to vote to invoke cloture on the Judiciary \nCommittee bill.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields \ntime? If no Senator seeks time, the time is charged against each side \nequally.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nduring the quorum call be equally divided, and I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \ninvoke cloture on the Specter substitute amendment. I do so because of \nseveral key reasons. First, the legislation that came out of the \nJudiciary Committee had broad bipartisan support. I think when you have \nthat kind of bipartisan support, it speaks to what we can do as a \nSenate when we reach across the aisle to try to find common ground. I \nthink the Judiciary Committee found that common ground.\n  Second, the bill addresses the key issues we should be addressing in \nthe Senate today. It addresses border security, which is critically \nimportant to us, that we deal with trying to strengthen our homeland \ndefenses and our national security. It addresses the issue of \nenforcement of immigration laws in our country. It also addresses the \neconomic and human realities of undocumented workers that we have in \nAmerica today.\n  It is a good bill from that perspective. It is a law and order bill. \nFor those on the other side who say this is amnesty, I reject that \nlabeling. It has penalties and registration that go along with the \nrequirement for those people who are undocumented and working in the \nUnited States.\n  Finally, no matter how this cloture vote goes--and I intend to vote \nfor cloture because it is a good bill, and I urge my colleagues to vote \nfor cloture--we need to continue to work on this issue because it is so \nimportant to the future of America. We have a reality in our country \ntoday; where we have broken borders and lawlessness, we need to restore \nsome order and regularity to our immigration system. This issue is too \nimportant for us to simply walk away.\n  I hope we will continue to work through this issue and come up with \nthe kind of wisdom that Solomon would bring to a very important \nnational issue, so we can get some kind of resolution that addresses \nthe concerns of all of those who are so affected by our immigration \nlaws.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I began this debate by praising the \nbipartisanship of the Judiciary Committee for reporting a comprehensive \nand realistic immigration bill to the Senate. I have said from the \noutset that Democratic Senators could not pass a good immigration bill \non our own. With fewer than 50 Democratic Senators, we will need the \nsupport of Republican Senators if the Senate is to make progress on \nthis important matter today.\n  With all the dramatic stagecraft of the last few days and the \nprotestations from the other side of the aisle it may seem surprising, \nbut the truth is that by invoking cloture on this bill, we move to \nconsideration of germane amendments. If the Kyl amendment is germane \nand pending, it would be in line for a vote. So much for all the \nbluster and false claims of Democratic obstruction we have heard. If \nRepublicans want to move forward on this debate, and get one step \ncloser to a vote on tough but fair immigration reform, they should \nsupport cloture. For the past few days, I have offered, and our \nleadership has offered, to take up a number of bipartisan amendments \nfor debate and votes that would have easily won the support of the \nSenate. It\n\n[[Page S3169]]\n\nwas Senator Kyl who objected to that progress.\n  Late last night, the Republican leader came to the floor to file a \nmotion that would require the Senate to send the immigration bill back \nto the committee. He immediately acted to ``fill the tree,'' a \nparliamentary procedure that means that none of us could offer \namendments, and he filed an immediate cloture motion.\n  So before any of us even saw the amendment, the Republican leader \nmade sure to prevent any Senator in this body from offering an \namendment of his or her own. It is somewhat ironic, after all of the \nposturing by Republicans over the past 2 days about the right of \nSenators to offer amendments and be heard, that the Republican Party \nhas returned full force to its standard practice of shutting out those \nwho might disagree. That is too bad, especially on a matter this \nimportant. We began with a high level of demonstrated bipartisanship. \nSenator Specter and I worked together to get a bill out that had a two-\nthirds majority of the Judiciary Committee, Republicans and Democrats, \nvoting for it.\n\n  The majority leader had set March 27 as the deadline for Judiciary \nCommittee action, and we met his deadline. I always understood that the \nmajority leader had committed to turn to the committee bill if we were \nable to meet his deadline. That is what I heard the Judiciary Committee \nchairman reiterate as we concluded our markup and heard him say, again, \nas the Senate debate began. The Democratic leader noted that we had \nagreed to proceed based on the assurances he had received that ``the \nfoundation of the Senate's upcoming debate on immigration policy will \nbe the bipartisan Committee bill.''\n  The majority leader had often spoken of allowing two full weeks for \nSenate debate of this important matter. Regrettably, what the majority \nleader said and what happened are not the same. The Senate did not \ncomplete work on the lobbying reform bill on schedule and that cut into \ntime for this debate. When the majority leader decided to begin the \ndebate with a day of discussion of the Frist bill, we lost more time. \nWe were left then with 1 week, not 2. We have lost time that could have \nbeen spent debating and adopting amendments when some Republicans \nwithheld consent from utilizing our usual procedures over the last \ndays. When the false and partisan charges of obstruction came from the \nother side, the Democratic leader filed a petition for cloture that I \nhope will bring successful action on a comprehensive, realistic and \nfair immigration bill.\n  So I regret that now, when we have a bill with strong bipartisan \nsupport, some would try to make this into a partisan fight. I fear that \nthey have succeeded in making a partisan fight over a bill that began \nas a bipartisan bill. I urge all Senators, Republicans, Democrats and \nthe Senate's Independent, to vote for cloture on the bipartisan \ncommittee bill and bring this debate to a successful conclusion so that \nwe can have a bill passed by the Senate by the end of this week.\n  This is an historic vote. It asks us whether the Senate is committed \nto forging real immigration reform. I urge all Senators to vote for \nreform by supporting this cloture motion on what is a bipartisan bill \nthat balances tough enforcement with human dignity.\n  Now, the Republican manager of the bill was right to take on the \nsmear campaign against the committee bill from opponents who falsely \nlabeled it amnesty. The committee bill is not an amnesty bill. \nPresident Reagan signed an amnesty bill in 1986. This is not. This is a \ntough bill with a realistic way to strengthen our security and border \nenforcement, while bringing people out of the shadows to earn \ncitizenship--not immediate citizenship; it still takes 11 years. They \nhave to pay fines, work, pay taxes, they have to learn English, and \nthen they have to swear allegiance to the United States. That is a long \nway from amnesty.\n  As the New York Times noted in an editorial, responding to those who \nfalsely smeared this as an amnesty bill, painting the word ``deer'' on \na cow and taking it into the woods does not make the cow into a deer. \nThis is something every deer hunter in Vermont knows.\n  It is most ironic to hear those in the Republican Congress talk about \namnesty and lack of responsibility. Their record over the last 6 years \nis a failure to require responsibility and accountability, or to serve \nas a check and balance. They are experts in amnesty, so they should \nknow this bill is not amnesty.\n  I was glad to hear the Republican leader begin to change his tune \nover this week and acknowledge that providing hard-working neighbors \nwith a path to citizenship is not amnesty. I have not had an \nopportunity to see, let alone review, the Republican instructions in \nthe motion filed late last night. I am advised that they now have a \nproposal to establish a path for citizenship for some of the \nundocumented. I guess other Republicans will falsely label that effort \nas ``amnesty for some.''\n  Tragically, however, the opponents of tough and smart comprehensive \nimmigration reform will not stop with smearing the bill. Some who have \nopposed it have used ethnic slurs with respect to outstanding Members \nof the Senate. I spoke about this yesterday, when I praised Senator \nSalazar. His family's is a distinguished record that should not need my \ndefense. I deplore the all-too-typical tactics of McCarthyism and \ndivision to which our opponents have resorted, again. This is an issue \nthat goes to the heart and soul and conscience of the Senate. When \npeople who disagree with Members of this body resort to ethnic or \nreligious slurs, we all ought to stand up and condemn it. I did so on \nthe floor of the Senate yesterday.\n  I recall the wisdom of Senator Ralph Flanders, the first one to have \nthe courage to stand up to Joseph McCarthy. We are now facing in this \ncountry a religious and ethnic McCarthyism. I wish one Republican would \nstand up--just one--and say they agree that we should not have such \nreligious and ethnic slurs on Members of the Senate just because of \ndisagreement with a position they have taken on the bill. Regrettably, \nno one did. It is beneath the dignity and honor of this great body and \nbeneath the dignity and honor of any Member of the body. I, again, \nthank Senator Salazar, Senator Menendez, Senator Obama, and Senator \nMartinez for their support of the committee bill and their \nparticipation in this debate.\n  The Specter-Leahy-Hagel substitute amendment that mirrors the \nJudiciary Committee bill confronts the challenging problem of how to \nfix our broken immigration system head on. It is strong on \nenforcement--stronger than the majority leader's bill. In some ways it \nis stronger than the bill passed by the House. It includes provisions \nadded by Senator Feinstein to make tunneling under our borders a \nfederal crime and increases the number of enforcement agents. It is \ntough on employer enforcement and tough on traffickers. But it is also \ncomprehensive and balanced. I have called it enforcement ``plus'' \nbecause it confronts the problem of the millions of undocumented who \nlive in the shadows. It values work and respects human dignity. It \nincludes guest worker provisions supported by business and labor and a \nfair path to earned citizenship over 11 years through fines, the \npayment of taxes, hard work and learning English that has the support \nof religious and leading Hispanic organizations. It includes the AgJOBS \nbill and the DREAM Act, the Frist amendment, the Bingaman enforcement \namendment, and the Alexander citizenship amendment.\n  Wisely, we have rejected the controversial provisions that would have \nexposed those who provide humanitarian relief, medical care, shelter, \ncounseling and other basic services to the undocumented to possible \nprosecution under felony alien smuggling provisions of the criminal \nlaw. And we have rejected the proposal to criminalize mere presence in \nan undocumented status in the United States, which would trap people in \na permanent underclass. Those provisions of the bill supported by \ncongressional Republicans have understandably sparked nationwide \nprotests because they are viewed as anti-Hispanic and anti-immigrant \nand are inconsistent with American values.\n\n  Our work on immigration reform has been called a defining moment in \nour history. The Senate, in its best moments, has been able to rise to \nthe occasion and act as the conscience to the\n\n[[Page S3170]]\n\nNation, in the best true interests of our Nation.\n  I hope that the Senate's work on immigration reform will be in \nkeeping with the best the Senate can offer the Nation. I hope that our \nwork will be something that would make not only my immigrant \ngrandparents proud--and I stand only one generation from my immigrant \ngrandparents--but a product that will make our children and \ngrandchildren proud as they look back on this debate. Now is the time \nand this is the moment for the Senate to come together to do its part \nand reject the calls to partisanship.\n  Now is the time to move forward with the bipartisan committee bill as \nour framework so that we can bring millions of people out of the \nshadows and end the permanent underclass status of so many who have \ncontributed so much. By voting for cloture, we will take a giant step \ntoward better protecting our security and borders and allowing the \nAmerican dream to become a reality for our hard-working neighbors. \nHistory will judge. The time is now.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous \nconsent that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Leahy). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I asked Senator Leahy to take my place in \nthe chair because I want to show that a Republican agrees with him, in \npart. I do support the statements made by the Senator from Vermont \nconcerning the derogatory statements that may have been made concerning \nany racial connections with this bill.\n  However, I cannot support cloture on the bill because it still \ncontains the provisions with regard to felons. The amendment we tried \nto vote on the other day, I am informed, is probably not possible to \nconsider if we vote cloture on this bill at this time. So I regret that \nI cannot support cloture. I stated that I would vote for cloture on the \nbill as it came from the Judiciary Committee. Under the circumstances, \nonce it was discovered, with the provisions with regard to prior \nconvictions for felonies, I supported that amendment the other day by \nvoting not to table it. I believe that amendment should be considered \nbefore we vote cloture on this bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I believe time has been allocated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 8 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Chair remind me when there is 2 minutes \nremaining?\n  Madam President, the Senate Judiciary Committee passed a strong \nbipartisan, comprehensive reform bill last week, and Members on this \nside of the aisle believe it deserves an up-or-down vote on its own \nterms. Unfortunately, we have gotten bogged down instead on procedural \nissues. But the vote we cast this morning for or against cloture is not \njust a procedural vote; the vote we cast today is a vote on how to \nreconcile America's history and its heritage as a nation of immigrants \nwith today's crisis of undocumented immigration.\n  It has been said many times--and it bears repeating--all in this room \nare descended from immigrants. Immigrants signed the Declaration of \nIndependence and they wrote the Constitution of these United States. \nImmigrants settled our frontiers, they built our great cities, and they \nfueled our industrial revolution.\n  Our history is a nation of immigrants, but that history has a dark \nside as well. Millions of Africans were brought here in chains, \nimmigrants in a technical sense, but forced for generations to labor as \nslaves, our great national shame. Millions of other immigrants fared \nonly slightly better: the Chinese coolies, who worked 18 to 20 hours a \nday to build our railroads under deplorable conditions; the Mexican \nbraceros, who were actively recruited by the United States Government \nto labor in our fields but were systematically denied fair payment for \ntheir work; and today the undocumented immigrants who are exploited at \nthe workplace and live with their families in constant fear of \ndetection and deportation.\n  For decades, this country has turned a blind eye to the plight of the \nstranger in our midst and looked away in indifference from this \ngrotesque system. But a nation of immigrants rejects its history and \nits heritage when millions of immigrants are confined forever to \nsecond-class status.\n  All Americans are debased by such a two-tier system. The vote we cast \ntoday is on whether the time has come to right these historic wrongs, \nand we will have that opportunity to do so with the underlying bill.\n  Over these past days, it has become apparent to Senator McCain, \nmyself, and the others who are in active support of this legislation \nthat adjustments are going to have to be made in that legislation to \ngain strong bipartisan support that will reflect greater than 60 votes \nin the Senate. I am convinced a majority in the Senate supports our \nparticular proposal.\n  As I have spoken on other occasions, this is a composite of different \nactions that is in the interest of our national security, our economic \nprogress, and our sense of humanity. But we understand adjustments have \nto be made, and over the last few days, Democrats and Republicans in \nthe leadership have been coming together to try and find common ground.\n  There are those who believe we ought to treat undocumented aliens as \na particular group and treat them all the same. There are others who \nsay those who have just arrived here should be treated differently and \nunder different circumstances. We have been attempting to adjust those \ndifferent views, and I believe we have made important progress in a way \nthat will maintain the integrity of the legislation but also will mean \nperhaps a somewhat longer period of time for adjusting of status or \nearning citizenship for those who have more recently arrived.\n  There has been a strong, good-faith effort on both sides to try and \nfind this common ground. I am very grateful for the leadership our \nleaders have provided on our side--Senator Reid, Senator Leahy, and \nothers who have worked in this endeavor. I thank my friend and \ncolleague Senator McCain and a number of his associates--Mel Martinez \nand a number of others--who have worked to try and move this process \nforward.\n  I hope the vote on cloture will be successful, but I recognize fully \nthat if we are not successful, it is going to open up a new opportunity \nfor us to finally realize the legislation which will essentially \npreserve the fundamental integrity of the approach Senator McCain and I \nhave taken. It will provide some differences, and out of accommodation \nand in the desire and interest to achieve the underlying thrust of this \nlegislation, I urge our colleagues to support those compromises. It is \nin our best interest. Then I am confident that we can, before the end \nof this week, report out legislation that will be comprehensive and \nwill meet the challenges of our time.\n  Finally, we have come together--Republicans and Democrats--in other \nmajor civil rights times. We came together in the 1960s with the 1964 \nCivil Rights Act, 1965 and 1968 Civil Rights Act. We all came together \non the Medicare and Medicaid proposals. We came together, as well, on \nhigher education legislation that made such a difference. And we came \ntogether on the Americans with Disabilities Act. We haven't had that \nkind of coming together in this body on a matter of national importance \nand international importance. We may very well be at that moment in the \nSenate. I am prayerful that will be the outcome and that we will have \nthat kind of achievement. We still have some hurdles to work through, \nbut I hope that will be the final and ultimate outcome.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n\n[[Page S3171]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 25 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I might say to my colleagues who would \nlike some time, we have 25 minutes. They are invited to come to the \nfloor and speak. I think we will have time to extend to a number of \nMembers.\n  I am pleased to note we have made some significant progress, although \nwe do not have the bill in a position yet where we know precisely where \nwe are heading, but it now appears we will be successful with the \naddition of the ideas which have been injected into the process by \nSenator Hagel and Senator Martinez.\n  We will be coming up on a cloture vote on the committee bill shortly. \nI would very much like to see the committee bill move forward, but I do \nnot think it is fair to have cloture on the committee bill without \ngiving Senators an opportunity to offer amendments.\n  We have been on this measure since last Wednesday, and we have had \nvery few amendments offered. The Senators--principally Republican \nSenators--who have come to the floor to offer amendments have been \nprevented from doing so by parliamentary rules. I acknowledge that \nthose who have stopped us from offering amendments are operating within \nthe rules, but I do not think within the spirit of the Senate, which is \nto have a committee bill, have it open for amendments, have the \namendments debated, and have the amendments voted on--that is the way \nthe Senate works, but that has not been the result here.\n  Had that been the case, had Senators been permitted to offer their \namendments in due course and have an opportunity to follow the \ncustomary procedure, then I would have been an advocate of cloture to \nmove the process along. But that has not been the case.\n  Unusual as it may seem for the chairman of the committee bill to \noppose cloture on that bill, that is the position I am taking because \nthere has not been an opportunity to vote on amendments.\n  We have, in any event, progressed beyond this point so that we now \nhave another bill which has been committed to the committee, and we are \nhaving a cloture vote in due course scheduled for tomorrow. Perhaps \nthat cloture vote could occur today; I don't know. But if we can see \nwhere we are heading, it would obviously be desirable to move the \nprocess along as promptly as possible.\n\n  The ideas advanced by Senator Hagel and Senator Martinez make changes \nin the committee bill by having a distinction between those who have \nbeen here for more than 5 years, where they will work for 6 years and \nbe entitled to a green card, contrasted with those who have been here \nfor less than 5 years but more than 2 years from the date of January 7, \n2004, which is the date established by the date President Bush made a \nmajor speech on advancing ideas on immigration reform. Those who have \nbeen in the country prior to January 7, 2004, but for less than 5 \nyears, will be on a slightly different track, where they can be here \nfor 6 years and have 1-year extensions, and their ability for green \ncards will depend upon the cap not having been reached so that they are \nat the end of the line, in any event, from those who have had their \napplications pending. Some of the nurse applications for visas from the \nPhilippines go back to 1983, and one of the additions made in the \ncommittee mark was to see to it that those 11 million undocumented \naliens would not come ahead of people who have been following the law \nand who have been in line.\n  There is another modification on the temporary workers--if the green \ncards are reduced from 400,000 to 325,000, with an effort being made \nnot to take away jobs from Americans, to limit that number to try to \nreflect the need for immigrant workers but to reduce it to that extent. \nWe are still working on some refinements so that if the unemployment \nrate is high in certain cities, the number of green cards may be \nreduced there; again, so that employers cannot bring in immigrant \nworkers where American workers are involved.\n  We have, obviously, a very complicated system, but the work has been \nprodigious. There have been quite a number of Democrats who have met \nwith quite a number of Republicans. My own view has been to try to be \nflexible. If I had my choice, I would have the original chairman's \nmark, the mark that I put down as chairman. But that was modified \nsignificantly in the committee, taking up other provisions of the \nMcCain-Kennedy bill, and other amendments which were offered. As \nchairman, I tried to structure an accommodation among all of the bills: \nthe Hagel bill, the McCain-Kennedy bill, the Kyl-Cornyn bill. We came \nvery close in the markup a week ago Monday to an accommodation somewhat \nsimilar to what we have reached now, but we couldn't make it in \ncommittee, so we have come forward with the committee bill. If I had my \nchoice, to repeat, I would want the chairman's mark. My second choice \nis the committee bill. I am not wildly enthusiastic about the changes \nmade in Hagel-Martinez. But where we are with the changes made by \nSenator Hagel and Senator Martinez is better than where we are now; it \nis better than no bill.\n  What we are dealing with here, as we inevitably and invariably do on \nlegislation, is finding the best compromise we can pass. The issue is \nwhether that bill is better than no bill. I think, for me, that bill is \ndecisively better than no bill.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, would the chairman yield for a question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Let me first thank the chairman for his due diligence. \nThere is no question that he has focused on this for a good many months \nand has tried to work us through a process of time and issue. The \nSenator is so right in talking about all of the complications involved: \nthe types of labor, qualifications, and all that is necessary to deal \nwith this in a responsible way, and to contain our borders and to \ncontrol them. And without that, no orderly process will ever happen \neffectively.\n  As the chairman knows, I have spent a good deal of time on this \nissue, somewhat focused on a segment of our economy in agriculture. To \nyour knowledge, as it relates to the compromise you are talking about \nthat may be struck and has taken form here in the last 24 hours, is the \nagricultural provisions that we--myself, working with a member of your \ncommittee, Senator Feinstein--worked to put in the bill that came out \nof committee, is that still the provision that is in place as we know \nit and as we would vote on it?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I respond to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Idaho in the affirmative. It is intact. The reduction in green \ncards and visas from 400,000 to 325,000 may impact on that to some \nextent. But the amendment which was offered by Senator Feinstein, who \nis on the committee and on which you were a collaborator--and I again \ncongratulate you on that, as I did in committee when we accepted the \namendment--is intact. It is a very important amendment, worked out very \ncarefully. You have been working on this for years--you can say how \nmany years--but it has been a very long haul.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the chairman for that response. Every employment \nsector is unique, and what we have found, and I think what the \ncommittee has found, is that agriculture, because of the type of labor \ninvolved, is kind of the entry door many of our migrant laborers come \nthrough, legal and illegal, and from that, if you will, learn and move \nto other segments of the economy.\n  So we tried to reflect that in the structure of the Feinstein \namendment to the bill, recognizing that other portions of the bill \nwould be different, and that the compromise that is being talked about, \nin my opinion, makes some sense as it relates to seniority and time and \nplace to work in a fair and responsible way. At the same time, it makes \nsure that we don't effectively damage these segments of the economy \nAmericans will not work in, choose not to work in, and that we find \nforeign nationals can and will and are very effective in their work \nthere.\n  I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 14 minutes on the Republican side.\n\n[[Page S3172]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Again, I invite my colleagues if they wish to comment to \ncome to the floor. There is time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this is a historic moment in the Senate. \nThese who are witnessing this debate may think it is just another \ndebate on another bill, but it is not. This is a debate that has been \nin the brewing--at least in the making, I should say--for decades. \nSenator Kennedy of Massachusetts has been speaking out about meaningful \nimmigration reform for decades. It has eluded us. There are times when \nwe have done temporary things of some value, but we have never come to \ngrips with the fact that the immigration laws in America have broken \ndown. We are in virtual chaos. Borders are out of control, employers \nare hiring people without adequate enforcement, and there are 11 \nmillion or 12 million amongst us who are in undocumented or illegal \nstatus, uncertain of their future.\n\n  This is controversial. We have to come to grips with it. But it is \nrare in the history of the Senate that we consider a bill that touches \nso many hearts and changes so many lives in America as this immigration \nreform. We are literally going to define America's future with this \nbill. We are going to make it clear whether we are going to hold to the \nvalues that have made us a great and diverse nation.\n  There are people amongst us, some you may see and not know--people \nyou sit next to in church; families who bring their children to school \nwith your children; the worker at the daycare center where you leave \nyour precious kids every morning; the practical nurse who is working at \na nursing home caring for your aging parent; the people who cooked your \nbreakfast this morning at the restaurant, who cleared the table; those \nwho will straighten your room after you leave the hotel--many of them \nyou may not know, but look closely. Many of them will be directly \naffected by what we do in this Senate Chamber. What we do will change \ntheir lives. What we do will give them a chance to come out of the \nshadows, to emerge from the fear of detection, to finally have a chance \nto be part of America. We don't make it easy for them. It is a long, \nhard process to move from where they are today to legal status \ntomorrow, but at least we are addressing it and doing it in an honest \nfashion.\n  This morning's vote on cloture is on a bill which I think is the best \napproach. That is why I will vote for cloture. Some will disagree. But \nwe know, even as I stand here, there is another agreement underway. It \nis promising. It embodies the basic principles of the bill that emerged \nfrom the Senate Judiciary Committee. That bill included the Kennedy-\nMcCain substitute, an approach which offers a pathway to legalization \nfor the millions who are here in America.\n  I salute Senator Specter who spoke before me. He was one of the four \nRepublicans who stood with eight Democrats to bring that bill out. It \nwas not a popular position on his side of the table. The majority of \nRepublicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee oppose this bill. When it \ncame to the floor, the leaders on the Republican side of the Senate \ncondemned the bill. Yet today we find ourselves in a much different \nplace.\n  I give special credit to my leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada. In \nthe beginning of this week he said, We are going to stand fast for the \nvalues and principles of this bipartisan bill. He has taken a lot of \nheat on the floor of the Senate and outside, resisting amendments that \nwould cripple and destroy this process and derail our efforts to \nfinally have comprehensive immigration reform. Were it not for Senator \nHarry Reid on the Democratic side of this aisle standing fast, I don't \nknow that we could have reached the point we have reached today. But we \nhave reached it, and it tells me that we finally have come together in \na bipartisan fashion to deal with an issue that affects so many \nmillions across this country.\n  It is not over. Even if the cloture vote, as we call it in the \nSenate, passes tomorrow on the compromise, this can still be derailed. \nThere are still Senators, primarily on the other side of the aisle, \ndetermined to derail this agreement. They will offer crippling, \ndevastating amendments. We need to stand fast on a bipartisan basis to \nresist those amendments. Those who pledge their fealty to this bill can \nprove it with their votes. Don't say you are for it today and vote for \na devastating amendment tomorrow.\n  Secondly, what we decide here will go to a conference with the House. \nThe House approach is so different and it is so wrong. The House \nRepublican immigration bill by Chairman Sensenbrenner does not reflect \nAmerican values. To say that 12 million amongst us will be branded as \nfelons under the Federal law, to say that Good Samaritans, nurses and \nteachers and volunteers and people of faith, will be charged as \ncriminals under the Federal law is unthinkable and unacceptable and is \nnot consistent with American values. We will walk into a conference \nwith that point of view among the House Republicans. If we do not hold \nfast to our belief that we need a bill that is fair, a bill that is \nhonest and tough, a bill that is consistent with American values, we \nwill come back with a terrible outcome.\n  We need a commitment from the Republican majority in the Senate that \nwe will not even consider a conference report that moves in the \ndirection of the Sensenbrenner bill in the House. That is unacceptable. \nIt is unacceptable for us to criminalize millions of people.\n  With that commitment, and if we stand true to the values of McCain-\nKennedy and the bill produced by the Senate Judiciary Committee, we \nwill finally bring our neighbors and those who live amongst us out of \nthe shadows.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nTexas, Senator Cornyn.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I rise to speak in opposition to closing \noff debate on the underlying bill. We have heard at great length how \nthe opportunity to file and argue and have votes on amendments has been \neffectively denied by the Democratic leader. It would be a travesty \nand, indeed, it would be a farce for the Senate to close off debate \nbefore we have even had that debate on the substance of this bill.\n  Why it is that the Democratic leader and others who might vote to \nclose off debate would want to deny the Senate an opportunity to \nexclude felons from the scope of the amnesty provided by this bill is \nbeyond me. Why it is that there could be those who would want to deny \nAmerican workers the protection of a fluctuating cap on temporary work \npermits such that American citizens would not be put out of work \nbecause those who have come to the country in violation of our \nimmigration laws and would be given a guaranteed path to American \ncitizenship is beyond me. Why it is we would want to deny countries \nsuch as Mexico and the Central American countries the opportunity to \ndevelop their own economies and to provide opportunities for their own \ncitizens so that fewer and fewer of them would have to engage in part \nof the mass exodus from those countries to the United States, leaving \nthose countries hollowed out and unable to economically sustain \nthemselves and create opportunities for their own citizens, is beyond \nme.\n\n  I understand there are those, on both sides of the aisle, who happen \nto like the Judiciary Committee bill that is the subject of this \ncloture motion. While there are portions of the bill I like very much, \nparticularly those which have to do with border security, we know that \nthe bill as yet still does not have a worksite verification provision, \nto my knowledge. My understanding is, because of jurisdictional \nconflicts, the Judiciary Committee could not complete work on that \nportion of the bill, and that is within the exclusive jurisdiction of \nthe Finance Committee. We are still waiting for that title III to this \nbill to come to the floor and be offered as an amendment and be made \npart of this legislation. Without a worksite verification requirement, \nthis bill will not work, notwithstanding how much we do at our borders, \nwhich is very important.\n  This bill will not work unless we make sure that only people who come \nforward and submit themselves to background checks and we know are not \ncriminals or terrorists and we know in fact they are qualified and \neligible workers--unless we have a system\n\n[[Page S3173]]\n\nin place to make sure of that, this will not work and we will not have \ndone everything we can and should do to make sure this bill will work.\n  Indeed, in 1986, as part of the amnesty that was signed in that year, \nthe quid pro quo for the amnesty of some 3 million people was an \neffective worksite verification program and employer sanctions for \nthose employers who cheat and hire people on the black market of human \nlabor.\n  We know, because the Federal Government failed to provide that \neffective Federal Government worksite verification program, that now we \nare dealing with approximately 12 million people who have come here in \nviolation of our immigration laws, and we are confronted with the \nmonumental challenge of how to address those 12 million in a way that \nboth respects our legacy as a nation that believes in the rule of law \nwhile we continue to celebrate our heritage as a nation that believes \nwe are indeed a nation of immigrants and better for it.\n  This is not the Senate working according to its finest traditions. \nThe only way the Senate works is if each Senator has an opportunity to \ndebate and to argue and to offer amendments. We understand not all of \nthe amendments will be accepted. I am happy--maybe not happy, but I am \nwilling to accept the fact that there may be amendments I will offer \nthat will not be successful. But that is the way the committee process \nworked under Chairman Specter in the Judiciary Committee. Each of us \nhad a chance to have our say, to offer amendments, and to have a vote. \nThat is the way democracy works. But the idea that we will somehow try \nto jam this bill through here without Senators having a chance to \ndebate and vote on amendments is a farce. I hope my colleagues will not \nsupport it and that they will vote against cloture so we may offer \nthose amendments and have the kind of debate and process that \nrepresents the finest traditions of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes has expired.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I would like to take a minute only. I \nwould like the record to reflect I am speaking as in morning business \nfor that minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. CRAIG are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, in the absence of any other Republican \nSenator who seeks time to speak on the pending issue, I yield to myself \n5 minutes as in morning business to talk about two Judiciary Committee \nbills.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter pertaining to the introduction of S. 2557 \nand S. 2560 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I began this debate by praising the \nbipartisanship of the Judiciary Committee for reporting a comprehensive \nand realistic immigration bill to the Senate. I have said from the \noutset that Democratic Senators could not pass a good immigration bill \non our own. With fewer than 50 Democratic Senators, we will need the \nsupport of Republican Senators if the Senate is to make progress on \nthis important matter today.\n  With all the dramatic stagecraft of the last few days, and the \nprotestations from the other side of the aisle, it may seem surprising, \nbut the truth is that by invoking cloture on this bill we move to \nconsideration of germane amendments. If the Kyl amendment is germane \nand pending, it would be in line for a vote. So much for all the \nbluster and false claims of Democratic obstruction we have heard. If \nRepublicans want to move forward on this debate and get one step closer \nto a vote on tough but fair immigration reform, they should support \ncloture. For the past few days, I have offered and our leadership has \noffered to take up a number of bipartisan amendments for debate and \nvotes that would have easily won the support of the Senate. It was \nSenator Kyl who objected to that progress.\n  Late last night, the Republican leader came to the floor to file a \nmotion that would require the Senate to send the immigration bill back \nto the committee. He immediately acted to ``fill the tree'' with a \nseries of amendments and filed an immediate cloture motion. So before \nany of us even saw the amendment, the Republican leader made sure to \nstop every other Senator from offering any amendment. How ironic, after \nall the posturing by Republicans over the last 2 days about the rights \nof Senators to offer amendments and be heard, the majority party has \nreturned full force to its standard practices. That is too bad, \nespecially on a matter this important and on which we began with such a \nhigh level of demonstrated bipartisanship.\n  The majority leader had set March 27 as the deadline for Judiciary \nCommittee action, and we met his deadline. I always understood that the \nmajority leader had committed to turn to the committee bill if we were \nable to meet his deadline. That is what I heard the Judiciary Chairman \nreiterate as we concluded our markup and heard him say, again, as the \nSenate debate began. The Democratic leader noted that we had agreed to \nproceed based on the assurances he had received that ``the foundation \nof the Senate's upcoming debate on immigration policy will be the \nbipartisan committee bill.''\n  The majority leader had often spoken of allowing 2 full weeks for \nSenate debate of this important matter. Regrettably, what the majority \nleader said and what happened are not the same. The Senate did not \ncomplete work on the lobbying reform bill on schedule and cut into time \nfor this debate. When the majority leader decided to begin the debate \nwith a day of discussion of the Frist bill, we lost more time. We were \nleft then with 1 week, not 2. We have lost time that could have been \nspent debating and adopting amendments when some Republicans withheld \nconsent from utilizing our usual procedures over the last days. When \nthe false and partisan charges of obstruction came from the other side, \nthe Democratic leader filed a petition for cloture that I hope will \nbring successful action on a comprehensive, realistic, and fair \nimmigration bill.\n  I regret that over the last 3 days some tried to make this into a \npartisan fight. I fear they have succeeded. I urge all Senators, \nRepublicans and Democrats, and the Senate's Independent, to vote for \ncloture on the bipartisan committee bill, to bring this debate to a \nhead and a successful conclusion, in the time and on the terms set by \nthe majority leader. If we are to pass a bipartisan bill by the end of \nthis week, we will need to join together to support cloture on the \nbipartisan committee bill, proceed to work our way through the \nremaining amendments and pass the bill.\n  This is a historic vote on whether the Senate is committed to making \nreal immigration reform. I urge all Senators to vote for reform by \nsupporting this cloture motion on the bipartisan bill that balances \ntough enforcement with human dignity.\n  The Republican manager of the bill was right to take on the smear \ncampaign against the committee bill from opponents who falsely labeled \nit amnesty. The committee bill on which cloture is being sought is not \nan amnesty bill but a tough bill with a realistic way to strengthen our \nsecurity and border enforcement while bringing people out of the \nshadows to have them earn citizenship over the course of 11 years \nthrough fines and work and paying taxes and learning English and \nswearing allegiance to the United States. As The New York Times noted \nin a recent editorial, painting the word ``deer'' on a cow and taking \nit into the woods does not make the cow into a deer.\n  It is most ironic to hear those in the majority of the Republican \nCongress talk about amnesty and lack of accountability. Their record \nover the last 6 years is a failure to require responsibility and \naccountability or to serve as a check or balance. They are experts in \namnesty and should know that this bill is not amnesty.\n  I was glad to hear the Republican leader begin to change his tune \nthis weekend and to acknowledge that providing hardworking neighbors \nwith a path to citizenship is not amnesty. I have not had an \nopportunity to see, let alone review, the Republican instructions in \nthe motion filed late last\n\n[[Page S3174]]\n\nnight. I am advised that they would establish a path to citizenship for \na segment of the undocumented. I guess other Republicans will falsely \nlabel that effort as ``amnesty for some.''\n  Tragically, however, the opponents of tough and smart comprehensive \nimmigration reform do not stop with smearing the bill. They have also \nused ethnic slurs with respect to outstanding Members of this Senate. I \nspoke yesterday to praise Senator Salazar. His family has a \ndistinguished record that should not need my defense. I deplore the \nall-too-typical tactics of McCarthyism and division to which our \nopponents have resorted, again. I wish someone on the other side of the \naisle had shown the wisdom of Ralph Flanders and joined with me in \ncriticism of such tactics. Regrettably, no one did. I, again, thank \nSenator Salazar, Senator Menendez, Senator Obama, and Senator Martinez \nfor their support of the committee bill and their participation in this \ndebate.\n  The Specter-Leahy-Hagel substitute amendment that mirrors the \nJudiciary Committee bill confronts the challenging problem of how to \nfix our broken immigration system head on. It is strong on \nenforcement--stronger than the majority leader's bill. In some ways it \nis stronger than the bill passed by the House. It includes provisions \nadded by Senator Feinstein to make tunneling under our borders a \nFederal crime and increases the number of enforcement agents. It is \ntough on employer enforcement and tough on traffickers. But it is also \ncomprehensive and balanced. I have called it enforcement ``plus'' \nbecause it confronts the problem of the millions of undocumented who \nlive in the shadows. It values work and respects human dignity. It \nincludes guest worker provisions supported by business and labor and a \nfair path to earned citizenship over 11 years through fines, the \npayment of taxes, hard work, and learning English that has the support \nof religious and leading Hispanic organizations. It includes the Ag \nJOBS bill and the DREAM Act, the Frist amendment, the Bingaman \nenforcement amendment, and the Alexander citizenship amendment.\n  Wisely, we have rejected the controversial provisions that would have \nexposed those who provide humanitarian relief, medical care, shelter, \ncounseling, and other basic services to the undocumented to possible \nprosecution under felony alien smuggling provisions of the criminal \nlaw. And we have rejected the proposal to criminalize mere presence in \nan undocumented status in the United States, which would trap people in \na permanent underclass. Those provisions of the bills supported by \ncongressional Republicans have understandably sparked nationwide \nprotests being viewed as anti-Hispanic and anti-immigrant and are \ninconsistent with American values.\n  Our work on immigration reform has accurately been called a defining \nmoment in our history. The Senate, in its best moments, has been able \nto rise to the occasion and act as the conscience of the Nation, in the \nbest true interests of our Nation. I hope that the Senate's work on \nimmigration reform will be in keeping with the best the Senate can \noffer the Nation. I hope that our work will be something that would \nmake my immigrant grandparents proud, and a product that will make our \nchildren and grandchildren proud as they look back on this debate.\n  Now is the time and this is the moment for the Senate to come \ntogether to do its part and to reject the calls to partisanship. Now is \nthe time to move forward with the committee bill as our framework so \nthat we can bring millions of people out of the shadows and end the \npermanent underclass status of so many who have contributed so much. By \nvoting for cloture we will take a giant step toward better protecting \nour security and borders and allowing the American dream to become a \nreality for our hard-working neighbors. History will judge, and the \ntime is now.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I will vote in favor of cloture on the \nJudiciary Committee substitute to S. 2454, the immigration bill that is \npending. This substitute is not a perfect bill, but it is a good bill, \nand I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  This is a defining moment for America. Our immigration system is \nbroken, and it is up to us to fix it.\n  Congress can choose from several paths. We can build a wall around \nour country and make felons of millions of people who are undocumented \nor who have provided humanitarian assistance to the undocumented. That \nis the path the House bill would take, and I believe it is a path that \nis fundamentally inconsistent with our Nation's history and values.\n  But we have another option, a better option. We can recognize that we \nneed a comprehensive, pragmatic approach that strengthens border \nsecurity but also brings people out of the shadows and ensures that our \nGovernment knows who is entering this country for legitimate reasons, \nso we can focus our efforts on finding those who want to do us harm. \nThat is the Judiciary Committee substitute, and that is the path I \nbelieve we must choose.\n  First of all, we can and must bolster our efforts at the borders and \nprevent terrorists from entering our country. We absolutely must work \nto curb illegal immigration, and I am pleased that the Judiciary \nCommittee substitute contains strong provisions in this area. But it \nwould be fiscally irresponsible to devote more and more Federal dollars \nto border security without also creating a realistic immigration system \nto allow people who legitimately want to come to this country to go \nthrough legal channels to do so.\n  Right now, there are roughly 11 million to 12 million individuals \nhere illegally. The United States issues only 5,000 employment-based \nimmigrant visas each year for nonseasonal, low-skilled jobs. This is \nnowhere near the number of jobs that are available but not filled by \nAmerican workers. More than anything else, this lack of available visas \nexplains why we face such an influx of undocumented workers. These are \nthe facts, and our immigration policy must deal with them.\n  Improving our border security alone will not stem the tide of people \nwho are willing to risk everything, even their lives, in order to enter \nthis country. According to a recent Cato Institute report, the \nprobability of catching an illegal immigrant has fallen over the past \ntwo decades from 33 percent to 5 percent, despite the fact that we have \ntripled the number of border agents and increased the enforcement \nbudget tenfold. If we focus exclusively on enforcement, our immigration \nsystem will remain broken, and I fear we will have wasted Federal \ndollars.\n  We need a new solution. We need to improve security at our borders \nand create a system that allows law-abiding noncitizens to enter the \ncountry legally to work when there is truly a need for their labor and \nthat deals with the ``shadow population'' of illegal immigrants who are \nalready here. And that is why business groups, labor unions and \nimmigrant's rights groups have all come together to demand \ncomprehensive immigration reform.\n  There has been a lot of talk in this debate about ``amnesty.'' Let's \nbe perfectly clear: Not one Senator who supports this committee \nsubstitute has suggested giving undocumented aliens blanket amnesty. \nThe committee substitute would require undocumented aliens to show work \nhistory, satisfy background checks, pay fines, fulfill English language \nand civics requirements, and wait at the back of the line in order to \nobtain permanent status. In other words, people who come forward and \nplay by the rules would be able to earn--not automatically receive but \nearn--a path to permanent status.\n  It is easy to argue that those who came here illegally should be sent \nback to their home countries and that to do otherwise would be an \naffront to the rule of law. But even Homeland Security Secretary \nMichael Chertoff acknowledged to the Judiciary Committee last fall that \nit is impractical, not to mention astronomically expensive, to suggest \nthat we just deport 11 million or 12 million people. We have to grapple \nwith the complex reality in which we find ourselves, and it is not \nrealistic or productive to suggest that mass deportations are a \nsolution.\n  Another provision of this substitute creates a guest worker program \nthat allows employers in the future to turn to foreign labor but only \nwhen they cannot find American workers to do the job. This will help \navoid a future flow of undocumented workers. Our laws must acknowledge \nthe reality that American businesses need access to foreign workers for \njobs they cannot\n\n[[Page S3175]]\n\nfill with American workers. In my home State, I have heard from many \nbusiness owners, including a number whose businesses go back for \ngenerations, about the need for Congress to fix our broken immigration \nsystem because they cannot find American workers. These hard-working \nAmerican business owners desperately want to follow the rules and \ncannot fathom why Congress has dragged its feet on this issue for so \nlong. Whether it is tourism or farming or landscaping, our businesses \nwill continue to suffer if we fail to enact meaningful, comprehensive, \nlong-term immigration reform. But once we do, we also need to do a \nbetter job of enforcing our immigration laws in the workplace.\n  While the committee substitute recognizes the need for foreign \nworkers, the new guest worker program also includes strong labor \nprotections to ensure that foreign labor does not adversely affect \nwages and working conditions for U.S. workers. We must not create a \nsecond class of workers subject to lower wages and fewer workplace \nprotections. That would hurt all workers because it drives down wages \nfor everyone. Foreign workers who have paid their dues should be \ntreated fairly and deserve the protections of all working Americans.\n  For all of these reasons, I support the core immigration reform \nprovisions of the committee substitute. I also want to mention two \npieces of legislation included in the committee substitute that I \nstrongly support.\n  The first is the DREAM Act. Regardless of what you might think about \nother aspects of immigration reform, we have to recognize that there \nare people affected by this debate with little say in the decisions \nthat affect their lives--undocumented children. Many of these children \nhave lived in this country for most of their lives and have worked hard \nin school. Yet due to their undocumented status, their long-term \noptions are greatly limited. These children live with the threat of \ndeportation and without access to crucial financial resources, making \nit virtually impossible to pursue the college education that would \nenable them to contribute more fully to our society. We should not \npunish children for their parent's actions, and we should not deny \nchildren who have worked hard the opportunity to live up to their \npotential. That is why I am a longtime supporter of the DREAM Act and \nwhy I am so pleased it was accepted as an amendment during the \nJudiciary Committee proceedings on this bill. This provision will allow \nchildren who are long-term U.S. residents, who have graduated high \nschool, who have good moral character, and who simply want to further \ntheir contribution to our society, to pursue a higher education or \nenlist in the military. Under this provision, States could grant \ninstate tuition to such students, and it would also establish an earned \nadjustment mechanism by which these young people could adjust to a \nlegal status.\n  I am also pleased that the AgJOBS legislation is included in this \nsubstitute. It is a tribute to Senator Craig, Senator Feinstein, and \nSenator Kennedy that we were able to reach a compromise on AgJOBS that \nthe committee voted to include. This crucial legislation will enable \nundocumented agricultural workers to legalize their status and would \nreform the H2-A agricultural worker visa program so that in the future, \ngrowers and workers will not continue to rely on illegal channels.\n  I wish to mention that I was pleased the Judiciary Committee accepted \nan amendment that I offered, to ensure that people whose naturalization \npetitions are denied by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services can \nseek judicial review. Citizenship decisions have historically been a \njudicial function, and it would have been a real disservice to our \nNation's traditions to prevent individuals who have worked hard to \nbecome U.S. citizens to be denied that most central privilege without a \njudge's review of the decision.\n  Of course, this bill is not perfect. It contains some very troubling \nprovisions. I do not think that the National Crime Information Center \ndatabase, which is the central criminal database used by local, State \nand Federal agencies around the country, should include civil \nimmigration violations, and the International Association of Chiefs of \nPolice has also expressed concerns about this. I also have concerns \nabout other provisions in title II of the bill that require excessive \ndeference to executive agency decisionmaking in immigration cases and \nthat expand the categories of individuals subject to the most draconian \nimmigration consequences.\n  But overall, this is a good bill. I believe that if the Senate \ninvokes cloture on, and ultimately passes, the Judiciary Committee \nsubstitute or something similar to it, we will be well on our way to \nfixing our broken immigration system. We will have chosen the right \npath.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, how much more time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 1 minute 40 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I reserve the remainder of the time and yield the floor. \nI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, baseball season is upon us. Tomorrow, my \nfriend, Hall of Fame to be pitcher Greg Maddux will pitch. With 11 more \nvictories, he will be in the top 10 of all baseball players who have \never pitched in the Major Leagues. He needs to win 11 more games this \nyear.\n  The reason I mention this is what we are doing here in the Senate is \nnot a baseball game but, in spite of that, the American people are \nlooking for a win. There is no question to this point the Senate has \nnot pitched a perfect game, but I will say that the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee has done a great deal. They have, in effect, loaded the \nbases. The Senate Judiciary Committee has loaded the bases. We have the \nbases loaded, and now the Senate is up to bat. We need to get a hit. If \nwe get a hit, we drive in a run, it is over, and the American people \nhave won.\n  We have to remember what we are voting on. We are voting to keep \nmoving forward on a good, strong, bipartisan bill that will secure our \nborders. No matter how many people come and talk, how many speeches \nthey give, the fact is that is what it is all about. We, the minority, \nbelieve we owe it to the American people to keep moving forward on \nlegislation that will keep us safe.\n  Some Republicans disagree with that. It is very clear from the debate \nthat has taken place. I can only guess they intend to kill this \nimmigration debate and move on to other matters. That is unfortunate. \nIf that happens, the Senate's inability to secure our borders and fix \nour immigration system will be the Republican's burden to bear.\n  The one question I ask throughout all this: Where is President Bush? \nOn an issue which is this important, I haven't seen his congressional \nliaison working the halls the way they do on the budget matters or they \nwill later today or early when we come back after a break on \nreconciliation. I haven't seen them here. I haven't seen the Vice \nPresident over in his little office here, calling people in, saying \nthis is what we need to do for the country. On immigration, the \nPresident has been silent.\n  After this vote, which will take place in just a few minutes, I hope \nthe President will become engaged in what is going on here and join in \nthe move to pass important immigration legislation.\n\n  Everyone says that they support immigration reform. In a matter of \nminutes, we are going to vote, and we have been told that all the \nmajority is going to vote against cloture. That is too bad because the \nbill before us is, as I indicated, a good bill. This legislation is \nimportant. It will be a blow to America if this vote is blocked.\n  For the last 2 weeks, we have enjoyed some rare bipartisan moments in \nthe Senate. We have seen Democrats and Republicans on the Judiciary \nCommittee work together on one of the greatest national security issues \nwe have ever faced. The bipartisan spirit has resulted in a strong bill \nthat was supported by half the Republicans and all the Democrats on the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  This bill isn't perfect, but it takes a comprehensive approach to \nimmigration reform that this Nation needs. It\n\n[[Page S3176]]\n\nwill secure our borders. It cracks down on employers who break the law. \nIt will allow us to find out who is living here, whether it is 11 \nmillion or 12 million. We will find out. We want the people who are \nliving in the shadows to come forward, to be fluent in English. We do \nnot want people who have committed crimes. We want them to pay taxes \nand have jobs. Even with that, they go to the back of the line.\n  It is true that there will be additional immigration votes tomorrow--\nmaybe even late tonight if something can be worked out this afternoon. \nPeople have been working on the Martinez amendment for the last several \ndays, and they haven't completed it yet, but they are very close. I \ncompliment the Senator from Florida for the work he has done. Maybe it \ncan be improved. I hope it becomes something for which I can vote.\n  There has been tremendous movement during the night. I think that is \nvery fortunate. We don't need to wait until tomorrow to register \nsupport for a strong bipartisan immigration reform bill; we can do it \nright now by voting for the committee bill.\n  I have heard the arguments against voting for cloture but, frankly, \nthey do not make a lot of sense.\n  The first argument you hear is that by invoking cloture, you are \nshutting down debate.\n  It was interesting. Late last night, Senator Frist offered an \namendment. Do you know what he did? He filled the tree. He filled it up \nso no more amendments could be offered.\n  I said last night to the Presiding Officer: Can I offer an amendment?\n  He said no.\n  But I have to say that the majority leader, in rare form, said: I got \nthe point.\n  That happens all the time here. It happens that people are not \nallowed to offer amendments. It is very frustrating to me--I wanted to \noffer a lot of amendments--and I am sure it is frustrating to others, \nbut that is the way it is.\n  The other argument is that we shouldn't vote for cloture because the \ncloture motion was filed by the minority and not by the majority. If it \nis important to end the debate, it doesn't matter who files a cloture \nmotion.\n  I don't know how easy it is for someone who has voted for this \ncommittee bill to vote against cloture. I don't understand how you \ncould do that logically. But, in effect, that is what is going to \nhappen. I think voting against cloture is a disservice to our country.\n  I have great hope that when we complete this vote here today, we will \ncome back, the bases will still be loaded, and we will have a pitcher \nthere ready to throw something, and what will be thrown is the Martinez \namendment. It is something we can all take a swing at and drive in a \nrun. What would that run be? It would be a run that would give the \nAmerican people a victory--a victory for border security, a victory for \npeople who want to work. It would be a very important provision of this \nguest worker program, supported by wide-ranging groups of people.\n  The third important aspect of this legislation, if we can get the hit \nthis afternoon, would be to make sure that the 12 million people have a \npath to legalization--not an easy path but mountains to climb, some \nwashes to move up, maybe even a tree or two to cut down, but it gives \npeople hope that they can come out of the shadows and be part of our \ngreat American culture. I hope that will happen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, in a few moments, we will be voting on \nthis cloture motion.\n  We find ourselves this morning at an interesting moment in time based \non what we had to do yesterday and last night. The procedure has been \ncomplex. Indeed, some have tried to play politics or use parliamentary \nrules to slow things down, speed them up, cherry-pick amendments that \nwe address.\n  I believe many of our colleagues have been unfairly treated in the \nsense that, in a very important debate, when they have amendments we \nknow will advance the discussion and improve the underlying bill they \nhave been denied the opportunity to come forward and even introduce \ntheir amendments, debate them, and have them voted on.\n  In a few moments, we will have a vote on a motion presented by the \nDemocratic leader that everyone knows will fail, and I think it is a \nreal shame that some have felt it was more important to play these \ngames to get to this point, but we are here and we are going to have a \nvote.\n  On the other hand, I am very optimistic by a lot of the events that \nhave occurred over the last 14, 18 hours in terms of making real \nprogress. After this vote in 30 or 45 minutes, I think the decks will \nessentially be cleared in the sense that we can optimistically look at \nwhere we are going to go over the next 12 or 24 hours.\n  I believe the Hagel-Martinez proposal introduced yesterday, which all \nof our colleagues have looked at over the course of this morning, gives \nus an opportunity to make a major step forward on the underlying bill. \nIt gives a fair approach, a balanced approach. It gives priority to the \nsecurity concerns about our national security interests that are always \nat the top of our list. It pays attention to the 9/11 recommendations. \nIt respects the rule of law as well as that rich contribution and \nheritage provided by our immigrant population.\n  It was last October that I met with Senators Cornyn and McCain and \nmany others to discuss our intentions to take a 2-week block of time \nand focus on it here on the floor of the Senate. Publicly, at that \npoint in time--again, it was October--I laid out a strategy, a plan to \nstart with border security, where we have in this broad body agreement, \nand then build out by consensus a comprehensive plan that would include \nthe two other very important components--border security; second, \ninterior enforcement, enforcement of the workplace--and, third, a \ncomprehensive immigration temporary worker plan that would address what \nhas become the most challenging aspect of this discussion: the 11 \nmillion, 12 million, or 13 million illegal immigrants or undocumented \npeople who are here. That is where we will find ourselves after this \ncloture vote.\n  Shortly thereafter, I asked the Judiciary Committee, ably led by \nArlen Specter and Senator Leahy, to produce a bill, to have the \nnecessary hearings and markup, and consider legislation. Indeed, after \nsix markup periods of designing and writing that bill, they did just \nthat. I commend them. I thank the chairman. I know many Members were \ninvolved and participated, and I think they did a very good job.\n  We began the debate last week. We started with border control, just \nas we laid out. We extended that to interior control enforcement and \nworkplace enforcement and then comprehensive immigration reform \nincluding the temporary worker program. The American people expect it. \nTo allow 2,000 or 3,000 illegal people to come across the border in the \nmiddle of the night, not knowing who they are or where they are going, \nis wrong. We can fix that, as well as comprehensive reform.\n  I am optimistic that after today's vote, after we do that, if we stay \nfocused, if we come together, if everyone takes a very careful look at \nthe Hagel-Martinez proposal, we will finish with a bill which will make \nAmerica safer, protect the rule of law, and recognize our interest in \nlegal immigration.\n  As I have said all along, I believe we cannot support amnesty. \nAmnesty, as I said before, is to give people who have broken the law a \nspecialized, unique track to citizenship. But we do have 12 million \npeople here today. We have to be practical. With the Hagel-Martinez \napproach, we will recognize and discuss the fact that these 12 million \npeople are not a monolithic group. It is a group that can be addressed \nin different ways depending on where one falls within that group.\n  I support a strong temporary worker program that allows people to \nfill what employment needs we have, to come here and to learn a skill, \nsend money back home, and then return to their hometowns to build and \ncontribute to their local community.\n  I believe we need this three-pronged approach because only a \ncomprehensive approach is going to fix this badly broken system we have \ntoday. For all we do on the border, at the worksites, we need to fix \nthe immigration system and also to give us the real border security \nthat so many know we need.\n  Over the course of the day, people can study the approach which was \nput\n\n[[Page S3177]]\n\non the table by Senators Hagel and Martinez. It deserves discussion and \nfocus. I believe it will be the turning point in the debate because it \nis time for us to act and not talk. It is time for us to no longer \ndelay, no longer postpone. It is time for us to give our colleagues the \nopportunity to offer their amendments.\n  So talk, yes; debate, yes. But then let us vote--let us vote in our \nStates' interests, vote for what is in our country's interest but; \nabove all, let us give people the opportunity to vote.\n  I will close by saying again that I am very optimistic that by \nworking together and applying a little common sense, we will come up \nwith a plan that gets the job done and which makes America safer and \nmore secure.\n  I encourage our colleagues to vote no on cloture now, and then the \nSenate will really get to work.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 39, the nays are \n60. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I move to reconsider the vote and to lay that motion on \nthe table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, over the past few weeks, the Senate has \nengaged in an important debate that is long overdue. Our current \nimmigration system is broken and has been broken for many years. \nAlthough this problem is complex, the need for reform is clear, and I \nam pleased that the Senate is moving forward on the issue.\n  We need to make comprehensive, responsible, and commonsense reforms \nthat will stem the tide of illegal immigrants, will be fair to those \nwho are here legally, and will deal realistically with the millions of \nillegal immigrants already here. I believe U.S. immigration policy \nshould establish clear procedures for determining who can enter this \ncountry legally. And it must provide the tools for apprehending those \nwho enter the United States illegally and to punish those who hire them \nat the same time. We must honor our traditions as both a nation of laws \nand a nation of immigrants, enriched by the diversity of newcomers.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee worked hard to create a bipartisan \npackage that would accomplish many of those goals. The bill before us \ntoday would strengthen security at our borders through advanced \ntechnology, increased border patrol, and heavier fines. It would create \na sustainable temporary worker program to help fill the lowest wage \njobs, which pay little and are short of American takers. And it would \nprovide a path to citizenship that does not bump anybody who is here \nlegally but would allow law-abiding, hard-working undocumented \nimmigrants to go to the end of the line.\n  I am pleased by the inclusion of the AgJOBS bill in the Specter \nsubstitute amendment. The agriculture industry is the second largest \nindustry in Michigan, behind manufacturing, and it depends upon the \nwork of immigrants. The AgJOBS provision would provide protections for \nboth the immigrant and American workers. It is estimated that without a \nguest worker program that allow for agricultural workers, the State of \nMichigan would lose hundreds of millions of dollars. In short, the \nAgJOBS provision is vital to the economic health of Michigan.\n  The security provisions in this bill are also important for Michigan \nand for the Nation. As the 9/11 Commission pointed out in its final \nreport, the northern border has traditionally received dramatically \nless attention and resources from the Federal Government. I am pleased \nthat the language passed by the Senate Judiciary Committee and included \nin the Specter substitute amendment authorizes an additional 12,000 \nBorder Patrol agents over the next 5 years, and requires that at least \n20 percent of these agents be stationed along our northern border.\n  I was also pleased that Senator Collins is joining me in an amendment \nto help ensure our Border Patrol agents and other Federal officials \ninvolved in border security--including police officers, National Guard \npersonnel, and emergency response providers--have the capability to \ncommunicate with each other and with their Canadian and Mexican \ncounterparts.\n  The Levin-Collins amendment would direct the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity to establish demonstration projects on the northern and \nsouthern borders to address the interoperable communications needs of \nthose who have border security responsibilities. These projects would \nidentify common frequencies for communications equipment between United \nStates and Canada and the United States and Mexico and provides \ntraining and equipment to relevant personnel.\n  Overall, this legislation would be a step forward on a challenging \nand pressing issue. It contains important bipartisan provisions that \nwill enhance our security and our prosperity while being fair.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to \nproceed as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. KERRY pertaining to the introduction of S.J. Res. \n33 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMINT). The Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n\n[[Page S3178]]\n\n  (Mr. DeMINT assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me talk about the business at hand, and \nthat is the most important debate that I think this Senate has held in \na good many months, on S. 2454, the comprehensive national immigration \nbill. In this immigration reform discussion, I have stood here to \nemphasize our imperative duty to guard our borders and strengthen our \nnational security. I have spoken about the provisions within S. 2454 \nthat deal particularly with the agricultural economy that I have \nfocused on now for a good many years. I presented my colleagues with \nalternatives and approaches toward resolving the issue of illegal \nforeign nationals working in the agricultural economy.\n  Today I want to talk about another component of the immigration \ndebate. I am concerned about some of the comments being flung around as \nwe address this critical issue. Certainly, this is a topic that awakens \nAmerica's emotions, but I cannot help but reflect on what those \ncomments reveal about us as a Nation. It is as though America doesn't \nwant to face the mirror and look at herself. She doesn't want to see \nwhat she is and what that means. But for her own good, she has to. She \nmust look in her mirror. She is a blend. She is a wonderful mosaic. She \nis English. She is German. She is Italian. She is Polish. She is Irish. \nShe is Asian. She is African. And, yes, she is Hispanic. She is \nmultiracial, multiethnic, and diverse in every aspect of her national \nlife. That is why she is admirable. That is why she has prospered, and \nthat is why she is strong.\n  What is true in science is true in sociology. Mixing results in \nachievement and strength--we ought to think about that. We ought to \nevaluate some of the conceptions we have regarding immigrants and \nmeasure them against the realities to see if they hold true.\n  Immigration is a phenomenal national challenge. It always has been. \nBut immigration is a challenge, it is not a threat. Quite honestly, \nimmigrants represent solutions to many of our Nation's problems, both \ncurrently and in the future.\n  (Mr. VITTER assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics \nprojects a shortfall of 10 million workers in this country by 2010. The \nreason is quite simple: Our workforce is growing older, and as it grows \nolder, it shrinks.\n  That is true in Japan, a great Nation 30 years ago, 20 years ago, \nsuggested to be the economic force of the world, and 12 years ago, it \nquit growing and began to die. Why? Because her workforce grew older.\n  On the other hand, immigrant labor is behind the significant economic \ngrowth this country has experienced in different areas in recent years. \nThese are the economic necessities of today in a growing economy. Can \nwe recognize this? Do we see that foreign nationals are cleaning up New \nOrleans and binding her wounds? Do we know that the Pentagon was \nrebuilt by Hispanic muscle?\n  Immigrants are sweating it out across our country. They consistently \nhave done it literally for centuries. In my home State, Hispanics were \ndigging the mines in the 1860s. Mexican cowboys and ranchers were solid \nmembers of the pioneer communities even before my State became a State. \nHispanics were mule packers in the 1880s, the mule trains that moved \nacross the great West. They and the Chinese were building and \nmaintaining the railroad systems of the American West throughout the \n19th and 20th centuries. Today, they are harvesting apples in \nWashington, peaches in Georgia, and oranges in Florida. They are \ngathering grapes in California, slashing sugarcane in Louisiana, \nharvesting potatoes in Idaho, and picking corn in Iowa. Their \nfootprints are in agricultural fields across America.\n  Immigrants are hard workers. They work hard because they are grateful \npeople and feel a sense of debt for the opportunity this country has \ngiven them. Contrary to what some believe, immigrants who have entered \nlegally and illegally are not here to siphon services but to produce \nand to contribute. They are working hard and, in most instances, giving \nback.\n  The Idaho commerce and labor department reports that between 1990 and \n2005, Hispanic buying power in Idaho rose more than twice as fast as \ntotal buying power across our State. Nationwide, the purchasing power \nof Hispanics will reach $1 trillion--that is trillion with a ``t''--in \n4 years. Beyond their role in sustaining the country's labor force, \nimmigrants make a net fiscal contribution to the U.S. economy.\n  The President's 2005 Economic Report, which uses figures that are \nmost authoritative in analyzing to date the economic impact of \nimmigrants, says:\n\n       The average immigrant pays nearly $1,800 more in taxes than \n     he or she costs--\n\n  The economy. Undocumented immigrants are believed to contribute \nbillions of dollars to our Social Security system, billions of dollars \nthey will not benefit from.\n  According to the President's report, the administration's earnings \nsuspense file--that is a file within Social Security made up of taxes \npaid by workers with invalid or mismatched Social Security numbers--\ntotaled $463 billion in 2002.\n  While other nations of the developed world are aging, America still \nsees a youthful face reflected in that mirror in which she looks. \nImmigration renews the United States, and it keeps us young, while \ncountries such as Japan, as I mentioned earlier, and Russia and Spain \nare facing problems because their populations are decreasing. America \nhas the necessary arms to support its pension and its social programs. \nTherefore, a comprehensive immigration reform is in America's best \nself-interest.\n  Yes, we must contain our borders. Yes, we must, in any immigration \nprogram, make sure that it is controlled and managed so that those who \ncome to America can, in fact, become Americans.\n  Understanding these realities erases some of the misconceptions \nbouncing around this Chamber and bouncing around America, \nmisconceptions that sometimes smack of prejudice. Previous immigration \nwaves have experienced it to some extent, but I believe that we, as a \nnation, are greater than that. When every one of us, except Native \nAmericans, belong to a family that came from somewhere else, we should \nbe careful not to erect mental borders, the type that keep people who \nare different from us at arm's length.\n  We are a nation that encourages new thinking and benefits from the \ngrowth that results from that new thinking. The American poet, Oliver \nWendell Holmes, said it best when he said:\n\n       A mind stretched by a new idea never returns to its \n     original shape.\n\n  It expands. It grows. It broadens. Immigration is a source of new \nideas of entrepreneurship and vitality. The meeting of cultures simply \ndoes not happen in a one-way street but in a bridge, where both sides \ngive and receive.\n  When America looks at herself in her mirror, what will she see? She \nwill see the very multicultural character she has always been. She will \nsee that characteristic is her greatest asset.\n  So the debate on the floor of the Senate today is worthy of this \nSenate. It is worthy of all of us to make sure that a program that is \nbroken, a national immigration program that has not had a caretaker for \nover two decades, now be given that responsibility, to be redesigned, \nto be shaped, to be brought under control, that our borders be secure \nand that America's multinational or multiethnicity continue to grow and \nprosper and bring the kind of strength and viability to our culture \nthat it has always given us.\n  America will be greater because of what we do here, if we do it \nright; it will not be lessened by our actions.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the compromise \nthat we have reached around a comprehensive immigration bill.\n  A group of Members led by Senators Hagel, Martinez, Salazar, McCain, \nKennedy, Durbin, Lieberman, Graham, and others, have agreed to move \nthis debate to a sensible center. In doing so, they have bridged a wide \ndivide and demonstrated what the U.S.\n\n[[Page S3179]]\n\nSenate is capable of when it comes together to work on an important \nproblem affecting the lives of all Americans. So I commend this group \nthat I have had the honor of being a part of for moving closer to an \nagreement that serves the twin purposes of securing our borders and \nbringing undocumented workers out of the shadows.\n  To assess our progress on this issue, we need only look back on where \nwe were when this debate started last week. Many Members on the other \nside of the aisle opposed any plan that would provide a path to \ncitizenship for undocumented workers who are living in the United \nStates. I think the fact that, a little over a week later, we are now \nat a point where it is recognized that a path to citizenship should be \npart of a comprehensive package; that it will, in fact, improve our \nability to monitor these workers and to make sure they are not \ndepressing the wages of American workers; and that the undocumented \npopulation should have the opportunity to live out the immigrant dream \nover the long term is a positive step forward. I am especially pleased \nthat the compromise includes changes to the guestworker program, first \nproposed by Senator Feinstein and me, to protect American wages and \nensure that Americans get a first shot and a fair shot at jobs before \nthey go to guestworkers.\n  Everyone in the Senate who has introduced a comprehensive immigration \nbill, including the Administration, has called for a new guestworker \nprogram. I have to say that there are some concerns I have with a \nguestworker program. Clearly, there is a consensus among employers and \nthe Chamber of Commerce that they need greater access to legal foreign \nworkers in order to avoid the disconnect between supply and demand. In \nrecognition of that consensus, the Judiciary Committee bill created a \nnew temporary worker program. But many experts have expressed concerns \nabout the size of that guestworker program and the effect it could have \non American workers' wages and job opportunities. I think many of those \nconcerns are legitimate.\n  The Judiciary Committee bill would have allowed 400,000 new temporary \n``essential'' workers per year, adjusted up or down by market triggers. \nIt would have created a 3-year visa, renewable for 3 years, with \nportability to allow guestworkers to move from employer to employer. It \nwould have required that employers first seek out U.S. workers, and \nthat guestworkers be granted labor protections and market wage \nrequirements.\n  Under the Judiciary Committee proposal, the guestworker could apply \nfor permanent status within the new employment-based cap if his \nemployer sponsored him, or the guestworker could self-petition to stay \nif he worked for 4 years.\n  In order for any guestworker system to work, it has to be properly \nstructured to turn people who would otherwise be illegal immigrants \ninto legal guestworkers. And it has to provide protections for American \nworkers who perceive their jobs to be at stake.\n  Unfortunately, I believe the Judiciary Committee did not quite strike \nthe right balance. But we can do better. We can ensure that \nguestworkers are not just unfair competition for American workers; \nrather, that they are a legitimate source of critical workers.\n  To that end, Senator Feinstein and I offered an amendment to retain \nthe underlying structure of the program presented in the Judiciary \nbill, but to address some legitimate concerns that have been brought to \nour attention.\n  Let me discuss some of the key provisions in this amendment.\n  First, Senator Feinstein and I originally sought to lower the cap on \nguestworkers from 400,000 to 300,000. The compromise bill lowers the \ncap to 325,000 workers. That's a significant decrease that should give \nsome comfort to American workers.\n  Second, our amendment ensures that localities with an unemployment \nrate for low-skilled workers of 9 percent or higher do not see an \ninflow of guestworkers under any circumstances.\n  Third, our amendment ensures that guestworkers receive a prevailing \nwage, whether or not they are covered by a collective bargaining \nagreement.\n  Finally, we guarantee that any job offered to a guestworker is first \nadvertised to Americans at a fair wage.\n  These are fair, commonsense changes. Our amendment recognizes that \nAmerican workers will be better off if we replace the uncontrolled \nstream of undocumented workers with a regulated stream of guestworkers \nwho enter the country legally and have full access to labor rights. \nReplacing an illegal workforce with legal guestworkers who can defend \nthemselves will raise wages and working conditions for everyone.\n  I think the amendment Senator Feinstein and I have offered will \nensure that an employer seeks a temporary worker only as a last resort, \nand only after making a good-faith and fair offer to American workers, \nwhich is why this amendment has been endorsed by the Laborers' \nInternational Union, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, SEIU, and \nthe United Food and Commercial Workers Union.\n  I am pleased at the work that has been done. My understanding is that \nthe compromise Hagel-Martinez legislation that is being prepared will \nprovide for these terms. However, I remain concerned. We have to make \nabsolutely certain--given the delicate balance between security, border \nprotection, and treating all workers fairly--that we do not end up \nhaving a series of amendments that effectively gut this legislation. We \nalso have to make sure that, if this bill is negotiated with the House \nin a conference committee, we do not end up with a program that creates \na second-tier class of workers who cannot be citizens, and can be \nexploited by their employers.\n  I am pleased at the progress that we have made since last week. I \nhope we continue it. I am looking forward, on a bipartisan basis, to \naddressing these concerns in the debate that follows over the next \nseveral days.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Doha Round\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Committee on \nFinance, I chair a committee that has jurisdiction over international \ntrade. We find ourselves being both a participant and an observer of \nDoha Round negotiations under the World Trade Organization. Those \nnegotiations are in a very determinative state; success will be made, I \nbelieve, during the month of April or the Doha Round, for all practical \npurposes, would end--not in the minds of the WTO or in the minds of the \n148 nations other than the United States but as a practical matter. If \nthings are not done by the end of 2006 and the President's authority \nfor trade promotion running out in July of 2007, there will not be time \nfor us to get something done before trade promotion authority runs out.\n  I would like to have trade promotion authority for the President \ncontinued beyond July 2007. I would try to promote that, but we saw \nvery close votes on CAFTA and other trade agreements; there is a \nprotectionist trend in the Congress--maybe not in the Nation as a whole \nbut at least in Congress--that might keep us from getting trade \npromotion authority reauthorized.\n  I comment in these few minutes on where we are on the Doha Round and \nwhat I expect to happen and leave the message, if it does not happen \nvery soon, this round could be dead.\n  As we enter the final months of the WTO Doha negotiations, I am very \nconcerned the bright promise of a world far less burdened with often \ncrippling, market-distorting trade barriers may be slipping from our \ngrasp. In particular, I am very troubled by the fact that nearly 5 \nyears after WTO members adopted the Doha ministerial declaration that \nlaunched this round of global trade talks, some of our WTO negotiating \npartners still seem willing to forgo this very historic opportunity \nthat Doha represents to open highly protected agricultural markets.\n  We now have less than 4 weeks to go to meet the WTO's new April 30 \ndeadline to reach agreement on what is referred to as modalities or, \nanother way\n\n[[Page S3180]]\n\nto put it, a roadmap for how we will achieve our specific market-\nopening objectives in the agricultural negotiations. This deadline, \nsimilar to most of the others, also appears to be elusive.\n  The Doha Round is a historic opportunity because global trade rounds \nare relatively rare events. We have had only nine of them since the \ncreation of the global trading regime back in 1947, what we then called \nthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT.\n  Agriculture, which was ignored for almost the first 40 years of GATT, \nwas only first addressed at all during the last round, which was the \neighth round, which was called the Uruguay Round because it started in \nMontevideo and finished and passed by Congress in 1993.\n  So here we are, 13 years later, trying to make some progress--but not \nmaking very much progress--toward what we would hope would be a 10th \nsuccessful round since the regime started in 1947. Because many trade-\ndistorting barriers were untouched or minimally reduced at the end of \nthe Uruguay Round in 1993, much was left to be done, particularly in \nagriculture, but we are negotiating manufacturing, we are negotiating \nservices, so a lot needs to be done.\n  In light of the lack of progress in the World Trade Organization, I \nbriefly address a few points. First, as chairman of this Senate \nCommittee on Finance, I reaffirm, as strongly as I can, the basic \nelements of the Trade Act of 2002, especially the legislation crafted \nby this committee that renewed the President's trade promotion \nauthority in 2002, after it had lapsed for about 7 years.\n  The underlying premise of our trade promotion authority legislation, \nwhich gives Congress enhanced oversight authority over trade \nnegotiations conducted under that act, is that the United States will \npursue a very ambitious, very comprehensive trade negotiation, \nparticularly in agriculture. This was the cornerstone of the Doha \nRound--ambitious, comprehensive negotiations and nothing less.\n  The reason I fought so hard for trade promotion authority is simple. \nThe benefits from ending decades of trade-distorting practices in the \nglobal agricultural trade are overwhelming. The U.S. Department of \nAgriculture has estimated getting rid of market-disrupting agricultural \nprotection could increase the value of U.S. agricultural exports by at \nleast 19 percent. In addition, the Department of Agriculture study also \nconcludes that agricultural liberalization would increase global \neconomic welfare by $56 billion each year.\n  I know well how vital trade is to farming families anyplace in \nAmerica, but I am particularly knowledgeable about my State of Iowa \nbecause I happen to be a family farmer, farming jointly with my son \nRobin. Our farmers and agricultural producers sold over $3.6 billion in \nagricultural exports in overseas markets last year. Although importers \nand consumers from all over the world seek out Iowa's agricultural \nproducts, this is also true of American agriculture generally.\n  Moreover, more than $3 trillion of economic activity in our $12 \ntrillion economy is derived from trade. Think of that: More than 25 \npercent of our economy is based upon international trade. That is why \nan ambitious, comprehensive result in the Doha negotiations is the only \nkind of result that makes sense, both for my State of Iowa and the \nUnited States.\n  President Bush and Ambassador Portman have done a very good job--in \nfact, a remarkable job, in my view,--of pursuing an ambitious, \ncomprehensive agricultural deal, especially in the difficult period \nprior to and during the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference last December.\n  Nevertheless, some World Trade Organization members, principally the \nEuropean Union, now apparently want to stop short of that ambitious, \ncomprehensive, result-seeking agreement that was previously reached in \nopening Doha Round, and they particularly want to shortchange the \nnegotiations in the area of agricultural market access. That is why, \nwhen pressed by the United States and other World Trade Organization \nmembers, the European Union appears to be changing the subject away \nfrom ambitious market access to secondary issues such as food aid, on \nwhich we are now having protracted discussions.\n  I am not even sure our own negotiators should be participating in \nsomething as fringe as food aid as compared to the massive discussions \nand decisions that need to be made in trade-distorting export subsidies \nby the European Union or by, in the case of the United States, \nproduction-related subsidies that we do for American agriculture, not \nsubsidies for agriculture generally but those which are trade \ndistorted. We find our American negotiators getting all nervous about \nfood aid as somehow being a major item. No. What it is is an effort on \nthe part of the European Union to detract attention from the really big \nexport subsidies and production-oriented subsidies.\n  Perhaps that is because of the intense political pressure European \ntrade and agricultural officials think they face at home. It seems to \nme that the European Trade Minister wants to open up and do really good \ntrade negotiations. It seems like there is a hangup by the European \nAgricultural Minister. And it seems to be really a hangup by French \nfarmers. According to one account by former European Commission \nofficials, European farm groups described one compromise agricultural \nagreement as a death warrant for European farmers. However, that was in \n1992, connected with the Uruguay Round negotiations, and the \nagricultural agreement that drew so much protest in Europe was back \nthen, not today, when that description was made. Ultimately, of course, \nEurope accepted the Uruguay agreement in 1993. Now the European Union \nis right back where they were 13 years ago, citing that same agreement \nas a model for the type of agreement they would like to see today, at \nleast in terms of linear tariff reductions.\n  So we have seen this type of reaction from Europe before.\n  Today, once again, the European Union thinks that ambitious market \naccess too politically painful to achieve or to even thoroughly \nnegotiate, but they got over that hurdle in Uruguay. Why can't they get \nover that hurdle in Doha? So we are back at the European tactic. It \nappears that what they are really trying to do is a minimal deal \nsomehow being seen as a good deal. Apparently, they think it is a good \nresult if they can get something that is marginally better than the \nstatus quo, end negotiations, declare victory, and go home.\n  Other WTO Members such as Brazil appear reluctant to agree to an \nambitious outcome in agricultural market access because they may \nbelieve that they can achieve their objectives through other means, \nsuch as litigation. You know about the cotton case. Brazil recently was \nsuccessful in that case. So it may give them false hopes that they can \nachieve, through legal briefs in Geneva, what they do not appear to win \nat the negotiating table of the Doha Round.\n  I would like to say a word about both of those situations.\n  First, a minimal deal in the Doha agricultural negotiations is not \nsomething that can be considered a victory in any sense of the term, \neven in a political sense. What do I mean by a minimal deal? A deal \nthat goes just beyond the 36-percent average tariff reduction of the \nUruguay Round, a deal that leaves tariff peaks in place, or a deal that \nundermines market access by long lists of special exemptions.\n  I will not try, as chairman of the Finance Committee, to spin some \nminimalist deal into some sort of political victory. In fact, I will \nnot even allow it to be brought up for consideration in the Finance \nCommittee or, if I was overruled by my own committee, I would fight it \non the floor, if it ever got that far.\n  So let me make that as clear as I can. A bad deal for agriculture in \nDoha negotiations is worse than no deal. That was my position at the \nstart of these negotiations, and that is my position now. All those \npeople spending all their time negotiating on food aid when they ought \nto be negotiating on export subsidies, when they ought to be \nnegotiating on subsidies encouraging overproduction, that is not going \nto take my eye off the ball.\n  A minimalist outcome in the Doha negotiations, after years of effort \nand high-level political engagement, would send a terrible message that \nreal reform in agriculture is too hard to achieve and may set us back \nfor decades.\n\n[[Page S3181]]\n\n  It would make meaningless a key element of the agricultural component \nof the Doha Ministerial Declaration where WTO member countries \ncommitted themselves to ``comprehensive negotiations aimed at \nsubstantial improvement in market access.'' That is what U.S. \nagriculture demands for giving up our subsidies connected to \nproduction. Farmers want their income from the marketplace, not from \nthe Federal Treasury. But we cannot do that without market access, \nwhere there are 62 percent average tariffs around the world on \nagriculture compared to our 12 percent. If that happened, it would \nreward countries such as the European Union that have big farm \nspending, highly inefficient production----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his time in morning \nbusiness.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent for 4 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. If we went this route, it would reward countries such \nas the European Union that have big farm spending, highly inefficient \nproduction, and use nontariff barriers to thwart trade. And even though \nthis round is known as the Doha Development Round because it is \nsupposed to help poor countries, a bad deal that keeps high trade \nbarriers in place would tell developing countries that they can forget \nabout seeing fair opportunity to export their products.\n  As for World Trade Organization members that see litigation in \ndispute settlement--as Brazil did in the cotton case--as a practical \nalternative to negotiations, I would remind those who are tempted to \nadopt this position that litigation, even under the new, improved WTO \nrules, is unpredictable, costly, time-consuming, and not the way to \nresolve unfair trade.\n  Moreover, litigation is not always the most effective way to open \nmarkets and eliminate trade barriers, especially over the long haul. \nHistorically, we have also depended on negotiations and the everyday \nmanagement of trade and commercial relations as much better ways to \nachieve and maintain open markets.\n  Make no mistake, we can and will defend our interests through dispute \nsettlement when it is necessary to do so, and we have done so as the \nUnited States in the World Trade Organization quite successfully. But \nsubstituting litigation for negotiations or for management of our \ncommercial relations is neither practical nor desirable, nor is it the \nway to bolster confidence in the World Trade Organization as an \neffective negotiating forum.\n  I began by saying that this round of trade negotiations is a historic \nopportunity. It can be historic in the sense that we achieve a result \nthat truly benefits the global community by increasing global \nprosperity, and it can be historic in the sense that we miss a great \nopportunity to promote prosperity and open markets throughout the \nworld.\n  Unfortunately, we have made enormous mistakes before when we missed \nimportant opportunities to fight for comprehensive global trade \nliberalization. In the early years of the General Agreement on Tariffs \nand Trade, going as far back as 1947, it was the developed nations, \nparticularly the United States, that created exceptions for \nagriculture, that exempted it from liberalization under the GATT \nregime. It has taken us decades to shift gears to try to bring \nagriculture under the discipline of global trade rules. That is why it \nis so important for us to continue to make real progress in this round \nof global trade talks.\n  Achieving real, meaningful results in these talks is something I am \nas strongly committed to now as ever before. It is also why I will \ncontinue to oppose any outcome in the WTO that, in my judgment, fails \nto accomplish these goals, even if it is a minimalist approach. Don't \nexpect me to bring such an agreement before the Senate as chairman of \nthe Finance Committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise to talk about immigration reform. \nOver the past week, I have heard many of my colleagues describe the \nimportant contributions immigrants have made to American society and \nculture. Like my colleagues, I agree that the United States has a long \nand proud tradition of immigration. Immigrants have contributed in many \nways to our Nation since its birth. Many Americans are descendants of \nimmigrants who came to America seeking a better life. Unfortunately, \ntoday we have a huge illegal immigration problem that threatens our \nNation's security and our economic security.\n  I was recently contacted about this issue by a constituent of mine. \nShe is a young Irish-American woman whose parents emigrated from the \nRepublic of Ireland to the Commonwealth of Kentucky over 20 years ago. \nWhen talking about her experience of immigration to the United States, \nthis young woman stressed to me what a privilege immigration to our \ncountry truly is. She is right. Immigration is a privilege and not an \nentitlement. This distinct privilege of immigration is one which is \nunique to our great Nation and one which is currently being threatened \nby the flow of illegal immigrants into our society.\n  Like so many of my colleagues, I would like to see this country's \ntraditions of immigration preserved. But it must be done in a way that \ndoes not reward those who broke our laws and came to this country \nillegally. Looking at immigration reform, I believe we must start with \nsecuring our borders, to stop those who illegally try to enter the \nUnited States.\n  Border security is the foundation on which we must build immigration \nreform. It is essential to our national security that we make it our \nNo. 1 priority. We need to keep a close eye on who the people are who \nare entering this country and the purpose they have for coming here. \nThe only way to do that is to make sure our Border Patrol agents and \nother law enforcement officials responsible for stopping illegal \nimmigrants have the resources they need to protect our borders.\n  Right now, our Border Patrol agents do not have enough funds to \nsecure our borders effectively. Often, people have the ability to just \nwalk across the unguarded border without question.\n  We need to provide the Border Patrol agents with the best resources, \nthe most up-to-date technology, and, most importantly, the manpower \nthey need to successfully do their job.\n  Just this past week, the FBI busted a smuggling ring organized by the \nterrorist group Hezbollah. They had some of their members cross the \nMexican border to carry out possible terrorist attacks inside the \nUnited States. Securing our borders is no longer an option, it is a \nnecessity. It is essential to securing our national safety, the safety \nof our citizens, and the safety of future American citizens.\n  We must also find a commonsense solution to dealing with those \nindividuals who are already here illegally. While there currently are \nseveral options on the table, I believe amnesty in any form is not an \noption. I was disappointed to see this in the Specter amendment. We \nmust find a solution that meets the needs of employers, while also \nprotecting American jobs.\n  I think this could be done through some kind of program that would \nrequire illegal immigrants to return home to their country of origin \nafter a set period of time. Once home, these workers could then apply \nto get on the path to come back as a temporary resident and maybe even \napply for citizenship. But in no way should amnesty for illegal \nimmigrants be an option. If these folks want to come back as citizens, \nthey need to go back to their country and get in line behind the almost \n3 million people who have already begun following the law and waiting \npatiently to enter the United States legally. No one should be allowed \nto cut in line.\n  As many of you know, Kentucky has a very proud and rich history in \nagriculture. From our tobacco farms, to our dairy farms, Kentucky's \neconomy relies on its agricultural industries. As someone who is from \nan agricultural State, I understand the need for temporary workers. Any \nguest worker program needs to be simple to use for both the employer \nand the employee. Employers must be provided with the proper tools to \nverify the immigration status of their employees. Those tools need to \nbe easy for our Nation's employers to access and to use. This is \nessential to any type of immigration reform and to our national \nsecurity. We need to know who is being employed,\n\n[[Page S3182]]\n\nwhere they came from, and how long they are allowed to stay.\n  Congress must act on immigration reform. I hope partisan politics \ndoes not prevent action on an issue that is so important to our Nation. \nI would like to once again reflect back on the words of my Irish-\nAmerican constituent and urge my colleagues, this week, to help keep \nimmigration a privilege of our great Nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to help put integrity back into the immigration \nprocess. While our country does have a rich tradition of immigration, \nwe do not have a rich tradition of rewarding those who break our laws. \nI call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, both Democrats and \nRepublicans, to remember the principles upon which our great Nation was \nfounded. While we always have been and still are a land of opportunity, \nwe also are a land of laws.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I hope this big problem that we \nhave facing our Nation is given a chance to be solved on the floor of \nthe Senate this week.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Support for the President's Plan for Iraq\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I come to the floor to respond to some of \nthe comments that were just made by my colleague from Massachusetts. I \nwant to start off by saying that I have been very supportive of the \nPresident on the war in Iraq because he has had a plan and he has \nstayed the course. That is what gives me confidence in the President. I \nthink it is what gives confidence to many American people. They \nunderstand that he has made a strong commitment in Iraq to stick with \nthe Iraqi people, and he has confidence in those people. Even though \nthe political winds are twirling around, he has been able to ignore \nthose and move forward. He is showing success. Sometimes it is not as \ngreat as we would like to see or as dramatic, but I think what we see \ntoday in the criticism of the President is individuals who are being \nspun in the political winds, unlike the President.\n  When my colleague from Massachusetts calls the strategy of today \ncounterproductive and says we ought to pull out our forces immediately \nfrom Iraq, that is a catastrophic suggestion. It is not anything that \nwe should consider very seriously. It wasn't that long ago when my \ncolleague from Massachusetts was saying that it would be a disaster and \na disgraceful betrayal of principle to speed up the process and simply \nlay the groundwork for expedient withdrawal of American troops, which \nwould risk the hijacking of Iraq by former terrorist groups and former \nBaathists. This quote was in the runup to the 2004 election.\n  So we see some being spun in the political winds, while the President \nremains strong, forceful. The President truly is a leader in a very \ndifficult situation in Iraq. That is why I feel so very committed to \nsupporting the President. You cannot deny the fact that this President \ntruly wants to see democracy survive in Iraq, and he truly believes in \nthe Iraqi people.\n  Contrary to criticism coming from the other side of the aisle, he \ndoes have a plan, and he is sticking to that plan.\n  As we move through various phases of the President's plan, we have \nseen that criticism has changed from the other side. I think they \ncriticize just for the sake of criticism, trying to get the President \noff course. But to his credit, he has stayed the course. I think that \nis commendable. That is what helps make him a strong and effective \nPresident.\n  I want to make this point: Al-Qaida is still a threat in Iraq, but we \nare making significant advances there. I have to base that on \ndiscussions I have had with troops that have come freshly out of Iraq. \nThey all believe they are indeed improving our situation in Iraq. They \nthink they are making a difference in Iraqi lives, and they truly \nbelieve the Iraqi people they associate with appreciate what is \nhappening and appreciate their efforts.\n  There is a statewide elected official in Colorado, Mike Coffman, who \nhas returned from Iraq. His mission was to help set up local \ngovernments throughout Iraq. We found in our military forces that we \ndidn't have that expertise. And Mike, who is in the Reserves, could \nmake a difference in Iraq. The military said: We need you, Mike \nCoffman, to help set up these local governments. He spent almost a year \nin Iraq helping set up local governments and the story he has to tell \nis one of progress in Iraq, that the people in Iraq are truly moving \nforward and trying to set up their local governments. He thinks that \nour soldiers are making a difference.\n  Not for one moment has he expressed any regrets in having taken a \nyear out of his political life in Colorado to go to Iraq and make a \ndifference in Iraqi lives and help support the President and the plan \nhe has for stabilizing Iraq and a gradual withdrawal.\n  This is the point: my colleague from Massachusetts seemed to have \nlearned the lessons of 9/11 when he warned against a precipitous \nwithdrawal from Iraq in the past, but as the political winds have \nchanged, he seems to have forgotten those lessons anew. Republicans \nwill never forget the lessons of 9/11 and will continue to support the \nPresident's efforts to bring peace and stability to Iraq.\n  I am supporting the President because he is staying the course. He \nhas a plan in Iraq. He is putting the plan to work. I think that in the \nlong run he is going to make a difference. We are going to have a \nbetter world because of his efforts. We are going to have a more stable \nMiddle East, and this President will truly go down in history as a \ngreat leader.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to speak for a few minutes \nwith respect to the amendment that has already been filed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to talk about an \namendment that I filed, that I hope soon we might be able to consider, \non this important bill with respect to immigration and with respect to \nFederal land border security, which are integrated.\n  First, let me say that I am hopeful we can move forward with this \nbill. It is a very important bill. Obviously, all of us agree with the \nfact that there are problems that need to be resolved, and they need to \nbe resolved soon so they don't continue to become more difficult.\n  We also recognize that there are aspects of this bill that are \ncontroversial and difficult. I am not certain where we are in the \nprocess, but I am hopeful the discussions we have had will continue to \nbe useful and that we can come to, whether this week or later, \ncompletion of this issue.\n  As far as I can tell, everyone has agreed we need to do something \nabout the border, that the border needs to be secure, whatever it takes \nto do that. Some of us don't think it takes 700 miles of fence, but it \nwill probably take some fence and take some other new technologies, as \nwell as dollars and people, to have a secure border.\n  I don't think there is any question but that that needs to be done \nand needs to be done soon so that the problem that exists because of \nhaving a porous border doesn't continue to exist in the future. There \nis general agreement that over time, as immigrants come here for jobs, \nemployers will need to report as to the citizenship status of the \npeople they employ. There needs to be a system to do that so it can be \npart of the way of enforcing lawful immigration into this country.\n\n  Further, I think most people don't disagree with the idea of \nimmigration. The question, at least in my view, is illegal immigration. \nI am opposed to illegal immigration, and I think we have to do \nsomething to see that it doesn't continue to happen. The challenge is: \nHow do we handle those folks who are here, whether it is 12 million or \nwhatever the number is? I think that is where we are in the \ncontroversy, and I understand that.\n  Personally, I don't think anyone should be given amnesty, nor should\n\n[[Page S3183]]\n\nthey be given any particular advantages for citizenship if they came \nhere illegally, and we need to find a way to deal with it. On the other \nhand, I am very much in favor of having legal workers come here and \nfill the jobs that are necessary. But they ought to have legal work \npermits, and they should have to go back if it is a work permit, and if \nthey are citizens, they need to go through a citizen entry system.\n  The other part of the debate and what I came to talk about is the \naspect of our borders and security. That is one of the reasons--not \nonly for immigration, but for security--we need to secure our borders. \nMany of our national treasures and resources are on the front line of \nborder security. Thirty-nine percent of the southern border of the \nUnited States is under the jurisdiction of the Department of the \nInterior. Arizona's Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument and other \nfederally owned resources have become a hotspot for illegal border \ncrossings. I visited Oregon Pipe last year. I am the chairman of the \nParks Subcommittee. Frankly, they are using almost all of their \nresources not to take care of the park, not to do the things park \npeople normally do, but to protect against illegal immigration movement \nacross the border that is the park boundary border on the national park \nborder.\n  Over the last 2 years, park rangers have arrested 385 felony \nsmugglers, seized 40,000 pounds of marijuana, and interdicted 3,800 \nillegal immigrants. These are national park rangers. So it has become a \nvery important part of border security.\n  Border security activities play, as you might imagine, a very \nsignificant role in park operation funding and in park operation staff. \nCustoms and border protection agents are not always available to patrol \nthe Federal lands along the border. As you can see here, there are a \nnumber of things that are there. The Bureau of Indian Affairs, for \ninstance, right here, is a very large aspect of the Arizona border. \nHere is the Organ Pipe park we mentioned. The Bureau of Reclamation has \na number of these yellow spots along here. We don't have Texas and New \nMexico on the map, but there are also a great many more Federal lands \nthat are there.\n  We have to make sure these agencies are given the assistance they \nneed to provide the border security that is necessary, to provide for \npark researchers and others who are there doing their work or to pursue \nsmugglers crossing the border. We never think about that particularly. \nAll of a sudden there are cars parked there and people who have driven \nacross, left the cars and walked on through, and so on. It is quite a \nproblem. I understand that the Park Service law enforcement will \ninevitably play a role in border security, but we need to keep their \njobs focused on protecting the park and not having to spend all their \ntime on international borders--which is the responsibility of the \nBorder Patrol--and other activities, or at least provide additional \nfunding.\n  This amendment will ultimately do two things: Protect our borders and \nprotect our national treasures.\n  We direct the Director of Homeland Security to increase Customs and \nborder protection personnel to secure Federal lands and Federal parks \nalong the border, which is I think a reasonable thing to do.\n  It requires Federal land resources training for Customs and Border \nPatrol agents who will be dedicated to Federal land border security to \nminimize the impact on the natural resources. After all, that is why we \nhave Federal lands.\n  That is why we have parks, to make sure the resources are protected. \nQuite frankly, if you have illegals crossing, they have no interest in \nprotecting those resources.\n  It provides unmanned aerial vehicles, aerial assets, and remote video \nsurveillance camera systems and sensors. Those are the things we need \nas opposed to big walls.\n  It requires the Secretary of the Interior to conduct an inventory of \nthe costs incurred by the National Park Service relating to the border \nsecurity activities and submit those recommendations to Congress.\n  I realize this is only one rather small element of this whole issue \nwe are talking about but, nevertheless, it is a unique issue, it is an \nimportant issue, and as we move through dealing with border security \nand dealing with Federal land borders and protecting these things, I \nhope we keep in mind this unusual but important exposure we have to our \nFederal lands.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Conrad and Mr. Alexander pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 2571 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending legislation is the Frist second-\ndegree amendment to the motion to commit.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, a little while ago--I was not here, I was \nat a hearing of the Finance Committee--I am informed that the Senator \nfrom Colorado, Mr. Allard, came to the floor to attack my position on \nIraq, which is fine by me, but also I think somewhat questionable with \nrespect to the rules and the ethics of the Senate to attack me \npersonally about my motives with respect to a position I have taken. \nThe Senator from Colorado suggested that ``we see an individual who is \nbeing spun in the political winds.''\n  Let me make it clear to the Senator from Colorado, and anybody else \nwho wants to debate Iraq, that when it comes to issues of war and peace \nand of young Americans dying, nobody spins me, period.\n  I am not going to listen to the Senator from Colorado or anyone else \nquestion my motives when young Americans are dying on a daily basis or \nlosing their limbs because Iraqi politicians won't form a government \nfrom an election that they held in December. That is inexcusable.\n  Let me ask the Senator from Colorado: Is it OK by him that young \nAmericans are dying right now while politicians in Baghdad are \nfrittering away their time and squandering the opportunity our soldiers \nfought to give them? Does he think that is a plan that is working? Does \nhe think that is serving the needs of the American military?\n  Indeed, a year and a half ago or 2 years ago, I suggested, as did \nmany other people, that it would be inappropriate to set a timetable \nfor American troops to withdraw because we had not had elections and \nbecause most people assumed what we were fighting then was al-Qaida and \nterrorists who were foreign terrorists. But the fact is since then we \nhave trained forces, we have trained police. We listened to this \nadministration consistently come and tell us how great the training is, \nhow many people are up and trained, how much they have been able to \nmake progress, how 70 percent of the country is indeed peaceful.\n  If that is true, then there shouldn't be a great threat to reducing \nAmerican forces on a schedule that is also tied to our ability to \nresolve other issues with respect to Iraq.\n  I ask the Senator from Colorado: Let us have a real debate about this \nissue.\n  Does he ignore what our own generals tell us? He says the President \nhas a plan. Our generals tell us--General Casey--that the large \npresence of American forces in fact is adding to the occupation in the \nsense of an occupation and it derails the Iraqis standing up on their \nown.\n  I am listening to General Casey--not to the Senator from Colorado. If \nGeneral Casey tells me the Iraqis would stand up faster if there were \nless Americans there, I believe him. Our troops have done the job.\n  Don't come to the floor of the Senate and try to suggest to me that \nsomehow when we come up with a plan to protect our troops and to make \nAmerica stronger we are somehow making their life more miserable. Ask \nthe troops. Seventy percent of the troops who were polled in Iraq said \nthey thought next year we ought to be able to withdraw. Those are our \ntroops talking to us.\n  The notion that we are going to try to make this into one of those \npolitical\n\n[[Page S3184]]\n\nsquabbles--let us have a real debate about the policy in Iraq. Anybody \nwho wants to come to the floor and pretend it is working today is \nliving in fantasyland.\n  Anybody who wants to suggest our soldiers ought to be dying so a \nbunch of folks over there can squabble over issues we haven't even \nbrought to the diplomatic table adequately has a false sense of what \nprotecting the troops means and of what their interests are. The fact \nis they only respond to deadlines.\n  Talk to people who have been in the region. It took a deadline to get \nthem to have a transfer of the provisional government. It took a \ndeadline to be able to get the elections in place. It took a deadline \nto be able to get the Constitution in place. It took a deadline to be \nable to have the election that we held in December.\n  The fact is it ought to take a deadline now to tell them to put a \ngovernment together, stop messing around, and don't put our kids' lives \nat stake and waste the billions of dollars of American taxpayers. Get \nyour government together. You owe that much to the American people. You \nowe that much to yourself. You owe that much to the Iraqis. You owe \nthat much to the world, which is waiting for leadership, for some kind \nof adult behavior.\n  I don't think the American people believe what the Senator from \nColorado said--that they believe there is a good plan in place. \nEverything we have been told about Iraq has turned out to be false, \nfrom almost day one. This is the third war we are fighting in Iraq in \nas many years. The first war, I remind Americans, was the war to get \nSaddam Hussein and weapons of mass destruction. Then when there were \nnot any weapons of mass destruction, it became regime change.\n  If the President of the United States had come to the Congress and \nsaid I want authorization to go to Iraq for regime change, he wouldn't \nhave received it.\n\n  Then after it was regime change, it transformed into, oh, we have to \nfight them over here rather than fight them over there--fight them over \nthere rather than here in the United States of America. That sounded \ngood for a while because all of us want to fight al-Qaida and want to \nfight terrorists. But, lo and behold, we found there were, according to \nmost of the estimates, 700 to 1,000 or so hardcore jihadists from other \ncountries over there.\n  The insurgency grew day by day to be an insurgency that is now a low-\ngrade civil war. Prime Minister Allawi called it a civil war. Does the \nSenator from Colorado believe he knows better than Prime Minister \nAllawi what to call it? The fact is it is now a civil war, and our \ntroops can't resolve a civil war, no matter how valiant--and they have \nbeen--no matter how courageous--and they have been--and no matter how \nskilled--and they have been. This is the best military I have ever \nseen. These are the best young men and women I have ever met, and it \nhas been a privilege to go to Iraq and meet them. And they are making \nprogress in certain areas. But their progress is set back by the \nunwillingness of Iraqis to pick up the baton of democracy.\n  You have to compromise. The whole reason they think they can sit \nthere and not compromise is because the President's policy is stay the \ncourse, stay the course, stay the course. And we have an occasional \nvisit by the Secretary of State or somebody to suggest they ought to do \nmore.\n  Ambassador Khalilzad is a terrific person. He is skilled, and he is \ndoing a great job. But he can't do this alone.\n  I believe we ought to have a real debate about their policy--a policy \nwhere they told us it would cost $20 billion to $30 billion. Remember \nthat, colleagues? Remember Mr. Wolfowitz in front of the committees \ntelling us, Oh, the Iraqi oil is going to pay for the war? Remember \nthem telling us that the soldiers were going to be received like \nconquering heroes with flowers all across Iraq?\n  Then when looting broke out, remember Mr. Rumsfeld standing up and \nsaying that Washington is safer than Baghdad, and looting happens? \nRemember how they didn't even guard the ammo dumps and our kids started \nto get blown up with the ammo they could have guarded? No plan was put \nin place.\n  If anybody wants to read about Iraq, read the book ``Cobra 2.'' You \ncan read the astounding story of negligence and malfeasance with \nrespect to this war, about companies overbilling us, Halliburton by \nbillions of dollars.\n  Do you want to run down the list of things that are egregious with \nrespect to this war? I will tell you one thing that I know well, and I \nwill remind the Senator from Colorado that half the names on the wall \nof that Vietnam Memorial--half the names on that wall--became names of \nthe dead after our leaders knew our policy wouldn't work.\n  Our policy isn't working today, and I am not going to be a Senator \nwho adds to the next wall, wherever it may be, that honors those who \nserved in Iraq so that once again people can point to a bunch of names \nthat are added after we knew something was wrong. We have a bigger \nresponsibility than that.\n  The absence of legitimate diplomacy in this is absolutely astounding \nto me. When you look at what former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger \ndid night after night, day after day, flying back and forth on an \nairplane, struggling to be able to get people to come to agreement \naround the table; when you look at what former Secretary Jim Baker did, \ntraveling all over the world, working with countries, pulling people \ntogether around the idea--I don't even see deputy assistant secretaries \nor other people out there at that level working with other countries to \ntry to find a resolution to this.\n  There are Sunni neighbors all around who could play a more \nsignificant role. The Arab League could play a more significant role. \nThe United Nations could play a more significant role. What are we \ndoing? Drifting day after day after day.\n  Do we want to go back and talk about the armor our troops didn't \nhave? Do we want to go back and talk about the humvees that weren't \nuparmored? How many kids have lost their arms or legs because of the \nlack of adequacy of the equipment they were given? How many parents had \nto go out and buy armor for their kids because it wasn't provided for?\n  I have never in my life seen a war managed like this one where there \nhas been zero accountability at the highest levels of civilian \nleadership and people have been able to make mistake after mistake \nafter mistake. And people want to come to the floor and defend it as \nsomehow justifiable that we have a plan and we are on course? We are \nnot on course. We are on the wrong course. The plan needs to be \nchanged.\n  Somebody ought to tell the Iraqi leadership that American citizens \nare not going to put their money and the treasury of their young into a \nkind of noneffort to compromise and show statesmanship and leadership \nthat puts a government together. When they put that government \ntogether, then we can talk about how we are going to move forward. But \nright now, this is adrift. It is a policy without leadership, and the \nAmerican people understand that. What we need now is civilian \nleadership that is equal to the sacrifice of our soldiers.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Police Chief Terry Gainer\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today is the day before the departure of \nCapitol Hill Chief of Police Terry Gainer, a man who has served us so \nwell.\n  I have known Terry Gainer for almost 20 years. He served as \nsuperintendent of the Illinois State Police and left that position to \nbecome one of the leading officers in the District of Columbia Police \nForce. He was then asked to become chief of the Capitol Police Force. I \nknew that the people making that decision had made a very fine choice. \nChief Gainer proved me right.\n  Terry Gainer grew up in Illinois, served his country in Vietnam, \nreturned from that war a decorated veteran. His service did not end \nwhen he left the military. Prior to his position with the Illinois \nState Police, he spent 16 years with the Chicago Police Department. \nWith his extensive experience at the highest levels of police work, his \nreputation for professionalism and his tireless commitment\n\n[[Page S3185]]\n\nto the security of our Nation's most honored building and those who \nvisit and work within it, Terry Gainer brought the Capitol Police Force \nto a new level of professionalism.\n  In the words of one of their officers, Chief Gainer transformed the \nCapitol Police Force from an inside operation, where the officers were \noften viewed many times as security guards, to a well-known, highly \nvisible, professional law enforcement team. That change took place at a \ncritical moment in our Nation's history. The threat of terrorism became \nvery real and the vulnerability of the building in which I speak became \nvery obvious. Today, the well-trained group of men and women protecting \nour security today in this hallowed building are among the finest in \nthe Nation, and we are extremely fortunate to have them.\n  As a Member of the Senate whose life was made safer because of Chief \nTerry Gainer's leadership, I am indebted to him for his singular \nservice to Congress and to our country. The Gainer legacy on Capitol \nHill is written in a police force proud of its mission and committed to \nserve and protect. Chief Gainer deserves the gratitude of the Capitol \nfamily for his fine service. He will be missed.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Durbin pertaining to the introduction of S. 2573 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                             Scooter Libby\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the last item I would like to speak to is \none that is now in the news for the last several hours. It has been \nnoted that in the court papers filed by Lewis Scooter Libby before the \nFederal court that he has made some amazing disclosures. You will \nremember that Mr. Libby was Vice President Cheney's chief of staff who \nwas indicted recently over the Valeri Plame incident. The Valeri Plame \nincident involved a situation where someone told Robert Novak, a \ncolumnist, about the identity of a woman who was working undercover to \nprotect the United States. That disclosure was made through White House \nsources which Mr. Novak attributed them to and has been investigated \nsince by Patrick Fitzgerald, who is a special prosecutor on this case \nand the U.S. attorney for the northern district of Illinois.\n  As a result of his investigation to date, Mr. Libby, Vice President \nCheney's chief of staff, has been indicted. Now today there are \ndisclosures that in his court papers he has made some statements which \nare troubling. Before his indictment, according to CNN.com, Lewis Libby \ntestified to the grand jury investigating the CIA leak that Vice \nPresident Cheney told him to pass on the information and that it was \nPresident Bush who authorized the disclosure.\n  According to the documents, the authorization led to a July 8, 2003, \nconversation between Mr. Libby and New York Times reporter Judith \nMiller. There was no indication in this court filing that either \nPresident Bush or Vice President Cheney authorized Mr. Libby to \ndisclose Valeri Plame's CIA identity, but the disclosure in documents \nfiled Wednesday means that the President of the United States and the \nVice President put Lewis Libby in play as a secret provider of \ninformation to reporters about prewar intelligence on Iraq.\n  The authorization came as the Bush administration faced mounting \ncriticism about its failure to find weapons of mass destruction, the \nmain reason the President gave for the invasion of Iraq.\n  Mr. Libby's participation in a critical conversation with New York \nTimes reporter Judith Miller on July 8, 2003, occurred only after the \nVice President advised the defendant, Mr. Libby, that the President of \nthe United States specifically had authorized Mr. Libby to disclose \ncertain information in the National Intelligence Estimate. That is what \nis in the court records. That is what was disclosed today.\n  At the time the National Intelligence Estimate was prepared, I was a \nmember of the Senate Intelligence Committee. I recall it very well \nbecause as we were preparing for the invasion of Iraq, one of the \nsenior staff people on the committee came to me and said: Senator, \nsomething is unusual here. We never make an important decision, let \nalone an invasion of a country, without what is known as a National \nIntelligence Estimate. We bring together all the intelligence agencies \nof our Federal Government, ask them to compare notes, and reach a \nconclusion as to what we are likely to find if we move forward. It has \nnot been done.\n  This was in September. The vote on authorizing the invasion of Iraq \nwas weeks away, and we still hadn't brought together the best minds of \nour intelligence community to determine what we were likely to find \nonce there. So I wrote a letter to George Tenet, head of the Central \nIntelligence Agency, requesting this National Intelligence Estimate, as \nwell as Senator Robert Graham, who joined me, as chairman of the \ncommittee, in making the same request. Within a few weeks, the National \nIntelligence Estimate was prepared and given to us.\n  There has been a lot of review of that estimate ever since. Some \npeople say it was a shoddy job. It was slapped together. It had \nfootnotes that didn't make sense. It was the basis of our intelligence \nfor going to war. But the one thing I can tell you is, the minute it \nwas handed to me in the Intelligence Committee, I was told: This is top \nsecret. This is classified. You disclose this at your own peril. You \nwill be subject to criminal prosecution if you do. It is one of the \nburdens of serving on that committee. You are reminded of that \nconstantly, that no matter what information you absorb, you cannot \nspeak to that information when you leave that closed room.\n  Now we learn that according to Mr. Libby, now under indictment, he \nwas authorized by not only Vice President Cheney but President Bush to \ndisclose information in the National Intelligence Estimate to the \npress. The allegations that are contained here suggest that information \nwas being disclosed in order to overcome criticism that the American \npeople had been misled about weapons of mass destruction.\n  I have to tell you, as a member of that committee, we looked at the \npreparation of this intelligence leading up to the war, and we were \ndisappointed. Our intelligence agencies did not do the professional job \nwe expected of them. I can't explain to you exactly why. Some of it has \nto do with lack of technology, lack of sharing information. Some of it, \nthey were just plain wrong.\n  Their guess and best estimate as to what we would find in Iraq was \nplain wrong. Despite all of the hyperbole about weapons of mass \ndestruction, still today, not a single weapon has been found. Despite \nall of the suggestions that somehow Saddam Hussein was part of the \ntragedy and disaster of 9/11, absolutely no connection has been \nestablished. Despite all of the threats of mushroom clouds from \nCondoleezza Rice and others, it turns out there was no evidence of \nnuclear weapons in Iraq.\n  That information was wrong. The American people were told that we \nhave to go to war, we have to risk the lives of American servicemen \nbecause of a threat that didn't exist. Where are we today? We are still \nthere, and 130,000 American soldiers, as I stand here safely, are \nrisking their lives for America in Iraq. As of this morning, 2,346 \nAmerican soldiers have died in service to their country. We stand in \nawe of their patriotism and courage, but we have to ask some hard \nquestions.\n  The hard questions go to this point: How and when will this war end? \nWhen will the Iraqis reach the point where they accept responsibility \nfor their own country? We can no longer afford to be misled about the \nthreat to the United States and what lies ahead in Iraq. The people I \nspoke to on my recent trip to southern Illinois got it right. One of \nthem said: Why aren't we going to the Iraqi Government and saying that \nover 3 years ago we sent in our soldiers to depose your dictator, a man \nwhom no one respected; we deposed him so that you could take control of \nyour own country. We put American lives on the line so you could hold \nfree elections. We gave you a chance to start your own government. When \nare the Iraqis going to stand up for themselves, their own country, and \ntheir own defense? How many years have we been promised that we are so \nclose to the day when the Iraqi Army will be able to take the place of \nthe U.S. Army? I will believe it when the first American soldier comes \nhome and is replaced by an Iraqi soldier ready to stand and die for \nIraq, as our soldiers do every single day.\n\n[[Page S3186]]\n\n  Sadly, we don't know when that day might come. The President comes \nbefore the American people several weeks ago and what does he say? ``Be \npatient.'' Be patient as more American soldiers are endangered and lose \ntheir lives. Be patient as we face a situation with no end in sight. It \nis hard to counsel patience. When asked directly when will the American \nsoldiers be coming home, what did the President say? That will be up to \nthe next President--the next President.\n  The Iraq war has lasted almost as long as World War II. If we have to \nwait 2\\1/2\\ more years for American soldiers to come home, it will be \none of the longest conflicts in our history. Is this what we bargained \nfor when we invaded Iraq? We know now that the so-called coalition of \nthe willing involved a lot of countries, but primarily it involved \nAmerican lives. It is American soldiers who are standing and fighting \nin vastly greater numbers than any other country that is involved.\n  Let me tell you that the families who wait at home anxiously want to \nknow the same answer to the question I pose: When, Mr. President, is \nthis war going to end? When are we going to turn over the \nresponsibility to the Iraqis?\n  When will we replace American soldiers with Iraqis who will stand and \nfight for Iraq? This last week I was in Illinois and visiting with \nfriends of mine who work in railroad unions. I talked about this issue, \nand a fellow followed me out of the room and said: My son is headed \nover there next week. He started crying. This strong fellow who worked \nfor the railroad all his life was a father whose heart was broken \nknowing his son was going into this danger. How many families have had \nto watch that happen and waited anxiously and expectantly at home for \nthe letters and e-mails and phone calls? How many, sadly, have received \nthe tragic news that they were one of the 2,346 families who lost \nsomeone they loved very much in that country?\n  Mr. President, as I read the allegations in the newspapers from Mr. \nLibby, former Chief of Staff to Vice President Cheney, they were \ndisclosing secret, classified information from a national intelligence \nestimate to the press in the hopes of bolstering the President's \npopularity. It is a grave disappointment. We can do nothing less than \nto investigate this. We need to find out if this did occur. If it did \noccur, the President and Vice President must be held accountable--\naccountable for misleading the American people and for disclosure of \nclassified information for political purposes. That is as serious as it \ngets in this democracy.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Operation Iraqi Freedom: Three Years Later\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, in light of the fact that we have those \nwho are calling for the immediate withdrawal from Iraq, I think we \nought to sit back and look at what has happened in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom for the last 3 years. We have made remarkable progress in Iraq \nin the last 3 years.\n  On March 19, 2003, the United States and coalition forces launched \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. At that time, life in Iraq, under Saddam \nHussein, was marked by brutality and fear and terror. Iraqis had no \nvoice in their country or their lives. Saddam devastated Iraq, wrecked \nits economy, ruined and plundered its infrastructure, and destroyed its \nhuman capital.\n  Let's look at what is happening today. Iraq has a democratically \nelected government. The reign of a dictator has been replaced by a \ndemocratically elected government, operating under one of the most \nprogressive constitutions in the Arab world. Millions of Iraqis have \njoined the political process over the past year alone. Today, Saddam \nHussein is facing justice in an Iraqi court.\n  The Iraqi people are holding Saddam accountable for his crimes and \natrocities. I believe the next year will bring a consolidation of these \ngains, helping a new government stabilize and build a solid foundation \nfor democracy and increased economic growth.\n  Iraq's elected leaders are diligently working to form a government \nthat will represent all the Iraqi people. As the Iraqi Government comes \ntogether and Iraqi security forces improve their readiness, efforts to \nstabilize the nation will increasingly be Iraqi-led.\n  I point out that securing a lasting victory in Iraq will make America \nsafer, more secure, and stronger--make it safer by depriving terrorists \nof a safe haven from which they can plan and launch attacks against the \nUnited States and American interests overseas; more secure by \nfacilitating reform in a region that has been a source of violence and \ndepriving terrorist control over a hub of the world's economy; stronger \nby demonstrating to our friends and enemies the reliability of U.S. \npower, the strength of our commitment to our friends, and the tenacity \nof resolve against our enemies.\n  Despite progress, the situation on the ground is tense. As al-Qaida's \nactions show, terrorists want to impose a dictatorial government on the \nIraqi people. The coalition is united in support of the Iraqi people in \nhelping them win their struggle for freedom. The terrorists know they \nlack the military strength to challenge Iraqi and coalition forces \ndirectly, so their only hope is to try to provoke a civil war and \ncreate despair.\n  The President's national security for victory in Iraq has three \ntracks. I would like to go over those briefly. They are a political \ntrack, a security track, and an economic track, and I would add that \nall three tracks are progressing.\n  On the political track, many are participating in Iraq's political \nprocess. Iraqis completed two successful nationwide elections and a \nnational constitutional referendum in 2005. Each successive election \nexperienced less violence, bigger voter turnout, and broader political \nparticipation. On December 15, more than 75 percent of the Iraqi \nvoting-age population participated in the election for a new \ngovernment--an increase of more than 3 million voters over the January \nelection.\n  I will talk a little bit about the security track.\n  Iraqi security forces are increasingly in the lead. Three years ago, \nunder Saddam Hussein's rule, the Iraqi Army was an instrument of \nrepression. Today, an all-volunteer Iraqi security force is taking \nincreasing responsibility for protecting the Iraqi people.\n  Iraqi security forces are growing in number and assuming a larger \nrole. More than 240,000 Iraqi security forces have been trained and \nequipped. Over 112,000 Iraqi soldiers, sailors, and airmen have now \nbeen trained and equipped. More than 87,000 police have been trained \nand equipped. These police work alongside over 40,000 other Ministry of \nInterior forces.\n  Additional Iraqi battalions are conducting operations. Last fall, \nthere were over 120 Iraqi Army and police combat battalions in the \nfight against the enemy, and 40 of those were taking the lead in the \nfight. Today, the number of battalions in the fight has increased to \nmore than 130, with more than 60 taking the lead.\n  Let's briefly look at the economic track.\n  Iraq's economy is recovering, and the Iraqi people have better access \nto essential services. In 2005, the Iraqi economy grew an estimated 2.6 \npercent in real terms, and the International Monetary Fund has \nestimated it will grow by more than 10 percent in 2006.\n  Mr. President, 3.1 million Iraqis enjoy improved access to clean \nwater, and 5.1 million have improved access to sewage treatment. More \nthan 30 percent of Iraq's schools have been rehabilitated, and more \nthan 36,000 teachers have been trained.\n  This is what our American soldiers in Iraq have helped accomplish for \nthe Iraqi people and for America. We should be proud and thankful for \ntheir willingness to step forward for freedom. Freedom does work. It \nworks for America, and I believe it will work for Iraq. The solution is \nnot a hasty retreat; the solution is to carry on with the President's \nplan for victory.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S3187]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as we all know, there has been an \nannouncement of a resolution or a settlement among a group of Senators \nrelating to the border security and immigration reform bill that is \npending before the Senate, although I would note that the entire Senate \nhas yet to sign off on that agreement. I, for one, want to talk for a \nfew minutes about my concerns regarding the proposal.\n  Last night we were told at approximately 10 o'clock that this \nagreement was struck with a group of Senators. It consists of 525 pages \nand I dare say not many people have read it yet. But my review of the \nagreement causes me some serious concerns about whether it represents \nsomething that reflects good policy or something that would warrant my \nsupport.\n  First, I believe there is a grave risk that the proposal would \nrepresent a repetition of the mistake of 1986 when the Congress passed \nmajor immigration legislation. My colleagues will recall that it was \nthat year Ronald Reagan signed a bill that was acknowledged to be now, \nin retrospect, two different things. The first is it was an amnesty for \n3 million people who entered our country in violation of our \nimmigration laws. The second thing we have come to realize in \nretrospect is it was a complete and total failure when it came to \nsecuring our borders and enforcing our immigration laws.\n  Some have speculated it was the Federal Government's failure to \nprovide employers a means to verify the eligibility of prospective \nemployees that they could work legally in the country, and certainly \nthe failure on the Federal Government's part is a large part of what is \nto blame. The corollary of that is the lack of employer sanctions for \nhiring an illegal workforce. In the past year, we have seen only three \nsanctions filed against employers for hiring illegal aliens to work in \nthe United States.\n  Some have said the reason that bill failed is because it didn't have \nany provision for a legal workforce. I am somewhat sympathetic to that \nargument because I do support comprehensive immigration legislation, \nbut starting first with border security. We know our inability to \ncontrol our borders is not only resulting in massive waves of illegal \nimmigration, but we also know it is a national security risk because \nanyone who has the money to pay a human smuggler or has their wits \nabout them enough to make it over here on their own could literally \nwalk or swim or drive across our border because it is wholly \nunprotected between the authorized ports of entry. We know our Border \nPatrol is sorely undermanned with only about 11,000 Border Patrol \nagents for a 2,000-mile southern border, and contrast that with 39,000 \npolice officers in the city of New York alone.\n  So we can see the Border Patrol has been vastly out manned and \noutnumbered when it comes to the number of people coming across. There \nwere 1.1 million illegal aliens apprehended last year alone.\n  The problem with the 1986 amnesty is that it led to additional \nillegal immigration, and we now have approximately 12 million \nundocumented immigrants--people who have come to this country in \nviolation of our immigration laws. And we have come to learn that our \nbooming economy is a vast magnet for people who want a better life. \nWhile we can all understand that on a very basic human level, we also \nknow the U.S. Government and the people of this country cannot accept \nanyone and everyone who wants to come into this country in violation of \nour immigration laws. Thus, we have a right, as every sovereign nation \nhas, to regulate the flow of people across our borders in our Nation's \nbest interests.\n  I worry that the legislation that is now pending before this body, \nthe so-called Hagel-Martinez compromise, would actually result in a \nfurther magnet for illegal immigration because it, in part, rewards \npeople for coming into the country in violation of our immigration \nlaws.\n  It causes me great concerns in other respects as well. For example, \nthe proposal would not be closed to felons and serial criminal \noffenders. Nor would it be closed to people who had their day in court \nbut failed to comply with the deportation order, showing tremendous \ndisrespect not only for our laws but for the safety and welfare of the \nAmerican people.\n  We also know the current bill that is pending before us prevents \ninformation sharing by the Department of Homeland Security to root out \nfraud, which is another problem with the 1986 amnesty because people \nwere able to generate fraudulent documents to qualify for that amnesty. \nWe know that false documents are a tremendous vulnerability of the \nAmerican people to terrorists and criminals and others who want to come \nacross our borders, and this bill does not do enough to allow us to \nprotect ourselves by investigating and prosecuting that kind of fraud, \nby sharing information, and that is why we need some amendments to be \nargued and voted on by the Senate to fix the serious gaps in this bill.\n  But perhaps one of the gravest concerns I have is this proposed \ncompromise does not protect American workers. Indeed, under this bill, \nup to 12 million people will be able to get green cards. In other \nwords, they will gain the status of a legal permanent resident and a \npath to American citizenship. This is without regard to whether our \neconomy is in a boom status as it is now, with about 4.8 percent \nunemployment, or whether our economy is in a recession, where Americans \nare more likely to be out of work and competing with these 12 million \nnew green card holders for employment. So I believe we need a provision \nin this bill that provides for a true temporary worker program that can \nreflect the ups and downs of the economy.\n  Under this bill there will be a massive one-way migration of people \nfrom countries in Central America and Mexico and South America into the \nUnited States, and no incentives for their return and for maintaining \ntheir ties to their family and their culture and their country in a way \nthat ultimately benefits their country as well. No country on Earth can \nsustain an economic body blow of a permanent migration of its work \nforce out of that country. But this proposal this creates a temporary \nworker category that is not temporary, but is instead an alternative \npath to citizenship. So even though there are some who have talked \nabout a guest worker program or a temporary worker program, this is \nneither. This is an alternative path to citizenship for 12 million \npeople, permanent status in the United States, regardless of whether \nour economy is good or our economy is bad. And when it is bad, these \nindividuals will prove stiff competition indeed for America and people \nborn in these United States, or legal immigrants.\n  There is also no provision in this bill--and this is another concern \nI have for the American worker--that there be a willing employer and a \nwilling employee. In other words, under this bill individuals can come \ninto the country and self petition for green cards or legal permanent \nresidency. Thus, here again, another important protection for the \nAmerican worker is totally ignored under this bill.\n  Another grave concern I have, and this goes back to 1986, is there is \nabsolutely no provision made for employer verification of the \neligibility of prospective employees. As some have said, this is deja \nvu all over again because the Judiciary Committee, as you know, Mr. \nPresident, and as the distinguished ranking member knows, did not have \njurisdiction over that provision of the bill, so it had to be drafted \nby the Finance Committee. Yet there is absolutely no amendment pending. \nI don't know of any plans--maybe there are plans that I am just unaware \nof--that would provide employers the means to verify that individuals \nare indeed eligible to work in the United States and discourage, if not \neliminate, the use of fraudulent documents to claim that authority to \nwork in the United States. Without that, without border security, \nwithout interior enforcement, and without employer verification and \nsanctions for those who do not play by the rules, this bill provides \nanother invitation to massive illegal immigration and constitutes a \nreward to those who have come into our country in violation of our \nlaws.\n\n[[Page S3188]]\n\n  My ultimate concern is we will have a vote on a motion to close off \ndebate on this compromise tomorrow morning. There are a number of \npending amendments that I intend to offer. Of course we know the Senate \nlargely operates by unanimous consent. There is also a desire by \nSenators right before any recess to get on to their homes and their \nfamilies and back to their States. But this is an extremely important \nbill, I would say, even more than most of the issues we consider here \nbecause it is a matter of national security. It is a matter of \nmaintaining the confidence of the American people because, frankly, the \nAmerican people believe we let them down in 1986. They believe the \nSenate is not serious about border security, is not serious about \nworkplace enforcement, and the only way we are going to be able to \ndemonstrate that we are serious is to have a full and fair debate, to \nallow amendments and votes on those amendments on the floor. So far, \nall we have been met with is obstructionism because we have been denied \nthe opportunity to have an up-or-down vote on essential amendments that \nare necessary to improve this bill.\n  I know we will have a vote tomorrow morning. Unless there is some \ngood-faith attempt to reach some accommodation to allow Senators to \noffer those amendments that would improve the bill in the respects I \nhave pointed out, then I expect that we will have a long weekend, and \nperhaps beyond, so there will be an opportunity for us to have the kind \nof debate that is reflective of the world's greatest deliberative body \nand which discharges the responsibility we have to protect the American \npeople, to secure our borders, to make sure we are absolutely serious \nabout enforcing our laws, while at the same time we enact comprehensive \nborder security and immigration reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                                 Darfur\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will not speak for long. I do this \nbecause I wish to speak about the severe humanitarian crisis in Darfur, \nSudan.\n  It has been almost 2 years since the Congress, in a bipartisan effort \nof both the House and Senate, declared the atrocities in Darfur, Sudan, \nto be genocide. That is a word not passed around easily in these halls.\n  Then, about a year and a half ago, the administration publicly \nreached the same conclusion. I know there was debate within the \nadministration whether they would use that word. I commend President \nBush for reaching the same conclusion.\n  What worries me, here is a case where the Senate, the House of \nRepresentatives, and the President of the United States, all came \ntogether to call the atrocities in Darfur, in our day and our age, \ngenocide. But since those declarations, the United States and other \nnations have failed to devise an effective strategy to bring peace to \nthe desperate people of that remote, war-ravaged region. The human cost \nof this failure has been unimaginable. It is staggering.\n  Earlier this month, President Bush celebrated International Women's \nDay. There is no cause for celebration for the women of Darfur, \nthousands of whom have been the victims of rape and other acts of \nsexual violence inflicted by Government security forces and the \nmilitias they support. They use rape as a method of terror.\n  There have been systematic massacres, rape, torture and the burning \nof hundreds of villages, homes--often with the families inside. Darfur \nhas been pillaged and the lives of its people destroyed.\n  The Government of Sudan has repeatedly attempted to disguise its role \nin the violence so it has been impossible to ascertain an accurate \ndeath toll, but somewhere between 200,000 and 300,000 people have died \nof murder or starvation.\n  Many thousands more have ended up in squalid refugee camps after \ntheir homes have been reduced to ashes by the Government-sponsored \njinjaweit militias.\n  At the same time this is happening, we see Sudan's President, Omar \nHassan al-Bashir, squander $4.5 million, in this desperately poor \ncountry, to purchase a 118-foot, 172-ton Presidential yacht so he can \nentertain foreign dignitaries and create a perverse facade of Sudanese \nprogress and sophistication.\n\n  This is progress and sophistication, or a reflection of the ego of a \nleader? Is it progress and sophistication, that children have been \nmurdered and members of the family murdered in front of other members \nof the family?\n  Then, to make this even worse, the President of Sudan, in order to \ntransport it by land from Port Sudan to Khartoum, required severing 132 \nelectric lines, plunging neighborhood after neighborhood into temporary \ndarkness.\n  It is difficult to conceive of the level of greed, arrogance, and \ntwisted logic that would cause the leader of a desperately impoverished \ncountry to waste millions of dollars on a ridiculously ostentatious \nyacht to cruise the Nile River while thousands of the Sudanese children \nhe is supposed to be protecting have fallen victim to the jinjaweit's \nbrutality.\n  Tens of thousands more are at serious risk of death by starvation, \nmalnutrition, disease, and mayhem. Under Secretary General for \nHumanitarian Affairs, Jan Egeland, recently stated that Darfur has \nreturned to ``the abyss'' of early 2004 when the region was ``the \nkilling fields of this world.''\n  The scale of atrocities occurring in Darfur is appalling. For too \nlong the international community has been doing too little, hoping \nagainst reality that somehow the situation would improve.\n  Instead, in recent weeks we have seen the violence spread across the \nborder into Chad. The Government of Sudan is actively exporting the \nDarfur crisis to its neighbor by providing arms to the jinjaweit and \nallowing them to attack Chadian refugees and villagers, seizing their \nlivestock and killing anyone who resists.\n  As a result, 200,000 of the residents of Chad have been forced from \ntheir homes. They have become displaced people in their own country.\n  Earlier this month, the Senate, and rightly so, unanimously passed S. \nRes. 383. It calls on our President to take immediate steps to help \nimprove security in Darfur. The resolution proposed a no-fly zone over \nDarfur and the deployment of NATO troops to support the African Union \nforces currently on the ground.\n  The African Union has done its best, but with only 7,000 troops, \ninadequate resources, and a weak mandate to patrol this vast area, it \nhas been unable to prevent the militias from continuing to attack \ncivilians with impunity.\n  I strongly support a role for NATO to bolster the African Union's \nmission, until the U.N. peacekeeping mission can be fully deployed, \nwhich could take a year or more.\n  Only a few nations have the trained troops to contribute and their \nnumbers are stretched thin among many of the U.N. missions around the \nworld. But NATO troops on the ground could reinforce the African Union \nforce with their superior command and control and intelligence-\ngathering capabilities.\n  Until recently, the Bush administration refused to support additional \ntroops. However, in the last several weeks, President Bush has shown a \nrenewed interest in Darfur. On March 9, in a hearing before the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice testified \nthe administration is committed to the deployment of a larger \npeacekeeping force, and I agree with her on that.\n  Despite the encouraging rhetoric, the administration continues to \nunderfund the African Union mission. The $161 million requested in the \nFiscal Year 2006 supplemental request for peacekeeping in Darfur will \nonly cover the U.S. share to sustain the current number of troops.\n  It will not do anything to pay for the additional troops that \nPresident Bush has finally acknowledged that we need. With people dying \nneedlessly every week, the President must address the Darfur crisis \nmore urgently.\n  Earlier this week, I was pleased to cosponsor an amendment, which was \naccepted, to the FY 2006 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill to \nadd $50 million in peacekeeping funds for Darfur.\n  The funds in the supplemental bill for peacekeeping in Darfur were \nbarely adequate to support the current African Union mission through \nthe rest of\n\n[[Page S3189]]\n\nthis fiscal year. The additional $50 million will go to training and \nequipping the African Union force that has done its best despite scarce \ntraining and too little heavy equipment.\n  There is no question the Government of Sudan bears a great deal of \nresponsibility for the crimes against humanity that have occurred and \ncontinue to occur within its borders, and now in eastern Chad.\n  It has sponsored brutal militias, hampered the African Union \npeacekeepers, and impeded the work of the international relief \norganization.\n  Most recently, it has opposed reconstituting the African Union force \nas a U.N. force, presumably fearing that the United Nations could pose \na challenge to its own ability to act with impunity in a part of the \nworld that is often beyond the spotlight of public scrutiny.\n  But we in this country, the richest, most powerful Nation on Earth, a \ncountry blessed with so many advantages, have done too little to stop \nthe genocide in Sudan. Many more lives could have been saved if we and \nother nations had shown stronger leadership.\n  This is not just an economic or military issue; this is a moral \nissue. With all the blessings this country receives, we have a moral \nresponsibility to stop genocide.\n  In our history, we have known what has happened when we have moved \ntoo slowly when we had a chance to stop genocide. We either moved too \nslowly or we did not move at all when genocide occurred.\n  Let us match the rhetoric with resources to support the number of \ntroops needed to do the job. Let us set an example by our own \nleadership to the rest of the world that we will put an end to the \nviolence. This is something on which I believe all Americans--\nRepublicans and Democrats--would agree. It is something that, if we \nbelieve in a higher calling, we will do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Leahy, ranking member on \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  I have received just this afternoon in my office some disturbing news \nin the form of correspondence from the Congressional Budget Office. It \nsuggests a number of areas where the amendment we are talking about \nhere today, No. 3424, the immigration so-called compromise, violates \nour budget and the rules of the Senate.\n  Let me read from the correspondence we have received. This is \nsomething, as you know, Mr. President, as a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, that we never discussed at all. It is not a matter we spent \nany time at all discussing as we moved forward with legislation which \nultimately cleared that committee and came to the floor--legislation \nwhich I thought was not good legislation and which I opposed, and so \ndid the Senator from Texas, who just relinquished the Chair. We didn't \ndiscuss the financial impact of the legislation before us.\n  One of the things our rules of the Senate require is that if a bill \nis on the floor that is in violation of a budget we have adopted, it is \nsubject to a budget point of order. I am not going to make that budget \npoint of order now because I am sure someone here would want to move to \nwaive that budget point of order, but I am giving the heads up to those \nwho are supporting this bill that it is a budget buster.\n  We have not yet begun to figure out how much this legislation will \ncost. I will be quoting from the Congressional Budget Office, which is \nthe authoritative department to determine these matters. They have \ngiven us a preliminary report.\n  Let me read from the correspondence they have given and which I have \njust received.\n\n       CBO has estimated the cost of some--but not all--of the \n     provisions of the proposed Hagel-Martinez amendment to the \n     immigration bill. The version we are working with is labeled \n     O:/MDM/MDM06671 and was provided to us this morning.\n\n  One reason they got this this morning was that this so-called \ncompromise which was hatched yesterday was not even printed until 10 \no'clock last night.\n  We have been talking about these problems for weeks and we produced \nthe bill that came out of committee--I don't know what name to put on \nit; the Specter-Kennedy-McCain amendment, the bill that came out of \ncommittee--and it was crushed on the floor of the Senate, with 60 \npeople refusing to move to a final up-or-down vote on it, 60 to 39.\n  We have now the compromise desperately put together by people--well \nmeaning, no doubt, but none of whom bring any particular experience, \nknowledge to the problem facing us. And I assure you, if in the 5 days \nof markup in Judiciary Committee we didn't discuss the actual cost of \nthis program, I am sure, as they worked feverishly into the night last \nnight, they didn't consider it either. They had no idea. But this was a \npolitical discussion about how to put a bill together that politically \nmight pass around here regardless of the details of it.\n  Frankly, we are going to have to deal with the specifics of illegal \nimmigration. It is too important to treat it at a superficial level.\n  There are bills which, when we come up to a recess, the leader has to \npush, and you always try to do those things, and people make \ncompromises, and they pass. But this is not a normal bill at all. The \nAmerican people care about it, and we owe them some things.\n  I don't think there are any Senators here who haven't been back to \ntheir States and made some commitments and stated some principles that \nthey thought are critical to a good immigration bill, and I want them \nto be aware of what we are talking about.\n  The bill number which the Congressional Budget Office referenced is \nthe pending amendment, No. 3424, to the Frist motion to commit.\n  Let me continue now with what we received from the Congressional \nBudget Office:\n\n       The figures in this e-mail do NOT include costs associated \n     with the conditional nonimmigrant provisions, which we are \n     still working on. They also do NOT include revenue losses and \n     outlays for the Earned Income Tax Credit, which we will be \n     getting from the Joint Tax Committee and which results \n     largely from the conditional non-immigrant provisions. Those \n     revenue losses and Earned Income Tax Credit outlays may be \n     significant.\n\n  I will talk about the average salary of most of the workers who are \nhere illegally today and those workers who will be regularized, placed \non permanent resident status, given a green card, and placed on a \npathway to citizenship. As you look at those salaries, you will see \nthat they fall in the classic earned income tax credit range.\n  I have had occasion for some time to wrestle with the earned income \ntax credit. A lot of people oppose it entirely. You file your tax \nreturn, and if you don't owe any taxes and you have a lower income, you \nget a tax rebate from the Government. You don't pay taxes; they give \nyou an average rebate. I submit that salaries for these workers are \ngoing to be pretty close to the average recipient of the earned income \ntax credit benefit. The average recipient gets $2,400 a year by way of \na tax credit. Persons who are working here illegally today are not \ncurrently getting the earned income tax credit, but if we regularize \nthem and make them permanent residents, they will. That will cost us a \nlot of money.\n  The Congressional Budget Office is saying they haven't considered \nthose numbers yet in the cost of this bill, but they are real and \nsignificant, as I say they, indeed, are.\n  They go on to say this:\n\n       With those important caveats, estimated outlays are about \n     $2 billion for the first 5 years--2007-2011--and $12 billion \n     for the first 10 years--2007-2016. The final figures will be \n     bigger than those. Most of those costs are for Medicaid and \n     Food Stamp programs.\n\n  They say those are not the final figures. The final figures will be \nbigger. It didn't include the earned income tax credit.\n  They go on to say this:\n\n       Outlays in the succeeding 10 years will be greater. The \n     bill would impose mandates on State and local governments \n     with costs that would exceed the threshold established in the \n     Unfunded Mandates Reform Act in at least 1 of the first 5 \n     years after they would take effect.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this message from the Congressional \nBudget Office be printed in the Record so that my colleagues can begin \nto look at it and begin to understand that we have a budget problem \nwith this bill, among other things.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S3190]]\n\n\n     From: Paul Cullinan.\n     Sent: April 6, 2006.\n     To: Ed Corrigan.\n     Subject: Partial cost estimate for immigration amendment.\n\n       CBO has estimated the cost of some--but not all--of the \n     provisions of the proposed Hagel-Martinez amendment to the \n     immigration bill. The version we are working with is labeled \n     O: MDM MDM 06671 and was provided to us this morning.\n       The figures in this e-mail do NOT include costs associated \n     with the conditional nonimmigrant provisions, which we're \n     still working on. They also do NOT include revenue losses and \n     outlays for the Earned Income Tax Credit, which we will be \n     getting from the Joint Tax Committee and which result largely \n     from the conditional non-immigrant provisions. Those revenue \n     losses and EITC outlays may be significant.\n       With those important caveats, estimated outlays are about \n     $2 billion for the first five years (2007-2011) and $12 \n     billion for the first ten years (2007-2016). The final \n     figures will be bigger than those. Most of those costs are \n     for the Medicaid and Food Stamp programs.\n       Outlays in the succeeding 10 years will be greater. The \n     bill would impose mandates on State and local governments \n     with costs that would exceed the threshold established in the \n     Unfunded Mandates Reform Act in at least one of the first \n     five years after they would take effect.\n       If you have any questions, please call Paul Cullinan, Eric \n     Rollins, or myself.\n                                                     Bob Sunshine,\n                           Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the Senate Judiciary Committee, under \nthe 2006 budget resolution, has only $6 million remaining. We are \ntalking about a minimum of $2 billion in costs, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, under the first 5 years of this \nimmigration bill which is before us today, but the Judiciary Committee, \nunder our budget resolution, has only $6 million remaining in its \ndirect spending allocation for the next 5 years.\n  CBO's preliminary estimate, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice letter I just read, is that amendment No. 3224 will spend at \nleast $2 billion during that period and likely much more over that \nperiod and the next 5 years. This far exceeds the $6 million--it might \nsound large to you, but in the scheme of things we discuss today, it is \na paltry sum--allocated to the committee under the budget.\n  On this basis, we need to review what we should do as a Senate. I \nthink it is appropriate and the right thing that the Senate confront \nthe question and make a decision as to whether we should waive that \npoint of order and go forward with this legislation or not waive it, in \nwhich case the bill would be subject to failure.\n  I note that the Budget Committee has responsibilities in this, and \nevery aspect of that has not been completed to date, and it may be \npremature to move to make such a motion at this time. I am sharing this \nwith everyone so they can be prepared to think through the consequences \nof this cost, which has not been discussed whatsoever. In fact, if you \nlisten to some of the proponents of the legislation before us, if we \njust pass this bill, it is going to make us all rich, everybody is \ngoing to do better, for the first time people are going to pay taxes, \nthe economy is going to improve, and the average guy is going to be \nfine. The reality is, that did not happen in 1986 and it is not going \nto happen this time because many of these benefits are such that they \nare not available to people here illegally. Under this law they will \nbecome legal.\n\n  We are going to see a rise in costs to our Government beyond that \nwhich is permitted by the budget we all voted on, we all agreed to, and \nwe all said we need to stand by. I should not say ``all,'' but enough \nvoted to pass the budget. The budget is a very significant and \nimportant document. Many of us take very seriously this cap we agreed \nto place on spending and agreed not to pass legislation that would \nbreak those caps, even if we like the underlying amendment or bill that \nwould spend money. That violates the budget. On many occasions I have \nfelt it my duty to vote ``no'' because I agreed to a budget number. \nThis Congress and this Senate has agreed to budget caps. The very \nsignificant factor is that today we now know the Hagel-Martinez \namendment violates that Budget Act. I am sure the committee bill also \ndid, but it would appear this may be further along.\n  We have seen amnesty before in our country, in 1986, and the record \nis clear that American taxpayers did pay the cost of the fiscal deficit \ncreated by the 3 million beneficiaries under the 1986 amnesty. Of \ncourse, the original estimates were that 1 million, 1.5 million people \nwould qualify for amnesty in 1986. Now they are estimating 12 million. \nBut, in fact, 3 million showed up in 1986 and claimed the benefits of \namnesty, many using documents that were dubious.\n  A 1997 study conducted by the Center for Immigration Studies \nestimated that the 3 million newly legalized aliens in the 1986 amnesty \nhad generated a net fiscal deficit of $24 billion in the short decade \nthat passed since their arrival. The 3 million cost the Government $24 \nbillion. That is a very large sum of money.\n  Incidentally, when Congress passed the 1986 amnesty bill, it \nestimated only 1 million illegal aliens would qualify for that amnesty \nlaw and draw upon the Treasury. That is how the numbers were out of \nsync.\n  There is no doubt about it, American taxpayers will pay if this \nlegislation passes. If this, what I consider to be fairly described as \namnesty, passes, the American taxpayers will pay the cost of this \namnesty and it will be a drain on our programs that are designed to \nprovide health care and assistance to American citizens and those who \ncame here lawfully to achieve legal permanent status.\n  According to the Pew Hispanic Center report from last year, the \naverage family income in 2003 for unauthorized migrants in the country \nfor less than 10 years was $25,700, while those who had been in the \ncountry a decade or more earned $29,000.\n  Given that the average family income for illegal immigrants is just \nabove the 2006 Federal poverty line of $20,000, it is not surprising \nthat many of these families will likely rely on social service programs \nto meet their basic needs. That is what we know will occur.\n  Though the exact cost of this new amnesty is impossible to absolutely \ndetermine, certainly CBO is providing a low figure that they can verify \nas of this date. We can learn a lot by looking at existing studies that \ngive us a glimpse at the cost of illegal immigration to our social \nprogram. For example, the Center for Immigration Studies estimated that \nin 2001, 31 percent of illegal households used at least one of four \nmajor welfare programs: Medicaid, SSI, TANF, which is temporary \nassistance for needy families, which is a basic welfare program, or \nfood stamps. That is a very large number. It is not improbable \nconsidering the other numbers about the average income, knowing that \nthere are so many below the poverty line.\n  The Urban Institute estimates in 2000, 47,000 families in the United \nStates headed by one or two illegal aliens received TANF, the temporary \nassistance for needy families, on behalf of their children--47,000 is a \npretty dramatic number.\n  Further, if each of these families received greater than $1,000 a \nyear, the amount spent for a TANF household by illegal aliens could \neasily reach tens of millions of dollars.\n  I see others who wish to speak and I will follow up on this later. I \nam saying we have to deal with the reality. Unfortunately, we have not \nspent a lot of time thinking through the full consequences of our \nactions. We have not had economists, we have not had experts, we have \nnot had Government officials, we have not had professors and scientists \ndiscuss with us the impact of this legislation and how we can pass \nlegislation that would best help those who come here, and how we can do \nso in a way that does not adversely impact the Treasury of the United \nStates.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business so I can engage the distinguished chairman of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee in a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S3191]]\n\n                             Joint Inquiry\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks \nof September 11, 2001, Congress convened a bipartisan, bicameral joint \ninquiry into the activities of the intelligence community before and \nafter the attacks. I had the opportunity to serve on the joint inquiry \nand I am proud of the work that was accomplished there.\n  In December of 2002, a report was issued in which we stated that the \ninspector general of the CIA should ``conduct investigations and \nreviews as necessary to determine whether and to what extent personnel \nat all levels should be held accountable for any omission, commission, \nor failure to meet professional standards in regards to the \nidentification, prevention, or disruption of terrorist attacks.''\n  The report went on to state that the Director of the CIA should take \nappropriate action in response to the inspector general's review.\n  The CIA Inspector General completed his report in June 2005. I was \nsurprised that the report took so long to complete, but I am impressed \nwith its quality. After the report of the 9/11 Commission and the joint \ninquiry itself, it is one of the most thorough examinations of the \nintelligence community activity before September 11. It provides a \nunique perspective and makes a number of findings that in my view \nshould be available to the American people as part of the historical \nrecord. It also makes a number of recommendations that should be \ncarefully considered.\n  The public has a right to see these recommendations consistent with \nthe protection of our national security. The American people should be \nable to read the report and decide for themselves whether the \nrecommendations of the CIA inspector general have been carried out in a \nsatisfactory manner. Both the chairman and the vice chairman of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee have supported the release of this \nreport.\n  As Chairman Roberts has put it, ``The deaths of nearly 3,000 citizens \non September 11, 2001, gives the American people a strong interest in \nknowing what the [inspector general] found and whether those whose \nperformance was lacking will be held accountable.''\n  Despite the chairman's request, the CIA has decided not to act on the \ninspector general's recommendations at all. Not to act at all. It is \nimportant to note that the inspector general did not recommend that \ncertain individuals be held accountable. The inspector general merely \nrecommended that the action or inaction of certain individuals be \nexamined to determine whether they should be held accountable. CIA \nDirector Porter Goss has refused to allow even this initial \nexamination.\n  Two months ago I wrote to the Director of the CIA, Mr. Goss, asking \nthis report be declassified and released as soon as possible. I \nnotified Director Goss if I did not see any progress within 60 days I \nwould take action to release this report to the public. It has been \nover 60 days and still the CIA has not responded.\n  In the interest of making this report public and available to the \nAmerican people, I ask now unanimous consent the Senate direct the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence to make this report available \nto the American people as soon as possible.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I agree \nwith the Senator from Oregon that this is a very important report. We \nwere, as everyone knows, viciously attacked on September 11 and in the \naftermath of those attacks we wanted answers. Many of those answers \nhave been found during the last 4 years and some of those answers are \ncontained in the report. But the families of the victims of September \n11 have a right to these answers and the American people have a right \nto these answers.\n  At the same time, I tell my colleague, we need to be sensitive to the \nfact that there is properly classified national security information \nthat is included in this report, and this information needs to be \nprotected.\n  While the Senator is correct that the CIA has not been adequately \nresponsible to him or to me, I suggest that rather than release the \nreport immediately in unredacted form, we instead sit down with the \ninspector general and work to redact any information that needs to \nremain classified in the interest of national security.\n  So I object to the Senator's request and suggest instead that we work \nwith the inspector general to review this report and determine what can \nbe appropriately released to the public.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation to the \nchairman of the Intelligence Committee for his willingness to work with \nme and for the suggestions and discussions that we have had. I would \nlike to suggest that we bring this issue to the inspector general \nimmediately and ask the inspector general to release this report within \n30 days. If the Senator agrees to bring this issue to the inspector \ngeneral immediately so that staff can begin working with the inspector \ngeneral's office over the upcoming 2-week recess, and the chairman and \nI can review their progress when we return, then I would be willing to \nwithdraw my unanimous consent request that this report be made public \nimmediately at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon for his \nwillingness to cooperate on this issue. It is an important one, and I \nlook forward to working with him on it. This certainly sounds \nreasonable to me. So I think he is absolutely correct in his \nsuggestion. I will be happy to work with him.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, because we are going to work together \ncooperatively to turn this around in the next 30 days, I withdraw my \nunanimous consent request at this time and express my appreciation to \nchairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Roberts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                          Excused from voting\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be excused \nfrom voting until the first vote that occurs on April 24.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, at 10:30 this morning, the proponents of \nwhat I would have to say is amnesty in the bill that came out of the \ncommittee, the Kennedy-McCain-Specter bill, or whatever name you want \nto give it, that bill was crushed in this body with 39 votes for and 60 \nvotes against. It was pulled and removed from the docket and sent back \nto Committee. Then we had a group get together yesterday in an effort \nto develop what they call a compromise. They could see that there was a \nvote coming, and they thought they could put something together, and I \ndon't blame them. It has been referred to as the Hagel compromise. But \nwe have looked at the bill, and I have to tell my colleagues, if you \nvoted against the Kennedy bill this morning, you need not support the \nHagel compromise because it is fundamentally the same thing. I am going \nto talk about it and explain how it is essentially the same bill.\n  I wish it weren't the same thing. I wish it was something we could \nsupport. I would like to support good legislation. We have an \nopportunity--a real opportunity--to fix the problem with security and \nimmigration in our country. Our Nation is at risk. Our borders are not \nunder control. However, we have the capacity to do it. It is not that \nhard. I have said it before, and I have explained how we can do it.\n  T.J. Bonner, the head of the National Border Patrol Council said: It \nis real simple. You simply fix up the border. You remove the magnet of \na job by having real workplace enforcement and, all of a sudden, things \ncan go in the right direction.\n  This bill does none of that. It rewards bad behavior, it would \nencourage illegal behavior in the future, and we should not pass it. It \nis against what so many of us promised that we would\n\n[[Page S3192]]\n\nvote for and we don't have a lot of time. That bill was hatched \nyesterday after a few Senators met somewhere and thought they could \nwaltz in and just fix it. They expected all of us to line up and vote \nfor it. I don't believe people are going to line up and vote for it.\n  They produced this compromise and introduced it, and we didn't get a \ncopy until 10 o'clock last night. This compromise that we got late last \nnight is 525 pages long. What is in it? Ninety-five percent of what is \nin it, I have to tell you, is just what you voted against and rejected \nthis morning. We rejected it because it was not a good piece of \nlegislation. It did not do what we promised the American people we were \ngoing to do as individual Senators. If you look at the expressions of \nSenators as a group, time and again they say things that they believe \nare legitimate principles. These bills do not reflect those principles.\n  The President has said he is against an automatic path to \ncitizenship, and he is against amnesty, both of which are in this bill. \nThe President needs to read it. When you go out and campaign and tell \npeople what you are going to do, you need to honor that commitment.\n  Let me tell you some of the things that are in this Hagel compromise. \nIt triples--triples--the number of employment-based green cards \navailable each year. This is not a committee that met yesterday. This \nis a group of people, ad hoc Senators got together and huddled. The \nSenator in the chair there, he has been in a huddle, Quarterback George \nAllen. They got in a huddle, and with very little time and effort to \nstudy the issues, they came up with this legislation. Ninety-five \npercent of it was what was in the bill we rejected just this morning. \nWhat does it do? One of the most significant things that we have given \nvery little thought to is it triples the number of employment-based \ngreen cards available each year. It triples the number.\n  Currently, there are 140,000 available. Currently, spouses and \nchildren, if they come in, they count against the 140,000 cap. Under \nthe Kennedy bill that we voted down this morning they jumped that \nnumber to 400,000, and spouses and children didn't count against the \ncap. This bill raises it to 450,000 annually, and spouses and \nchildren--we estimate about 540,000 more, family members--can come with \nthem, and they do not count against the cap. That is pushing a million \na year. That is a huge change.\n  I, personally, am of the view that if we can make our system lawful \nand have it work correctly, we can and will want to increase the \nnumber. But triple the number, and then increase that number again, by \nallowing spouses and children to come and not count against the cap? \nThat is a sixfold increase. Without any hearings? Without any \neconomists? Without listening to the labor unions? Without listening to \nbusiness people tell us how many people we really need? Without any \nprofessors or scientists who understand the impact this kind of huge \nnumbers would have? They propose we accept this compromise, and it goes \nbeyond the Kennedy proposal that was rejected this morning.\n  It changes the amnesty process for the current number of people. \nThese 450,000 plus family members are, for the most part people who \nlive outside the country. They apply and can come in. So the total \nnumber who come in with a green card--which means you are a permanent \nresident citizen and you are on an automatic path to citizenship--this \nis supposed to be for those people.\n  The message is we want a guest worker program. That is what they \nsaid. We want a guest worker program. What does that sound like, if you \nare an American citizen trying to evaluate what your legislators are \ndoing up here? I hope those American people who are watching are \nfollowing this closely because these are not guest workers.\n  Somebody said let's not call it guest workers anymore, let's call it \ntemporary workers. But they are not temporary workers either. They get \na green card. They come in under this new H-2C program, and they are \nable then, on the petition of an employer, to get a green card within 1 \nyear. If they don't have an employer petition for them, they can self-\npetition, which is not the rule now. Now these are supposed to be based \non employment that is needed.\n  President Bush says a company that needs workers certifies they need \nyou. Now you can self-certify and within 5 years you can be placed on \nan automatic path to citizenship. They never have to return home. That \nis all I am saying. Anybody who says this is a temporary worker program \nor guest worker program is not correct the way this language is in the \nbill.\n  These numbers do not include all that is in the bill. The AgJOBS bill \ncame up on the floor a little over a year ago and was debated and \nblocked. Senator Saxby Chambliss, who chairs the Agriculture Committee, \nand a number of us raised objections to that bill. We blocked it. It \ndid not go forward. It did not pass.\n  They blithely added the whole AgJOBS bill to the committee bill and \nit has now been made part of this compromise. There are 1.5 million who \ncan come in under the AgJOBS bill.\n  People say we need the talented people. We still have limits on \ntalented people who come into the country with high education levels, \nbut there is virtually no limit on the number of unskilled workers who \ncome into our country. That is not good public policy, I submit. That \nis probably not what you said when you have been out campaigning and \ntalking to your constituents around the country.\n  Under the current law, before new legislation passes, the United \nStates issues 1.1 million green cards a year. That is what we do today, \nand 140,000 of those green cards are available to aliens who are \nsponsored by employers. That is the working group. Under the Hagel-\nMartinez compromise bill, the United States would now issue between 2.2 \nmillion and 2.5 million green cards each year, 450,000 of which will be \nemployment-based green cards during the years 2007 and 2016. That is \ntriple the number of employment-based green cards we currently issue on \nan annual basis, triple the number we currently issue. Although the \nnumber would be curtailed after a few years, it is still 150,000 more \nthan currently issued. After 2016, the number of green cards for \nemployer-sponsored aliens would go back to double the current level, at \n290,000.\n\n  They have also increased the employment-based green card cap--that is \nthe total limit, over and above the 450,000 that would now be available \neach year under the compromise--by exempting spouses and children from \ncounting against the cap. Spouses and children count against the cap \ntoday. So we triple the number, and we don't count spouses and \nchildren. Because an average of 1.2 family members accompany \nemployment-based green card holders, we estimate that about 540,000 \nfamily members will also get employment-based green cards without \ncounting against this cap. That is contrary to what we do today. It is \ncontrary to our policy. This is a huge change is all I am saying.\n  Maybe after thorough debate we might want to go that far. I doubt it. \nI think we want to increase the number of legal workers who come to our \ncountry but surge these numbers this much without any discussion \nwhatsoever? This means next year we could have 990,000--that is almost \na million--employment-based green cards issued: 550,000 for the \nworkers, 540,000 for the family members. That is equal to the total \nnumber of green cards we handed out this year for all categories, \nincluding employment-based, family-based, asylum, refugees, \ncancellation of removal, and so forth.\n  Using the estimate from our population chart, based on the CRS data \nand the Pew Hispanic data, the way the new amnesty categories would \nwork is as follows. This is what is in the compromise.\n  If you are here for 5 or more years--and that includes 8.85 million \nof the 11.5 to 12 million people who are estimated to be here, or 75 \npercent of those who are estimated to be here today--what happens to \nyou? You are treated just like you were under the Kennedy bill that was \nrejected this morning. You get to stay, work, apply for a green card \nfrom inside the United States.\n  Again, what does green card mean? It means you are a permanent \nresident, eligible for all the social welfare benefits that belong to \nAmerican citizens, No. 1. No. 2, it puts you on a guaranteed path to \ncitizenship. This is your\n\n[[Page S3193]]\n\nreward for violating the law by coming in illegally.\n  Under this bill, 75 percent of them, 8.85 million would get to stay \nand apply for green cards from inside the United States, just like the \nrejected bill earlier today provided for. And in addition, spouses and \nchildren would get those green cards as well. And they, spouses and \nchildren, would get green cards even if they are not in the United \nStates.\n  So if the person came here to work temporarily, planned to go back to \nhis family, didn't have a plan to stay here permanently and intended to \ngo back to his country of origin, make a little extra money to help out \nthe family, now we have encouraged them to go ahead and bring their \nfamily here. That would be a large number. That will impact more than \nthe 1.1 million who are covered by the bill, according to the \nestimates.\n  They do not count against any family or employment caps or green \ncards. We do currently have a limit. We are supposed to have a limit on \nthe total number who can come in as permanent workers on the path to \ncitizenship so none of these would count against the caps, out of the \n11 to 12 million.\n  So 75 percent of the 11.5 million are like that. What about those in \nthe compromise? They say we are going to be a little different than the \nKennedy bill for those 1.4 million people who have been here from 2 to \n5 years. What happens to those that have only been here illegally for 2 \nto 5 years? You get to stay legally, and you are able to continue to \nwork in the United States while you apply for a work visa if, within 3 \nyears, at any time during that 3 years, you go across the border \nthrough a consular office and pick up a nonimmigrant visa that you can \napply for from the United States. Although the Department of Homeland \nSecurity Secretary may waive the departure requirement. So you can go \nacross the border, go to the office, pick up the thing and come right \nback the same day.\n  Spouses and children get the same status. If they came here \nillegally, they get the same green card status, but they don't have to \ngo across the border to pick it up, they can get it right here at home. \nIf they apply for the H-2C, a new work visa created under title IV, the \nemployer can sponsor them for a green card the day they come back into \nthe United States.\n  The employer can petition that day to get them a green card. Once you \nget that green card, you are a legal, permanent resident, entitled to \nthe welfare and governmental benefits of our country.\n  What about those who are here for less than 2 years? That is not \ndirectly addressed in this compromise bill that we now have before us \nthat is supposed to solve all of our problems. Unfortunately, it \ndoesn't solve them.\n  The compromise sponsors will tell you that the people who have been \nhere less than 2 years--that is about 1.2 to 1.7 million--will have to \nleave immediately or be deported.\n  First, let me ask how many people are being apprehended and deported \ntoday? Who is going to apprehend and deport these people who are here \nillegally in the last year?\n  I raise that as a practical question.\n  But under the bill language, you can qualify for the new H-2C worker \nprogram, even if you are unlawfully present in the United States.\n  My legal counsel is a smart reader of the law.\n  This is the way the bill explains it. It doesn't say that plainly. It \nsays:\n\n       In determining the alien's admissibility as an H-2C \n     nonimmigrant. . . . paragraphs (5), (6)(A), (7), (9)(B) and \n     (9)(C) of section 212(a) may be waived for conduct that \n     occurred before the effective date.\n\n  What does all that mean?\n  If you do not have time to put aside the statute, the compromise \nbill, and go back and read the underlying statute, you don't know what \nit means, but if you do that, as my counsel did, you will see that is a \npretty sneaky maneuver. As I noted, under the new H-2C program, 400,000 \nper year can get green cards as workers, and these people will qualify \nfor that because those code sections refer to aliens who came here \nillegally and those who have been ordered removed but have come \nillegally will go back into the United States.\n  The last bunch, the 1.2 million that have been here less than 2 \nyears, they are not going to leave this country.\n  First of all, nobody is going to come and get them. They are going to \napply under the new visa program, the H-2C worker program that has \nthese huge numbers that we have triple the numbers for. And it \nspecifically says in the statute that they will qualify, even if they \ncame here illegally or have been apprehended here illegally or \nremoved--and removed from the United States--and they have come back \nillegally, they still get to qualify and stay here.\n  We don't need to vote for a bill such as that.\n  By the way, in reading the bill carefully, my fine staff discovered--\nit is kind of hard to do all this when you get a bill last night at 10 \np.m. which is 325 pages--that those here illegally, whom I just \nmentioned, in the last 2 years or have been removed and come back \nillegally, they do not even count against the cap. Why would we want to \ndo that?\n  I say to you that whoever drafted the bill--I don't really say this \nto the sponsors because the sponsors of the compromise who met for a \nfew hours and put this thing together didn't realize who all had worked \non it. I guess it is the forces who believe that no illegal alien \nshould be left behind. So everybody who is here illegally gets to stay \nin the country, and they don't even count against the cap for the green \ncard.\n  I don't think we ought to welcome back into this country someone who \nhas been apprehended, deported and removed from the country and they \ncome back again illegally. They ought not to be allowed to stay, \nperiod, much less be given a permanent status and much less be put on a \npath to citizenship, which this compromise legislation will do.\n  We think somebody had to have intended this. Somebody who was \ninvolved in the writing of this knew what they were doing and \ndefinitely wanted to include everybody to make sure that they could say \npublicly: Well, if it is 5 years, you know you can stay, but if is less \nthan 5 years, you could be removed. None will be removed unless they \nare convicted of a felony or three misdemeanors.\n  They basically said you wouldn't be eligible for citizenship if you \ncame here after January of 2004. That is not true. The bill covers \neverybody. That is part of the compromise legislation and still part of \nit. It is part of the Kennedy bill that we roundly rejected this \nmorning, and it is part of the compromise that is before us now.\n  Let me take a few minutes to run over some of the provisions in that \n95 percent of the Kennedy bill that was rejected this morning that \nremains in the Hagel compromise.\n  Here are some of the difficulties with it.\n  Let us take loophole No. 1: Absconders and some individuals with \nfelonies or 3 misdemeanors are not barred from getting amnesty.\n  An absconder is somebody who was apprehended by Border Patrol people, \ndetained, they did not have time to take him or her out of the country, \nthey were busy, they did not have jail space, detention space for them, \nso they release them on bail. That is what they do all over the country \nbecause we don't take this seriously, and they don't show up when they \nare supposed to be deported. Surprise. They abscond.\n  Absconders and some individuals with felonies or three misdemeanors \nare not barred from getting amnesty.\n  Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, different crimes make \naliens ``inadmissible,'' ``deportable,'' or ``ineligible'' for specific \nbenefits.\n  As written, the Specter substitute--it is included in this bill--only \nrequires an alien to show they are not ``inadmissible'' to qualify for \nthe amnesty contained in the bill. However, some felonies make an alien \n``inadmissible,'' but some do not.\n  Absconders--aliens with final orders of removal who are currently \nwatched by ICE immigration officers--should not be eligible for \namnesty. They remain eligible for this amnesty. The Kyl-Cornyn \namendment that was blocked by the other side so we couldn't get a vote \non it, was designed to fix this loophole. It would keep aliens with \nfelony convictions or three misdemeanors from being eligible for the \nnew amnesty program. Surely, we agree on that. If we had a vote on it, \nI am sure it would pass.\n\n[[Page S3194]]\n\n  But the leader on the other side has managed to block us from getting \na vote.\n  Loophole No. 2: Aliens specifically barred from receiving immigration \nbenefits for life because they filed a frivolous asylum application \nwill also be able to receive amnesty. Under INA, section 208(d)(6), if \nthe Attorney General determines that an alien knowingly filed a \nfrivolous asylum application, the alien will be permanently \nineligible for any benefits under the INA. This bill changes that. On \npage 333, it says: ``Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \nSecretary shall adjust . . . '' an alien who meets the requirement of \nINN 245B. There is no provision that states that the alien is eligible \nfor amnesty if they file a frivolous asylum application. It, therefore, \ngives benefits to aliens previously barred from all immigration \nbenefits.\n\n  Loophole No. 3: All aliens who are subject to a final order of \nremoval--for some reason you are brought up and the court has ordered \nyou removed from the country--who failed to leave pursuant to a \nvoluntary departure agreement, they entered into those agreements and \noftentimes people promise to leave and never leave--or who are subject \nto the reinstatement of a final order of removal because they illegally \nreentered after being ordered removed from the United States are also \neligible for amnesty.\n  I call on my colleagues to look at the bill. On page 353, line 3, the \nbill clearly states that any alien with a final order of removal can \napply for amnesty. This means that the aliens who have already received \ntheir day in court have had their case fully litigated, and they have \nbeen ordered removed and have failed to depart will now be rewarded for \nnot following the law and leaving like they were ordered to do. They \nwill qualify for this amnesty.\n  This will include many of the 37,000 Chinese nationals that China has \nrefused to take back. I understand maybe they have agreed to take them \nback in the last day or so, but they have been pretty recalcitrant on \nit. I will be surprised if they are all approved for repatriation.\n  But do you see how important this could be.\n  Loophole No. 4: Aliens who illegally entered the country multiple \ntimes are also eligible for amnesty. Page 334, line 8 requires \ncontinuous physical presence and states than an alien must not have \ndeparted from the United States before April 5, 2006, except for brief, \ncasual or innocent departures. Every time the alien reenters the United \nStates illegally, they are committing a criminal offense. But this bill \nrewards those aliens with amnesty also.\n  Loophole No. 5: This bill allows aliens who have persecuted anyone on \naccount of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular \nsocial group or political opinion get amnesty. It fails to make \npersecutors ineligible for amnesty.\n  I would have thought that was an oversight until I noticed on page \n363, line 22, that the bill makes those heinous acts bar aliens here \nbetween 2 and 5 years from amnesty but not those who have been here \nlonger. The same bar left out for the 8.8 million who have been here \nfor more than 5 years. This will be interpreted as an intentional \ndecision of Congress when we pass this bill.\n  That is not inadvertent. I don't know why they did that.\n  Loophole No. 6: There is no continuous presence or continuous work \nrequirement for amnesty. To be eligible to adjust from illegal to legal \nstatutes under the bill, the alien must simply have been ``physically \npresent in the United States on April 5, 2001,'' and have been \n``employed continuously in the United States'' for 3 of the 5 years \n``since that date.''\n  The bill does not say ``employed continuously in the United States \nsince that date,'' as some have said. It does not require that \nemployment be full time. Which means that it will be interpreted by any \nfair court following the law to mean that the alien will be eligible \nfor amnesty if they have been employed in the United States either full \ntime, part time, seasonally, or self-employed.\n  The bill also allows the time of employment be shortened if the alien \nhas attendance in a school. The employment requirement under the \nlanguage, as written, is as broad as possible. Essentially, any alien \nwho worked in the United States for 3 out of 5 years any time prior to \nApril 5, 2006, will fulfill the eligibility requirements.\n  Loophole No. 7: The bill tells the Department of Homeland Security to \naccept ``just and reasonable inferences'' from day labor centers as \nevidence of an alien meeting the bill's work requirements.\n  Day labor centers--I am not sure how reliable those can be to make \nmajor decisions. Some of these are openly and notoriously promoting \nillegal workers.\n  Under the bill, an alien can ``conclusively establish'' that he was \nemployed in the United States, and it can be either full time, part \ntime, seasonally, or self-employed by presenting documents from Social \nSecurity, the Internal Revenue Service or an employer related to \nemployment. The alien meets ``the burden of proving by a preponderance \nof the evidence that the alien has satisfied the requirements'' if the \nalien can demonstrate ``such employment as a matter of just reasonable \ninference.''\n  If you can just have a reasonable inference that you have worked, get \na document from a day labor center, you meet the work requirements. \nEverybody will meet it. No illegal alien will be left behind.\n  The bill then states:\n\n       . . . it is the intent of Congress that the [work] \n     requirement . . . be interpreted and implemented in a manner \n     that recognizes and takes into account the difficulties \n     encountered by aliens in obtaining evidence of employment due \n     to the undocumented status of the alien.\n\n  The invitation is there to abuse the system. The invitation for fraud \nis clear.\n  Congress is telling the Department of Homeland Security to accept \npretty much anything as proof of work, and if they don't take it, they \nwill be sued and they will win in court because the bill we have \nwritten says anything goes as valid proof of work.\n  Loophole 8: The bill benefits only those who broke the law, not those \nwho followed it and got work visas to come to the United States. That \nis a plain fact. If you were here legally on or before April 5, 2001, \nyou will not get the benefit of this amnesty. This amnesty benefits you \nonly if you came here illegally.\n  Loophole 9: The essential worker permanent immigration program for \nnonagriculture low-skilled workers leaves no illegal alien out. It is \nnot limited to people outside the United States who want to come here \nto work in the future but includes illegal aliens currently present in \nthe United States who do not qualify for the amnesty program in title \nVI, including aliens here for less than 2 years. Under the bill \nlanguage, you can qualify for this new program to work as a low-skilled \npermanent immigrant even if you are unlawfully present in the United \nStates.\n  The bill specifically states:\n\n       In determining the alien's admissibility as an H-2C . . .\n\n  The program is specifically intended to apply to absconders. There \nare 400,000 absconders out there now that we are trying to apprehend \nand trying to deport. They have been ordered deported yet they \nabsconded; illegal aliens who were in removal proceedings and signed a \nvoluntary departure agreement but never left, many of them did that, \nand illegal aliens already removed from the United States but who have \ncome back.\n  Loophole No. 10: The annual numerical cap on this program is a \ncompletely artificial cap. If the 400,000 cap per year is reached, what \nhappens then? The cap immediately adjusts itself to make more room \nunder the cap. I kid you not. If the cap is reached, an additional \n80,000 visas can be given out that year and the cap will go up \nautomatically the next year as much as 20 percent. Even if the cap \nstays at 400,000 per year, we will have a minimum of 2.4 million low-\nskilled permanent--not part-time--immigrants in the first 6 years, the \nlength of the H-2C visa if the individual did not file for a green \ncard.\n  I see the Democratic leader. I have been going over some of the \nthings in the bill that I think the American people and maybe our \ncolleagues are not aware of. It is a breathtaking piece of legislation. \nIt is something that jeopardizes our ability to be successful in the \nSenate in passing good legislation. The compromise will not deal with \nthe problems I mentioned today. I am very disappointed.\n\n[[Page S3195]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues, if you said you would not vote for amnesty, you \nshould not vote for this compromise. If you voted against the Kennedy-\nSpecter-McCain committee bill that came out today--and the vote was 60-\n39 against it--you should not vote for this bill. It is essentially the \nsame thing.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I so appreciate the courtesy of my friend \nfrom Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate your courtesy so very much.\n  Mr. President, the Democrats continue to fight for strong border \nenforcement and comprehensive immigration reform. This compromise is \nthe second bipartisan plan we have supported, this Martinez amendment \nwhich is now before the Senate. We are happy to welcome Senator Frist. \nHe has been very cooperative in working to get this bill where it is \nnow, to the Senate, at this time. It is a comprehensive, tough, smart \napproach that we have advocated all along.\n  Unfortunately, other Republicans seem intent on delaying and \ndefeating this compromise. We are ready to move forward, but a group of \nRepublican Senators want to slow this matter down, it appears. If not \nfor them, this legislation could move forward. We would head into the \nrecess with a bipartisan victory for the American people.\n  Although this compromise is not perfect, it still is the right \ncomprehensive approach. It is ``enforcement plus,'' tough reforms to \nprotect our border and crack down on employers who hire illegally plus \nit will bring the millions of undocumented immigrants out of the \nshadows.\n  The Republicans are divided, obviously, on this issue. We must \nprotect this fragile compromise and those bent on gutting this bill \nwith hostile amendments. We still must ensure that this comprehensive \napproach is not lost when the bill reaches conference with the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Therefore, I have suggested to the distinguished majority leader that \nthe conferees on this be the Judiciary Committee. There would still be \nthe two-vote majority that we have on all conference committees. These \nmen and women who make up the Judiciary Committee fully understand this \nlegislation. I believe they would make sure the Senate's position was \nprotected.\n  I have also said in addition to that we should have a limited number \nof amendments. I have made that proposal to the distinguished majority \nleader.\n\n  I believe it is a test of leadership for President Bush to see what \nhe can do to help bring everyone into this program. We do not need this \nmatter derailed.\n  I will meet with Senator Frist at approximately 8:30 again tonight \nand see if there is something we can work out. Here he is. So I hope \nthere is something we can do.\n  I have, as I indicated, suggested that the Judiciary Committee \nmembers be conferees and we have a limited number of amendments. It \nsounds fair. It sounds reasonable, to me. I hope President Bush, who \nhas talked about immigration reform, would get involved and help us \nreach the finish line.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I said this earlier this morning: we find \nourselves at an interesting moment. This morning we had a cloture vote \nwhich gave us the opportunity to start afresh. We started in a very \npositive way in that we had a strong bipartisan show of support for an \namendment, the Martinez-Hagel amendment. That is a good alternative. \nThat is what we will be voting on tomorrow morning.\n  We left that meeting with the understanding that we would be able to \ndebate amendments and bring up amendments and discuss amendments to \nthis issue of immigration given the fact that it is a complex issue. \nAnd I think this Senate has come to the real point where we agree it is \ngoing to take a comprehensive approach to address the illegal and \nundocumented people coming into this country across our borders. That \nis real progress over the last week.\n  However, the problem we have, we have not been given the opportunity \nto treat each of these colleagues in this room fairly, allowing them to \ncome forward and offer their amendments and to have them debated, to \nimprove, to modify, to probably win some and to lose some, but to help \nshape legislation as we did on other bills, including the \ntransportation bill, highway bill, other large, complex bills in this \nSenate.\n  Over the course of the day it was my expectation as we set out this \nmorning, we take a step forward in terms of debating an amendment and \nlooking at the overall immigration bill and offering amendments on that \nimmigration bill to improve it. Yet here we are, 10 hours later, and we \nhave made absolutely no progress.\n  The amendments that were first offered on this bill were a week ago, \nWednesday of last week, the Kyl amendment. To this day, we have not \nbeen able to have a vote on that Kyl amendment, the Dorgan amendment, \nor the Isakson amendment, all of which have been on the table and \ndiscussed, but we are not allowed to vote on them. It takes unanimous \nconsent, all of us working together to do that.\n  The problem is, unless the Senate is able to work its will, we are \nnot ever going to be able to finish a bill and all the good we want to \ndo in addressing immigration will come to naught today or tomorrow and \nin the near future. That is the tragedy.\n  I still think we have an opportunity to reverse that. What I \nrecommend, and I will talk to the Democratic leader shortly, is that we \nproceed and take up the Kyl amendment and that we debate it, and we \nalready have had sufficient debate. We can vote on it and dispose of \nthat and take that next amendment, the Dorgan amendment, and vote on \nthat, dispose of that, and take up the Isakson amendment, and vote on \nthat, and then develop some good will.\n  I think, again, most everyone in this Senate wants to move this bill \nforward, see where we are, and then continue through the evening and \nthe night in order to consider other amendments. That would be the \nnormal process and the process I would expect.\n  I will be talking to the Democratic leader and I hope we can make \nprogress and do just that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am a little puzzled as to why the \ndistinguished Democratic leader needed to come to the Senate at this \ntime because, as he said, there is going to be a conversation between \nhim and the majority leader in 15 minutes.\n  We all know where we are. We all know the obstacles we face. But we \nalso know that people of good will need to sit down together and \nimplement the bipartisan agreement made after a lot of labor and hard \nwork.\n  All I can say is I am a little puzzled, but I still hope in 15 \nminutes the conversation between two individuals of good will would \nagree to move forward with a process. That is, obviously, the will of \nthe majority of this Senate.\n  I am puzzled, but I hope the conversation that takes place in about \n15 minutes between the two leaders would bear fruit and the details of \nwhat that agreement would be would, obviously, be between the two \nleaders.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me salute those on the floor who have \nbeen so instrumental in bringing us to this point.\n  I look over and see Senator Martinez, who has worked very hard to \nfind a bipartisan compromise which I now support. I thank him for that \nleadership.\n  I say the same of Senator McCain and Senator Graham and so many \nothers who have gathered here today. They are people of good will who \ngenerally want to pass a bill, as I do. The same can be said for many \non our side of the aisle who have spent an extraordinary amount of time \ntrying to find this common ground.\n  But let's be very blunt about where we are at the moment. It is 8:15 \non Thursday night. Tomorrow is the last day of the session before a 2-\nweek recess.\n  Clearly, if we don't reach some agreement as to how we are going to \ndeal with this bill when we return after the Easter recess, it really \nis a troubling situation. I hope it is not a situation that would \njeopardize the bill. We are trying to come up with a reasonable number \nof amendments. Yesterday, we\n\n[[Page S3196]]\n\ncalculated there were 228 amendments filed to the pending bill. It is \nphysically impossible to deal with that number of amendments. We know \nthat. As the whip on this side, I have faced 100 or more amendments and \nhad to try to talk Members out of them. At this point, we are trying to \nreach a reasonable number.\n  We have been given a list of potential amendments on the Republican \nside. I will tell you that almost without exception, they are authored \nby Senators who have expressly stated on the floor they want to defeat \nthis bill. So at some point, we have to acknowledge the obvious. \nSenators should have the opportunity, I suppose, to express themselves, \nbut if the purpose of the amendments is just to drag this out once we \nreturn to the point where it never passes, we have done a great \ndisservice.\n  It was not that long ago that we gathered on the floor of the third \nfloor of this Capitol in the press room congratulating ourselves on \nwhat we had achieved on a bipartisan basis. Supposedly there was a \nbipartisan will to move forward. We need the same thing now. And we \nneed to acknowledge that every Senator who wants to offer every \namendment cannot be allowed to do so, if we are ever going to complete \naction on the bill. Both sides have to be reasonable in the amount of \namendments that will be offered or nothing will happen.\n  The final point the Democratic leader, Senator Reid, made, is equally \nimportant. We want the conference committee to be a working committee \nthat understands the bill. The clearest way to achieve that is to have \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, with 10 Republicans and 8 Democrats, \nrepresent our interests, if the bill ever passes in the Senate. We \nthink it is going to be an arduous process facing a House where the \nchairman of the House Judiciary Committee has passed a bill far \ndifferent than the one we are considering in the Senate today. I don't \nthink that is an unreasonable request by the Senator from Nevada. It \nreflects a two-vote plurality for the Republicans, as is usually the \ncase, and brings the people to this conference committee who have \nworked on this bill the longest and the hardest. That is what we put on \nthe table.\n  I sincerely hope that before we adjourn this evening we can announce \nan agreement to move forward. If we don't, I fear that tomorrow there \nwill be a race for the airports without this resolved, and we will wait \nfor 2 weeks in the hopes that when we return we will have the same \nspirit of bipartisan cooperation. We may and we may not. We shouldn't \nmiss this chance, this historic opportunity to seize this moment and to \npass comprehensive immigration reform which starts with enforcement of \nour borders, enforcement against employers who are misusing those who \nare undocumented, and a legal pathway so that those who have lived in \nthe shadows and in fear for so long finally have a chance to prove \nthemselves, in a long and difficult process, that they are in a \nposition to be legal participants as part of our great democracy.\n  Tonight may be the test as to whether we can achieve that. I hope \nbefore we close down the session tonight, it is with the good news that \nwe have reached a bipartisan agreement; otherwise, I am very concerned \nabout the fate of this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois. He has \nbeen involved in many, probably too many, conversations we have had on \nthis issue and meetings and gatherings. It is very interesting. \nEverybody is expressing the same desire, yet we can't quite get there. \nThat is hard to understand.\n  I would like to make one comment to my friend from Illinois about \nconferees. One, I am confident it will be a fair conference. Obviously, \nin my personal view, the Judiciary Committee will be the appropriate \nconference. But that is a privilege and a right and a responsibility of \nthe majority leader. We know the way it works around here. The majority \nleader appoints conferees. The majority leader wants to resolve this. \nHe doesn't want the legislation gutted or destroyed in conference. We \nhave worked too hard to get where we are. We have to proceed, at least \na little bit, in good faith, recognizing if at some point as we are \nmoving along that confidence is not there, you can derail it at any \ntime. You can start the procedure that we have been in for the last 9 \nor 10 days. That seems to me the right thing to do, and I hope the \ndiscussion between the two leaders in 10 minutes will yield us an \nagreement to move forward.\n  The Kyl-Cornyn amendment has been pending for 10 days. We have on \nyour side Senator Dorgan who feels strongly about his amendment, and so \ndoes the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Isakson. Those are issues we could \nwork through and then see the end of the tunnel. We all know what \nhappens. I think we are down to something like 20 amendments on our \nside, and it would probably be less than that. But there are only so \nmany major issues associated with this bill.\n\n  I thank the Senator from Illinois for his cooperation and his efforts \nto bring this process forward. I think any objective observer would \nargue that it is time we move forward with the process. As the Senator \nfrom Illinois said, it is almost too late.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I may echo the comments of the \nSenator from Arizona, had we followed a normal procedure in the Senate \nover the last week or 10 days, we would have probably had way more \nvotes than Senators on this side of the aisle are requesting. A modest \nnumber of amendments, as Senator McCain indicated, roughly 20 \namendments, is an incredibly small number of amendments when you \nconsider the magnitude of the bill that is before us and the length of \ntime that it has been before us. We could have been to the end of the \nprocess if we had had the kind of procedure that is typically followed \nin this body. I am hoping that we can get to that point. I am \noptimistic that the meeting between the two leaders may produce an \nagreement to get started. We have a group of amendments that are the \nlogical place to start. I hope before the evening is over, we will have \nan opportunity to lock those in and to move forward, as we do on every \nother piece of legislation that we handle in this body.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I have been involved, along with many \nother people, trying to work hard. And if this were an easy problem, we \nwould have solved it many years ago. As a nation, in 1986, we offered \namnesty under Ronald Reagan, and 3 million people have turned into 11 \nmillion people. We can argue rightfully about what is punishment, what \nis amnesty. But what we can't afford is to take broken borders and \ncombine them with a broken Senate.\n  America needs something to work around here on immigration. The House \nhas spoken. I don't agree with their conclusion, but at least they \nspoke. The President is speaking. The Senate is trying to speak. We \nhave reached a bipartisan compromise that enjoys support on both sides \nbut also enjoys fair criticism. If it begins to be the rule that you \ncan't offer an amendment if you oppose a bill, that is probably not a \ngood policy for our friends in the minority.\n  We want to be able to tell America why we differ with each other and \nin some constructive way vote on what our differences are. Three \namendments on a bill this important is unfair to our colleagues who \ndisagree with what we are trying to do. Some of them are trying to make \nthe compromise better. I was in the Judiciary Committee. It has been a \nheck of a place to reside. If I had known going in what it was about, I \ndon't know if I would have accepted the job. But I have thoroughly \nenjoyed it in this sense: We have taken very important issues, and we \ntalked about them and we voted. We spent days on this bill. We had \ndozens of votes, Senator Sessions. Nobody said you couldn't vote. We \nworked through it, and we came out with a bill that some like and some \ndon't. Now we are on the Senate floor.\n  Everybody who is not on Judiciary deserves at least a shot to have a \nsay about this bill. As much as I like being on the Judiciary \nCommittee, I don't\n\n[[Page S3197]]\n\nthink we should take over the whole Senate. So what we are trying to do \nis give people on the committee and not on the committee a chance to \nrevisit this legislation in some orderly process.\n  Here is what we propose. It really is about who to trust, and trust \nis pretty low around here. The country has lots of problems, but we \nhave to be able to prove to each other we mean what we say. I hope I \nhave proven this. I mean it when I say I am for a comprehensive bill. I \nhave taken some votes that are not that popular at home. But I believe \nit is best for the country and the people of South Carolina to \nrealistically solve this problem. Senator Isakson has a good amendment. \nSenator Kyl and Senator Cornyn, there are a bunch of good amendments \nout there. Some of them I will vote against, but they deserve the right \nto be voted on.\n  What do we do in conference? Senator Frist has been a very good \nleader this week. He has taken a majority of his conference in a way \nthey really didn't want to go, but they are now understanding it is \nbetter to get something done than nothing. And to get to the end of the \ntunnel, we are going to have to trust each other a little bit.\n  Senator Durbin has been terrific. You have been in every meeting I \nhave been in, and I believe in your heart you believe it is good for \nthe country to solve this problem. The only way we are going to get \nthere from here is to have a little bit of faith. If at the end of the \nday this bill blows up, I don't expect you to accept that result, nor \nwill I. But I am willing to give the process an opportunity to prove to \neach other that we can do what we said we can do.\n  I think we can deliver a bill with Republicans and Democrats that \nwould honor the compromise we reached today, but we can't do it \nshutting out our colleagues. I know if we give this a shot, we will \nmake it. But those who want to kill it, you need to be on notice. As \nlong as I am in the Senate, we are going to be talking about this kind \nof problem. Every day we talk, people come across our border, and we \ndon't know who they are. Some are doing good and some may not. We need \nto fix this problem.\n  To my colleague from Illinois, I know where your heart is, and I \nappreciate what you have done. But we need to move forward. America \nneeds a better legal system when it comes to immigration. America needs \nsecure borders. America needs to treat with dignity 11 million people \nwho have committed a wrong but could be of great value to us in the \nfuture. But more than anything else, America needs a Senate that can \nwork.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will be brief. Obviously, Senator \nSessions is on the committee and had been speaking prior to this \ninterlude with our leaders.\n  I have worked 5 years to get a piece of this bill, and I have a piece \nof the bill that is currently before us. At the same time, I have voted \nconsistently to allow my colleagues who disagree to have a vote on \ntheir issues. Senator Sessions and I rarely disagree on issues. On this \nwe disagree.\n  He is very artful in casting certain provisions of it one way. I \ncould argue it the opposite way. I suspect my arguments would sound \nnearly as logical as his. But what is important here is the final \nshaping of a very important piece of legislation.\n  Controlling our borders is an absolute must that we have denied \nourselves for now two decades. Everybody talks about the 1986 act. It \ndidn't work. No, it didn't work. It didn't work because we didn't \nrealize, at least some didn't, that we were sending a signal out that \nif you could get here and wait your time, some day you might become \nlegal. You might become a citizen. We didn't realize that we put a \nmegaphone to the world and said: Come one, come all.\n  We also had an economy and job-creating environment in which there \nwere jobs to be had. We didn't control the border. Again in 1996, a \ndecade later, we attempted to tackle it again. Numbers had grown. We \ndidn't control the border.\n  In 1999, I began to work on the agricultural issue. I worked a \ncompromise over a period of 5 years now with a lot of different people. \nBut in the heart of what I have done is a very important key: it is \ncontrolling the border. No matter how we write this legislation, if you \ncannot define the number and control the number, it is for naught. That \nis an absolute fact.\n  It isn't by accident that the first few titles of the committee bill \nare all about border control. I wish we would move much faster on \nborder control. I wish nationally we could move tomorrow because what \nwe have offered will take a few years to implement.\n  We have to train more Border Patrol men, 1,500 a year, and go on and \non with beds of detention and all that. That is important and part of \nthe control. We have to find the resources to do it. So all of that has \nto fit together.\n  At the same time, Americans are phenomenally frustrated about what we \nare doing and where we are. They know why we need to do something, and \nthey know our borders ought to be controlled. Well, I am going to stand \nhere and defend the right of my colleagues to offer amendments. I would \nlike to think that on the issues I am passionate about, my arguments \nare more persuasive to a majority and I can defeat any amendment that \nmight be proposed to change certain provisions. I don't know, but I am \nwilling to take that risk because I have to guarantee this process.\n  The attitude of shut out and deny has never worked in this Senate. We \nalways shape it a little bit, but we never deny it. Yet for a week now \nit has been denied and it will not stand or the bill will fall. That \nwould be wrong for the American people not only to see but to \nunderstand because in it are the ingredients to solve a problem, if we \nhave the heart and the will to implement it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I agree with much of what Senator Craig \nsaid--particularly about the ineffectiveness at the border. Let's be \nreal frank and honest about the bill we have today. The reason we are \nin trouble today, the reason we are not going to be able to pass this \nlegislation is that the bill is a failure. It is a colossal failure. It \nis a dead horse. It has been lying out in the sun, and people have been \nhaving to look at it, and they are now able to smell it. A few \namendments and a compromise is not going to revive this. It doesn't do \nwhat we want it to do. It has a huge surge in immigration.\n  The compromise is 95 percent of what was in the bill we just rejected \nthis morning by a 60-vote margin--95 percent of it. And the others were \nsupposed to make some big difference, but part of the changes in the \nbill increase the number of people who would come into the country, and \nthere is not any restraint on the legislation. So the underlying bill \nthat came out of committee was bad from the beginning.\n  Let me tell you what happened. We debated the bill. We spent 5 days \nin markup, and 4 of those days basically were on border control issues. \nWe debated individual words. Then, all of a sudden, on the last day, \nwhen the majority leader said we had to have the bill out, about noon \nwe got around to the amnesty for the 11 million people and what we were \ngoing to do about future immigration policies. And without any \namendments--maybe no more than one or two--they were adopted in toto, \nwithout any real discussion, no expert testimony, no full understanding \nof the comprehensiveness of it. We just rushed it through. We passed \nthis bill last Monday at about 6 or 7 o'clock at night. It hit the \nfloor on Tuesday or Wednesday. The bill was not even printed until \nWednesday night. We were devoting Wednesday all day to the bill, and it \nhad not even been printed.\n  I ask my colleagues this: Should you not know how much the bill \ncosts? Is anybody here prepared to stand up and say what this bill \nwould cost, the compromise bill, if we pass it? How much will it cost? \nDoes anybody know?\n  I made inquiry today and got back a letter from CBO that said it is \nclearly in violation of the Budget Act. Now, they said that was just a \npart of the cost; it was much more than that. They were still trying to \nrun the numbers.\n  So within minutes, I got this e-mail from the Congressional Budget \nOffice. It has a score on it. It says that CBO and Joint Tax estimate \nthat direct spending outlays under this bill would total about $8 \nbillion for the first 5\n\n[[Page S3198]]\n\nyears. That is clearly in violation of the Budget Act.\n  What about revenues? Joint Tax and CBO--our two agencies we depend on \nto tell us what the cost and impact of the legislation will be--\nestimate that the legislation would result in an on-budget revenue loss \nof $5 billion from 2007 to 2011 and $2 billion over the 2007-to-2016 \nperiod, largely because of lower tax payments by businesses.\n  Here is discretionary spending. Assuming the appropriation of a \nnecessary sum, CBO estimates that outlays for those purposes would \ntotal at least $16 billion from 2007 to 2011 and more than $30 billion \nover 2007 to 2016. And they are in a governmental mandate. The bill \nwould impose mandates on State and local governments with costs that \nwould exceed the threshold established by the Unfunded Mandates Act and \nat least 1 of the first 5 years after they take effect, totaling $29 \nbillion over 5 years.\n  Well, why am I saying that? First of all, that is a lot of money. We \nhave Social Security in trouble, Medicaid in trouble, and we are going \nto add $29 billion more to our costs?\n  What is really troubling is that it is symptomatic of the lack of \nthought and serious evaluation that went into writing this bill to \nbegin with. It is not a good piece of legislation. It has good \nintentions. It desires to do the right thing. Unfortunately, as I have \nstudied it, having been on the Judiciary Committee, I have come to \nbelieve it cannot be amended. And we are going to have three amendments \nthat are going to somehow fix this bill? It fundamentally needs to be \nreviewed. I really think so.\n  I will repeat that I am optimistic about our ability to make this \nwork. I am optimistic that, with just a commitment of will and some \nresources, we can create secure borders and increase the number of \npeople who come into our country legally. We can deal humanely and \nfairly with the 11 million to 12 million--or maybe even 20 million--\nillegals who are here. We don't have to give them every single benefit \nwe give to those who follow the law, but we can allow most to stay and \nwork and live here, if that is what they have been doing and if that is \npossible. We can work out all those things. We can deal with those \nissues in an effective way. But this legislation doesn't do it, and it \nis too late to fix it.\n  We need to have some real hearings, get the best minds in America to \ntell us about this problem, and work out legislation that is not \namnesty, that doesn't cost $27 billion, that creates a lawful system on \nour borders so people can enter and exit easily with biometric \nidentifiers if they are lawful and those who try to come in unlawfully \nget apprehended. That can be done. This bill doesn't do it. The \ncompromise legislation doesn't do it. It needs to be voted down.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, we have been in a stalemate over the \nissue of amendments for several days now on what is an issue which, as \nthe Senator from Alabama so eloquently said, is very important to all \nAmericans. It is a very important issue to those who support the bill \nand to those who might oppose the bill. It is an issue where the lives \nof many people in America are hanging on its outcome.\n  The President has spoken in the last 24 hours about the need for the \nSenate, with a seriousness of purpose, to move forward to try to arrive \nat a reasonable resolution of this issue. The fact is that, as we have \nover now several days endured, I am not so familiar with every nuance \nof Senate procedure so as to fully understand all that might be and \ncould be done. But there is also a benefit to that, which is that I am \nso accustomed to what the rest of America thinks and hears and, \nfrankly, have a view that I think is also fresh, which is to say: How \ndo you explain to anyone in America that on something as fundamentally \nimportant as the immigration laws of this country, on a system that \nadmittedly, while we cannot agree on much, we have to agree is a broken \nsystem, that today is not working, not serving America's need for \nsecurity of the border, that is not serving America's need to know who \nthese 12 million people are and why they are here, that today is a \nsystem that compounds and permits illegal behavior by those who cross \nthe border illegally and those who employ them and benefit by their \nlabor.\n  There is a tacit understanding that we have an illegal system and we \nare fine with that. In the midst of that need and in the midst of this \noverwhelming problem we have in our country, the Senate has a \nresponsibility to do something about it.\n  So how do we explain to the people of America that 100 Senators, led \nby their leaders, have been hung up over the fact that they cannot \nagree on how many amendments they are going to have to this bill? It is \nthat simple. We just cannot agree on the number of amendments that will \nbe considered on the bill. Some would say it is too fragile a \ncompromise. If it is too fragile to not have the sufficient votes to \ndefeat amendments to the bill, why, then, it would not pass anyway. \nThat is an indication of a lack of purpose.\n  Some would say: It is too broken down and cannot be fixed. Let's give \nit a try. I have never heard of a bill which I participated in in my \nshort career in the Senate that came to the floor and there was not an \nup-or-down vote--well, sometimes they are done by unanimous consent. \nBut on monumental, controversial legislation such as this, there are \nalways going to be amendments. And I think about how am I going to \nexplain to the people who are looking to me for leadership, telling me \nto get something done on this problem--and on both sides, people are \ndemanding that the border be secure, and other people are asking that \ntheir status be resolved so they can move on to have a piece of the \nAmerican dream--and say to both of them that the Senate has failed you \nand did not act; we could not act for the simple reason that we could \nnot agree on the number of amendments. We agreed on the underlying \nidea--a majority of Senators, I believe, or perhaps a significant \nmajority agreed on how we might perhaps make a contribution toward \nsolving this problem with what now has been reached as a compromise. \nAnd we announced it with great fanfare. Then we get to the issue of how \nmany amendments.\n  The bottom line is that this issue is too important--too many people \nare depending on it and the security of our Nation depends upon it--for \nus to fail this test of leadership. If we fail to act on this bill, as \nI seriously fear we will because of the reason that some would prefer \nto have the politics of this issue over the policy we could create by \nacting upon this issue, whatever the will of the Senate may be on it, \nwe will have seriously failed the American people and failed the test \nof leadership. The President has encouraged us, told us, urged us to \nmove forward and to act on this very important issue. We simply are \ndilly-dallying and failing to act on something that is fundamentally \nimportant to the people of this country.\n  So I say that if this issue fails to be acted upon, there will be \npeople looking for places to hide and fingers to point as to who is to \nblame. I would blame all 100 of us for not getting it done. Those who \nagree with it can vote for it, and those who disagree with it can vote \nagainst. Those who have legitimate amendments should be able to offer \nthem and be able to have a vote on them up or down.\n  Obviously, we have to limit the number of amendments. So we are back \nto the decision of how many amendments. You would think that grown \npeople could decide how many amendments to have on a bill of this \nsignificance and of this importance to the Nation. If we don't agree on \nthe question of how many amendments, I look forward to hearing \nsuggestions on how we explain to the American people why we failed to \nact.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to speak to an amendment \ndesigned to clarify existing immigration law and ease the burden on \nfamilies sent abroad in service to the United States.\n  Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, there is normally a 3-year \nresidence requirement for spouses of U.S. citizens to be naturalized. \nSection 319 (B)(3) waives that requirement for applicants whose citizen \nspouses are ordered abroad by our Government to keep families intact \nwhile certain members do their duty to our country, wherever in the \nworld that may require them to go. The same law rightly places value on \ncohabitation between\n\n[[Page S3199]]\n\nspouses in requiring that applicants spend no more than 45 days away \nfrom their citizen spouse. The waiver provided under existing law is \nclearly intended to prevent our Government from splitting up families \nwhose members are in the service of this country for the mere purpose \nof satisfying shortsighted antifamily regulations. Yet that is exactly \nwhat has occurred as a result of the Bureau of Citizenship and \nImmigration Services' overly narrow interpretation of this law.\n  I wish to briefly tell you a story about two constituents of mine, a \nhusband and wife from New Orleans, who were subjected to this \nparticular fate. Brett Schexnider has served as an Active-Duty officer \nin the Armed Forces for more than 20 years, and holds the rank of \ncommander in the U.S. Navy. Commander Schexnider married his wife \nGisele in March of 1999. When the Navy ordered Commander Schexnider to \nleave New Orleans for a foreign post over 2 years later, Gisele, who is \noriginally from France, understandingly and dutifully accompanied her \nhusband on his tour of duty. After 14 months, the Navy sent Commander \nSchexnider back home, and his wife returned with him. Four months \nlater, she applied for naturalization. Her application was denied as a \nresult of her having joined her husband abroad, which caused a break in \nthe 3 years of continuous residence normally required. Relying neither \non explicit regulation nor statute, USCIS determined that she was no \nlonger entitled to a waiver of the 3-year requirement because her \nhusband had returned to the United States by the time she filed her \napplication. After 6 years of marriage, Gisele was told that she would \nhave to wait another 3 years before her application could be approved. \nI submit to my colleagues that this unwritten policy and absurd \ndetermination is not only bureaucratically senseless but also a \nshameful offense to the institution of marriage.\n  Again, this amendment does not seek to do anything more than clarify \nexisting law so that it may achieve its original purpose. The provision \nin Federal regulations requiring that duty abroad last at least 1 year \nwould remain intact, as would the requirement that an applicant be \npresent in the United States at the time of naturalization. My \namendment would simply prevent applicants from failing residence \nrequirements if they choose to follow their spouse to a Government-\nordered post.\n  Our military families and the families of this Nation's public \nservants who are sent abroad do not deserve to be punished for their \nservice. The laws of this Government and the agencies that execute them \nmust not be allowed to separate families whose members stand up to \nanswer the call of duty, and I would hope that all my colleagues could \njoin me in protecting our Nation's families from this disgraceful \npractice.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Amendment be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN ALIEN SPOUSES.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for purposes of \n     determining eligibility for naturalization under section 319 \n     of the Immigration and Nationality Act with respect to an \n     alien spouse who is married to a citizen spouse who was \n     stationed abroad on orders from the United States Government \n     for a period of not less than 1 year and reassigned to the \n     United States thereafter, the following rules shall apply:\n       (1) The citizen spouse shall be treated as regularly \n     scheduled abroad without regard to whether the citizen spouse \n     is reassigned to duty in the United States.\n       (2) Any period of time during which the alien spouse is \n     living abroad with his or her citizen spouse shall be treated \n     as residency within the United States for purposes of meeting \n     the residency requirements under section 319 of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act, even if the citizen spouse \n     is reassigned to duty in the United States at the time the \n     alien spouse files an application for naturalization.\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/06/senate-section/article/S3199-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3199-S3201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there now be a \nperiod of morning business with Senators permitted to speak for up to \n10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we are about to close in a few moments. We \nhave some business to do. But I want to comment briefly on the events \nof today with respect to what I think is tragic in the sense that we \nare, in all likelihood, not going to be able to address a problem that \ndirectly affects the American people.\n  What the Senate does best is to identify a problem, to develop and \ntake a solution through committee, and then bring that product to the \nfloor of this body and allow 100 Senators--the body itself--to modify, \nto take away, or to add to that product and produce a bill. And it \nbecomes especially important when you are addressing very complicated \nissues, tough issues, tough challenges that you produce a product that \nreflects the intent and the will of this entire body, the Senate.\n  In this particular case, when we are discussing immigration, the \nproblem has been clearly identified. Our borders are broken. Our \nimmigration system does not work, Our laws that are on the books are \nnot being enforced.\n  Again and again, we have heard over the last 2 weeks that we are a \nnation of laws, a proud nation, a rich nation because of our immigrants \nand our history of immigrants. But with those laws not enforced, our \nworkplace is not protected, and with employers not having the tools \navailable to enforce those laws, with too many people living in the \nshadows, we have a set of problems that have to be addressed.\n  This body has moved in the direction of addressing that in a \ncomprehensive way. We developed a product in the committee, we took \nthat product to the floor, but when we came to the point where the \nminority, using their rights, which I would argue is abusing those \nprivileges, caused the system of deliberation and amendment to fail, \nthat resulted in postponement, it resulted in blocking amendments, not \nhaving votes, obstruction.\n  They did not allow amendments to be offered--the substantive \namendments, the really important amendments--or to be voted on.\n  Everybody watching this debate over the last week and a half asked--\nwe all have that telephone call or that question in town meetings: How \nin the world could the Senate possibly operate that way? How can a \nhandful of Senators or a minority of Senators--fewer than 50 in this \nbody--actually stop progress on an important bill?\n  The American people are baffled by it, and appropriately so. The \nanswer lies in that the rules of the Senate allow them to do that, and \nif those rules are used in that manner, then things can be stopped, \npostponed, and blocked.\n  People call it tyranny of a minority. Is that an overstatement? Not \nreally, because the tyranny means that you have something bad \nhappening, and the strength is of the minority, and that has actually \ntaken place. We have seen it play out over the course of the last 12 \nhours, almost exactly 12 hours after a vote today to oppose a bill that \ngives illegal immigrants, undocumented people, a direct special path to \ncitizenship. Many thought it would be a new day and, indeed, shortly \nthereafter, a large number, a bipartisan group of people, rallied in \nsupport of proceeding to an amendment put forth by Senators Hagel and \nMartinez, broadly supported with a number of cosponsors on both sides \nof the aisle.\n\n  That amendment, coupled with the work that the committee had done to \ndate, that the Senate had done, did everything pretty much in terms of \ntightening the borders, worksite enforcement, looking at 12 million \nundocumented, illegal immigrants here and saying it is not a monolithic \ngroup and has to be addressed in a certain way and developing a \ntemporary worker program.\n  However, at that point, the minority, having said the amendments \ncould be\n\n[[Page S3200]]\n\noffered, reversed course, and over the course of today we have not had \nany amendments offered. We have had them offered--in fact, 396 \namendments are at the desk--but we are not allowed to take any of those \namendments out and debate and vote on them. And we did not do any \namendments today. We all know a lot of people say they will file \namendments, and they do not ultimately even want to debate them, but \n396 amendments reflect a lot of Members with interest, on both sides of \nthe aisle, with an interest in modifying or attempting to modify or \ndiscussing how they might modify the underlying bill.\n  I have been consistent in my remarks over the last several days, \nactually at the end of last week, as well, that it is important we \nbegin debate and we begin that amendment process and get votes on some \nof those amendments. People say, well, you had three votes. There are \n396 amendments, and we did have three votes. They were fairly \nnoncontroversial. The problem is that we have a lot more substantial \namendments.\n  The amendment that we talked about earlier tonight, the Kyl \namendment, was offered Wednesday of last week; and another amendment, \nthe Dorgan amendment, was offered last week; and the Isakson amendment \nwas offered last week. These are amendments we have not been allowed to \nvote on.\n  Earlier tonight, a couple of hours ago, when the Democratic leader \nand I were both on the floor, I suggested we go ahead and take up the \nKyl amendment. Even if we could not come to all the agreements about \nwhat will happen weeks or months from now, let's go ahead and take up \nan amendment and maybe we could capture the good will of the Senate, \nshow progress, and after that take up the Dorgan amendment and the \nIsakson amendment, and hopefully at some point--maybe it even could \nhave been now--we could see how we could proceed with other amendments.\n  That proposal was refused and, thus, we are here now a couple of \nhours later. A lot of other proposals have gone back and forth, and \nwithout talking too much about what the Democratic leader and I have \ntalked about, we have tried to put together packages or groups of \namendments that might be considered. I have been quite open. We would \nlike to see about 20 amendments, out of 396, about 20 be considered at \nsome point in the future, in a package, and ultimately have passage of \nthe bill after those amendments. How they fall is important, but voting \nis important. And however they fall, if we can vote on the underlying \nbill, I think it would pass. But the response to that, again, was \n``no.''\n  I mention that because we have seen this flow over the course of the \nday, a lot of optimism earlier today, but now, since we have had no \namendments over the course of today, I don't see how cloture can be \ninvoked tomorrow morning. We will have to wait and see how the votes \ngo, but I would think all of the people who have been denied the \nopportunity to offer their amendments are not going to want to proceed \nwhere, in a process, they are being shut out, totally shut out. But we \nhave to wait and see how that vote goes tomorrow morning.\n  Now, where do we go from here? I always say that tomorrow is a new \nday, and we do not know what exactly will happen tomorrow morning. I do \nsee little progress on this bill possible tomorrow because of the \nobstruction that we have run up against.\n  What is disheartening to me is that we do have a huge problem along \nour borders today. As I have said many times before, when I was last at \nthe Rio Grande border, 400 people were caught that night. That means \n400 people will probably be caught tonight in that one little sector. \nBut in addition to those 400 people being gone, there are probably \nabout 800 or 1,200 people who are going to get through that border \ntonight--just that little sector tonight--and tomorrow night and the \nnext night and the next night because we did not act and because we are \nnot acting and not moving forward. I think that is a disservice to the \npeople living along those borders. It is a disservice to the people who \nare going in those hospitals along the borders in the border States, \nwho have to wait hours, sometimes several hours, maybe even a whole \nday, because these waiting rooms are crowded with people who have come \nillegally across the border over the preceding days.\n  But we will have to see how the vote goes tomorrow morning. If \ncloture is not invoked--and I don't see how it can be, the way the \nprocess has proceeded--we will have a cloture vote on a strong border \nsecurity bill, a bill that does deserve to be passed. If we cannot pass \nthe comprehensive bill, because of obstruction, we will have the \nopportunity after that to vote on a strong border security bill that \nalso has interior enforcement and worksite enforcement tomorrow morning \nas well.\n  I do hope we can turn the corner here at some point and address these \nproblems which do affect the American people. We have to stay above \npartisanship. We have to work together and be able to debate in a civil \nway. I stressed that initially when we began the debate, saying we have \nto be civil and dignified, but then I found that we were not even \nreally able to debate because we have not been allowed to vote on these \namendments.\n  Mr. President, does the Democratic leader want to have any comment? \nIf not, I will proceed on with business. I do not want to cut off \nanything.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will say a few words. I wasn't planning on \nsaying anything, but I think I must say something.\n  Mr. President, no matter how many times I call this lectern a car, it \ndoes not matter, this is not a car. This is a lectern, used here in the \nSenate for us to put our papers on and deliver a speech. This is not a \ncar. If I come to the Senate floor and, day after day, hour after hour, \ncall this a car, it is not a car. It is a lectern.\n  If I come to this Senate floor day after day and say what the \nDemocrats have done is unusual, unwarranted, unbelievable, it is wrong, \nit is as wrong as this lecturn being called a car.\n  Now, we are in a unique situation. The distinguished majority leader \nand I have really tried to work something out. I indicated that I \nthought it would be appropriate that we agree on who would be on the \nconference--the Judiciary Committee. It sounds reasonable.\n  I also thought we should have--not that I was rushing forward with \nthis, but I would agree, on behalf of my caucus, to a reasonable number \nof amendments. Mr. President, 20 or so is not a reasonable number of \namendments. That is filibuster by amendment. It appears here what they \nwant is to filibuster. They, the Republicans, want to filibuster the \nMartinez bill.\n  So I do not know how much more reasonable we could be. We are united. \nWe have produced votes this morning to show we are serious about \nlegislation. We will continue to fight for strong border enforcement, \ncomprehensive immigration reform.\n  What we have suggested is reasonable. It is fair. And the \ndistinguished majority leader said we will see how the vote goes. I \nthink that is really important, that we see how these votes go. I would \nhope that the night will bring the confidence that we can move forward \nand invoke cloture on the Martinez bill and finish this legislation. \nThere are still votes that would be valid postcloture on that.\n  I also make this commitment: If cloture is not invoked--and I think \nthat would be a terrible disservice to this country--I will continue to \nwork on immigration reform. This is something that has to be done. It \nhas to be done. The leader and I have gone back and forth so many times \ntoday that we are beating paths to our offices.\n  I hope this legislation will move forward tomorrow. I know people \nfeel that this lecturn is a chair, but it is not. This is the Senate. \nThis is how it works. The way to bring all this to a close is to invoke \ncloture. And then we can all walk out and declare victory for the \nAmerican people. This isn't a question of who filed a cloture motion or \nwho allowed amendments or didn't allow amendments. This is the Senate. \nThat is how it has worked for almost 220 years.\n  I hope the night will bring what I think is common sense and we can \nresolve this matter. It would sure be something I would like very much.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I want to, one more time, make it clear \nthat we have tried to move to take up the Kyl amendment tonight, but \nthe other side refused that opportunity, and the Dorgan amendment and \nthe Isakson\n\n[[Page S3201]]\n\namendment, to proceed with debate. The Democratic leader and I have had \nthe discussion. I want to make it clear that not supporting cloture \ntomorrow is the only way we can support our right to be able to offer \namendments and to debate them. It is important for everybody to \nunderstand that because it comes on the heels of broad support for the \nunderlying amendment.\n  Mr. REID. If I could ask a question--pardon the interruption--that \nwould be in addition to at least 17 other amendments at some time in \nthe future; is that right?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the intent is to start down the path of \namendments and allow the debate and then to allow the votes. We have \nstopped short because I have said that our side, since 396 amendments \nhave been offered, needs about 20 amendments--and this doesn't have to \nbe right now; this could be at some point in the future--that we could \nput into a package and then debate the bill. With that, we have not \nbeen able to reach agreement. That is where we are. But this \nwillingness to debate and vote, I want to make it crystal clear we have \nattempted again to do that. I keep mentioning it because with cloture \nin all likelihood not being invoked tomorrow, it is solely because we \nhave not been given that opportunity to offer amendments to improve the \nbill. Some of them would win; some would lose.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. FRIST. I am happy to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If we fail to invoke cloture tomorrow, is the majority \nleader saying we then cannot amend the Martinez substitute that is \nbefore us?\n  Mr. FRIST. I believe that following the cloture, if cloture is not \ninvoked on the Martinez amendment tomorrow, we will follow that \nimmediately with a cloture vote on the bill itself, the border security \nbill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I might ask the majority leader, if I understand it, \nit is a cloture vote on the motion to commit which would make the \nMartinez substitute the bill before us. If that cloture vote prevails, \nthere is ample opportunity then to amend that substitute that is before \nus. Why does the majority leader argue that Republicans would withhold \ntheir votes and stop the process? The process can still go forward. \nAmendments can still be offered at that point. We have not filed \ncloture on the underlying substitute. It is only on the motion to \ncommit.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the problem with tomorrow is, we will be in \nthe exact same situation. If cloture is not invoked, we will have one \namendment up. We will be exactly where we are now, with your ability to \ndo what you have done, what the Democratic side has done, for the last \nweek and a half, and that is not to allow amendments to come forward \nand continue to block and obstruct. That is the problem, that we can't \ncome to an agreement on a package. And we have tried to bring it up \nwith a group of amendments, say 20 amendments. We have tried to say \nlet's take one amendment at a time. And the problem is that process is \nbeing thwarted, whatever technique we try.\n  I will not support cloture tomorrow and I don't think our side of the \naisle will support cloture tomorrow because it denies our Members the \nright to offer their amendments and debate them.\n  Mr. REID. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state it.\n  Mr. REID. If cloture is invoked tomorrow, there would still be an \nopportunity to offer amendments postcloture, germane amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If a slot were available on the amendment \ntree, they could be offered. Currently, there are no slots. The tree is \nfull.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Chair, those slots \nwere not filled by the minority, were they?\n  I think the point is made.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the motion to commit, the amendments were \noffered by the majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I have no further questions.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the leader is aware that one amendment \ncould be pending during that entire 30 hours. The minority could deny \nMembers the right for votes on their germane amendments.\n  I guess I would ask, would the minority leader agree to allow \namendments be given 30 minutes of debate, equally divided, so we can be \nassured that we can debate and vote on that and other important \namendments?\n  Mr. REID. Is that postcloture?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to consider that. I think we would have to \nsee what amendments were offered. But I think something such as that is \nwithin reason. I am happy to see what we can do. I cannot say until I \nknow what the amendments are, which ones are germane or not.\n  My point is that there is a way we can have amendments offered \npostcloture. All we have to do is have cloture invoked tomorrow.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to votes in relation to the following amendments: The Kyl \namendment, the Dorgan amendment, and the Isakson amendment.\n  I further ask that before each vote there be 30 minutes of debate \nequally divided in the usual form.\n  Before the Chair rules, I note that two Republican amendments in this \nagreement have been pending for over a week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, of course, Mr. President, \nuntil we have an agreement, as has been indicated, on what is going to \nhappen postcloture, and we have talked about this, and a conference--\nthese things sound very procedural in nature, but they are important to \nwhat this body does. So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/06/senate-section/article/S3201-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3201-S3203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport a bill which I will introduce, entitled, ``Reverse the Raid on \nStudent Aid Act of 2006.''\n  Forty years ago, our country made a promise to the young men and \nwomen to make college more affordable for those who have the \ndetermination to pursue higher education regardless of their financial \nbackground. This promise was made through the enactment of the Higher \nEducation Act of 1965.\n  Even before the enactment of that legislation, the National Defense \nEducation Act in the 1950s marked the first time that Congress made a \nFederal commitment to help young people complete their education.\n  Most people do not remember the circumstances. We started giving \nstudent loans across America because we were afraid. Our fear was based \non the fact that the Russians in the 1950s launched a satellite known \nas Sputnik. We knew they had nuclear capacity and now they were \nlaunching a satellite in the heavens. It frightened us.\n  In the midst of the world war, we did not know if we had a new \nvulnerability, but we knew where to start in America. We started in the \nclassroom. We decided we needed a new generation of Americans with a \ncollege education--specialists, scientists, engineers--people who could \nprepare America to defend itself and to be competitive in years to \ncome. And we also realized that college education in the 1950s and \n1960s was not what it is today. It was really the province of the lucky \nfew, those who were the Senators and daughters of alumni across America \nand those fortunate enough to be discovered and given a chance to go on \nto higher education.\n  We changed everything in the 1960s. We democratized college education \nin America. College education became an opportunity for many in \nfamilies that had never produced a college graduate. How did these kids \nget to school and finish? The National Defense Education Act said: We \nwill loan you the money.\n  I know a little bit about this story because I was one of those \nstudents. After graduating from high school, I borrowed money from the \nNational Defense Education Act and went on to complete a college degree \nand a law degree. I never could have done it without borrowing that \nmoney. The terms now seem so simple and so easy. I was supposed to pay \nthat money back over the next 10 years, after 1 year of grace period, \nbut for the next 10 years after graduation, 10 percent a year at the \noutrageous interest rate of 3 percent. Of course, I did pay it back and \nlook\n\n[[Page S3202]]\n\nback now as I reflect on it and realize what a great loan it was and \nwhat a great investor it was. I was one of millions who benefited.\n  The good news is that the number of students who enroll in higher \neducation across America has nearly doubled over the past 35 years: 8.5 \nmillion college students in 1970 to approximately 16 million by 2005. \nThere is some bad news to this story. Despite the importance of college \neducation in the 21st century, many millions of young adults never make \nit to college.\n  Never has higher education been more important than it is today. Over \nthe course of a lifetime, a college graduate will earn over $1 million \nmore than someone without a college degree. Today, six out of every ten \njobs in America require some postsecondary education or training.\n  In addition to the individual benefits of a college education, we \nknow that investing and producing more college-educated Americans is \nvital to our Nation's future. Economists estimate that the increase in \nthe education level of the U.S. labor force between 1915 and 1999 \nresulted directly in at least a 23-percent overall growth in U.S. \nproductivity.\n  If you are a student of history, you come to realize how critical \neducation is to where we are today. Why was the 20th century, from 1900 \nto 1999, the American century? What was it that made America different? \nWhy did we excel when other nations stalled? I think you look back to \neducation there as well.\n  Between 1890 and 1912, during that 22-year period of time, we built, \non average, one new high school in America every single day. All across \nAmerica, communities decided that high school education was now \nsomething worth the investment. Was it a Federal mandate? No. It was \nthe decision of local communities that kids would not quit at the \neighth grade. High school--once again, a province of the wealthy and \nthe privileged--became customary and public and universal in America.\n  So with this rush of new high school graduates coming to lead \nAmerica, in so many different fields--business and education and other \nplaces--the 20th century became the American century. We moved from the \nModel T from Ford Motor Company to launching our own rockets at Cape \nCanaveral. We moved forward, with the understanding that education was \nthe key.\n  Recently, many reports have sounded the alarm that we may be losing \nour education. The world's technology is moving faster than our \neducation. Countries such as China and India are showing dramatic \nprogress when it comes to technology and innovation. To keep America at \nthe economic forefront of the 21st century, we have to realize we need \nto continue to value education. We need to invest in it. We need to \nmake certain that Americans are in the forefront, leading the world \nwhen it comes to educational standards. We also have to understand that \nmany of these young college students, tomorrow's leaders, will not have \na chance unless we give them a helping hand, the same kind of helping \nhand that this college student had many years ago.\n  The cost of college education is far beyond the reach of many \nAmerican students, not just those from poor families but those who come \nfrom middle-income households and farm families and families of recent \nimmigrants to our country. According to the College Board, in current \ndollars, the total cost for tuition fees and room and board at a 4-year \npublic university has increased by 44 percent over the last 5 years. \nFederal financial assistance is not keeping pace. Twenty years ago, the \nmaximum Pell grant for low-income and working-class families covered \nabout 55 percent of the costs of attending a 4-year public college. \nToday, the maximum Pell grant of $4,050 covers about 33 percent of the \ncost.\n  More and more students find that grant is not enough. According to \nthe U.S. Department of Education, the average student debt of $17 \nthousand has increased by more than 50 percent over the last decade. We \nknow the stories, stories of students who finally get the diploma, \nproudly walk down the steps, pose for photographs with their parents, \nand then try to figure out how in the world are they going to pay back \nthat student loan. That student loan is going to guide them in their \nlifetime decisions. I have met so many who said: I took this job \nbecause it paid a little more. It was not the job I wanted, it was not \nthe thing I wanted to do, but I have to pay off a student loan. So \nthese students, burdened with more debt, find their life choices \nlimited and restricted.\n  Smart, hard-working kids deserve a chance to go as far as their \ntalent will take them in America.\n  Students who are qualified to go to college, students who have the \ndesire to go to college, students who can make valuable economic, \nintellectual, and cultural contributions to America by pursuing higher \neducation should not be kept away from school because they don't have \nthe money. These students are our future.\n  Let me tell you why I come to the floor and make a speech, which \nvirtually everyone would agree with, and why I am introducing a bill \ntoday. Earlier this year, we decided to change the law when it came to \ncollege student loans. Earlier this year, the Republican leadership in \nCongress missed an opportunity to make an important investment in our \nNation's future. A bill known as the deficit reduction bill, pushed \nthrough Congress by the Republican leadership and signed by President \nBush, made $12 billion in cuts in student aid, the single largest cut \nin financial aid programs in history.\n  Democrats, on the other hand, proposed reinvesting in student \nbenefits the savings from reducing excessive bank subsidies. We were \nturned aside. Our approach was rejected. Unfortunately, the Republican \nmajority missed an opportunity to prevent higher student loan interest \nrates from getting out of hand and going into effect. So as of July 1 \nof this year, regardless of how low interest rates may be, student loan \ninterest rates will be fixed at 6.8 percent for student borrowers and \n8.5 percent for parents who borrow for their child's education. \nStudents will no longer be able to take advantage when interest rates \ngo down by consolidating their loans. Currently, those loan rates are \nabout 5.3 percent for student borrowers, 6.1 for parents.\n  In addition, students are prohibited from consolidating loans that \nthey might have from various sources and various schools in an effort \nto lower their interest rates. If we want to move ahead in the global \neconomy, we can't succeed by saddling our newest workers with more \ndebt. That is exactly what this bill does. Anyone who owns a home and a \nmortgage knows that there comes a time when you get the news that \ninterest rates are going down, that you might consider renegotiating \nyour mortgage and then your monthly payment will go down. You can pay \noff more on principle and maybe retire your mortgage sooner. It is \nsomething we do all the time, whether we are refinancing a car or a \nhome or something else for which we borrowed.\n  But along come the financial institutions and special interest groups \nand say: There is one group in America that we will not allow to \nconsolidate their loans and at a lower interest rate. Which group did \nwe pick? The most vulnerable--college students. And do you know why? \nThey are not very good lobbyists. These kids spend too darned much time \non their books, and they don't buy the good lobbyists in Washington. I \njust don't know what is wrong with this generation that they haven't \nhired the fancy lobbyists, who roam our hallways with considerable \nretainers, to represent them. Maybe they just assumed some of the \nMembers of the Senate might be sympathetic to college students.\n  Well, they were wrong. When it came to a choice between more money \nfor the financial institutions that finance the student loans or \nstanding up for the students to keep interest rates down, guess who \nwon. The special interests won; the financial institutions won. The \ncollege students lost. As a consequence, they are burdened with more \ndebt. Isn't it great that this Government, which generates so much debt \nevery single day to be heaped on the shoulders of future generations in \nterms of our national debt, now decided to increase the personal debt \nof that same generation when it comes to college student loans?\n  Large educational debt changes the future for many of these students. \nCareer plans change. Lifestyles change. Home and auto purchases are put \non hold. Family plans have to be delayed to accommodate debt payments.\n\n[[Page S3203]]\n\n  Let me tell you two real-life stories that illustrate the effects of \nthese large student loan debts.\n  Margo Alpert is a 29-year-old Chicago public interest lawyer who is \non a 30-year repayment plan, 30 years to repay her student loan. She \nwill be in her mid 50s and thinking about her retirement by the time \nshe has finally paid off her student loan.\n  Carrie Gevirtz, a 28-year-old social worker who earned her master's \ndegree in social work last year from the University of Chicago, \nbabysits and teaches kickboxing to supplement her $33,000 yearly income \nso she can pay off her $55,000 student loan. She is a social worker, \nfor goodness' sakes. Here she is taking part-time jobs to pay off this \nmountain of debt which Congress, thank you, has just increased the cost \nof.\n  College graduates such as Margo and Carrie are forced to make \nlifestyle decisions based on their debt. But there are other lifestyle \ndecisions that are being made as well. Are you familiar with an \noperation known as Sallie Mae? Sallie Mae was a quasi-governmental \nagency which went private about 10 years ago. Sallie Mae is a financial \ninstitution, one of the largest when it comes to financing student \ndebt. Check it out. Google Sallie Mae. You will find one of the most \nprofitable corporations in America. They loan money to students, and \nthey are making a fortune.\n  Let me give an illustration of how good life is at Sallie Mae, the \ninstitution that is providing student loans for students across \nAmerica. Sallie Mae's chairman, Albert Lord, racked in $40 million a \nyear to oversee the student loan business and took some of the money \nthat he made and decided to buy over 200 acres in nearby Maryland, \nright outside of Washington. People in the area were nervous, wondering \nwhat Mr. Lord, the chairman of Sallie Mae, was going to do with over \n200 acres. They were afraid he was going to build a subdivision.\n  He calmed their fears: Don't worry. I am going to be building my \npersonal, private golf course. It is just for me. So don't worry, there \nwill be a lot of people here.\n  The chairman of Sallie Mae, this operation that is financing students \nloans, is doing pretty well, don't you think? Obviously, he is not \nsweating out paying back his student loan. He is worried about whether \nhe is going to be golfing and breaking par on the next hole.\n  Young adults are forced to hold off on life plans such as starting a \nfamily and a home and car purchases in order to accommodate their loan \npayments, while Sallie Mae vice presidents, just below Mr. Lord, are \nmaking an average of $350,000 to $400,000 a year. Young people like \nMargo and Carrie should not face such high penalties because they had \nthe desire and determination to pursue higher education.\n  High school graduates who qualify for college should not be turned \naway because they can't afford the cost. That is why I am introducing \nthe Reverse the Raid on Student Aid Act of 2006. This bill would cut \nstudent loan interest rates to 3.4 percent for student borrowers, 4.25 \npercent for parent borrowers. Students would be allowed to consolidate \nloans while in school in order to lock in lower interest rates. The \nbill would repeal the single holder rule and allow students who want to \nconsolidate their loans to shop around for the best deals rather than \nbeing locked in with their current lender. This is a luxury everybody \nenjoys. Why shouldn't students have it? The Pell Grant Program would be \nturned into a mandatory spending program with yearly increases.\n  An investment in our children's education is an investment in \nAmerica's future. We must do what we can today to ensure that America \nremains a global leader in the future.\n  I recently went to a high school outside of Chicago in one of the \nsuburbs. I wanted to meet with the math and science teachers. We have a \nserious challenge, not enough math and science teachers, particularly \nat the high school level. I sat down with a young lady who was very \ngood and well liked by her students. I said: How did you pick this high \nschool?\n  She said: Honestly, Senator, I had hoped to teach in Chicago in one \nof the inner-city schools. That is where I wanted to be. But this job \npaid me $200 more a month. I didn't have any choice. I couldn't pay off \nmy student loan and buy a car and work in the Chicago public school \nsystem. So I took this job in the suburbs.\n  That was perfectly understandable. But it is a clear illustration of \nhow this debt drives career decisions and how this young woman who \nmight have made a significant difference in the life of some of the \npoorest kids in my State had to make a different choice and, having \nmade that choice, you can understand the outcome when it comes to \neducation in my State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/06/senate-section/article/S3203-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING MIKE TRACY\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mike's head shines pretty brightly on a clear day.\n  Mike is always fond of saying that his job is not rocket science. It \nis not science, he is right. It is art--and Mike Tracey is a master at \nthe art of communications. He is a man who finds a challenge and \ntackles it head-on.\n  His tenacity is legendary. When he heads into a battle with me, Mike \nis always out on the front line with the flag flying high. He is a man \nwho loves America and is not afraid to let people know it. When you are \naround Mike, you cannot help but be boosted by this man's passion.\n  I am sad to see Mike Tracey leave my staff, but he goes on to a new \nchallenge, and I know he will tackle that challenge with the same \ntenacity he approaches life and has for 10 years approached the job he \ndoes for me. I wish him the best of luck and thank him for his service \nto me, to the State of Idaho, and to America.\n  Mike Tracey, have a great life in your next job, as I know you will.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/06/senate-section/article/S3203-2", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3203-S3205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from \nIndianapolis. Army Specialist Antoine J. McKinzie, 25 years old, died \non March 21st when his unit came under attack during a patrol of \nwestern Baghdad. With his entire life before him, Antoine risked \neverything to fight for the values we Americans hold close to our \nhearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  Antoine graduated from Pike High School in 2000 and joined the Army 3 \nyears later, after receiving his associate's degree in computer-aided \ndrafting from ITT Technical Institute. Jerry Henson, Antoine's best \nfriend, described him as ``one of the best guys I've ever known. I just \nremember his laugh. He had one helluva laugh. He had a hearty, tall-guy \nlaugh. It is one of those things that I will miss a lot.'' In December, \nAntoine returned to Indiana for 3 weeks to celebrate Christmas with his \nfamily. His stepfather recounted to a local newspaper, ``He looked \ngreat. He was healthy. He was happy. He felt like he was doing an \nimportant job He was proud to serve his country.''\n  Antoine was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. He was a member of the 4th Battalion, 27th Field Artillery \nRegiment, 1st Armored Division, based in Baumholder, Germany. Today, I \njoin Antoine's family and friends in mourning his death.\n\n[[Page S3205]]\n\nWhile we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take \npride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Antoine, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Antoine was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, Antoine will be remembered by family \nmembers, friends, and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we \nhonor the sacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Antoine's sacrifice, \nI am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the \nfamilies of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we \ncannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living \nand dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor \npower to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember \nwhat we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This \nstatement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am \ncertain that the impact of Antoine's actions will live on far longer \nthat any record of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Antoine J. McKinzie in the \nofficial record of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and \nfor his profound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I \nthink about this just cause in which we are engaged, and the \nunfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that \nfamilies like Antoine's can find comfort in the words of the prophet \nIsaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord \nGod will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Antoine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/06/senate-section/article/S3205-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, in each of the last 4 years, amendments \nhave been inserted in the Commerce, Justice,\n\n[[Page S3206]]\n\nScience, CJS, Appropriations Act by the House of Representatives which \nseverely handicap the efforts of those working to stop the flow of guns \nfrom reckless gun dealers into the hands of criminals. These amendments \nprohibit the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, ATF, \nfrom disclosing important information from the Firearms Trace System \nDatabase to local law enforcement and government officials unless it is \nconnected to a ``bona fide criminal investigation or prosecution'' and \nprohibiting release for purposes of civil lawsuits.\n  According to published reports, these amendments have directly \nimpacted a lawsuit by the city of New York against several gun \nmanufacturers and distributors who it alleges have adopted sales and \nmarketing practices which facilitate the transfer of guns to criminals. \nThe city received ATF firearms trace data from 1998 to 2003 but has \nbeen unable to attain data from subsequent years because of the \nprohibition inserted in the law on its release for the purposes of \ncivil lawsuits.\n  Legislation has recently been introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives which would make the restrictions on ATF firearms trace \ndata permanent. On March 28, 2006, New York City Mayor Michael \nBloomberg testified before the House Judiciary Committee against this \nbill and said that it ``would make it immeasurably harder to stop the \nflow of illegal guns to criminals, and depriv[e] local governments and \ntheir law enforcement agencies of the tools they need to hold dealers \naccountable. Specifically, these obstacles would take the form of \nsevere restrictions on our use of ATF trace data, which is perhaps the \nmost effective tool we have in combating illegal gun trafficking.''\n  Mayor Bloomberg also expressed concern regarding provisions in the \nbill and current law which limit the ATF firearms trace data available \nto local law enforcement officials to data regarding the local \ngeographic data. Mayor Bloomberg testified that 82 percent of the guns \nused in crimes in New York City were purchased outside of New York \nState. As Mayor Bloomberg pointed out in his testimony, restricting the \naccess of law enforcement officials to firearms trace data from other \njurisdictions severely limits their ability to take action against \nreckless gun dealers in other States.\n  I am hopeful the House of Representatives will defeat efforts to \ncontinue restrictions on law enforcement and local government \nofficials' access to important ATF firearms trace data. In addition, I \nam hopeful that the Senate will take up and pass legislation introduced \nlast week by Senator Menendez to repeal restrictions in current law. \nATF firearms trace data related to reckless gun dealers should be made \neasily available to those who have a responsibility to protect our \nfamilies and communities from the threat of gun violence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/06/senate-section/article/S3206-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3206-S3207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL AUTISM AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

As many as 1.5 million \nAmericans today are believed to have some form of autism. The \nDepartment of Education indicates that autism is growing at a rate of \n10 to 17 percent per year. At these rates, the prevalence of autism \ncould reach 4 million Americans in the next decade.\n  The prevalence of autism has increased astronomically in the past \ndecade, and in certain areas of New Jersey, the rates are higher still. \nWe know far too little about this disorder, and the work of the Centers \nfor Disease Control, CDC, and the National Institutes of Health, NIH, \nis vital to our efforts to learn more about the nature and incidence of \nautism.\n  I am a proud cosponsor of S. 843, the Combating Autism Act of 2005, \nwhich authorizes $860 million over 5 years to combat autism through \nresearch, screening, intervention, and education. I urge my fellow \nSenators to support the passage of this bill so that we can continue \nefforts to eliminate autism.\n  Congress approved the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, \nIDEA, in 1975, requiring States to provide an appropriate education to \nstudents with special needs. While it committed to providing 40 percent \nof the additional costs for educating such students, today the Federal \nGovernment funds only 17.8 percent of the cost. In the fiscal year 2006 \nLabor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill, \nthe Federal Government cut back on its share of the cost of providing \nspecial education. This leaves State governments and local school \ndistricts to choose between paying the extra cost or cutting programs. \nIt is vital that Congress fund IDEA at the fully authorized level. I \nurge my fellow Senators to support IDEA and pass S. 2185, the IDEA Full \nFunding Act.\n  Congress must remain committed to supporting efforts by medical \nresearchers, doctors, schools, State and local governments, and \nfamilies to learn more about autism and to treat it. This disorder \naffects too many already. We must do what we can to eliminate future \ncases while we treat people who currently have autism. I hope we can \nall join together in this important fight and recognize the importance \nof National Autism Awareness Month.\n\n\n                              Bob Newhart\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, recently The New York Times ran another \nprofile of Bob Newhart. I say ``another'' because it is one of so many \nglowing articles written about him over the years.\n  Marcelle and I are fortunate to know Bob and his wife Virginia, known \nby everyone as Ginnie. Bob is a wonderful family person who enjoys \nbeing with his wife, children, and grandchildren, but still has time to \nbring joy to everyone who comes in contact with him. As many times as I \nhave heard some of his comedy routines, I still find myself convulsed \nin laughter, though nothing can equal the quiet times Marcelle and I \nhave been able to spend with the Newharts.\n  Bob is extraordinarily well read and well informed and brings a wry \nand insightful view to whatever is happening. I can think of no one who \nis his equal, and I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From The New York Times, Mar. 25, 2006]\n\n             The Button-Down Comic, Still Standing Up at 76\n\n                            (By Ben Sisario)\n\n       Los Angeles, March 24: Hidden behind a wide black gate, \n     with a fountain in front and a big pool in back that the \n     grandchildren love to dive into, and with the bookcases \n     inside cluttered with the likes of David McCulloch and Joseph \n     J. Ellis, Bob Newhart's house in Bel Air would seem a \n     perfectly comfortable spot for a man of 76 to cocoon and \n     write his memoirs.\n       But a comedian craves the sound of laughter, and Mr. \n     Newhart, though happily deep into his golf-playing years, \n     cannot stay away from the stand-up circuit. He does about 30 \n     dates a year, mostly on short weekend trips. (He will perform \n     tonight at the Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts.)\n       ``I can't imagine not doing it,'' he said, sitting on an \n     overstuffed sofa in his living room, in crisp gray slacks and \n     a fuzzy blue sweater, with his narrow reading glasses resting \n     at a steep angle almost at the tip of his nose. ``It's \n     something I've done for 46 years, and at 5 o'clock I'll start \n     pacing up and down to get the adrenaline going. It's like \n     Russian roulette--you're out there and it's working and \n     you're saying, `Thank God the bullet's not in the chamber.' \n     ''\n       Mr. Newhart built his career on a persona that would avoid \n     tension and thrills at all cost. He emerged in the early \n     1960's as a former accountant and copywriter who acted out \n     the mundane and ridiculous details of great moments in \n     history through brilliantly minimalistic one-sided telephone \n     calls, like a gigglingly skeptical Englishman talking to Sir \n     Walter Raleigh about his discovery of tobacco. (``You take a \n     pinch of tobacco and you stuff it up your nose and it makes \n     you sneeze? Yeah, I imagine it would, Walt!'') And on two \n     long-running sitcoms, he played versions of the same \n     character, a slightly grouchy pragmatist always just a breath \n     away from losing his cool over the neurotic foibles of his \n     supporting cast.\n       ``The Bob Newhart Show'' ran from 1972 to 1978 and is now \n     finding a second life on DVD; its third season is being \n     reissued April 11.\n\n[[Page S3207]]\n\n     And since his second sitcom, ``Newhart,'' ended in 1990 after \n     eight seasons, Mr. Newhart has lent his almost-unflappable \n     deadpan to a handful of films and television shows, most \n     recently ``ER'' and ``Desperate Housewives.'' But his \n     favorite activity remains simply standing in front of a crowd \n     with a microphone.\n       ``I'm proudest of being a stand-up,'' he explained, \n     ``because it's harder. The degree of difficulty is 3.85 \n     instead of 3.5.''\n       It was also his baptism. Sitting in his spacious living \n     room, dressed like the frumpy innkeeper of ``Newhart'' and \n     speaking with a strategic stammer that sets up every punch \n     line, he is comfortingly recognizable as one of his \n     television characters. His naturalistic technique of relying \n     on his own personality to fill out his characters, he said, \n     is a skill he picked up early in his stand-up career.\n       ``You start out doing somebody else,'' he said. ``I'd watch \n     the Sullivan show and I'd watch the Paar show, and a comedian \n     would be on, and I'd be laughing but at the same time \n     analyzing him. When I started, I was doing all the good \n     comedians I'd ever seen. Then I developed my own voice. My \n     routines are my natural way of looking at the world.''\n       Mr. Newhart discusses his performance like a serious method \n     actor. He said: ``With the stand-up comic on TV, whether it's \n     Seinfeld or Cosby or Roseanne, more important than their \n     knowledge of how to tell a joke is their knowledge of \n     themselves, or the persona they've created as themselves. So \n     that when you're in a room with writers you can say, `Guys, \n     that's a funny line but I wouldn't say it.' ''\n       As a stand-up, he draws from a lifetime of routines, and \n     for his oldest fans he always includes a few numbers from his \n     first albums, like the conversation between Abraham Lincoln \n     and his public relations man, who urges him not to shave his \n     beard because it plays so well in focus groups. Reading \n     recently about the Zacarias Moussaoui trial, his ``button-\n     down mind'' found an angle on the 9/11 pilots, and he has \n     been toying with it as a possible stand-up bit.\n       ``They didn't want to learn to take off and land,'' he \n     said. ``They just wanted to fly. Some have criticized the \n     F.B.I. because that should have been a red flag. But I saw it \n     as a case of--'' he studied his coffee table it as if it were \n     a weekly planner--`` `O.K., well, I don't have to come in \n     Monday; I can come in late Tuesday; Wednesday and Thursday, \n     O.K., that's flying; and then I don't have to come in \n     Friday.' ''\n       His understated style has been widely influential, often in \n     surprising ways. One of his biggest fans is Bernie Mac, who \n     says he is but one of a generation of black comedians who \n     were inspired by Mr. Newhart.\n       ``A lot of people define courage as being out front and in \n     your face,'' Mr. Mac said, ``but Bob didn't come out of his \n     picture frame for anybody. That bland style, that plaid \n     jacket, with the hair combed to one side over the bald spot--\n     that was Bob. And there's nothing wrong with that. Because it \n     takes courage to be yourself, and he showed everybody that.''\n       Working on his memoir, to be published in the fall by \n     Hyperion, Mr. Newhart was reminded of the time he was on \n     David Susskind's talk show with a panel of comedians, \n     including Buddy Hackett and Alan King, and Mr. Susskind asked \n     him about his background.\n       `` `You went to college?' he asked,'' Mr. Newhart said. \n     ``And I said, `Yes, I went to Loyola University and I got a \n     degree in accounting.' And Buddy said--'' here Mr. Newhart \n     did a remarkable imitation of Mr. Hackett's voice--``  `You \n     mean you didn't have to do this?' ''\n       ``And now I can say, `No, Buddy, I had to do this.'\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/06/senate-section/article/S3207-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n            HONORING BRAVO COMPANY OF WEIRTON, WEST VIRGINIA\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today it is my great honor to \ncommend the soldiers of Bravo Company of the 463rd Engineering \nBattalion, Army Reserve Unit of Weirton, WV, as they return home. \nSelflessly leaving their families and communities behind during an 11-\nmonth deployment in Iraq, the 463rd served as a model of courage \nthroughout their tour of duty.\n  In October 2004, more than 140 men and women of Bravo Company \nanswered the call to service--leaving for training at Fort Bragg and in \nKuwait. In doing so, they joined generations of West Virginians who \nhave served our Nation in times of war, unselfishly putting themselves \nin harm's way to defend our country and protect the freedom of all \nAmericans. I am not surprised by their actions--West Virginians, and \nour neighbors throughout the Ohio Valley, have always been among the \nfirst to respond to their country's call to service--but I am \nnevertheless grateful for their service and commitment. Thanks to the \n463rd and so many other West Virginia men and women who have fought in \nIraq and Afghanistan, I am proud to say that West Virginia's long \ntradition of patriotism is very much alive and well.\n  On Christmas Eve 2004, Bravo Company entered Iraq to begin its \nmission of rebuilding the war-torn country. Bravo Company provided \nengineering support for our troops, upgraded an Iraqi Air Force base, \nrepaired a damaged bridge on the Tigris River needed for troop \nmovements, and provided infrastructure for refueling the airplanes that \nprovided such critical support in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Through \ntheir determined efforts, these individuals secured the safety of their \nfellow American men and women in uniform, simultaneously serving as the \nembodiment of American commitment to the people of Iraq. For that, they \ndeserve our sincere gratitude and deepest respect.\n  Tragically, Bravo Company's mission was not completed without loss. \nOn August 21, 2004, the life of Sgt. Joseph Nurre, a 22-year-old native \nof Wilton, CA was claimed by a roadside bomb near Samarra, Iraq. His \nfellow soldiers described him as an intensely dedicated soldier and a \nwarm, engaging friend. As Bravo Company returns home, Sergeant Nurre \nand his family remain in our thoughts and prayers.\n  To all the men and women of Bravo Company, 463rd Engineering \nBattalion, I thank you for your service, patriotism, and commitment to \nour country and its defense. Your bravery and selfless sacrifice have \nearned you the admiration and respect of West Virginians and our \nNation. God bless you all, and welcome home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/06/senate-section/article/S3207-2", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  25 YEARS DEFENDING DIGNITY AND WORTH\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, 25 years ago, a community in my \nState found itself with some new unwelcome neighbors. North Idaho made \ndismaying national headlines as ``Hate's New Home.'' These headlines \nwere a terrible distortion of the truth; the neo-Nazi organization that \nmoved its headquarters to Hayden represented only a tiny fraction of \nthe people who called Idaho home. Still, the damage was done, and \npeople were left with the dreadful and mistaken impression that \nIdahoans were intolerant, prejudiced and hateful. And to make matters \nworse, like a malignant growth, some who did embrace doctrines of \nintolerance and bigotry were drawn to the area.\n  It is at crisis points that we define ourselves as either cowards or \npeople of honor. The citizens of Kootenai County had a choice to make, \nand they chose to be people of honor. The Kootenai County Task Force on \nHuman Relations was founded, giving that region a chance to speak out \nagainst human rights violations and prejudice. When the Aryan Nation \ndecided to march down Main Street in Coeur d'Alene, rather than return \nhatred for hatred, businesses simply closed, giving the marchers no \naudience for their message of intolerance. Last year, the residents of \nHayden exercised perhaps the most powerful right granted us as American \ncitizens--our vote--sending a clear message that a leadership of hatred \nwas absolutely unacceptable. And what didn't make the national press in \nrecent years is the fact that according to the Southern Poverty Law \nCenter, as of 2000, Idaho had 70 human rights groups, or one for every \n18,500 people. To put this in perspective, at that time, California had \none for every 358,000 people and New York had one for every 167,000 \npeople. Now that is worthy of headlines, as far as I am concerned.\n  In cooperation with the task force and with a vision of established, \nongoing education and leadership in human rights, the generous support \nof the Greg C. Carr Foundation, and dedicated leadership of Human \nRights Education Institute board of directors, the Human Rights \nEducation Institute was established, opening its doors in December \n2005.\n  North Idaho was unexpectedly presented with a choice 25 years ago. \nIts citizens have not only responded with honor and justice, they, in \nthe words of a former task force leader, ``made lemonade out of \nlemons.'' I commend my fellow Idahoans on their vision for dignity and \nworth for all people. I applaud their staunch commitment to uphold our \nDeclaration of Independence, Constitution, and our Bill of Rights which \nensure equality for all under the law.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/06/senate-section/article/S3208-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3208]]\n         HONORING THE CITY OF MADISON ON ITS 150TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and \nhonor the city of Madison as it celebrates its 150th year. As a \nWisconsinite, I take great pride in our State's Capital, which is well \nknown for a unique mix of culture, education and natural beauty, as \nwell as a vibrant civic and political life.\n  In the first part of the 19th century, James Duane Doty, who would \nlater serve as Wisconsin's territorial governor, became enamored with a \npiece of land in south central Wisconsin that was nestled on an isthmus \nbetween two lakes. Doty purchased the land and named it after the \nfourth President, James Madison. It was this land that would become \nhome to Wisconsin's capitol, its university, and one of the State's \nthriving cultural centers.\n  Doty had the territorial capital moved from Belmont to Madison in \n1837. By the time the Village of Madison was incorporated as a city in \n1856 there were nearly 7,000 residents.\n  Madison boasts a strong tradition of diversity. Yankees from the \nEastern States came first, followed soon by German, Irish and Norwegian \nimmigrants. After the turn of the century, Madison also became home to \na growing number Italian, Greek, African-American, and Jewish \nresidents.\n  The State constitution called for a university to be situated near \nthe seat of government. In many ways, this provision could be credited \nwith paving the way for ``the Wisconsin Idea'' that has made Wisconsin \nsuch a center for innovative public policy. Putting the capital and the \nuniversity together has encouraged educators and researchers to play a \ncentral role in addressing social problems, and it has revolutionized \nthe way that Wisconsin, and the nation, approach public policy issues.\n  The University of Wisconsin-Madison is also a cornerstone of \nMadison's rich cultural life, offering a tremendous array of concerts, \nplays, lectures and other activities. And UW's students bring an energy \nto life in the city that is one of Madison's hallmarks.\n  The State capitol is another defining Madison landmark, both the \nbuilding itself, and how it has contributed to the city's character. \nPolitics and public service have been a part of Madison from the very \nbeginning, and they have made Madison home to some of the State's \ngreatest moments, including the passage of historic progressive \nlegislation at the turn of the last century under the leadership of \nthen-Governor Robert M. La Follette.\n  Madison has also achieved a wonderful system of parks and \narchitectural beauty in its public spaces, which complement the natural \nbeauty of the lakes' shorelines. These areas also serve as host to \noutdoor concerts and countless other activities during summer months.\n  Having graduated from UW-Madison and served in the State senate, and \nas a resident of nearby Middleton, I am not only proud to represent the \npeople of Madison, I am privileged to be a part of this community. I \nknow Madison residents will continue to draw on their city's rich \nhistory and continue to enjoy the beautiful land that captivated James \nDoty so many years ago. I hope that my colleagues will join me in \ncongratulating the city of Madison as it celebrates its \nsesquicentennial.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/06/senate-section/article/S3208-2", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SESQUICENTENNIAL OF MADISON, WISCONSIN\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nsesquicentennial of the great city of Madison, WI. Over the next few \ndays people from all over Wisconsin will gather in Madison for the 150-\nyear anniversary festivities.\n  Madison is a city unlike all others. The vibrant people who give life \nto the city care about their community and appreciate the natural \nbeauty and unique character that surrounds them. As a graduate of the \nUniversity of Wisconsin, I spent 4 of the happiest years of my life in \nMadison and my fondness for the city is undiminished years later. \nVisiting the farmers' market is one of my favorite ways to spend a \nsummer morning, even better if I can stop at Ella's Deli afterward.\n  Since that time, Madison has continued to grow and flourish. It is a \nplace of great culture, home to a vast array of interests, and a center \nof learning. Madison is fortunate to have first-class opera, symphony, \nand theater. Art and history enthusiasts can find the Chazen Museum of \nArt, the Wisconsin Historical Museum and the Madison Museum of \nContemporary Art. As the home of the University of Wisconsin, as well \nas Edgewood College, Madison Area Technical College and Herzing \nCollege, Madison's student population is an important part of the \ncommunity and drives fresh thinking and new ideas.\n  As the State Capital, Madison has been the center of Wisconsin's \nproud progressive tradition. ``Fighting Bob'' La Follette founded his \nmagazine, The Progressive, in 1909, and it is still published in \nMadison today. And we know that The Onion has its roots there, too.\n  Parks and trails, lectures and sporting events, fine food and \nnightlife make Madison a great place to live and work. Money Magazine \nwrote what we knew all along when it rated Madison as the best place to \nlive in the United States.\n  These are just a few of the many more reasons that I am proud of the \ncity of Madison and I congratulate them their sesquicentennial.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/06/senate-section/article/S3208-3", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RETIREMENT OF JOHN W. KEYS III\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize John W. \nKeys III, an extraordinary public servant who will be retiring on April \n15, 2006, as the Commissioner of Reclamation. John is a truly dedicated \nFederal official who has worked tirelessly throughout his career on \nbehalf of the Bureau of Reclamation and the water users it serves.\n  John has served as the Commissioner of Reclamation since July 2001. \nPrior to that, he spent 34 years as a career employee with the Bureau, \nstarting as a civil and hydraulic engineer. He spent many years in my \npart of the country, serving as the Pacific-Northwest regional director \nfor 12 years prior to his retirement in 1998.\n  John's tenure as Commissioner coincided with the worst five years of \ndrought in the past 5 centuries. John had to deal with growing, often \nconflicting, demands for water in the arid West. He initiated the Water \n2025 program to help States and water districts address these competing \nneeds. He is a consensus builder who helped craft a historic agreement \non the use of Colorado River water. Throughout his tenure, he made \nresolving water conflicts in the Klamath Basin, on the Oregon-\nCalifornia border, a top priority for the Bureau.\n  John is a commercial airline pilot and a white water enthusiast. He \nused to average about 300 flight hours a year, often flying for \norganizations like Angel Flight, Air LifeLine, and County Search and \nRescue, based out of Moab, UT. He also used to officiate high school \nand college football games. It is my understanding that John intends to \nspend time with his family after he retires. John's wife Dell is a \nfamily practice physician and Airman Medical Examiner, and is also a \npilot.\n  While I wish John well as he returns to the family and the activities \nhe loves, I want him to know that he will be missed. His leadership and \nhis understanding of western water issues have been invaluable over \nthese last 5 years.\n  I wish John and his wife Dell well as they enjoy their family and \ntheir golden years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/06/senate-section/article/S3208-4", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3208-S3209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CONGRATULATING UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN NCAA CHAMPIONS\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President I rise today as a proud alumnus of the \nUniversity of Wisconsin to congratulate the Men's Cross Country and \nWomen's Hockey teams on their recent NCAA National Championship \nvictories.\n  On November 21, 2005, the UW Men's Cross Country team won their first \nNCAA Division I title since 1988. This fourth NCAA title for the Men's \nCross Country program broke their 3-year streak of second place \nfinishes. Since their first competition in 1905, the UW Men's Cross \nCountry program has been no stranger to success. Just 5 years after UW \nMadison formed the team, the Badgers won the first Big Ten cross \ncountry championship in school history.

A bill to improve competition in the oil and gas industry, \nto strengthen antitrust enforcement with regard to industry mergers, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I am sending to the desk today \nlegislation captioned as the ``Oil and Gas Industry Antitrust Act of \n2006,'' legislation on behalf of myself and Senator DeWine, Senator \nKohl, Senator Leahy, Senator Feinstein and Senator Durbin. The \nJudiciary Committee has held hearings on the escalating price of \ngasoline, which has risen some 25 percent in the past year, from $1.85 \nper gallon nationally in January of 2005 to $2.38 a gallon early this \nyear.\n  We have seen rapid consolidation in the oil and gas industry, with \nmany mergers which are specified in the written statement I will have \nincluded in the Record and enormous profits characterized by the \nprofits reported by ExxonMobil, which earned over $36 billion in 2005, \nthe largest corporate profit in U.S. history.\n  The legislation we are introducing will do a number of things. First, \nit will eliminate the judge-made doctrines that prevent OPEC's members \nfrom being sued for violating the antitrust laws. There is no doubt \nthat they take joint action when deciding how much oil to sell, actions \nwould normally constitute unlawful price fixing.\n\n[[Page S3214]]\n\nThis legislation would make them subject to our antitrust laws.\n  With fewer players in the industry, anticompetitive acts, including \nthe withholding of supply and information sharing, become easier. The \nbill would prohibit oil and gas companies from diverting, exporting, or \nrefusing to sell existing supplies with the specific intention of \nraising prices.\n  The bill also requires the FTC and the Attorney General to consider \nwhether future oil and gas mergers should receive closer scrutiny. It \nrequires the GAO to evaluate whether the divestitures required by the \nantitrust agencies for past mergers were adequate to preserve \ncompetition. There is significant evidence that the concentration in \nthe industry has been a contributing factor to increasing gasoline and \noil prices. There are other factors, but it is not explained simply by \nthe increase in the cost of crude oil. This bill takes a firm stand to \nprotect the American consumer from enormous increases in gasoline \nprices and in oil prices--something very serious when we have \ninsufficient funds in LIHEAP to take care of people who are unable to \npay for the increasing costs of heating oil.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my prepared statement \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Consolidation in the Oil and Gas Industry: Raising Prices?\n\n       Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce new \n     legislation, the Oil and Gas Industry Antitrust Act of 2005.\n       Average gasoline prices nationwide have risen by 25 percent \n     in the past year alone, from $1.85 per gallon in January 2005 \n     to $2.38 per gallon at the beginning of this year.\n       Prices for heating oil, other petroleum products and \n     natural gas--products that are important to the lives of \n     American consumers--have risen to similar heights.\n       While Americans are paying more for the products they use \n     to get to work and heat their homes, the mammoth integrated \n     oil companies that dominate the industry have earned record \n     profits. ExxonMobil reported that it earned over $36 billion \n     in 2,005, the largest corporate profit in U.S. history.\n       Although rising crude oil prices are one factor influencing \n     gasoline prices, it is not the only factor. Increased prices \n     simply cannot be entirely explained by higher crude oil \n     prices.\n       In a hearing last month and another one next week, the \n     Judiciary Committee is I exploring a likely cause for higher \n     prices--the consolidation that has occurred in the industry \n     over the past decade, and that continues today.\n       Over 2,600 mergers have occurred in the U.S. petroleum \n     industry since the 1990s, including transactions involving \n     the largest oil and gas companies in the nation.\n       Last summer, the FTC approved Chevron's acquisition of \n     Unocal.\n       In 2002, Valero acquired Ultramar Diamond Shamrock and \n     Phillips merged with Conoco.\n       The year 2000 saw the merger of British Petroleum and ARCO.\n       The largest transaction occurred in 1999 when Exxon merged \n     with Mobil.\n       Other transactions included British Petroleum's acquisition \n     of Amoco, Marathon's joint venture with Ashland Petroleum and \n     another joint venture that combined the refining assets of \n     Shell and Texaco.\n       Last month the Department of Justice just approved Conoco-\n     Phillips' acquisition of Burlington Resources, a merger that \n     creates the nation's largest natural gas company and the \n     third largest integrated oil company.\n       These transactions have resulted in significantly increased \n     concentration in the oil and gas industry, particularly in \n     the downstream refining and wholesale gasoline markets.\n       Fewer competitors in a market conveys market power on \n     remaining players, and with it, the opportunity to increase \n     prices. As we have learned in Committee, there is some \n     evidence that consolidation in the industry has increased \n     wholesale gasoline prices.\n       Fewer competitors in a market also makes collusion easier. \n     Recent events suggest that increased concentration may be \n     creating a ``collusive environment'' in the industry.\n       A number of experts have pointed to limited refinery \n     capacity as a cause for price spikes in recent years. No new \n     refineries have been built in the U.S. for-30 years. While \n     some existing refineries have expanded in recent years, other \n     refineries have closed. From 1998 through 2004, total \n     refinery capacity nationwide grew by less than one percent. \n     Today, U.S. refineries routinely operate at over 90 percent \n     of capacity. Critics have alleged that tacit collusion among \n     industry players has restrained the growth of refinery \n     capacity.\n       ExxonMobil and British Petroleum were recently sued by the \n     Alaska Gasoline Port Authority for allegedly conspiring to \n     withhold natural gas from customers who wished to transport \n     the gas via pipeline to an Alaskan port. An agreement between \n     Exxon and British Petroleum not to sell their natural gas to \n     the Alaskan project would violate the antitrust laws.\n       The Judiciary Committee has held two hearings this year to \n     consider the effects of concentration in the industry. The \n     most recent hearing in March considered whether concentration \n     had resulted, in increased prices for gasoline, other \n     petroleum-based fuels and natural gas.\n       The witnesses at that hearing--two experienced and \n     respected antitrust lawyers, the attorney general of Iowa, an \n     economist from the University of California at Berkeley and \n     the Senior Assistant Attorney General from California--all \n     agreed that there were problems with market power in the \n     industry.\n       Most of these witnesses testified that there was a serious \n     problem with tacit coordination and information sharing in \n     the industry made possible by having fewer players in the oil \n     and gas industry. Such conduct unquestionably leads to higher \n     prices.\n       Based on the testimony the Committee heard, it is pretty \n     clear that increased concentration in the industry has led to \n     higher prices. In part, the antitrust agencies need to adjust \n     their enforcement posture to reflect existing conditions in \n     the industry, but I believe there is a need for legislation. \n     The Oil and Gas Industry Antitrust Act of 2006, which I am \n     introducing today, would require the antitrust enforcement \n     agencies, as well as the GAO, to take a close look at their \n     past merger enforcement and whether the standard for \n     reviewing mergers should be changed. The original draft of \n     this legislation would have increased the standard of review \n     for mergers in the industry, but we would like to give GAO \n     and the enforcement agencies a chance to look at how the \n     standard should be changed. The legislation:\n       Amends the Clayton Act by prohibiting oil and gas companies \n     from diverting, exporting or refusing to sell existing \n     supplies with the specific intention of raising prices or \n     creating a shortage.\n       Requires the FTC and the Attorney General to consider \n     whether the standard of review for mergers contained in \n     Section 7 of the Clayton Act needs to be modified for mergers \n     in the oil and gas industry to take into account the \n     concentration that has already occurred in this industry.\n       Requires the Government Accountability Office to evaluate \n     whether . divestitures required by the antitrust agencies in \n     oil and gas industry mergers have been effective in restoring \n     competition. Once the study is complete, the antitrust \n     agencies must consider whether any additional steps are \n     necessary to restore competition, including further \n     divestitures or possibly unraveling some mergers.\n       Requires the antitrust agencies to establish a joint \n     federal-state task force to examine information sharing and \n     other anticompetitive results of consolidation in the oil and \n     gas industry. Economic studies show that sharing price and \n     production information in a concentrated market will result \n     in increased prices. Oil companies frequently supply each \n     other with gasoline in areas where they have no source of \n     supply through so-called ``exchange agreements.'' Refiners \n     also frequently share terminals and pipelines, which \n     facilitates the exchange of information. These practices \n     alone do not violate the antitrust laws, but parallel conduct \n     in combination with information sharing could be enough to \n     establish a violation of the antitrust laws.\n       Eliminates the judge-made doctrines that prevent OPEC \n     members from being sued for violating the antitrust laws by \n     conspiring to fix the price of crude oil.\n       It is my hope that this legislation will help reverse the \n     trend toward less competition and higher prices. The \n     cosponsors of this legislation--Senator Kohl, Senator DeWine, \n     Senator Durbin, Senator Leahy, Senator Feinstein--deserve \n     enormous credit for having the courage to take on this issue \n     and for helping to develop this important legislation. I urge \n     other members that are concerned about consolidation in the \n     industry--and about the prices that consumers are paying to \n     drive to work and heat their homes--to support this important \n     legislation.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to join with Senators Specter, \nKohl, DeWine and others on a new bill, the Oil and Gas Industry \nAntitrust Act of 2006, which includes, as its centerpiece, our NOPEC \nlegislation, which many of us have worked together on for years.\n  This measure--The No Oil Producing And Exporting Cartels Act, NOPEC--\nwould make OPEC accountable for its anticompetitive behavior and allow \nthe Justice Department to crack down on illegal price manipulation by \noil cartels. It will allow the Federal Government to take legal action \nagainst any foreign state, including members of OPEC, for price fixing \nand other anticompetitive activities. The tools this bill would provide \nto law enforcement agencies are necessary to immediately counter OPEC's \nanticompetitive practices, and these tools would help reduce gasoline \nprices now.\n  The Congress should pass this measure immediately instead of waiting \nuntil the price of gasoline at the pump is $4 a gallon. OPEC has \nAmerica over a barrel, and we should fight back. If OPEC were simply a \nforeign business engaged in this type of behavior, it\n\n[[Page S3215]]\n\nwould already be subject to American antitrust law. It is wrong to let \nOPEC producers off the hook just because their anticompetitive \npractices come with the seal of approval of this cartel's member \nnations.\n  It is time for the President to join the bipartisan majority in the \nSenate which already said ``NO'' to OPEC by passing NOPEC and by \nsending it to the other body, where it was killed.\n  The Senate has already passed this bill, which would make OPEC \nsubject to our antitrust laws. In fact, the Judiciary Committee has \napproved the NOPEC bill three times. Regrettably, even though President \nBush promised in 2000 that he would ``jawbone OPEC,'' the Bush \nadministration and its friends in the House have scuttled the NOPEC \nbill and the direct and daily relief it would bring to millions of \nAmericans.\n  In addition, this bill makes it unlawful to divert petroleum or \nnatural gas products from their local market to a distant market with \nthe primary intention of increasing prices or creating a shortage in a \nmarket. This solves a real problem where products are being shipped for \nsale in that market but are later diverted and sold for less in another \nmarket.\n  We have an obligation to address these and other issues caused by oil \ncartels and by greedy companies who have money--that they have \nextracted from the American people--to burn. That is why I am also \npleased that the bill includes provisions to conduct several studies \nthat address serious competition, information sharing, and other \nantitrust problem areas related to the oil and natural gas industries. \nThe American people deserve answers, and this bill also provides a path \nto getting those answers.\n  Authorizing tough legal action against illegal oil price fixing, and \ntaking that action without delay, is one thing we can do without \nadditional obstruction or delay.\n  The artificial pricing scheme enforced by OPEC affects all of us, not \nthe least of whom are hardworking Vermont farmers. The overall increase \nin fuel costs for an average Vermont farmer last year was 43 percent, \nmeaning that each farmer is estimated to pay an additional $700 in fuel \nsurcharges in 2006 alone. Vermonters know what the terrible \nconsequences of these high prices can be: forcing many farmers to make \nunfair choices between running their farms or heating their homes. No \none should be forced to make these choices, certainly not our hard-\nworking farmers.\n  In summary, this bill will provide law enforcement with the tools \nnecessary to fight OPEC's anticompetitive practices immediately, and \nhelp reduce gasoline prices now. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill, and to say ``NO'' to OPEC as we have done in the past.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Specter to \nintroduce the Oil and Gas Industry Antitrust Act of 2006. This \nlegislation will make several important and overdue reforms to our \nantitrust laws to give our Federal Government more of the tools it \nneeds to take action to combat anti-competitive conduct in the oil and \ngas industry. It will also direct that our antitrust enforcement \nagencies undertake several actions to ensure that they are enforcing \nour current antitrust laws properly.\n  We have all seen the suffering felt by consumers and our national \neconomy resulting from rising energy prices. Gasoline prices are once \nagain on the rise, with the national average price increasing more than \nthirty cents in the last month alone. Many industry experts fear, if \ncurrent trends continue, that last summer's record levels of more than \nthree dollars per gallon will be exceeded this coming summer. And \nprices for other crucial energy products--such as natural gas and home \nheating oil--have undergone similar sharp increases. These price \nincreases are a silent tax that steals hard earned money away from \nAmerican consumers every time they visit the gas pump and every time \nthey raise their thermostat to keep their family warm.\n  There is much debate about the causes of these gas prices. The role \nof increasing worldwide demand and supply limitations obviously play a \nrole. But our investigation in the Judiciary Committee--including two \nhearings in the last several months--have made plain the facts that \nmake many of us suspect that oil and gas markets are not behaving in a \ntruly competitive fashion. The GAO has found that there were over 2600 \nmergers and acquisitions in the oil industry since 1990, and that these \nmergers have caused the price of gasoline to increase from one to seven \ncents per gallon. Despite a substantial growth in demand, no new \nrefineries have been opened in the United States in 25 years. Instead, \nmore than half have been closed, so that overall national refining \ncapacity declined by more than 9 percent from 1981 to 2004 while demand \nfor gasoline rose 37 percent. Many argue that limiting refining \ncapacity is actually in the oil companies' interest, as it enables them \nto gain market power over supply to raise price.\n  And the oil industry has unquestionably enriched itself during this \nperiod of high prices. Oil industry profits reached record high levels \nlast year, led by Exxon Mobil's record high profits of over $36 \nbillion. An independent study by the consumers group Public Citizen \nfound that U.S. oil refiners increased their profits on each gallon of \ngasoline they refined by 79 percent in the five-year period ending in \n2004. While it is true that the world price of crude oil has \nsubstantially increased, the fact that the oil companies can so easily \npass along all of these price increases to consumers of gasoline and \nother refined products--and compound their profits along the way--\ndemonstrates to many of us that that there is a failure of competition \nin our oil and gas markets.\n  Indeed, at our hearing last month, the chief executives of our \nNation's largest oil companies admitted they had no difficulty in \npassing along crude oil price increases to consumers. Rex Tillerson of \nExxonMobil forthrightly testified that ``[t]he high price of crude oil \nhas been passed ultimately along to the consumer of whatever the \nfinished product may be . . . .'' David O'Reilly of Chevron agreed.\n  It also seems clear that there has been a failure of our antitrust \nenforcement agencies to take action to restore competition to this \nvital industry. Vigorous antitrust enforcement is essential to restore \ncompetition to these markets, and it is now time to strengthen our \nantitrust laws to ensure that they are up to the job. This bill that \nSenator Specter and I are introducing today will significantly enhance \nour antitrust laws to ensure that the government has the necessary \ntools to take action to restore competition in this industry, and also \ndirect that the government examine its enforcement policy to determine \nif additional changes are needed.\n  Our bill has five elements, each essential to strengthening antitrust \nenforcement in the petroleum industry. It contains two important \nchanges to existing antitrust law. First, it will amend the Clayton Act \nto prohibit withholding supplies of petroleum, gasoline or any other \nfuel for the primary purpose of increasing prices or creating a \nshortage. This provision will prevent the ability of oil producers and \nrefiners to limit supply to manipulate price. Second, it incorporates \nour NOPEC bill--legislation I have introduced each Congress since \n2000--to make the actions of the OPEC oil cartel subject to U.S. \nantitrust law. This provision will, for the first time, establish \nclearly and plainly that when a group of competing oil producers like \nthe OPEC nations act together to restrict supply or set prices, they \nare violating U.S. law. This provision will authorize the Attorney \nGeneral to file suit under the antitrust laws for redress, and will \nremove the protections of sovereign immunity and the act of state \ndoctrine from nations that participate in the oil cartel. Our NOPEC \nprovision passed the Senate last year as an amendment to the energy \nbill, but was subsequently dropped by the House-Senate Conference \nCommittee without explanation. It is past time to pass this much needed \nanti-cartel measure finally into law.\n  Our bill also will direct that the antitrust enforcement agencies \nundertake several important actions to promote competition. The first \ntwo of these measures will address the government's response to the \nhuge wave of consolidation in the oil industry. First, the bill will \ndirect that the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission conduct \na study and report their\n\n[[Page S3216]]\n\nfindings to us in nine months, as to whether the Clayton Act needs to \nbe amended to ensure that mergers which truly lessen competition in the \npetroleum industry are prohibited. Second, the bill directs a study by \nthe GAO to be completed within six months to examine whether the \nconsent decrees and divestitures obtained by the Justice Department or \nFTC in the oil industry have been effective in protecting competition. \nThe Attorney General and FTC are directed to consider additional action \nbe required to restore competition upon completion of this report. \nFinally, the bill directs that the Attorney General and FTC Chairman \nestablish a joint Federal-State task force to investigate information \nsharing among companies producing, refining, or marketing petroleum, \ngasoline or any other refined product.\n  As Ranking Member on the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee, I believe \nthat this bill is an important step to reforming our antitrust laws and \nrestoring competition to the oil and gas industry. All of us can agree \nthat anticompetitive conduct leading to higher prices for gasoline and \nother energy products simply cannot be tolerated. It is essential that \nwe give our government the necessary tools to do the job, and I am \ncertain our bill is a long overdue measure to do just that.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Oil and Gas Industry Antitrust \nAct of 2006.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am proud to join as a co-sponsor of \nSenator Specter's Oil and Gas Industry Antitrust Act. This bill should \nhelp us curb the skyrocketing energy prices that have been an \nincreasing burden on our Nation's consumers and businesses. It also \nshould help us figure out how we can address these problems in the \nfuture.\n  High fuel costs are affecting every family, whether they are driving \nacross town or heating their homes, and we must continue our efforts to \ndo something about it. This bill would take immediate steps to help \ndecrease possible price manipulation by oil companies and allow \ngovernment enforcement agencies to take action to prevent price-fixing \nby oil producing nations.\n  I have been working on this problem for a long time. In fact, Senator \nKohl and I have worked hard in our Subcommittee on Antitrust, \nCompetition Policy and Consumer Rights to encourage FTC monitoring of \ngas prices and their careful investigation of oil industry behavior. I \nbelieve that those efforts have helped limit the fuel price increases; \nunfortunately, we still face enormous problems in this area, and we are \nall paying higher and higher prices for gas and heating oil. So, we \nneed to continue our efforts and try some different approaches, and \nthis legislation does just that.\n  Specifically, this bill calls for the Government Accountability \nOffice to undertake a thorough study of the past enforcement actions \ntaken by the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice in \nprior oil industry merger investigations. This study will provide much-\nneeded information on how effective the antitrust agencies' actions \nhave been in preventing harm to consumers from mergers within the \npetroleum industry. Even more important, this bill also will call on \nthe FTC and DOJ to use the findings from that study to examine those \nspecific mergers and determine if they need to take further enforcement \naction regarding those deals. In addition, the antitrust agencies will \nutilize this information to take a close look at the petroleum industry \nand to determine whether they require special antitrust rules--\napplicable specifically to the oil industry--to give the agencies the \ntools they need to promote competition in the oil industry. This would \nbe a very significant step, of course, but it is something they will \nconsider.\n  Another important provision of this legislation creates a Joint \nFederal and State Task Force to investigate information sharing in the \noil industry that may lead to artificially high prices for gasoline, \nelectricity, and heating oil. The Federal Government and the various \nStates have worked very effectively in the past to look into price \nspikes, supply disruptions, and a host of commercial arrangements that \ncan harm consumers, and this bill provides a valuable framework for \ncontinuing and increasing this very effective cooperation.\n  Moreover, this bill will put an end to certain types of activities \nthat oil companies may use to drive up prices or create shortages for \nall types of fuels. Specifically, this bill makes sure that oil \ncompanies cannot manipulate prices by refusing to sell their products \nin particular markets or diverting oil products away from American \nshores to artificially create a shortage and pad their profits. I am \nparticularly pleased that the bill includes a provision that Senator \nKohl and I have pursued since 2000--a provision that would make it \nclear that the Antitrust Division can prosecute OPEC for its price-\nfixing.\n  I believe that some of the provisions of this bill will help right \naway, like limiting the ability of the oil companies to refuse to sell \npetroleum in markets that need it and putting OPEC on notice that they \ncan be prosecuted if they violate our laws. These provisions should \nhelp in the short-term. And, the other provisions, which require \nstudies and review of past enforcement actions and analysis of possible \nchanges in the antitrust laws, may help us address this problem in the \nlong-run.\n  This bill will make a difference and help consumers. I strongly \nencourage my colleagues to join in support of its passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 2559. A bill to make it illegal for anyone to defraud and deprive \nthe American people of the right to the honest services of a Member of \nCongress and to instill greater public confidence in the United States \nCongress; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the ``Honest \nServices Act of 2006,''--a bill to provide new tools for Federal \nprosecutors to combat public corruption in our government. The purpose \nof this bill is to strengthen the tools available to Federal \nprosecutors to combat public corruption. This bill articulates more \nclearly for lobbyists, members of Congress, and Congressional staff the \nline that cannot be crossed regarding links between gifts or special \nfavors and official acts, without incurring criminal liability.\n  Just recently, the Senate passed the Legislative Transparency and \nAccountability Act of 2006, S. 2349--the first lobbying reform bill in \nCongress in over a decade. I voted for the lobbying reform bill and I \nbelieve that this legislation takes an important step toward restoring \nthe public's confidence in Congress.\n  I was disappointed, however, that I did not have an opportunity to \noffer the bill that I now propose as an amendment to the lobbying \nreform bill because cloture was invoked very early in the floor debate. \nMy amendment would have offered an important and needed new dimension \nto the lobbying reform bill by strengthening our criminal public \ncorruption laws.\n  Although it is certainly important to have high ethical standards \nwithin Congress and more transparency in the lobbying process, vigorous \nenforcement of our Federal public corruption laws is also an important \ncomponent of this effort to restore public confidence in government. \nIndeed, it was only with the indictments of Jack Abramoff, Michael \nScanlon, and Randy ``Duke'' Cunningham that Congress took note of the \nserious ethics scandals that have grown over the last years. If we are \nserious about restoring public confidence in Congress, we need to do \nmore than just reform the lobbying disclosure laws and ethics rules. \nCongress must send a signal that it will not tolerate this type of \npublic corruption by providing better tools Federal prosecutors to \ncombat it.\n  This bill will do exactly that. The bill creates a better legal \nframework for combating public corruption than currently exists under \nour criminal laws. It specifies the crime of Honest Services Fraud \nInvolving Members of Congress and prohibits defrauding or depriving the \nAmerican people of the honest services of their elected \nrepresentatives.\n  Under this bill, lobbyists who improperly seek to influence \nlegislation and other official matters by giving expensive gifts, \nlavish entertainment and travel, and inside advice on investments to \nMembers of Congress and their staff would be held criminally liable for \ntheir actions. The law also prohibits Members of Congress and their\n\n[[Page S3217]]\n\nstaff from accepting these types of gifts and favors, or holding hidden \nfinancial interests, in return for being influenced in carrying out \ntheir official duties. Violators are subject to a criminal fine and up \nto 20 years imprisonment, or both.\n\n  This legislation strengthens the tools available to Federal \nprosecutors to combat public corruption, by removing some of the legal \nhurdles to public corruption prosecutions. Under current law, Federal \nprosecutors often have great difficulty bringing public corruption \ncases because it is difficult to prove a specific quid pro quo under \nthe Federal bribery statute. In addition, the current honest services \nfraud statute--18 U.S.C. 1346--requires that prosecutors must also show \nthat misconduct occurred via the mail or wire, even when there is clear \nevidence of an improper link between gifts and an official act. My bill \nmakes it possible for Federal prosecutors to bring public corruption \ncases without having to first overcome these hurdles.\n  The bill also provides lobbyists, Members of Congress, and other \nindividuals with much-needed notice and clarification as to what kind \nof conduct triggers this criminal offense. For much of the 20th \nCentury, honest services fraud was a common law offense which courts \nread into the federal mail and wire fraud statutes. In 1987, the \nSupreme Court invalidated this common law concept in the case of \nMcNally v. United States. In response to the McNally case, Congress \nsubsequently added an honest services mail and wire fraud statute--18 \nU.S.C. 1346--to the Federal criminal code. Section 1346 has been \nregularly relied upon by prosecutors in public corruption cases ever \nsince. However, that provision is often criticized for being too vague \nor for failing to give public officials sufficient notice about what \ntype of conduct is covered by the statute. Courts have also disagreed \nabout exactly what this statute means. My bill will help to resolve the \nconfusion about honest services fraud in the legislative context, by \nsetting out a well-defined honest services fraud offense for violations \ninvolving Members of Congress. In addition, the bill's intent \nrequirements ensure that corrupt conduct can be appropriately \nprosecuted, but that innocuous actions will not be inappropriately \ntargeted.\n  Lastly, my bill authorizes $25 million in additional federal funds \nover each of the next four years to give federal prosecutors needed \nresources to investigate public corruption. According to the FBI's \n2004-2009 Strategic Plan, reducing public corruption in our country's \nFederal, State, and local governments is one of the FBI's top \ninvestigative priorities--behind only terrorism, espionage, and cyber \ncrimes. However, an August 2005 report by the Department of Justice's \nInspector General, found that, since 2000, there has been an overall \nreduction in the number of public corruption matters investigated by \nthe FBI. That report noted that, in 2004, the FBI referred 63 fewer \npublic corruption cases to the United States Attorney's offices across \nthe Nation than it referred in 2000. My bill will give the FBI and the \nPublic Integrity Section within the Department of Justice new resources \nto hire additional public corruption investigators and public \ncorruption prosecutors.\n  If we are serious about addressing the egregious misconduct that we \nhave recently witnessed, Congress must enact meaningful legislation to \nstrengthen our public corruption laws and give investigators and \nprosecutors the resources they need to enforce these laws.\n  The unfolding public corruption investigations involving lobbyist \nJack Abramoff and former Representative Randy ``Duke'' Cunningham \ndemonstrate that unethical conduct by public officials has broad \nranging impact. Just last month, the Washington Post reported that, as \nan outgrowth of the Cunningham investigation, federal investigators and \nthe Pentagon are now looking into contracts awarded by the Pentagon's \nnew intelligence agency--the Counterintelligence Field Activity--to \nMZM, Inc., a company run by Mitchell J. Wade, who recently pleaded \nguilty to conspiring to bribe Mr. Cunningham. The Cunningham case \ndemonstrates that our democracy and national security depend upon a \nhealthy, efficient, and ethical government.\n  The American people expect--and deserve--to be confident that their \nrepresentatives in Congress perform their legislative duties in a \nmanner that is beyond reproach and that is in the public interest.\n  Because I strongly believe that Congress must do more to restore the \npublic's trust in their Congress, I urge all Senators to support this \nbill.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2559\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reauthorize the Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I further introduce the reauthorization \nfor the Office of National Drug Control Policy Act of 2006. Senators \nHatch, Biden, and Grassley have worked with me on this issue. This is \nthe office to establish our drug policy. Since 2001, according to the \nONDCP--the Office of National Drug Control Policy--the combined use of \nillicit drugs by 8th, 10th, and 12th graders has decreased by some 19 \npercent. We have seen a serious problem with methamphetamine. This \nagency is very important to carry out the administration's policy to \ntry to reduce drug usage.\n\n[[Page S3218]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my prepared statement \nbe printed in the Record.\n\n   Introductory Statement--``Office of National Drug Control Policy \n                     Reauthorization Act of 2006''\n\n       Mr. President, to reiterate I seek recognition today to \n     introduce the ``Office of National Drug Control Policy \n     Reauthorization Act of 2006'' and ask for the support of my \n     colleagues for this important legislation concerning the war \n     on illegal drugs.\n       This bill re-authorizes the Office of National Drug Control \n     Policy--(``ONDCP'')--the Administration's office responsible \n     for establishing policy and objectives to reduce illicit drug \n     use, manufacturing, and trafficking, drug-related crime and \n     violence, and drug-related health consequences. Senators \n     Biden, Hatch and Grassley have worked diligently with me in \n     crafting this bill to provide authorization for ONDCP and its \n     programs, and maintain a high level of Congressional \n     oversight. I appreciate their consistent leadership.\n       Since 2001, according to ONDCP, the combined use of illicit \n     drugs by 8th, 10th, and 12th graders has decreased 19 \n     percent. This amounts to roughly 700,000 students who are not \n     using drugs. ONDCP has prepared a National Drug Control \n     Strategy that seeks to build on this progress and attain the \n     President's goal of a 25 percent reduction in 5 years. I want \n     to see the President's 25 percent reduction goal become a \n     reality, and this bill will assist the Administration meet \n     this objective.\n       Drug use and abuse--particularly among our youth--has a \n     profoundly negative impact that spreads among our society \n     like ripples made in water. Drug use leads to increased crime \n     and violence, lowers educational standards, and has a \n     destructive impact on the family unit. We need to take \n     affirmative steps to provide the Executive Branch with the \n     tools it needs to confront the problem of drugs and the \n     negative consequences that follow from their abuse. This bill \n     seeks to do just that.\n       We have seen over the last few years an epidemic involving \n     the abuse of methamphetamine--a highly addictive drug that \n     has been particularly damaging to our youth. This is a drug \n     that can be cooked in low-tech labs with ingredients that can \n     be purchased at most convenience stores. As a result, we \n     included in the USA Patriot Act--which was recently signed \n     into law--provisions that: (1) restrict the sale and \n     distribution of chemical ingredients that make \n     methamphetamine; (2 ) provides critical resources to state \n     and local law enforcement; and (3) enhances international law \n     enforcement of methamphetamine trafficking. Congress \n     affirmatively responded to this problem and acted by passing \n     the Combat Meth Act. We seek to continue these efforts with \n     this legislation.\n       Once again, the President's 2007 budget seeks to shift \n     funding of High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA's) \n     from ONDCP to the Department of Justice as a separate entity \n     within the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force--\n     (OCDETF). The HIDTA program was created by Congress to exist \n     within ONDCP, and has successfully grown from 5 HIDTA's in \n     1990 to 28 HIDTA's that currently exist across the United \n     States. HIDTA's enhance and coordinate drug control efforts \n     among local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies, and \n     provides agencies with equipment, technology, and additional \n     resources to combat drug trafficking and their harmful \n     consequences in critical regions of the United States. This \n     bill keeps the HIDTA program within ONDCP where Congress \n     intended it to remain.\n       I am hopeful the provisions in this bill meet the goals set \n     by the President and reduce the overall use and abuse of \n     illegal drugs in our country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI:\n  S. 2561. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to make \navailable cost-shared grants and enter into cooperative agreements to \nfurther the goals of the Water 2025 Program by improving water \nconservation, efficiency, and management in the Reclamation States, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, an excerpt from John Steinbeck's classic \nThe Grapes of Wrath recounting the conditions preceding the great Dust \nBowl is eerily similar to the conditions currently faced by the \nSouthwestern United States. ``The sky grew pale and the clouds that had \nhung in high puffs for so long in the spring were dissipated. The sun \nflared down on the growing corn each day until a line of brown spread \nalong the edge of each green bayonet. The clouds appeared, and went \naway, and in a while they did not try any more. The weeds grew darker \ngreen to protect themselves, and they did not spread any more. The \nsurface of the earth crusted, a thin hard crust, and as the sky became \npale, so the earth became pale, pink in the red country and white in \nthe gray country . . . Every moving thing lifted the dust into the air. \n. . . The dust was long in settling back again.''\n  As of April 5, 2006, statistics provided by the Natural Resources \nConservation Service (NRCS) of the United States Department of \nAgriculture indicate that my home State of New Mexico is facing one of \nthe worst droughts in the past 100 years. Historic snow pack data \nindicates the 2005-2006 snow season is the worst in more than 50 years. \nSeveral river basins in New Mexico, including the Rio Hondo and Mimbres \nriver basins currently have no snow pack. This fact is particularly \ntroubling when one considers that we rely on spring run-off for our \nsurface water. Moreover, lack of snow pack indicates that our \nreservoirs, already depleted after years of drought, will remain at \nalarmingly low levels. According to the NRCS, ``Record low snow packs \nin several of the major basins have water managers scratching their \nheads, wondering how best to manage the water resource, with no real \nhopes of realizing any significant runoff to refill the reservoirs.'' \nThese facts, taken together, are particularly ominous.\n  Unseasonably warm temperatures in New Mexico have resulted in the \nstart of the runoff season in early March, something that usually \nstarts in middle to late April. The early beginning of the run-off \nseason will be particularly damaging to the agriculture industry which \nrelies on spring run-off for irrigation during the early growing \nseason. The lack of precipitation will also be devastating to our \nranchers and dairymen. Because drought has hindered local production of \nhay, it has to be hauled from great distances. As a result, hay is \napproximately twice as expensive as usual, placing a great economic \nstrain on the ranching and dairy industries. I fully anticipate that \nthe drought will interrupt municipal water service. Although early in \nthe year, the Village of Ruidoso, New Mexico has contacted my office \nseeking emergency Federal assistance to address looming water \nshortages. In addition, numerous New Mexico communities are under \nsevere water restrictions.\n  The current drought illustrates how perilously close we are coming to \nhaving serious and widespread water shortages and the need to make more \nefficient use of the water we do have. The competing demands of \nagriculture, industry, municipalities and environmental needs have \nplaced an enormous strain on available supplies of water. This is \nparticularly true with respect to our interstate rivers that are \ngoverned by compacts. These interstate agreements require that a \ncertain amount of water be delivered to downstream States. Meanwhile, \nenormous amounts of water are lost because of antiquated water \ninfrastructure. In many instances, relatively cheap water \ninfrastructure upgrades can minimize water losses. For example, by \nlining dirt canals, large amount of water can be saved that otherwise \nwould have been lost to seepage. For the past 3 years, Congress has \nmade available efficiency and conservation grants through the \nAdministration's Water 2025 program. The goal of this program is to \nmake more water available in water-short river systems through \ninfrastructure conservation and efficiency upgrades. The bill I \nintroduce today would authorize the Water 2025 program. While not a \npanacea to our water woes, I believe that this legislation will help us \nmaximize the water available to us during times of drought.\n  I would like to thank Representative Heather Wilson, our \nCongresswoman from the First Congressional District of New Mexico for \nintroducing the House companion to this measure. She fully appreciates \nthe breadth of this problem and I look forward to working with her on \nthis critically important issue.\n  Ensuring adequate water supplies for the Southwestern United States \nis as important a matter as any I can contemplate. As Chairman of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, which has jurisdiction over \nthis legislation, I assure it will receive prompt Committee \nconsideration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2561\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S3219]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to increase, effective as of December 1, 2006, the \nrates of compensation for veterans with service-connected disabilities \nand the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation for the \nsurvivors of certain disabled veterans; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I join Senator Akaka in introducing \nlegislation that would provide a cost-of-living adjustment to the rates \nof disability compensation provided to our Nation's disabled veterans \nand to the compensation provided to survivors of veterans and \nservicemembers who died, or who will die, as a result of military \nservice. Every year since 1976 Congress has enacted an annual COLA \nadjustment for veterans with disabilities and survivors. The regularity \nof Congress's action on COLA legislation underscores its importance. \nWithout it, inflation would erode the purchasing power of millions of \nbeneficiaries.\n  According to its fiscal year 2007 budget, VA estimates that it will \nprovide disability compensation to 2,867,013 veterans with service-\nconnected disabilities in the upcoming fiscal year. Among the veterans \nestimated to receive such compensation are 5 World War I veterans; \n335,180 World War II veterans; 160,889 Korean-conflict veterans; \n992,360 Vietnam-era veterans; and 762,230 veterans of the Persian Gulf \nwar era. The COLA legislation will also benefit an estimated 348,479 \nsurvivors.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, CBO, estimates that inflation, at \nthe close of this fiscal year, will be at 2.2 percent as measured by \nthe consumer price index published by the Department of Labor's Bureau \nof Labor Statistics. Once the actual inflation level is known, this \nlegislation would adjust payment rates in effect on November 30, 2006, \nand be applied to payments made to veterans and survivors effective \nDecember 1, 2006. CBO also estimates that the legislation will increase \ndirect spending by $530 million in fiscal year 2007. Again, because of \nthe importance accorded to annual COLA legislation, all of this \nspending is assumed in the budget baseline and, thus, requires no \noffset.\n  In summary, this legislation is critical to the lives of over 3 \nmillion beneficiaries who have served our country well and faithfully. \nI ask my colleagues for their continued support for our nation's \nveterans. And I ask for their support of the Veterans' Compensation \nCost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2006.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2562\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans' Compensation Cost-\n     of-Living Adjustment Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. INCREASE IN RATES OF DISABILITY COMPENSATION AND \n                   DEPENDENCY AND INDEMNITY COMPENSATION.\n\n       (a) Rate Adjustment.--Effective on December 1, 2006, the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall increase, in accordance \n     with subsection (c), the dollar amounts in effect on\n\n[[Page S3220]]\n\n     November 30, 2006, for the payment of disability compensation \n     and dependency and indemnity compensation under the \n     provisions specified in subsection (b).\n       (b) Amounts to Be Increased.--The dollar amounts to be \n     increased pursuant to subsection (a) are the following:\n       (1) Wartime disability compensation.--Each of the dollar \n     amounts under section 1114 of title 38, United States Code.\n       (2) Additional compensation for dependents.--Each of the \n     dollar amounts under sections 1115(1) of such title.\n       (3) Clothing allowance.--The dollar amount under section \n     1162 of such title.\n       (4) Dependency and indemnity compensation to surviving \n     spouse.--Each of the dollar amounts under subsections (a) \n     through (d) of section 1311 of such title.\n       (5) Dependency and indemnity compensation to children.--\n     Each of the dollar amounts under sections 1313(a) and 1314 of \n     such title.\n       (c) Determination of Increase.--\n       (1) Percentage.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), each \n     dollar amount described in subsection (b) shall be increased \n     by the same percentage as the percentage by which benefit \n     amounts payable under title II of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 401 et seq.) are increased effective December 1, 2006, \n     as a result of a determination under section 215(i) of such \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 415(i)).\n       (2) Rounding.--Each dollar amount increased under paragraph \n     (1), if not a whole dollar amount, shall be rounded to the \n     next lower whole dollar amount.\n       (d) Special Rule.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs may \n     adjust administratively, consistent with the increases made \n     under subsection (a), the rates of disability compensation \n     payable to persons under section 10 of Public Law 85-857 (72 \n     Stat. 1263) who have not received compensation under chapter \n     11 of title 38, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 3. PUBLICATION OF ADJUSTED RATES.\n\n       The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall publish in the \n     Federal Register the amounts specified in section 2(b), as \n     increased under that section, not later than the date on \n     which the matters specified in section 215(i)(2)(D) of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 415(i)(2)(D)) are required to \n     be published by reason of a determination made under section \n     215(i) of such Act during fiscal year 2007.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN (for himself, Mr. Enzi, and Mr. Talent):\n  S. 2563. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nrequire prompt payment to pharmacies under part D, to restrict pharmacy \nco-branding on prescription drug cards issued under such part, and to \nprovide guidelines for Medication Therapy Management Services programs \noffered by prescription drug plans and MA-PD plans under such part; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, The Medicare prescription drug plan is a \ntremendous success with more than 27 million Medicare beneficiaries now \nenrolled in the program. Seniors are realizing significant decreases in \nthe cost of their prescription drugs and the savings are even greater \nthan expected. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and \nhealth care providers worked together to plan and implement this \nprogram. In particular, community pharmacists played an important role \nin making this benefit successful. Prior to the January 1 start of the \nprogram, pharmacists assisted their Medicare patients in the selection \nand enrollment process. This process was new and challenging, but \npharmacists were diligent in serving their patients and providing much-\nneeded medications while the program became functional.\n  We are introducing a bill today to assist pharmacists as they \ncontinue to serve their patients and as they help to continue the \nsuccess of the Medicare drug benefit. This bill will allow pharmacists \nto achieve efficiencies in reimbursement for the products they have \nprovided to new beneficiaries. This is especially needed by small, \nrural independent pharmacies. This legislation will also provide \nincentives for pharmacists and other providers to help beneficiaries \nbetter utilize their medications, adhere to their drug regimens, and \nutilize cost saving medication therapy management programs.\n  I am pleased to offer this legislation that will help continue the \nsuccess of the Medicare prescription drug benefit.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2563\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Pharmacist Access and \n     Recognition in Medicare (PhARM) Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Pharmacist Access \nand Recognition in Medicare Act. I have enjoyed working closely with \nChairman Cochran and Senator Talent on\n\n[[Page S3222]]\n\nthis bill that will help protect the valuable role that pharmacists \nplay in our communities.\n  I have spent a lot of time over the past few months traveling around \nmy home State of Wyoming talking to seniors about the new Medicare \nprescription drug benefit. This new voluntary benefit represents the \nmost significant improvement to Medicare since its inception in 1965. \nBecause of this new benefit, more seniors have prescription drug \ncoverage and are able to purchase the medicines they need. Since the \nbenefit took effect on January 1, 2006, 17,700 beneficiaries in Wyoming \nhave signed up for prescription drug coverage and 27 million \nbeneficiaries nationwide have drug coverage. I encourage all \nbeneficiaries to enroll in a prescription drug plan before May 15, \n2006.\n  I strongly support our community pharmacists. The changeover to \nMedicare Part D hasn't been easy and has produced several obstacles \nthey have had to deal with as they have worked to serve Medicare \nbeneficiaries. In traveling around my State over the past few months, I \nhave talked to a few pharmacists who mentioned a few key problems they \nare facing with this new Medicare program that I believe we should \naddress.\n  The first is an issue of cash flow management. As the only accountant \nin the United States Senate, I understand this problem. Most \npharmacists have to pay their wholesalers like clockwork two times a \nmonth, but they are not receiving their reimbursement from the \nprescription drug plans in a similar timely fashion. This bill changes \nthat. The bill states that plans have to reimburse all ``clean claims'' \nevery 14 days. The bill also facilitates a quicker reimbursement by \nspecifying that claims submitted electronically shall be paid by \nelectronic transfer of funds. This is a small change in the law that I \nbelieve will play a large role in helping ease the transition to the \nnew program for our local and community pharmacists.\n  The second issue I have heard about is called co-branding. Some of \nthe prescription drug plans have partnered with some of the larger \npharmacies and the plans are putting pharmacy logos on the benefit \ncards the beneficiaries use to get their prescriptions filled. Some \npeople have told me that this is very confusing, because beneficiaries \nthink that they must go to the pharmacy listed on the card. My bill \nsays that co-branding is no longer allowed and all newly issued cards \nwill not have pharmacy logos on them.\n  The final thing this bill does is expand upon what was in the \nMedicare bill that passed in 2003 regarding medication therapy \nmanagement programs. I am pleased to say that Wyoming is ahead of the \ncurve in this area. A few years ago, the Wyoming Department of Health \npartnered with the University of Wyoming to provide a service called \nWyoming PharmAssist, which directly connects patients with registered \npharmacists to review their medications for possible drug interactions \nand duplications. I was pleased to learn that this service is more \nadvanced than systems in other States, providing patients with ways to \nreduce their monthly medication costs while improving safety. The \nWyoming PharmAssist program can save clients $152 per month and $1,844 \na year. Wyoming Pharm-Assist pays registered pharmacists for these \nunique services and is a model for the Nation. My bill tries to make \nthe Federal program more like the very successful program in Wyoming.\n  I commend all the pharmacists across the country who are working so \nhard to make this new Medicare program work. They are getting life \nsaving drugs to seniors who may not have been able to afford them \nbefore. I am proud to say I voted for this program back in 2003 and I \nam pleased with all the progress we are making.\n  I believe the Senate operates under what I call the 80/20 rule. 80 \npercent of the things that get done around here are non-contentious \nissues with support from both parties. The other 20 percent are the \ncontentious issues that we seem to spend all our time talking about. I \nthink this bill falls into the 80 percent category. This is a small \nbill that will do a lot of good for our pharmacists. It has wide \nsupport and I look forward to working with Chairman Grassley to help \nmove this bill through his Committee.\n  I invite my colleagues to join me and Senators Cochran and Talent as \nsponsors of this bill to allow pharmacists to continue to provide the \nbest quality care for seniors and the disabled who rely on them for \ntheir medications.\n  I ask that the text of the bill following my statement be placed in \nthe Record.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURR (for himself, Mr. Frist, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Gregg, Mr. \n        Alexander, and Mrs. Dole):\n  S. 2564.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2564\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate certain National Forest System land in \nthe State of Vermont for inclusion in the National Wilderness \nPreservation system and designate a National Recreation Area; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from \nVermont, Mr. Leahy, in introducing the Vermont Wilderness Act of 2006. \nThis legislation designates 48,051 acres within the Green Mountain \nNational Forest for management under the 1964 Wilderness Act.\n  The Green Mountain National Forest constitutes more than 400,000 \nacres of woodlands in central and southern Vermont. The Forest hosts up \nto 3.4 million visitors each year and is capable of supporting a \nvariety of uses, from timber production to snowmobiling to hiking, \nwhich contribute to Vermont's economy. The forest is also an important \nwildlife habitat and source of clean, fresh water. If well managed, the \nGreen Mountain National Forest will remain one of Vermont's most \nprecious environmental treasures, while continuing to support our \nstate's economic and recreational needs for generations to come.\n  The National Forest Service is responsible for most aspects of \nnational forest management but Congress reserved the authority to set \naside undisturbed wilderness lands. Good stewardship of the forest \nrequires leadership, and now is the time for us to accept this \nresponsibility to designate additional wilderness areas.\n  Twenty-two years ago, as a member of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, I joined my Senate colleagues, Mr. Stafford and Mr. \nLeahy, to introduce the Vermont Wilderness Act of 1984. That act \ndesignated 41,260 acres as wilderness. Since that time the Green \nMountain National Forest has acquired over 110,000 additional acres, \nwhile the populations of the State and the region have increased. These \nchanging demands, and the changing landscape, provide the opportunity \nand drive the need to designate additional land as wilderness.\n  The Vermont Wilderness Act of 1984 directed Congress to consider \nadditional wilderness designations in the Green Mountain National \nForest only after 15 years had elapsed and the management plan for the \nForest had been thoroughly reviewed. With last month's adoption of a \ncompletely revised Land Resource Management Plan for the Green Mountain \nNational Forest, these conditions have been met and it is time to act.\n  I have worked for the past 6 years with the other members of \nVermont's Congressional delegation, the National Forest Service, and \nState leaders. I have reviewed comments from thousands of constituents, \nvisited the forest on the ground and viewed it from the air, and spent \ncountless hours studying maps. These new designations are the result of \nthorough analysis and thought, and we do not make them lightly.\n  Many Vermonters disagree with the need for any wilderness \ndesignations, much less additional lands to be set aside at this time. \nI understand their concerns, but I also recognize the intent of the \nWilderness Act of 1964, and I believe deeply in the benefits of \nmanaging some areas so that forces of nature hold sway.\n  The Vermont Wilderness Act of 2006 designates two significant new \nwilderness areas: the 28,491-acre Glastenbury wilderness in southern \nVermont, and the 12,437-acre Battell wilderness in central Vermont. \nThese are pristine, remote forest lands, and would remain undisturbed \nfor future generations.\n  The recently completed Land and Resource Management Plan for the \nGreen Mountain National Forest is a credit to everyone who worked on \nit, and reflects the hard work of the U.S. National Forest Service. \nThis plan calls for additions to several existing wilderness areas \nincluding Peru Peak, Big Branch, Breadloaf and Lye Brook. These \nrecommended additions are included in this legislation, with some \nmodification.\n  This legislation also calls for 16,890 acres of the Moosalamoo \nRecreation Area in Central Vermont to be designated a national \nrecreation area. Moosalamoo exists today as a world-class destination \nfor widely diverse outdoor recreation activities on both public and \nprivate land. Moosalamoo is managed cooperatively by a group of owners \nand it attracts visitors from far and wide for hiking, camping, Nordic \nand alpine skiing and other activities. From the Robert Frost \ninterpretive trails to the blueberry management areas and oak clad \nescarpments, Moosalamoo is uniquely deserving of national recreation \narea designation.\n  The Green Mountain National Forest is an important source of wood \nproducts and the timber industry is critically important to Vermont's \neconomy. These wilderness and national recreation area designations are \nnot meant to interfere with a robust timber management program within \nthe forest, and I will work to support that program at every \nopportunity.\n  As we introduce this legislation it is important to acknowledge the \nfine work of Supervisor Paul Brewster and the staff of the Green \nMountain National Forest. They applied great skill and technical \nexpertise in developing the new management plan for the forest. The \nsame professionalism will certainly be applied to implement the plan. \nOur wilderness designations differ somewhat from those proposed by the \nForest Service, which is the reason this authority is reserved for \nCongress, but the new management plan has helped to inform and guide \nour work.\n  It is with great pride that I join my colleagues to introduce the \nVermont Wilderness Act of 2006. Our great state has been blessed with a \nbeautiful natural landscape, which Vermonters have worked hard to \npreserve. This bill will continue in that tradition by helping to \nsecure areas of the unspoiled wilderness that Vermont is known and \nadmired for.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I join with Senator Jeffords today to \nintroduce the Vermont Wilderness Act of 2006, to designate two new \nwilderness areas and to make a number of additions to existing \nwilderness areas in Vermont's Green Mountain National Forest. This \nlegislation will also designate a new National Recreation Area (NRA) in \nthe Green Mountain National Forest in the area commonly known as \nMoosalamoo.\n  The U.S. Forest Service has recently released its Record of Decision \n(ROD) and Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for the revision \nof\n\n[[Page S3228]]\n\nthe Green Mountain National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan. \nThis has been an effort encompassing several years, a lengthy process \nincluding significant public involvement, and a great deal of difficult \nand detailed work on the part of the Forest Service staff in Vermont \nand our region.\n  I want to extend my appreciation and thanks to the staff of the Green \nMountain National Forest for their perseverance and professionalism \nthroughout the plan revision process. This has been by no means an easy \ntask, with Vermonters and other interested citizens who care deeply \nabout the National Forest weighing in with sincere and often \nconflicting views on land, resource and forest management decisions.\n  While there is much of interest in such a comprehensive plan, the \nprimary role of the Congress lies with wilderness and other related \nspecial designations, such as National Recreation Areas. The Vermont \nCongressional Delegation has taken this responsibility seriously as we \nhave sought a compromise between those who would prefer significant \nadditions in wilderness areas and those who would prefer none. If this \nrecommendation were enacted, about a quarter of the current Green \nMountain National Forest would be designated as wilderness.\n  Just as the recently released Land and Resource Management Plan for \nthe Green Mountain National Forest has elicited abundant feedback \nacross the spectrum of interested citizens and organizations, we expect \nour proposal to do the same. We offer this legislation as a good-faith \neffort to find a middle ground, and once this proposal is referred to \nthe Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry--of which \nI am a member--we will welcome constructive comments and criticisms to \nimprove the bill. Since the Vermont Congressional Delegation has long \nbeen on the public record in favor of additional wilderness \ndesignations within the Green Mountain National Forest, comments that \nare as specific as possible will be especially helpful in helping to \nrefine our proposal.\n  In specific terms, this legislation proposes a new wilderness area in \nthe Glastenbury Mountain area of approximately 28,500 acres. In the \nRomance, Monastery and Worth Mountain areas the bill proposes adding \napproximately 12,500 acres, which together would become the Battell \nWilderness in honor of Joseph Battell, who once owned some 9,000 acres \nin this area and bequeathed thousands of acres to Middlebury College, \nwhich eventually became the core of the north half of the Green \nMountain National Forest.\n  The bill also proposes designating approximately 4,200 acres for \naddition to the existing Breadloaf Wilderness, 2,200 acres to the Lye \nBrook Wilderness, 800 acres to the Peru Peak Wilderness, and 40 acres \nto the Big Branch Wilderness. The proposed Moosalamoo National \nRecreation Area covers approximately 17,000 acres.\n  This legislation does not include additional acreage for the George \nD. Aiken Wilderness Area or the Bristol Cliffs Wilderness Area. It does \nnot propose a wilderness designation for the area known as Lamb Brook, \nand it does not propose a new National Recreation Area in the Somerset \nregion.\n  Our legislation builds on the recommendations of the Forest Service. \nIn many areas the Delegation bill closely tracks the Forest Service \nplan--Breadloaf, Big Branch and Peru Peak areas are nearly identical. \nIn the Glastenbury area, the Forest Service added more than 8,000 acres \nto their original plan, and we have further increased the acreage of a \nproposed Glastenbury Wilderness Area. In addition, this legislation \nadds about 2,000 acres to the Lye Brook Wilderness, above the Forest \nService recommendation. Finally, we are proposing the new Battell \nWilderness Area, which encompasses lands the Forest Service included in \na Remote Backcountry management category, which is essentially managed \nas a wilderness area.\n  In the Moosalamoo area, this legislation codifies the Moosalamoo \nNational Recreation Area, which has the strong support of the various \ncommunities and local partners in the area. We believe this designation \nbest represents the actual goals of the various stakeholders and merits \nthis national designation. Furthermore, we have included the Forest \nService's Escarpment management category in the designated area and \nhave also included previously agreed upon management guidelines in the \nbill.\n  I would offer the following thoughts which we have returned to on \nthose numerous occasions over recent years whenever this subject has \nbeen brought up for discussion in our State.\n  In sponsoring this legislation today, the Vermont Congressional \nDelegation is demonstrating our commitment to additional wilderness \ndesignations on the Green Mountain National Forest. The Green Mountain \nNational Forest is the largest contiguous public land area in Vermont \nand within a days drive for over 70 million people. We are committed to \nprotecting some National Forest lands for future generations under the \nNational Wilderness Preservation System.\n  Our proposals have not been driven by acreage quotas, but rather by \ndata supplied by the Forest Service and by interested Vermonters. \nTherefore, what is too much for some will be too little for others.\n  The timing of this introduction was conditioned so as to allow the \nForest Service process to reach its conclusion and, at the same time, \nto enable Vermonters and other interested parties to review both the \nForest Service and the Delegation recommendations. Throughout our \ndeliberations, we have appreciated the help of the Forest Service staff \nand have recognized their commitment to their planning regulations, \nguidelines and timetable. We invite all Vermonters to join us in \nthanking the Forest Service staff for all the hard work in their \nplanning effort.\n  While this legislation proposes to add significant wilderness to the \nGreen Mountain National Forest, it bears noting that most of the lands \ndesignated in this bill are not suitable for timber harvesting. This \nlegislation would retain many thousands of acres available for timber \nharvesting which will have to be managed in a fair, open and \nprofessional manner. We are committed to the development of such a \nprocess and we know the Forest Service shares this commitment. We \ninvite all interested parties to join in this effort. It is our hope \nthat given the superior manner in which the Forest Service conducted \nthe Forest Plan Revision process, unnecessary appeals and litigation of \nthe plan and future management activities can be avoided.\n  The Green Mountain National Forest has expanded since the last \nwilderness designations were made. As Senator Stafford, then \nCongressman Jeffords and I remember, during the consideration of the \nlast Vermont Wilderness bill in 1984 there were many perspectives on \nthe use of our National Forest. We assume there will be again this \ntime. As we were 1984, we remain committed to carrying on the strong \nconservation legacy that generations of Vermonters, like Senator Robert \nStafford, have fostered over the decades.\n  We urge anyone who is interested in the Green Mountain National \nForest to review the whole Plan, as the Forest Service has recommended, \nand to look beyond their own primary areas of concern so that we can \nall do what we can to help implement the Plan.\n  In closing, I would note that the Delegation knows that you cannot \nundertake every possible use on every acre of National Forest land, and \nwe believe most Vermonters support our approach to this issue. In \nrecognition of this fact, we are introducing this legislation as a \nvision for the Green Mountain Forest for this and future generations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself and Mr. Obama):\n  S. 2566. A bill to provide for coordination of proliferation \ninterdiction activities and conventional arms disarmament, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Cooperative \nProliferation Detection, Interdiction Assistance, and Conventional \nThreat Reduction Act of 2006. This bill is based upon the legislation \nthat Senator Obama and I introduced last year by the same name. Over \nthe last six months we have worked closely with the Administration and \nthe Department of State on legislation to improve U.S. programs focused \non conventional weapons dismantlement and counter-proliferation \nassistance more effective and efficient.\n  The Lugar-Obama bill launches two major weapons dismantlement and\n\n[[Page S3229]]\n\ncounterproliferation initiatives. Modeled after the Nunn-Lugar program, \nwhich dismantles weapons of mass destruction in the former Soviet Union \nand beyond, our legislation seeks to build cooperative relationships \nwith willing countries to secure vulnerable stockpiles of conventional \nweapons and strengthen barriers against WMD falling into terrorist's \nhands.\n  The first part of our legislation energizes U.S. programs to \ndismantle MANPADS and large stockpiles of other conventional weapons, \nincluding tactical missile systems. There may be as many as 750,000 \nMANPADS in arsenals worldwide. The State Department estimates that more \nthan 40 civilian aircraft have been hit by such weapons since the \n1970's. In addition loose stocks of small arms and other weapons help \nfuel civil wars and provide ammunition for those who attack \npeacekeepers and aid workers seeking to help war-torn societies. Our \nbill would enhance U.S. capability to safely destroy munitions like \nthose used in the improvised roadside bombs that have proved so deadly \nto U.S. forces in Iraq.\n  In August Senator Obama and I traveled to Ukraine and saw stacks of \nthousands of mortars and other weapons, left over from the Soviet era. \nThe scene there is similar to situations in other states of the former \nSoviet Union, Africa, Latin America, and Asia. In many cases, the \nsecurity around these weapons is minimal. Every stockpile represents a \ntheft opportunity for terrorists and a temptation for security \npersonnel who might seek to profit by selling weapons on the black \nmarket. The more stockpiles that can be safeguarded or eliminated, the \nsafer we will be. We do not want the question posed the day after an \nattack on an American military base, embassy compound, or commercial \nplane why we didn't do more to address these threats.\n  Some foreign governments have already sought U.S. help in eliminating \ntheir stocks of lightweight antiaircraft missiles and excess weapons \nand ammunition. But low budgets and insufficient attention have \nhampered destruction efforts. Our legislation would require the \nAdministration to develop a response commensurate with the threat, by \nrequiring better coordination and a three-fold increase in spending in \nthis area, to $25 million--a relatively modest sum that would offer \nlarge benefits to U.S. security.\n  The other part of the Lugar-Obama legislation would strengthen the \nability of America's friends and allies to detect and intercept illegal \nshipments of weapons and materials of mass destruction. Stopping these \nweapons and materials of mass destruction in transit is an important \ncomplement to the Nunn-Lugar program, which aims to eliminate weapons \nof mass destruction at their source.\n  We cannot do this alone. We need the vigilance of like-minded \nnations. The Proliferation Security Initiative has been successful in \nenlisting the help of other countries, but many of our partners lack \nthe capability to detect and interdict hidden weapons. Lugar-Obama \nseeks to address this gap by providing $50 million to establish a \ncoordinated effort to improve the capabilities of foreign partners by \nproviding equipment, logistics, training and other support. Examples of \nsuch assistance may include maritime surveillance and boarding \nequipment, aerial detection and interdiction capabilities, enhanced \nport security, and the provision of hand-held detection equipment and \npassive WMD sensors.\n  On February 9 the Committee on Foreign Relations held a hearing to \nexamine the State Department's efforts in these important areas. In \nresponse to a question on how important conventional weapons \nelimination and counter-proliferation is to U.S. security Under \nSecretary Joseph stated that ``other than stopping weapons of mass \ndestruction (at their source), I personally do not think that there is \n. . . a higher priority.'' The Under Secretary also pointed out that \nwith more resources he was confident additional progress could be \nachieved faster.\n  We have worked closely with Secretary Rice and her staff to improve \nthis legislation. The bill has been modified in a number of ways to \nimprove its effectiveness and to provide the Department with the \nauthority necessary to carry out important nonproliferation and \ncounter-proliferation missions. At the Department's request, we provide \nauthorization for the entire Nonproliferation, Antiterrorism, Demining, \nand Related Programs account. We also authorize international ship-\nboarding agreements under the Proliferation Security Initiative, the \nuse of the Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund outside the former \nSoviet Union, and the use of funds for administrative purposes. In \naddition, we provide the Secretary with the authority to make a \nreprogramming request to use the funds required under this legislation \nfor other nonproliferation and counter-proliferation activities in an \nemergency.\n  Earlier this week, Secretary Rice appeared before the Committee on \nForeign Relations. I took the opportunity to ask her opinion of Lugar-\nObama. She stated her personal support and that of the Department and \nthe Administration. I am pleased that efforts to craft this important \neffort not only have bipartisan Congressional support but the support \nof the Administration as well.\n  The U.S. response to conventional weapons threats and the lack of \nfocus on WMD detection and interdiction assistance must be rectified if \nwe are to provide a full and complete defense for the American people. \nSenator Obama and I understand that the United States cannot meet every \nconceivable security threat everywhere in the world. But filling the \nsecurity gaps that we have described and that Secretary Rice and Under \nSecretary Joseph have confirmed, should be near the top of our list of \npriorities. We do not believe these problems have received adequate \nresources and look forward to working with our colleagues in the Senate \nto rectify the situation.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, Senator Lugar has already outlined the \nlegislation that we are reintroducing here today and the process that \nhas led us to this point, so I will be brief.\n  I don't want my brevity to be confused with indifference towards this \nlegislation. I want to underscore the importance of this bill in \nestablishing a broad framework to more effectively combat the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and heavy conventional \nweapons. As I have said before, these are two critical issues that \ndirectly impact the security of the United States.\n  In some ways, the bill has already had its desired impact. There was \na reorganization of the State Department that will improve the \nDepartment's ability to deal with the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction and heavy conventional weapons. Moreover, the legislation \nhas focused additional high-level attention--the scarcest commodity in \nWashington--on these Issues.\n  However, there is more that needs to be done. I believe the Senate \ncan and should move this bill in an expeditious fashion. We have \nalready held a hearing on the bill, worked with the State Department to \nupdate and improve the legislation, and have received endorsements from \nan array of non-governmental organizations that follow these issues.\n  I will defer to the Chairman on the procedural issues, but my hope is \nthat we can report this bill out of the Foreign Relations Committee as \nsoon as possible and work for Senate passage shortly thereafter.\n  In closing, I want to thank Senator Lugar for his steadfast \ncommitment to these critical issues and look forward to collaborating \nwith him in the coming months on this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 2567. A bill to maintain the rural heritage of the Eastern Sierra \nand enhance the region's tourism economy by designating certain public \nlands as wilderness and certain rivers as wild and scenic rivers in the \nState of California, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing ``the Eastern \nSierra Rural Heritage and Economic Enhancement Act,'' a bill that will \nprovide protection for thousands of some of the most pristine, wild, \nand beautiful acres in California. I am glad to be joined in this \neffort by my colleague, Senator Feinstein. Representative McKeon, whose \ncongressional districts contains these special lands, introduced \ncompanion legislation today in the House of Representatives.\n\n[[Page S3230]]\n\n  My bill will protect three very special California treasures in the \nEastern Sierra. It makes considerable additions to existing Hoover \nWilderness areas, which border on Yosemite National Park. These \nadditions will protect the stunning High Sierra landscape of 11,000 \nfoot snow-capped peaks and valleys, lush meadows and deep forests that \npeople around the world associate with the Eastern Sierra.\n  These areas are also home to an abundance of wildlife, including \nblack bear, mountain lion, mule deer, waterfowl, and bald eagles.\n  This land provides more than just visual beauty, however--it is also \na recreational paradise. Year after year, hikers enjoy the \napproximately nine miles of the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail \nthat runs through this wilderness, and anglers enjoy the clear lakes \nand streams that support a number of species of wild trout. The bill \nwill also protect areas adjacent to the Emigrant Wilderness area, \nincluding another two miles of the Pacific Crest Trail.\n  My legislation will also designate about 24 miles of the Amargosa \nRiver as a Wild and Scenic River. As the only river flowing into Death \nValley, the Amargosa is an ecologically-important river in a dry desert \narea. Birds--and birdwatchers--abound in this area, both coming from \nfar and wide to enjoy the river area.\n  In short, these areas are not just California's natural treasures--\nthey are America's natural treasures. And that is why they deserve the \nhighest level of protection possible. That is what this bill does.\n  I was proud to include most of these lands in my California Wild \nHeritage Act that I reintroduced last month. And I look forward to \nworking with Senator Feinstein and Representative McKeon, and all my \ncolleagues, to protect these special places forever.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Mr. Warner, Mr. Allen, Ms. \n        Mikulski, Mr. Biden, and Mr. Carper):\n  S. 2568. A bill to amend the National Trails System Act to designate \nthe Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, \ntogether with Senators Warner, Allen, Mikulski, Biden and Carper to \ndesignate the route of Captain John Smith's exploration of the \nChesapeake Bay and its tributaries as a National Historic Trail. The \nproposed Trail is of great historical importance to all Americans in \nthat it represents the beginning of our Nation's story.\n  Next year our Nation will commemorate the 400th anniversary of the \nfounding of Jamestown and the beginning of John Smith's momentous \nexplorations of the Chesapeake Bay. In April 1607, three ships, the \nSusan Constant, the Godspeed, and the Discovery, arrived at the mouth \nof the Chesapeake Bay after a four-month voyage from England carrying \nthe colonists who would establish the first permanent English \nsettlement in North America and plant the seeds of our nation and our \ndemocracy. Under the leadership of Captain John Smith, the fledgling \ncolony not only survived, but helped ignite a new era of discovery in \nthe New World sparked by reports of Smith's voyages around the \nChesapeake Bay.\n  John Smith's explorations in the small, 30 foot shallop totaled some \nthree thousand miles, reaching from present-day Jamestown, Virginia, to \nSmiths Falls on the Pennsylvania border with Maryland and from Broad \nCreek, in Delaware to the Potomac River and Washington, DC. His \njourneys brought the English into contact with many Native American \ntribes for the first time, and his observations of the region's people \nand its natural wonders are still relied upon by anthropologists, \nhistorians, and ecologists to this day.\n  Chief Justice John Marshall wrote of the significance of Smith's \nexplorations. ``When we contemplate the dangers, and the hardships he \nencountered, and the fortitude, courage and patience with which he met \nthem; when we reflect on the useful and important additions which he \nmade to the stock of knowledge respecting America, then possessed by \nhis countrymen; we shall not hesitate to say that few voyages of \ndiscovery, undertaken at any time, reflect more honour on those engaged \nin them, than this does on Captain Smith.''\n  What better way to commemorate this important part of our Nation's \nhistory and honor John Smith's courageous voyages than by designating \nthe Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail? The Congress \nestablished the National Trails System ``to provide for the ever-\nincreasing outdoor recreation needs of an expanding population and in \norder to promote the preservation of, public access to, travel within, \nand enjoyment and appreciation of the open-air, outdoor areas and \nhistoric resources of the Nation.'' National Historic Trails such as \nthe Lewis and Clark Trail, the Pony Express Trail, the Trail of Tears, \nand the Selma to Montgomery Trail were authorized as part of this \nSystem to identify and protect historic routes for public use and \nenjoyment and to commemorate major events which shaped American \nhistory. In my judgment, the proposed Captain John Smith Chesapeake \nNational Historic Trail is a fitting addition to the 13 National \nHistoric Trails administered by the National Park Service.\n  Pursuant to legislation we enacted as part of the Fiscal 2006 \nInterior Appropriations Act authorizing the National Park Service to \nstudy the feasibility of so designating this trail, on March 21, 2006 \nthe National Park System Advisory Board concluded that the proposed \ntrail is ``nationally significant'' as a milestone for the English \nexploration of North America, contact between the English and the \nNative American tribes of the region, and in commerce and trade in \nNorth America. This finding is one of the principal criteria for \nqualifying as a National Historic Trail. Well documented by the \nremarkably accurate maps and charts that Smith made of his voyages, the \ntrail also offers tremendous opportunities for public recreation and \nhistoric interpretation and appreciation. Similar in historic \nimportance to the Lewis and Clark National Trail, this new historic \nwater trail will inspire generations of Americans and visitors to \nfollow Smith's journeys, to learn about the roots of our Nation and to \nbetter understand the contributions of the Native Americans who lived \nwithin the Bay region. It would also help highlight the Chesapeake \nBay's remarkable maritime history, the diversity of its peoples, its \nhistorical settlements and our current efforts to restore and sustain \nthe world's most productive estuary.\n  As Jamestown's 400th anniversary quickly approaches, designating the \nCaptain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail will bring \nhistory to life. It would serve to educate visitors about the new \ncolony at Jamestown, John Smith's journeys, the history of 17th century \nChesapeake region, and the vital importance of the Native Americans \nthat inhabited the Bay area. It would provide new opportunities for \nrecreation and heritage tourism not only for more than 16 millions \nAmericans living in the Chesapeake Bay's watershed, but for visitors to \nthis area throughout the country and abroad.\n  This legislation enjoys strong bipartisan support in the Congress and \nin the States through which the trail passes. The trail proposal has \nbeen endorsed by the Governors of Virginia, Pennsylvania, Delaware and \nMaryland and numerous local governments throughout the Chesapeake Bay \nregion. The measure is also strongly supported by the National \nGeographic Society, The Conservation Fund, The Garden Club of America, \nthe Izaak Walton League of America, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and \nthe Chesapeake Bay Commission as well as scores of businesses, tourism \nleaders, private groups, and intergovernmental bodies.\n  The Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail Act comes \nat a very timely juncture to educate Americans about historical events \nthat occurred 400 years ago right here in Chesapeake Bay, which were so \ncrucial to the formation of this great country and our democracy. I \nurge my colleagues to support this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 2569. A bill to authorize Western States to make selections of \npublic land within their borders in lieu of receiving five per centum \nof the proceeds of the sale of public land lying within\n\n[[Page S3231]]\n\nsaid States as provided by their respective Enabling Acts; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that would \nrestore balance to a system that disadvantages education funding in the \nWest. The Action Plan for Public Land and Education Act of 2006 would \nauthorize the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of \nAgriculture to grant Federal land to western States where large \nproportions of public land hamper the States ability to raise funding \nfor public education. This is a product of the hard work and creativity \nof Representative Rob Bishop, and I am working with him on this \nimportant effort.\n  Many of my colleagues may not know this, but 10 of the top 12 States \nwith the largest student-teacher ratios are in the West. These States \nalso have the lowest growth in per-pupil expenditures, and their \nenrollment growth is projected to increase dramatically.\n  The West's education funding deficit is not due to lack of commitment \nor effort by the States. The fact is that Western States allocate as \ngreat a percentage of their budgets to public education as the rest of \nthe Nation. Moreover, Western States pay on average 11.1 percent of \ntheir personal incomes to State and local taxes, whereas citizens of \nthe remaining States pay 10.9 percent of their incomes to these same \nState and local taxes.\n  The funding discrepancy for education in the West is due in large \npart to the lack of a sales tax base, which can only be generated on \nprivate land. On average, the Federal Government owns 52 percent of the \nland located in the 13 Western States, while the remaining States \naverage just 4 percent Federal land. Sales tax is not collected on \nFederal land, and as we know, public education is funded largely \nthrough sales taxes.\n  We all know, the school trust lands that are available to these \nStates are not sufficient to make up the education shortfall in the \nWest. This legislation would remedy that by granting public land States \n5 percent of federally-owned land within the State boundaries. The land \nwould be held in trust to be sold or leased, and the proceeds used \nstrictly for the support of public education.\n  Again, I thank Representative Bishop for his excellent work on this \nbill. My colleagues and I know of the need to address the West's \neducation funding problem. The Action Plan for Public Land and \nEducation Act of 2006 is a solution to this problem, and I urge my \ncolleagues to lend their support for this important proposal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Kyl, and Mr. \n        McCain):\n  S. 2570. A bill to authorize funds for the United States Marshals \nService's Fugitive Safe Surrender Program; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I join Senators Domenici, KYL, and \nMcCain to introduce a bill to support the Fugitive Safe Surrender \nProgram, which encourages those with outstanding arrest warrants to \nturn themselves in peacefully. This program--conducted under the \nauspices of the U.S. Marshal Service, with the cooperation of public, \nprivate, nonprofit and faith-based partners--involves using a local \nchurch or community center as a temporary courthouse, where fugitives \ncan turn themselves in and have their cases adjudicated.\n  This is not an amnesty program. Those who surrender are still held \naccountable for the original charges. However, by moving the \nprosecutors, public defenders, and judges to the new location, non-\nviolent cases can be resolved promptly on-site, in a setting where \nfugitives feel they can safely turn themselves in.\n  In a pilot program implemented last August in Cleveland, over 800 \npeople turned themselves in during a four day period, including 324 who \nhad outstanding felony warrants. Almost all the cases were adjudicated \non the day of the surrender. As means of comparison, the Fugitive Task \nForce conducted a more traditional sweep for three days following the \nimplementation of the Fugitive Safe Surrender program, resulting in the \ncapture of 65 people with outstanding warrants. Clearly, the Fugitive \nSafe Surrender program was a tremendous success, and I'd like to offer \nmy personal congratulations to Pete Elliott, the U.S. Marshal for the \nNorthern District of Ohio, and Dr. C. Jay Matthews, the Senior Pastor \nof the Mt. Sinai Baptist Church in Cleveland, for their efforts in \nheading up this successful endeavor. This type of innovation and \ncreative thinking is exactly what we need in the law enforcement \ncommunity, and it has obviously paid off in Cleveland.\n  The Fugitive Safe Surrender program has exceeded expectations and \ndemonstrated its value to the community. The logical next step is for \nthe U.S. Marshals to expand their initiative nationwide. They already \nhave been working with law enforcement, community, and church groups in \neight cities that have volunteered to be sites for Fugitive Safe \nSurrender in 2006: Albuquerque, NM; Phoenix, AZ; Washington, DC; \nLouisville, KY; Camden, NJ; Indianapolis, IN; Richmond, VA; and Akron, \nOH. They are hoping to expand to even more cities in 2007 and 2008. \nThis expansion is worthy of federal support, and that is why I have \njoined Senators Domenici, Kyl, and McCAIN in sponsoring the Fugitive \nSafe Surrender Act of 2006, which authorizes $3 million for fiscal year \n07, $5 million for fiscal year 08, and $8 million for fiscal year 09. \nThese funds will allow the U.S. Marshals Service to coordinate with the \nFugitive Safe Surrender sites around the country, also providing for \nthe cost of establishing secure courtrooms inside of a local church or \ncommunity center.\n  This is a good bill, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2570\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Fugitive Safe Surrender is a program of the United \n     States Marshals Service, in partnership with public, private, \n     and faith-based organizations, which temporarily transforms a \n     church into a courthouse, so fugitives can turn themselves \n     in, in an atmosphere where they feel more comfortable to do \n     so, and have nonviolent cases adjudicated immediately.\n       (2) In the 4-day pilot program in Cleveland, Ohio, over 800 \n     fugitives turned themselves in. By contrast, a successful \n     Fugitive Task Force sweep, conducted for 3 days after \n     Fugitive Safe Surrender, resulted in the arrest of 65 \n     individuals.\n       (3) Fugitive Safe Surrender is safer for defendants, law \n     enforcement, and innocent bystanders than needing to conduct \n     a sweep.\n       (4) Based upon the success of the pilot program, Fugitive \n     Safe Surrender should be expanded to other cities throughout \n     the United States.\n\n     SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--The United States Marshals Service shall \n     establish, direct, and coordinate a program (to be known as \n     the ``Fugitive Safe Surrender Program''), under which the \n     United States Marshals Service shall apprehend Federal, \n     State, and local fugitives in a safe, secure, and peaceful \n     manner to be coordinated with law enforcement and community \n     leaders in designated cities throughout the United States.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to the United States Marshals Service to \n     carry out this section--\n       (1) $3,000,000 for fiscal year 2007;\n       (2) $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2008; and\n       (3) $8,000,000 for fiscal year 2009.\n       (c) Other Existing Applicable Law.--Nothing in this section \n     shall be construed to limit any existing authority under any \n     other provision of Federal or State law for law enforcement \n     agencies to locate or apprehend fugitives through task forces \n     or any other means.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD:\n  S. 2571. A bill to promote energy production and conservation, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a comprehensive \nenergy bill, one that I call Breaking Our Long-Term Dependency, or the \nBOLD Energy Act.\n  As President Bush has stated, our Nation is addicted to oil. Our \neconomy requires over 20 million barrels of oil a day to fuel our cars, \nour trucks, heat our homes, and bring goods to market all across the \ncountry. Sixty percent of our consumption--60 percent--is from imports. \nMany of these imports are coming from the most volatile parts of the \nworld, the most unstable parts of the world, and we have to take \nserious steps now to reduce our growing dependency. That is what this \nbill is all about.\n\n[[Page S3232]]\n\n  This legislation, which is comprehensive in nature and which we have \nworked on for over 6 months, I believe is a serious contribution to the \ndiscussion. Let me make clear: These are not tepid steps. This \nlegislation is bold because that is what the situation requires if we \nare to seriously reduce our dependence.\n  This legislation invests approximately $40 billion over the next 5 \nyears to meaningfully reduce our dependence on foreign energy. Much of \nour imported oil comes from unstable parts of the world. Forty-five \npercent of our oil comes from Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Nigeria, and \nIraq. A major disruption to oil supplies in any of those areas could \nsend oil over $100 a barrel. Threats to oil supplies and surging demand \nhave contributed to a 95-percent increase in oil prices over the past 2 \nyears.\n  Imported oil now accounts for $266 billion of our trade deficit. That \nis more than a third of our total trade imbalance.\n  Our Nation faces other challenges on the energy front as well. \nFluctuating natural gas prices threaten the livelihood of our Nation's \nfarmers and manufacturers. Electricity sales are projected to increase \nby 50 percent over the next 25 years. Transmission capacity constraints \nprevent development of power production in many parts of the country, \nincluding North Dakota.\n  Fortunately, the United States has the domestic resources and the \ningenuity to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and meet our energy \nchallenges. It is time, I believe, to look to the Midwest rather than \nturning to the Middle East for our energy resources. We can turn to our \nfarm fields to produce more ethanol and biodiesel.\n  Brazil shows what can be done. Thirty years ago Brazil was 80 percent \ndependent on foreign energy. They have reduced that dependence to less \nthan 10 percent. At the same time, our country has gone from 35-percent \ndependence to now 60-percent dependence. We have been going the wrong \nway. Brazil has demonstrated what can be done to dramatically reduce \none's energy dependence. How did they do it? They did it by aggressive \npromotion of biodiesel, by aggressive promotion of ethanol, and by \ncreating a fleet of flexible fuel vehicles.\n  We could do that here. Brazilian officials are now predicting they \nwill be completely energy independent this year--this year. We can use \nour abundant domestic reserve of coal to produce clean, clear fuel as \npart of a plan to reduce our dependence, in addition to the use of \nthose renewables.\n  Coal-to-liquid fuel technology has tremendous potential. Converting \nAmerica's 273 billion tons of coal into transportation fuel would \nresult in the equivalent of over 500 billion barrels of oil. That \ncompares to Saudi Arabia's reserves of 262 billion barrels.\n  Why are we continuing to be dependent and vulnerable to foreign \nsources of energy? It makes no sense. It is time to do more than talk \nabout the threat; it is time to act. That is why I am introducing the \nBOLD Energy Act today.\n  My legislation would accomplish the following: It would increase \nproduction of renewable energy and alternative fuels. It would reward \nconservation and energy efficiency. It would provide more research and \ndevelopment funding for new energy technologies. It would promote \nresponsible development of domestic fossil fuel resources, and it would \nfacilitate upgrades to our Nation's electricity grid.\n  First, the BOLD Act takes aggressive steps to increase alternative \nfuel production and use. It extends the biodiesel and ethanol tax \ncredit. It requires ethanol use in the United States to increase from \n4.7 billion gallons in 2007 to 30 billion gallons in 2025. It creates a \nnew biodiesel standard. It promotes alternative fueling stations, and \nit establishes a $500 million grant program for the expensive front-end \nengineering and design of coal-to-liquid fuel plants. These steps will \nallow us to substitute home-grown fuels for foreign oil, dramatically \nreducing our dependence on imported oil.\n  Second, the experts tell us the single most important thing we can do \nto reduce our reliance on foreign oil is to improve the efficiency of \nour cars and trucks. My legislation provides a new rebate program for \ncars and trucks that achieve above-average fuel economy. The most fuel-\nefficient vehicles would qualify for rebates of up to $2,500. This will \nencourage consumers to buy, and manufacturers to produce, more fuel-\nefficient cars. We don't do this with the command-and-control structure \nof CAFE standards; we do it with incentives for the marketplace.\n  My bill also requires that all vehicles sold in the United States by \n2017 must include alternative fuel technologies, such as hybrid \nelectric or flex-fuel systems. Auto makers will be eligible for a 35-\npercent tax credit or retiree health care cost relief to make this \ntransition. We have had extensive discussions with the automobile \nindustry on how to design these incentives so they would be effective.\n  North Dakota E85 fueling systems will allow drivers to dramatically \nreduce gasoline usage. And in urban areas such as Washington, D.C. \nwhere most drivers commute fewer than 20 miles a day, new plug-in \nhybrids will allow most trips to be fueled by electricity rather than \ngasoline.\n  Third, the BOLD Energy Act promotes environmentally responsible \nenergy development here at home. It increases the existing enhanced oil \nrecovery tax credit to 20 percent for any new or expanded domestic \ndrilling project that uses carbon dioxide to recover oil from aging \nwells. Again, we have consulted broadly with industry on what would be \nthe most effective incentives to seriously increase domestic energy \nproduction.\n  It also includes language authorizing energy development in the Lease \nSale 181 area in the Gulf of Mexico that prohibits this development \nfrom occurring within 100 miles of the Florida coast or interfering \nwith military activities in the gulf.\n  These steps will allow us to substitute American oil and natural gas \nfor imports, creating jobs here at home and improving our energy \nsecurity.\n  Fourth, my BOLD Energy Act promotes new technologies to improve \nenergy efficiency and develop renewable energy, such as wind and solar. \nIt extends the renewable energy tax credit for 5 years and establishes \na national 10-percent renewable electricity standard.\n  My energy bill also creates a clean coal energy bonds program to \nallow electric cooperatives, tribal governments, and other public power \nsystems to finance new, advanced clean coal powerplants.\n  Finally, my legislation will improve the electricity grid in the \nUnited States by making it easier for State governments to finance the \nconstruction of transmission lines through the issuance of tax exempt \nbonds. Again, we have consulted broadly with industry over an extended \nperiod to find the things that would make the greatest difference to \ndramatically reducing our energy dependence. That is what this \nlegislation is about. That is why I call it the BOLD Energy Act. It is \nseriously designed to break our long-term dependency. That is why we \ncalled it the BOLD Energy Act.\n  A few weeks ago I met with the President and a bipartisan group of \nSenators at the White House to talk about energy policy. I told the \nPresident he was right to identify our addiction to oil as one of our \nchallenges. I also told him it is time to be bold. No more tepid plans, \nno more plans that fundamentally do not make a difference. It is time \nfor the United States to stand up to this challenge of seriously \nreducing our dependence on foreign energy.\n  Make no mistake, this is a bold plan. This plan calls for the \ninvestment of approximately $40 billion over the next 5 years. That is \nwhat it is going to take. If we are going to be serious about reducing \nour dependence, it is going to take more than half steps. It is time to \nput politics aside and assemble our best collective ideas into a new, \ncomprehensive energy policy. I ask my colleagues and I urge them to \nlook at this bill, to examine it. I urge them and hope that they could \ncosponsor it. If not, I welcome their constructive criticism about what \ncould be done to make it better.\n  I don't think we have any time to waste. There is no time to lose. We \nneed bold action. We need this BOLD Energy Act.\n  I send the bill to the desk for its assignment to the appropriate \ncommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and assigned to the \nappropriate committee.\n\n[[Page S3233]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank very much the dozens of \norganizations that have contributed to writing this legislation. As I \nhave indicated, we have spent 6 months in preparing this legislation. \nWe have consulted with literally dozens and dozens of organizations \nacross this country. We have consulted with Members in both the House \nand the Senate. We have consulted with Governors. We have consulted \nwith every relevant energy group in the State of North Dakota and in \nthe Midwest. I am delighted that so many of them have already endorsed \nthis legislation.\n  It is time for us to get serious about reducing our dependence on \nforeign oil. I am delighted today to be presenting this BOLD Energy \nAct. I believe it is the direction we should take. I again ask my \ncolleagues to give it their close consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from North \nDakota for thinking boldly and focusing on an urgent need for our \ncountry. I look forward to studying his proposal and working with him, \nespecially in the areas of conservation and efficiency. There is a \nconsensus within the Energy and Natural Resources Committee that we can \ndo more in conservation and efficiency. There is a consensus in the \nSenate, I believe, that we could do more in research and development. \nThere is a consensus that we could do more in renewable fuels. So I \nlook forward to looking at what he has to say.\n  I think our goal should be within a generation to end our dependence \non foreign oil. That wouldn't mean we wouldn't buy oil from Mexico or \nfrom Canada or from anyone, really, but it would mean that no other \ncountry could hold the United States of America hostage to the oil \nsupply.\n  That is a very constructive suggestion. There is one yellow flag I \nwould wave a little bit, and we can talk about it as it makes its way \nthrough the process. The Senator mentioned wind power. In terms of the \ntransportation sector, unless we begin to put these large, giant wind \nmachines on the cars--which I fully expect someone to propose before \nvery long, with a large subsidy--I think we ought to examine carefully \njust how much money we are already spending on giant windmills because \nit is a massive tax ripoff to the taxpayers of the United States.\n  The last figures I saw showed that we were now, over the next 5 \nyears, about to spend $3 billion supporting these giant wind machines, \nwhich are twice as tall as the football stadium at the University of \nTennessee and extend from 10-yard line to 10-yard line and only work \nwhen the wind is blowing. They deface the landscape of America.\n  The Senator has suggested a comprehensive policy that sounds very \nattractive to me, but I would like us to examine carefully, as we go \nthrough this, whether it is wise, for example, to extend the renewable \ntax credit another 2 years because that is just code words for more \nbillions of dollars to the wind industry. They have a very good lobby. \nThey are very effective. But there are other forms of alternative \nenergy, especially regarding fuels, which is what we are talking about \nwhen we are trying to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. That is \nwhere we use most of our oil, in the transportation sector. I hope we \nwill spend our available money on research and development, as the \nSenator has suggested, on conservation and efficiency, as the Senator \nsuggested, and on other kinds of fuels--biodiesel, as the Senator \nsuggested--and be very cautious about adding to the wind subsidy before \nwe clearly understand what we are doing.\n  Perhaps the figures aren't right, but the last figures I saw from the \nDepartment of Treasury is that the Congress has now authorized $3 \nbillion for giant wind machines. We don't need a national windmill \npolicy; we need a national energy policy.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, might I get the attention of the Senator \nfor just a moment? I say to him, first of all, I appreciate very much \nhis thoughtful remarks, as always. When you have a chance to look at \nthis, this is a comprehensive bill. We have spent months talking to \neveryone we thought had a good idea. We have talked to people who \nsponsored legislation in the House and the Senate, trying to cull those \nlegislative offerings for the best ideas. We have talked to the people \nwho were sponsored by Hewlett-Packard to do a review of national energy \npolicy in America.\n  As you know, they spent several years in a serious effort to come to \ngrips with what we could do that would dramatically reduce our energy \ndependence. The Senator is quite right. That is why so much of this \nlegislation is focused on fuels; that is where a significant part of \nour imported energy is going--to fuel the fleets of our country.\n  Let me say with respect to wind energy, I truly believe that is a \ncomponent of a comprehensive bill. Let me put it in perspective. In \nterms of our legislation, it is a very small part because I think that \nis the appropriate level of commitment to make in terms of \ncomprehensive energy policy. There are many other things that have much \nmore prominence in terms of where the investment is being made. I would \nsay to my colleague, in North Dakota we have extraordinary wind energy \ncapacity. We have the ability to relieve our dependence on coal-fired \nplants and our dependence on plants that are fueled by natural gas, and \nwe have extreme problems, long term, with natural gas in this country. \nThat is why natural gas prices have had such a runup.\n  Wind energy is a great part of an overall plan to reduce peaking \nload. Obviously, you cannot count on the wind blowing--although in \nNorth Dakota you almost always can. So you have to marry it with other \nenergy-generating sources. That is what we have done with this \nlegislation. I very much welcome my colleague's kind comments, and I \nlook forward to his consideration of what we have tried to do.\n  Let me just say, I gave my staff an assignment 6 months ago. I told \nthem I wanted an energy bill that anybody could look at and objectively \nsay: If this were enacted, it would make a serious contribution to \nreducing our energy dependence. I have supported the past energy bills \nthat have come through here. I was pleased to do so. But I think we all \nknow none of them make a dramatic change in our long-term dependence. \nThat is what this bill is designed to do, I say to my colleague: make a \ndramatic reduction in our dependence.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I appreciate the spirit of the \nSenator's remarks. He has presented this the same way he dealt with the \nbudget issues. He and Senator Gregg did a very good job with that and \nhelped the Senate through a difficult area. The last energy bill, the \none in July, was a very good bill because it began to shift our policy \ntoward producing large amounts of low-carbon and no-carbon energy. It \ntakes a while to do that. It is like turning a big ship around. But we \nare already beginning to see the results.\n  There was more conservation and efficiency in that than we had \nbefore, which avoids building new natural gas plants, for example. But \nwe could do much more.\n  There was significant support for nuclear power, which we should do \nmore of. All those who want to solve global warming in a generation \nshould be helping to support nuclear power because 70 percent of our \ncarbon-free energy in the United States today comes from nuclear power. \nSeventy percent of the carbon-free electricity that we produce comes \nfrom nuclear power. There is a growing consensus that we should begin \nto proceed with that in the United States, and even help India and \nChina avoid dirty coal plants that pollute the area. If we want clean \nair and low-cost power that is reliable, the approach toward nuclear \npower is important. That was in the bill.\n  I encourage steps towards clean coal, which would be coal \ngasification, which would limit the amount of nitrogen and sulphur and \nmercury that would come from the use of coal--we have a lot of coal in \nthe United States--and research for carbon sequestration. If we could \nrecapture the carbon, we could then use coal for large amounts of clean \npower.\n  Then we had significant support for renewable energy, for ethanol. \nThe President has now suggested that we extend that to different kinds \nof ethanol. I am sure there are appropriate places for wind power, but \nit doesn't\n\n[[Page S3234]]\n\namount to much. It is not very reliable. And there is no excuse for \nspending $3 billion over the next 5 years on gigantic windmills that \ngive big subsidies to investors and scar the landscape when we could be \nspending it on conservation and efficiency. Of course, what I hope, \nfinally, and in pursuit of Senator Conrad's goal, is that we redouble \nour interest in the hydrogen fuel cell economy. Major manufacturers are \ntelling me they are investing hundreds of millions of dollars each year \nin hydrogen fuel cells which will have no emissions except water, and \none major manufacturer said to me that his company, one of the largest \nin the world, would have a commercially available car on the market \nwithin 10 years, and that was last year. That seems soon to me. But the \nsooner that happens--the sooner that happens, the better.\n  To reduce our dependence on foreign oil so that we are not held \nhostage, and to make sure that we have clean air and to make sure that \nwe do our part not to add to global warming, we should do all these \nthings. We do not need a national windmill policy. We need a \ncomprehensive energy policy.\n  I see the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  We would have to put enough giant windmills to cover 70 percent of \nMassachusetts to equal the amount of energy in the oil we would get \nfrom ANWR.\n  My main purpose is to say to Senator Conrad that I welcome his \nproposal. It is a serious, thoughtful effort, as is characteristic of \nhis efforts.\n  I wish to ask that we carefully consider where the tax subsidies go \nbefore we spend more billions of dollars on a source that is already \noversubsidized, that scars the landscape, that only works when the wind \nblows, that requires large new power lines to be built and that can \nfend for its own in marketplaces where it is appropriate to be.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS (for himself and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 2572. A bill to amend the Aviation and Transportation Security Act \nto extend the suspended service ticket honor requirement; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce the \nAviation Consumer Protection Extension Act. The bill is a 1-year \nextension of section 145 of the Aviation and Transportation Security \nAct, which passed in 2001. The current extension expires in November of \nthis year.\n  Currently, the aviation industry is going through a difficult time \nwith numerous airline bankruptcies and overall uncertainty. In this \nenvironment, airline consumers deserve protection in the circumstance \nthat their air service provider suspends service because of a \nbankruptcy.\n  This extension provides that airline passengers holding tickets from \na bankrupt carrier are entitled to a seat on a standby basis on any \nairline serving that route if arrangements are made within 60 days \nafter the bankrupt airline suspends operations.\n  Under the provision, the maximum fee that an airline can charge for \nproviding standby transportation would not exceed $50 each way. The \nextension does not apply to charter flights but does cover frequent \nflyer tickets.\n  Like all Members of this body, my State of Montana has a number of \ntraveling families. In the unfortunate circumstance that an air carrier \ndiscontinues service, those families should not have to foot an \noutrageous bill to get back home.\n  In these times of unease and uncertainty in the airline industry, we \nneed to make sure hard-earned family vacations don't turn into \nunnecessarily costly expenditures. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on a timely passage of this important extension.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 2573. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide \ninterest rate reductions, to authorize and appropriate amounts for the \nFederal Pell Grant program, to allow for in-school consolidation, to \nprovide the administrative account for the Federal Direct Loan Program \nas a mandatory program, to strike the single holder rule, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

A bill to amend the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 \nto help reduce the increased risk of severe wildfires to communities in \nforested areas affected by infestations of bark beetles and other \ninsects, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about S. 2584, \n``The Rocky Mountain Forest Insects Response Enhancement and Support \nAct,'' or ``Rocky Mountain FIRES Act,'' which I introduced earlier \ntoday.\n  I am introducing this bill because we are facing an extremely \ndangerous wildfire situation in the West, including my home State of \nColorado, maybe worse than we have ever faced.\n  Below-average snowfalls, protracted drought, and a massive bark \nbeetle infestation have created fuel loads that threaten forest health, \nproperty, and human life. I fear that we are facing a perfect storm of \nconditions for devastating fires this summer in Colorado.\n  The southern half of Colorado, and much of the Southwest, has been \nhit by yet another year of below-average precipitation. With the \nexception of a few areas in Colorado's northern mountains, \nprecipitation levels this winter were 25-50 percent of average. \nColorado is now in its 7th consecutive year of drought.\n  This drought has been so severe and so long that even the healthiest \ntrees have become fuel for disease, fire, and insect infestations.\n  Mr. President, the bark beetle, a pest that normally kills only a few \nweak trees in a stand, has fed off entire forests of drought-weakened \ntrees. It is a plague that is sweeping through the Rockies.\n  The bark beetle problem in Colorado is of unprecedented magnitude. \nThe infestation is killing trees over hundreds of thousands of acres, \nleaving huge, dry fuel loads in its wake.\n  Across the State, but particularly in the Arapaho National Forest in \nnorthern Colorado, bark beetles are turning entire forests into brown, \ndead stands. In 2004, bark beetles killed an estimated 7 million trees \nover 1.5 million acres in Colorado.\n  When you see pictures that show the stands that have been hit by the \nbark beetle, you can see why people who live nearby are so concerned. \nYou can imagine what a fire would look like if it got into a stand of \nbeetle-infested timber--it would jump from crown to crown, racing up \nridges and through the forest faster than we could respond.\n  Beetle-kill stands are everywhere in Grand County and Larimer County, \nSummit and Eagle, Saguache and San Miguel. They are increasingly \nvisible in pockets along the Front Range, among houses and communities \nin the wildland-urban interface.\n  The areas with smaller outbreaks, like those in the Pike National \nForest and the Gunnison National Forest, are just as worrisome as the \nmassive outbreaks in northern Colorado. When we see even a handful of \nbeetle-kill trees, it usually means that the insects are already \nattacking the surrounding trees.\n  Private land owners and local governments are doing all they can to \ncombat this problem--they are using their chainsaws to protect their \nhomes, they are spraying trees, and they are devising protection plans. \nThey wonder, though, if they aren't alone in this fight. They wonder if \nthe Federal Government is asleep at the wheel in the face of potential \ndisaster.\n  The people who see the browned-out, dead forests from their kitchen \nwindows wonder why Washington isn't moving faster to curb this \nonslaught on our public lands--why is the government not clearing out \nthe dead trees, creating buffers to prevent the beetle from spreading, \nor providing more resources and expertise to help local communities \nprotect themselves?\n  I have pressed Secretary Johanns to find funds to deal with this \nemergency in Colorado and across the West. At the current budget \nlevels, we are simply not able to curb the bark beetle problem and \nprepare for the upcoming fire season. We could be treating 2 or 3 times \nas many acres this year if we only had adequate funds.\n  We must also give local communities and land managers the tools they \nneed to combat the bark beetle infestation. That is what S2584, the \n``Rocky Mountain Fires Act,'' will do.\n  My bill will facilitate a swifter response by the Forest Service and \nBLM to widespread insect infestations in our forests; provide \nadditional money to communities that are preparing or revising their \nwildfire protection plans; make grant funding available for enterprises \nthat use woody biomass for energy production and other commercial \npurposes, so that we can put beetle-kill trees and wood from hazard \nfuels-reduction projects to good use; and allow the Forest Service and \nthe BLM to award stewardship contracts to nearby landowners, so that \nresidents can do hazard fuels reduction on federal lands to protect \ntheir homes.\n  Coloradans are anxious for Congress to take action on the bark beetle \nissue because they know the dangers they face. They remember the fire \nstorms of 2002, when the Hayman Fire burned 138,000 acres on the Front \nRange, the Missonary Ridge Fire burned 70,000 acres near Durango, and \nscores of other fires across the State chewed up resources and claimed \nproperty and lives.\n  This year could be as bad, or worse, if we don't take action right \nnow.\n  We must find funds or provide emergency funding so that we can gear \nup for the fire season. We must also pass bark beetle legislation that \ngives communities and land managers the tools they need to protect \nproperty and lives.\n  We must take action right now. As I am reminded by the reports of \nfires in Colorado just this past week: this summer's fire season is \nalready upon us.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 2585. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to permit \nmilitary death gratuities to be contributed to certain tax-favored \naccounts; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. America's service men and women continue to make the \nultimate sacrifices for our Nation. In the tragic cases where brave \nsoldiers, marines, airmen, and sailors lose their lives in support of \nOperation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom, we must honor \ntheir service by ensuring that their families are not forced to \nshoulder undue financial strain. Therefore, I am honored to introduce \nthe Fallen Heroes Family Savings Act.\n  This legislation will increase the flexibility given to families \nwhile managing the death gratuity payment to the survivors of fallen \nservice men and women. This bill will provide these families expanded \nfinancial options to invest the $100,000 death gratuity payment in \nhealth, education, and retirement savings accounts. Allowing families \nto transfer these funds will help them save money for a college \neducation, medical expenses, or to finance a future retirement.\n  Allowing military families increased financial flexibility is the \nleast we can do to honor the legacy our troops have worked so hard to \ncreate. It is my hope that this legislation will assist the\n\n[[Page S3236]]\n\nfamilies of fallen service men and women in their time of grief and \nallow them to plan for their future.\n  I ask for unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the \nfollowing letter from the Military Officers Association of America in \nsupport of this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     Military Officers Association\n\n\n                                                   of America,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, April 6, 2006.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: I am writing on behalf of the 360,000 \n     members of the Military Officers Association of America \n     (MOAA) in support of your planned legislation, the Fallen \n     Heroes Family Savings Act. This important bill would help \n     military survivors manage the increased death gratuity \n     amounts permanently authorized in the FY2006 National Defense \n     Authorization Act.\n       The new $100,000 death gratuity provides greatly improved \n     compensation for military survivors and their families but \n     also presents a challenge as to where to safely invest such \n     sizeable sums to provide for future financial security. Your \n     bill would allow survivors to invest death gratuity lump sums \n     in Roth IRA's and other savings accounts, above the \n     contribution limits now allowed. This makes perfect sense and \n     is a logical extension of efforts to increase benefits to \n     widows.\n       MOAA is grateful for your leadership on this and other \n     issues important to our servicemembers. We pledge our support \n     in seeking enactment of this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Norb Ryan, Jr.,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today Senator Smith and I are introducing \n``The Fallen Heroes Family Savings Act'' that will help military \nfamilies that have suffered a tragic loss. In recent years, the \nCongress has generously raised the amount of the military death \ngratuity to $100,000 and expanded eligibility to all in uniform.\n  Our current tax laws do not allow the recipients of this payment to \nuse it to make contributions to tax-preferred accounts that help with \nsaving for retirement, health care, or the cost of education. Our \nlegislation would allow families who already have given so much to \ncontribute the death gratuity to certain tax-preferred accounts. These \ncontributions would be treated as qualified rollovers. The contribution \nlimits of these accounts will not be applied to these contributions.\n  This legislation will not ease the pain of military families that \nsuffer the loss of a loved one, but it can help families put their \nlives back together. It will enable military families to save more for \nretirement, education, and health care by being able to put the death \ngratuity payment in an account in which the earnings will accumulate \ntax-free.\n  These changes to our tax laws will help military families with some \nof their financial burdens. It can not repay the sacrifices that they \nhave made for us, but it hopefully demonstrates the gratitude of a \nNation that will not forget the families of the fallen.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 2586. A bill to establish a 2-year pilot program to develop a \ncurriculum at historically Black colleges and universities, Tribal \nColleges, and Hispanic serving institutions to foster entrepreneurship \nand business development in underserved minority communities; to the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Minority \nEntrepreneurship and Innovation Pilot Program, legislation aimed at \naddressing this Nation's growing economic disparities through \nentrepreneurship and business development. It is the spirit of \nentrepreneurship that has made America's economy the best in the world. \nAnd it is through the energy and vitality of the small business sector \nthat we will help all sectors of American society benefit from our \nrobust economy.\n  Exactly one year ago, the National Urban League released a report on \nthe State of Black America, which discussed the growing economic gap \nbetween African Americans and their white counterparts. The report \nstates that the median net worth of an African American family is \n$6,100 compared with $67,000 for a white family. The report makes clear \nthat closing the racial wealth gap needs to be at the forefront of the \ncivil rights agenda moving into the twenty-first century.\n  Disproportionate unemployment figures for minorities versus their \nwhite counterparts have also been a persistent problem. Even as the \nadministration has been touting the current low nationwide unemployment \nrate, the African American unemployment rate was 9.5 percent, the \nHispanic unemployment rate was 6 percent, while the unemployment rate \nfor whites averaged 4.1 percent.\n  As the Ranking Member on the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I have received firsthand testimony and countless \nreports documenting the positive economic impact that occurs when we \nfoster entrepreneurship in underserved communities. There are signs of \nsignificant economic returns when minority businesses are created and \nare able to grow in size and capacity. Between 1987 and 1997, revenue \nfrom minority owned firms rose by 22.5 percent, an increase equivalent \nto an annual growth rate of 10 percent and employment opportunities \nwithin minority owned firms increased by 23 percent during that same \nperiod. There is a clear correlation between the growth of minority \nowned firms and the economic viability of the minority community.\n  We have come a long way, but we still have a long way to go if this \ncountry is going to keep the promise made to all its citizens of the \nAmerican dream. In 2005, African Americans accounted for 12.3 percent \nof the population and only 4 percent of all U.S. businesses. Hispanics \nAmericans represent 12.5 percent of the U.S. population and \napproximately 6 percent of all U.S. businesses. Native Americans \naccount for approximately 1 percent of the population and .9 percent of \nall U.S. businesses. We can, and should do something to address what is \nessentially an inequality of opportunity.\n  I have long argued that there is a compelling interest for the \nFederal Government to create opportunities for business and economic \ndevelopment in all communities--throughout this Nation. It is \nappropriate for the Federal Government to lead the efforts and find \ninnovative solutions to the racial disparities that exist in this \ncountry, whether they are in healthcare, education, or economics.\n  Economic disparities in this country are a very complex issue, \nparticularly when racial demographics are involved. I am well aware \nthat there is no one-size-fits-all solution and there is no single \npiece of legislation that will level the playing field. However, I \nstrongly believe that education and entrepreneurship can help to close \nthe gap in business ownership and the wealth gap that exists in this \ncountry. Many minorities are already turning to entrepreneurship as a \nmeans of realizing the American dream. According to U.S. Census data, \nHispanics are opening businesses 3 times faster than the national \naverage. Business development and entrepreneurship have played a \nsignificant role in the expansion of the black middle class in this \ncountry for over a century.\n  The Minority Entrepreneurship and Innovation Pilot Program offers a \ncompetitive grant to Historically Black Colleges and Universities, \nTribal Colleges, and HispanicServing Institutions to create an \nentrepreneurship curriculum at these institutions and to open Small \nBusiness Development Centers on campus to serve local businesses. The \ncolleges and universities that participate in this program will foster \nentrepreneurship among their students, the best and brightest of the \nminority community, and develop a pool of talented entrepreneurs that \nare essential to innovation, job creation, and closing the wealth gap. \nThe bill would make 24 grants, for $1 million each, available to \ninstitutions that include entrepreneurship and innovation as a part of \ntheir organizational mission and open a business-counseling center for \nthose graduates that start their own businesses as well as the \nsurrounding community of existing business owners.\n  The goal of this program is to target students who have skills in \nhighly skilled fields such as engineering, manufacturing, science and \ntechnology, and guide them towards entrepreneurship as a career option. \nMinority-owned businesses already participate in a wide variety of \nindustries, but are\n\n[[Page S3237]]\n\ndisproportionately represented in traditionally lowgrowth and low-\nopportunity service sectors. Promoting entrepreneurial education to \nundergraduate students at colleges and universities expands the pool of \npotential business owners to technology, financial services, legal \nservices, and other non-traditional areas in which the overall \ndevelopment of minority firms has been slow. Growing the size and \ncapacity of existing minority firms and promoting entrepreneurship \namong minority students already committed to higher education will have \na direct relationship on the employment rate, income levels and wealth \ncreation of minorities throughout the nation.\n  The funds are also to be used to open a Small Business Development \nCenter (SBDC) on the campus of the institution to assist in capacity \nbuilding, innovation and market niche development, and to offer \ntraditional business counseling, similar to other SBDCs. The one-to-one \ncounseling offered by the business specialists at these centers has \nproven to be the most effective model available for making \nentrepreneurs run more effective, more efficient, and more successful \nbusinesses. By placing the centers on campus, the institutions will be \nable to leverage the $1 million grant for greater returns and \ncoordinate efforts with the school's academic departments to maximize \nthe efficacy of the program.\n  While the funding in this bill is modest relative to the multi-\nbillion dollar budgets we discuss on a daily basis, these funds can go \na long way and be leveraged to create economic growth in the most \nneeded areas of this country. With this legislation, we will help \nfoster long-term innovation and competitiveness in the small business \nsector. Mr. President, this bill is a small investment in the future of \nthis country that I am sure will do much to foster economic growth in \nour minority communities and beyond. I urge my colleagues to join me as \ncosponsors of this important piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Inhofe) (by request):\n  S. 2589. A bill to enhance the management and disposal of spent \nnuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste, to ensure protection of \npublic health and safety, to ensure the territorial integrity and \nsecurity of the repository at Yucca Mountain, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today, on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Inhofe, to introduce, at the request of the \nadministration, legislation to further the development at Yucca \nMountain of the national repository for nuclear spent fuel and defense \nnuclear waste. This bill is a good start on the road to enactment of \nlegislation that will resolve issues critical to the construction, \nlicensing and operation of the facility.\n  I hope to begin hearings on this issue in the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee shortly after the conclusion of the upcoming \nrecess. I look forward to working with the administration, Senator \nInhofe, and other interested Senators to facilitate the construction \nand operation of the repository, a project so important to the \ncontinued development of safe, clean, and efficient nuclear power in \nthis country.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2589\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require full disclosure of all entities and \norganizations receiving Federal funds; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, today, along with Senators Barack Obama, \nThomas Carper, and John McCain, I introduced legislation to create an \nonline public database that itemizes Federal funding.\n  The bill ensures that the taxpayers will now know how their money is \nbeing spent. Every citizen in this country, after all, should have the \nright to know what organizations and activities are being funded with \ntheir hard-earned tax dollars.\n  The Federal Government awards roughly $300 billion in grants annually \nto 30,000 different organizations across the United States, according \nto the General Services Administration.\n  This bill would require the Office of Management and Budget, OMB, to \nestablish and maintain a single public Web site that lists all entities \nreceiving Federal funds, including the name of each entity, the amount \nof Federal funds the entity has received annually by program, and the \nlocation of the entity. All Federal assistance must be posted within 30 \ndays of such funding being awarded to an organization.\n  This would be an important tool to make Federal funding more \naccountable and transparent. It would also help to reduce fraud, abuse, \nand misallocation of Federal funds by requiring greater accounting of \nFederal expenditures. According to OMB, Federal agencies reported $37.3 \nbillion in improper payments for fiscal year 2005 alone. Better \ntracking of Federal funds would ensure that agencies and taxpayers know \nwhere resources are being spent and likely reduce the number of \nimproper payments by Federal agencies.\n  Over the past year, the Senate Federal Financial Management \nSubcommittee, which I chair along with ranking member Carper, has \nuncovered tens of billions of dollars in fraud, abuse and wasteful \nspending, ranging from expensive leasing schemes to corporate welfare \nto bloated bureaucracy. This database would ensure that such spending \nis better tracked and the public can hold policymakers and Government \nagencies accountable for questionable spending decisions.\n  The Web site required by this bill would not be difficult to develop. \nIn fact, one such site already exists for some Federal funds provided \nby agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services, HHS. \nThe CRISP, Computer Retrieval of Information on Scientific Projects, is \na searchable database of federally funded biomedical research projects \nconducted at universities, hospitals, and other research institutions. \nThe database, maintained by the Office of Extramural Research at the \nNational Institutes of Health, includes projects funded by the National \nInstitutes of Health, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services, \nHealth Resources and Services Administration, Food and Drug \nAdministration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, Agency \nfor Health Care Research and Quality, and Office of Assistant Secretary \nof Health. The CRISP database contains current and\n\n[[Page S3240]]\n\nhistorical awards dating from 1972 to the present.\n  This type of information should be available for all Federal \ncontracts, grants, loans, and assistance provided by all Federal \nagencies and departments.\n  It often takes agencies months to verify or to determine an \norganization's funding when requested by Congress. There are numerous \nexamples of Federal agencies or entities receiving Federal funds \nactually trying to camouflage how Federal dollars are being spent or \ndistributing public funds in violation of Federal laws.\n  In October 2005, the House Government Reform Committee's Subcommittee \non Criminal Justice, Drug Policy and Human Resources questioned the \nU.S. Agency for International Development, USAID, assistant \nadministrator to determine if the agency was funding a proprostitution \nnongovernmental organization called Sampada Grameen Mahila Sanstha, \nSANGRAM, in apparent violation of Public Law 108-25. This law prohibits \nfunds from being used ``to promote or advocate the legalization or \npractice of prostitution or sex trafficking,'' and organizations \nseeking Federal funding for HIV/AIDS work must have a policy \n``explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking.''\n  According to an unclassified State Department memorandum, Restore \nInternational, an antitrafficking organization working in India, was \n``confronted by a USAID-funded NGO, SANGRAM while the former attempted \nto rescue and provide long-term care for child victims of sex \ntrafficking. The confrontation led to the release of 17 minor girls--\nvictims of trafficking--into the hands of traffickers and trafficking \naccomplices.'' According to this memorandum, SANGRAM ``allowed a \nbrothel keeper into a shelter to pressure the girls not to cooperate \nwith counselors. The girls are now back in the brothels, being \nsubjected to rape for profit.''\n  On November 16, 2005, a USAID briefer asserted to subcommittee staff \nthat USAID had ``nothing to do with'' the grant to the proprostitution \nSANGRAM and that the subcommittee's inquiries were ``destructive.'' \nNonetheless, congressional investigators continued to pursue this \nmatter and eventually proved that USAID money financed the \nproprostitution SANGRAM through a second organization named Avert, \nwhich was established with the assistance of four USAID employees as a \npassthrough entity. USAID has held the ex-officio vice chairmanship of \nAvert since inception. According to documents obtained by the \nsubcommittee, the USAID board member of Avert voted twice to award \nfunding to SANGRAM--July 27, 2002 and again on December 3, 2004--the \nlast time being some 18 months after the provisions of Public Law 108-\n25 prohibited taxpayer funding of proprostitution groups like SANGRAM.\n\n  Last August, HHS sponsored a conference in Utah entitled the ``First \nNational Conference on Methamphetamine, HIV and Hepatitis'' that \npromoted illegal drug abuse and dangerous sexual behavior. Conference \nsessions included: ``We Don't Need a `War' on Methamphetamine''; ``You \nDon't Have to Be Clean & Sober. Or Even Want to Be!''; ``Tweaking Tips \nfor Party Boys''; ``Barebacking: A Harm Reduction Approach''; and \n``Without condoms: Harm Reduction, Unprotected Sex, Gay Men and \nBarebacking.'' ``Tweaking'' is a street term for the most dangerous \nstage of meth abuse. A ``tweaker'' is a term for a meth addict who \nprobably has not slept in days, or weeks, and is irritable and \nparanoid. Likewise, ``party boy'' is slang for an individual who abuses \ndrugs, or ``parties.'' ``Barebacking'' is a slang term for sexual \nintercourse without the use of a condom.\n  While HHS initially denied sponsoring the conference, it was later \nlearned that thousands of dollars of a CDC grant were used to, in fact, \nsponsor this conference and CDC sent six employees to participate. In a \nletter dated October 28, 2005, CDC Director Dr. Julie Gerberding \nadmitted that ``Although CDC was not listed as a sponsor, a portion of \nCDC's cooperative agreement with Utah, $13,500, was used to support the \nconference. While Utah informed a CDC project officer that Utah and the \nHarm Reduction Coalition were sponsoring the conference and shared a \ndraft agenda with the project officer, Utah did not inform the project \nofficer about the particular source of the funding for the \nconference.''\n  Previously, the CDC was questioned about its financial support for a \nnumber of dubious HIV prevention workshops, including ``flirting \nclasses'' and ``Booty Call,'' orchestrated by the Stop AIDS Foundation \nof San Francisco. While CDC repeatedly denied to both Congress and the \npublic that taxpayer funds were used to finance these programs, a Stop \nAIDS Project official eventually admitted in August 2001 to using \nFederal funds for the programs. An HHS Office of Inspector General, \nOIG, investigation also concluded in November 2001 that Federal funds \nwere used to finance the programs and that the programs themselves \ncontained content that may violate Federal laws and Federal guidelines \nwere not followed. The OIG found that the activity under review ``did \nnot fully comply with the cooperative agreement and other CDC \nguidance,'' that the CDC requirement for review of materials by a local \nreview panel was not followed, and characterized some of the project \nactivities as ``inappropriate.'' Finally, the OIG concluded that ``CDC \nfunding was used to support all [Stop AIDS] Project activities.'' The \nStop AIDS Project received approximately $700,000 a year from the CDC \nbut no longer receives Federal funding.\n  These are just a few recent examples from only a couple agencies \nuncovered due to aggressive congressional oversight. While the public, \nwhose taxes finance these groups and programs, watchdog organizations, \nand the media can file Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, requests for \nthis same information, such requests can take months to receive answers \nand often go completely ignored.\n  If enacted, this legislation will finally ensure true accountability \nand transparency in how the Government spends our money, which will \nhopefully lead to more fiscal responsibility by the Federal Government.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Bingaman, Ms. \n        Murkowski, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Chafee, and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 2592. A bill to amend the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to improve \nthe nutrition and health of schoolchildren by updating the definition \nof ``food of minimal nutritional value'' to conform to current \nnutrition science and to protect the Federal investment in the national \nschool lunch and breakfast programs; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, our Nation faces a public health crisis of \nthe first order. Poor diet and physical inactivity are contributing to \ngrowing rates of chronic disease in the U.S. These problems do not just \naffect adults, but increasingly affect the health of our children as \nwell. Research suggests that one-third of American children born today \nwill develop type II diabetes at some point. For some minority \nchildren, the numbers are even more shocking, as high as 50 percent. At \nthe same time, rates of overweight among children are skyrocketing: \ntripling among children ages 6-11, and doubling among children ages 2 \nto 5 and ages 12-19 over the past three decades. Indeed, just this week \nthe Journal of the American Medical Association released a new study \nthat found that, in just the past 5 years, rates of childhood \noverweight and obesity rose very significantly.\n  There are many reasons for this public health crisis, and \naccordingly, addressing the crisis will require multiple solutions as \nwell. One place where we can start is with our schools, which have been \ninundated with foods and drinks having little or no positive \nnutritional value. A recent study from the Government Accountability \noffice found that 99 percent of high schools, 97 percent of middle \nschools, and 83 percent of elementary schools sell foods from vending \nmachines, school stores, or a-la-carte lines in the cafeteria. And it \nis not fresh fruits and vegetables and other healthy foods that are \nbeing sold. No, the vast majority of the foods being sold in our \nschools outside of Federal meal programs are foods that contribute \nnothing to the health and development of our children and are actually \ndetrimental to them.\n  Not only does the over consumption of these foods take a toll on the \nhealth\n\n[[Page S3241]]\n\nof our children, but they also have a negative impact of the investment \nof taxpayer dollars in the health of our kids. Every year the Federal \nGovernment spends nearly $10 billion to reimburse schools for the \nprovision of meals through the National School Lunch Program and School \nBreakfast Program. In order to receive reimbursement, these meals must \nmeet nutrition standards based upon the Dietary Guidelines for All \nAmericans, the official dietary advice of the U.S. government. However, \nsales of food elsewhere in our schools do not fall under these \nguidelines. Therefore, as children consume more and more of the foods \ntypically sold through school vending machines and snack bars, it \nundermines the nearly $10 billion in Federal reimbursements that we \nspend on nutritionally balanced school meals.\n  Finally, the heavy selling of candy, soft drinks and other junk food \nin our schools undermines the guidance, and even the instruction and \nauthority of parents who want to help their children consume sound and \nbalanced diets. The American public agrees. A Robert Wood Johnson \nFoundation poll from several years ago found that 90 percent of parents \nwould like to see schools remove the typical junk food from vending \nmachines and replace it with healthier alternatives. My bill seeks to \nrestore the role and authority of parents by ensuring that schools \nprovide the healthy, balanced nutrition that contributes to health and \ndevelopment.\n  What really hurts children and undermines parents is the junk food \nfree-for-all that currently exists in so many of our schools. How does \nit help kids if the school sells them a 20-ounce soda and a candy bar \nfor lunch when their parents have sent them to school with the \nexpectation that they will have balanced meals from the school lunch \nprogram?\n  Today, for the first time ever, bipartisan legislation is being \nintroduced in both Chambers of Congress to address this problem--and to \ndo what is right for the health of our kids. This bill is supported by \nkey health and education groups, and I would like to thank the National \nPTA, the American Medical Association, the Center for Science in the \nPublic Interest, the American Heart Association, the American Dietetic \nAssociation, the American Diabetes Association, and others for their \nstrong support.\n  The Child Nutrition Promotion and School Lunch Protection Act of 2006 \ndoes two very simple but important things:\n  First, it requires the Secretary of Agriculture to initiate a \nrulemaking process to update nutritional standards for foods sold in \nschools. Currently, USDA relies upon a very narrow nutritional standard \nthat is nearly 30 years old. Since that definition was formulated, \nchildren's diets and dietary risk have changed dramatically. In that \ntime, we have also learned a great deal about the relationship between \npoor diet and chronic disease. It is time for public policy to catch up \nwith the science.\n  Second, the bill requires the Secretary of Agriculture to apply the \nupdated definition everywhere on school grounds and throughout the \nschool day. Currently, the Secretary can only issue rules limiting a \nvery narrow class of foods, and then only stop their sales in the \nactual school cafeteria during the meal period. As a result, a child \nonly needs to walk into the hall outside the cafeteria to buy a \n``lunch'' consisting of soda, a bag of chips and a candy bar. This is a \nloophole that is big enough to drive a soft drink delivery truck \nthrough--literally. It is time to close it.\n  The bill is supported in the Senate by a bipartisan group of \nSenators. Joining me in introducing the bill are Senator Specter of \nPennsylvania, Senator Bingaman of New Mexico, Senator Murkowski of \nAlaska, Senator Durbin of Illinois, and Senator Chafee of Rhode Island. \nThe diverse group of supporters of this bill cuts all lines and shows \nthat when the health of our children is at stake, we can put aside our \ndifferences in the interest of our children.\n  This bill, by itself, will not solve the problem of poor diet and \nrising rates of chronic disease among our children and adults. But it \nis a start. Scientists predict that--because of obesity and preventable \nchronic diseases--the current generation of children could very well be \nthe first in American history to live shorter lives than their parents. \nIf this isn't a wakeup call, I don't know what is.\n  Our children are at risk. The time to act is now. And that's why I am \npleased to introduce the Child Nutrition Promotion and School Lunch \nProtection Act of 2006.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2592\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Nutrition Promotion \n     and School Lunch Protection Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) for a school food service program to receive Federal \n     reimbursements under the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 \n     U.S.C. 1771 et seq.) or the Richard B. Russell National \n     School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.), school meals \n     served by that program must meet science-based nutritional \n     standards established by Congress and the Secretary of \n     Agriculture;\n       (2) foods sold individually outside the school meal \n     programs (including foods sold in vending machines, a la \n     carte or snack lines, school stores, and snack bars) are not \n     required to meet comparable nutritional standards;\n       (3) in order to promote child nutrition and health, \n     Congress--\n       (A) has authorized the Secretary to establish nutritional \n     standards in the school lunchroom during meal time; and\n       (B) since 1979, has prohibited the sale of food of minimal \n     nutritional value, as defined by the Secretary, in areas \n     where school meals are sold or eaten;\n       (4) Federally-reimbursed school meals and child nutrition \n     and health are undermined by the uneven authority of the \n     Secretary to set nutritional standards throughout the school \n     campus and over the course of the school day;\n       (5) since 1979, when the Secretary defined the term ``food \n     of minimal nutritional value'' and promulgated regulations \n     for the sale of those foods during meal times, nutrition \n     science has evolved and expanded;\n       (6) the current definition of ``food of minimal nutritional \n     value'' is inconsistent with current knowledge about \n     nutrition and health;\n       (7) because some children purchase foods other than \n     balanced meals provided through the school lunch program \n     established under the Richard B. Russell National School \n     Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.) and the school breakfast \n     program established by section 4 of the Child Nutrition Act \n     of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1773), the efforts of parents to ensure \n     that their children consume healthful diets are undermined;\n       (8) experts in nutrition science have found that--\n       (A) since 1980, rates of obesity have doubled in children \n     and tripled in adolescents;\n       (B) only 2 percent of children eat a healthy diet that is \n     consistent with Federal nutrition recommendations;\n       (C) 3 out of 4 high school students do not eat the minimum \n     recommended number of servings of fruits and vegetables each \n     day; and\n       (D) type 2 diabetes, which is primarily due to poor diet \n     and physical inactivity, is rising rapidly in children;\n       (9) in 1996, children aged 2 to 18 years consumed an \n     average of 118 more calories per day than similar children \n     did in 1978, which is the equivalent of 12 pounds of weight \n     gain annually, if not compensated for through increased \n     physical activity; and\n       (10) according to the Surgeon General, the direct and \n     indirect costs of obesity in the United States are \n     $117,000,000,000 per year.\n\n     SEC. 3. FOOD OF MINIMAL NUTRITIONAL VALUE.\n\n       Section 10 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. \n     1779) is amended--\n       (1) by striking the section heading and all that follows \n     through ``(a) The Secretary'' and inserting the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 10. REGULATIONS.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--The Secretary''; and\n       (2) by striking subsections (b) and (c) and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(b) Food of Minimal Nutritional Value.--\n       ``(1) Proposed regulations.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date \n     of enactment of this paragraph, the Secretary shall \n     promulgate proposed regulations to revise the definition of \n     `food of minimal nutritional value' that is used to carry out \n     this Act and the Richard B.

A bill to protect, consistent with Roe v. Wade, a woman's \nfreedom to choose to bear a child or terminate a pregnancy, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Freedom of \nChoice Act. When the Supreme Court issued its landmark Roe v. Wade \ndecision in 1973, it made clear that our Constitutional right to \nprivacy grants women the freedom to choose whether to begin, prevent, \nor continue a pregnancy.\n  The purpose of this bill is very simple: It ensures that the \nguarantees of Roe v. Wade will be there for every generation of women.\n  We know what Roe has meant for women these past 33 years. It has \nallowed them to make their most personal and difficult reproductive \ndecisions in consultation with loved ones and health care providers. It \nhas given them the dignity to plan their own families and the ability \nto participate fully in the economic and social life of our country. \nAnd, most important, it has preserved health and saved lives.\n  Many of us are old enough to remember what it was like in the days \nbefore Roe. More than a million women a year were forced to seek \nillegal abortions, pushed into the back alleys where they risked \ninfection, hemorrhage, disfiguration, and death. Some estimate that \nthousands of women died every year because of illegal abortions before \nRoe.\n  When the Senate debated the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Alito, \nwomen wrote to me with their own heart-breaking stories. For one woman, \nthe year was 1956. She was only four when her mother died of an illegal \nabortion performed with a coat hanger. Too scared to ask for help, her \nmother bled to death at work.\n  Another woman wrote to me about how hard her mother and father \nstruggled during the depression, how they worked day and night to make \nends meet and support their two children. When her mother found out she \nwas pregnant again, she had health problems, and she knew she couldn't \ntake care of another child. She made the very difficult decision to get \nan illegal abortion. The procedure left her bleeding for weeks, and she \nalmost died.\n  Mr. President, the American people do not want us to go back to those \ndark days. In a recent CNN poll, 66 percent said they do not want Roe \noverturned. Yet there is a dangerous movement afoot to overrule Roe \nand, in the meantime, to severely undermine its promises.\n  Make no mistake: The threat to Roe is real and immediate. President \nBush has already put two anti-choice justices on the Supreme Court, \nwhere reproductive freedom now hangs by a thread. More than 450 anti-\nchoice measures have been enacted by the states since 1995.\n  Recently, South Dakota enacted a ban on abortion in nearly all \ncircumstances, even when a woman's health is at stake, even when she is \nthe victim of rape and incest. And South Dakota is not alone. Several \nother states are considering similar bans.\n  The extremists behind these abortion bans make no secret about their \ngoal. They want to use these laws to overturn Roe, and they think that \nthe changes on the Supreme Court give them a chance to do just that.\n  We must act now. That is why I am introducing legislation today to \nprotect the reproductive freedom of women across America.\n  The Freedom of Choice Act writes Roe v. Wade into federal law. It \nsays that every woman has the fundamental right to choose to bear a \nchild; to terminate a pregnancy before fetal viability; or, if \nnecessary to protect the health or life of the mother, after viability. \nIt says that we will not turn back the clock on the health and rights \nof women. And it says that we will take steps--as a Congress and as a \ncountry--to safeguard the dignity, privacy, and health of women now and \nfor generations to come.\n  I thank the cosponsors of this legislation, and I ask all my \ncolleagues who support Roe v. Wade to join us in making sure that it is \nthe law of the land, and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2593\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Freedom of Choice Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The United States was founded on core principles, such \n     as liberty, personal privacy, and equality, which ensure that \n     individuals are free to make their most intimate decisions \n     without governmental interference and discrimination.\n       (2) One of the most private and difficult decisions an \n     individual makes is whether to begin, prevent, continue, or \n     terminate a pregnancy. Those reproductive health decisions \n     are best made by women, in consultation with their loved ones \n     and health care providers.\n       (3) In 1965, in Griswold v. Connecticut (381 U.S. 479), and \n     in 1973, in Roe v. Wade (410 U.S. 113) and Doe v. Bolton (410 \n     U.S. 179), the Supreme Court recognized that the right to \n     privacy protected by the Constitution encompasses the right \n     of every woman to weigh the personal, moral, and religious \n     considerations involved in deciding whether to begin, \n     prevent, continue, or terminate a pregnancy.\n       (4) The Roe v. Wade decision carefully balances the rights \n     of women to make important reproductive decisions with the \n     State's interest in potential life. Under Roe v. Wade and Doe \n     v. Bolton, the right to privacy protects a woman's decision \n     to choose to terminate her pregnancy prior to fetal \n     viability, with the State permitted to ban abortion after \n     fetal viability except when necessary to protect a woman's \n     life or health.\n       (5) These decisions have protected the health and lives of \n     women in the United States. Prior to the Roe v. Wade decision \n     in 1973, an estimated 1,200,000 women each year were forced \n     to resort to illegal abortions, despite the risk of \n     unsanitary conditions, incompetent treatment, infection, \n     hemorrhage, disfiguration, and death. Before Roe, it is \n     estimated that thousands of women died annually in the United \n     States as a result of illegal abortions.\n       (6) In countries in which abortion remains illegal, the \n     risk of maternal mortality is high. According to the World \n     Health Organization, of the approximately 600,000 pregnancy-\n     related deaths occurring annually around the world, 80,000 \n     are associated with unsafe abortions.\n       (7) The Roe v. Wade decision also expanded the \n     opportunities for women to participate equally in society. In \n     1992, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey (505 U.S. 833), the \n     Supreme Court observed that, ``[t]he ability of women to \n     participate equally in the economic and social life of the \n     Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their \n     reproductive lives.''.\n       (8) Even though the Roe v. Wade decision has stood for more \n     than 30 years, there are increasing threats to reproductive \n     health and freedom emerging from all branches and levels of \n     government. In 2006, South Dakota became the first State in \n     more than 15 years to enact a ban on abortion in nearly all \n     circumstances. Supporters of this ban have admitted it is an \n     attempt to directly challenge Roe in the courts. Other States \n     are considering similar bans.\n       (9) Legal and practical barriers to the full range of \n     reproductive services endanger women's health and lives. \n     Incremental restrictions on the right to choose imposed by \n     Congress and State legislatures have made access to abortion \n     care extremely difficult, if not impossible, for many women \n     across the\n\n[[Page S3243]]\n\n     country. Currently, 87 percent of the counties in the United \n     States have no abortion provider.\n       (10) While abortion should remain safe and legal, women \n     should also have more meaningful access to family planning \n     services that prevent unintended pregnancies, thereby \n     reducing the need for abortion.\n       (11) To guarantee the protections of Roe v. Wade, Federal \n     legislation is necessary.\n       (12) Although Congress may not create constitutional rights \n     without amending the Constitution, Congress may, where \n     authorized by its enumerated powers and not prohibited by the \n     Constitution, enact legislation to create and secure \n     statutory rights in areas of legitimate national concern.\n       (13) Congress has the affirmative power under section 8 of \n     article I of the Constitution and section 5 of the 14th \n     amendment to the Constitution to enact legislation to \n     facilitate interstate commerce and to prevent State \n     interference with interstate commerce, liberty, or equal \n     protection of the laws.\n       (14) Federal protection of a woman's right to choose to \n     prevent or terminate a pregnancy falls within this \n     affirmative power of Congress, in part, because--\n       (A) many women cross State lines to obtain abortions and \n     many more would be forced to do so absent a constitutional \n     right or Federal protection;\n       (B) reproductive health clinics are commercial actors that \n     regularly purchase medicine, medical equipment, and other \n     necessary supplies from out-of-State suppliers; and\n       (C) reproductive health clinics employ doctors, nurses, and \n     other personnel who travel across State lines in order to \n     provide reproductive health services to patients.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Government.--The term ``government'' includes a branch, \n     department, agency, instrumentality, or official (or other \n     individual acting under color of law) of the United States, a \n     State, or a subdivision of a State.\n       (2) State.--The term ``State'' means each of the States, \n     the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, \n     and each territory or possession of the United States.\n       (3) Viability.--The term ``viability'' means that stage of \n     pregnancy when, in the best medical judgment of the attending \n     physician based on the particular medical facts of the case \n     before the physician, there is a reasonable likelihood of the \n     sustained survival of the fetus outside of the woman.\n\n     SEC. 4. INTERFERENCE WITH REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH PROHIBITED.\n\n       (a) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United \n     States that every woman has the fundamental right to choose \n     to bear a child, to terminate a pregnancy prior to fetal \n     viability, or to terminate a pregnancy after fetal viability \n     when necessary to protect the life or health of the woman.\n       (b) Prohibition of Interference.--A government may not--\n       (1) deny or interfere with a woman's right to choose--\n       (A) to bear a child;\n       (B) to terminate a pregnancy prior to viability; or\n       (C) to terminate a pregnancy after viability where \n     termination is necessary to protect the life or health of the \n     woman; or\n       (2) discriminate against the exercise of the rights set \n     forth in paragraph (1) in the regulation or provision of \n     benefits, facilities, services, or information.\n       (c) Civil Action.--An individual aggrieved by a violation \n     of this section may obtain appropriate relief (including \n     relief against a government) in a civil action.\n\n     SEC. 5. SEVERABILITY.\n\n       If any provision of this Act, or the application of such \n     provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be \n     unconstitutional, the remainder of this Act, or the \n     application of such provision to persons or circumstances \n     other than those as to which the provision is held to be \n     unconstitutional, shall not be affected thereby.\n\n     SEC. 6. RETROACTIVE EFFECT.\n\n       This Act applies to every Federal, State, and local \n     statute, ordinance, regulation, administrative order, \n     decision, policy, practice, or other action enacted, adopted, \n     or implemented before, on, or after the date of enactment of \n     this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Pryor, and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 2594. A bill to amend the Small Business Act to reauthorize the \nloan guarantee program under section 7(a) of that Act, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, every three years, our Committee reviews \nthe majority of the Small Business Administration's (SBA) programs to \nsee what's working, what's broken, and what can be improved. As ranking \nmember of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee currently, \nand a member for more than 20 years, I have worked on many \nreauthorizations. I can tell you that the SBA reauthorization process \nis a great opportunity to examine programs, to work with the small \nbusiness groups and SBA's partners--those who use these programs on a \nday-to-day basis--and the SBA, to ensure that they serve their intended \npurpose and make the dream of a small business a reality to those who \nmight not be eligible for business loans through conventional lending, \ndon't have an MBA but need some management counseling, or need help \ncutting through red tape to get government contracts.\n  Today I am focusing on the SBA's largest small business programs. \nSpecifically, I am introducing legislation to reauthorize the 7(a) Loan \nGuaranty Program for three years. This bill, the ``7(a) Loan Program \nReauthorization Act of 2006,'' authorizes the SBA to back more than a \ncombined $58 billion in 7(a) loans to small businesses, gives borrowers \nmore options when choosing SBA financing, reduces program fees on \nborrowers and lenders if the government charges excess fees or has \nexcess funding, creates an Office of Minority Small Business \nDevelopment within SBA to increase the availability of capital to \nminorities, and creates a National Preferred Lenders program to \nstreamline the application process for exemplary lenders to operate on \na national basis and reach more borrowers.\n  7(a) loans are the most basic and widely used loan of the SBA \nbusiness loan programs. These loans help qualified, small businesses \nobtain financing which is guaranteed for working capital, machinery and \nequipment, furniture and fixtures, land and building (including \npurchase, renovation and new construction), leasehold improvements, and \ndebt refinancing, under special conditions. The loan maturity is up to \n10 years for working capital and generally up to 25 years for fixed \nassets. A key concept of the 7(a) guaranty loan program is that the \nloan actually comes from a commercial lender, not the government.\n  This excellent private/public partnership has made this program one \nof the agency's most popular, with over 400,000 approved loans in the \npast six years. Last year alone, almost 96,000 small businesses \nreceived $15 billion in 7(a) loans, creating or retaining an estimated \n460,000 jobs. To ensure that we continue to have enough authorization \nlevels to manage the increasing demand, my bill reauthorizes the 7(a) \nLoan Program for three additional years at $18,500,000,000 fiscal year \n07, $19,500,000,000 fiscal year 08 and $20,500,000,000 fiscal year 09. \nThese authorization levels ensure that program levels are sufficiently \nhigh to enable the SBA to back the maximum amount of loans as possible \nand avoid credit rationing or shutdowns.\n  Providing appropriate authorization levels to adequately address the \ncapital needs of small businesses is as important as ensuring that \neligible borrowers have access to both fixed asset financing and \nworking capital to address all of their small business needs. \nCurrently, borrowers who need working capital under the 7(a) program \nand fixed asset financing through the 504 loan program are not able to \nutilize both SBA loan guaranty programs to their maximum amount and are \ntherefore forced to choose between the two programs. To prevent a \nsituation where a borrower is forced to choose between getting a much-\nneeded facility or getting working capital, my bill specifies that the \nborrower can have financing under both loan programs at the maximum \nlevel, given they qualify for both programs. In previous years, both \n7(a) and 504 loans were subsidized by appropriated funds to pay losses. \nIt was therefore appropriate to restrict small businesses to choose \nbetween the two programs. However, both of these programs are now self-\nsupporting, and it makes no sense to continue this restriction on \nborrowers.\n  One of our jobs on the Committee is to make sure that SBA-backed \nfinancing remains affordable to the small business community. As I just \nreferenced, the 7(a) program is now self-funding. The Administration \ninsisted on eliminating all funding for the loans, shifting the cost to \nborrowers and lenders, by imposing higher fees on them. The \nadministration spins this as a ``savings'' of $100 million to taxpayers \nwhile the small business community considers this a ``tax.'' In \naddition to this ``tax,'' the President's budget shows that borrowers \nand lenders already pay too much in fees, generating more than $800 \nmillion in overpayments since 1992 because the government routinely \nover-estimates the amount of fees needed to cover the cost\n\n[[Page S3244]]\n\nof the program. This is part of the reason that many of us in Congress, \non both sides of the aisle, opposed eliminating funding for the \nprogram. This legislation seeks to address overpayments by requiring \nthe SBA to lower fees if borrowers and lenders pay more than is \nnecessary to cover the program costs or if the Congress happens to \nappropriate money for the program and combined with fees there is \nexcess funding to cover the cost of the program. The Senate adopted \nthis provision, offered by me and Senator Landrieu last year, to the \nfiscal year 2006 Commerce Justice State Appropriations bill.\n  In this reauthorization process, as I mentioned previously, I think \nit is important to look at specific programs and examine whether or not \nthey are meeting their goals and intended mission. Part of the agency's \nmission is to fill the financing gap left by the private sector. \nAccording to a recent study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and \nBusiness Loan Express, availability of capital remains a priority for \nall small businesses, but for Hispanics and African Americans, it is \none of their top three concerns. They are still more likely to use \ncredit cards to finance their businesses, and they fear denial from \nlenders. Knowing of this need, I was deeply disappointed to see that \nalthough SBA's loan programs have increased lending overall, the \nfigures surrounding the percentage of small business loans going to \nAfrican-Americans, Hispanics, Asian Americans and women have not \nchanged much since 2001. The administration will tell you that SBA has \nbeen ``highly successful'' in making business loans to minority groups \nfacing competitive opportunity challenges. They claim that in fiscal \nyear 2005, almost 30 percent of 7(a) loans and about 25 percent of 504 \nloans were made to minority groups. However, according to the SBA's own \ndata, since 2001, while numbers of 7(a) loans have gone up for African \nAmericans, the dollars have remained at 3 percent of all money loaned. \nIn the 504 program, loans to women have decreased from 19 percent in \nnumber to 15 percent, and dropped from 16 percent to 14 percent in \ndollars. In the Microloan program, African Americans received 28 \npercent of the total number of microloans made in 2001 as compared to \nonly 21 percent of the total number of loans made in 2005. Their \nmicroloan dollars have also decreased from $7.1 million to $5.7 million \nin 2005. Native Americans went from 2 percent of the total number of \nmicroloans made in 2001 to less than one percent--a mere .93 percent--\nin 2005.\n\n  These statistics are of great concern and demonstrate that the SBA \nhas not been highly successful in playing an active role in fostering \nand encouraging robust entrepreneurial activity and small business \nownership amongst these minority groups. The stagnant percentage of \nsmall business loans in these communities represents a failure of this \nAdministration to provide an alternative means of obtaining capital to \nour underserved communities where funding has not been available \nthroughout conventional lending methods.\n  To break this trend and increase the proportion of small business \nloans to minorities, and the percentage of loans to African Americans, \nHispanics, and Asians relative to their share of the population, my \nbill creates an Office of Minority Small Business Development at the \nSBA, similar to offices devoted to business development of veterans and \nwomen and rural areas. In charge of the office will be the Associate \nAdministrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership \nDevelopment with expanded authority and an annual budget to carry out \nits mission.\n  Currently this position is limited to carrying out the policies and \nprograms of SBA's contracting programs required under sections 7(j) and \n8(a) of the Small Business Act. To make sure that minorities are \ngetting a great share of loan dollars, venture capital investments, \ncounseling, and contracting, this bill expands its authority and duties \nto work with and monitor the outcomes for programs under Capital \nAccess, Entrepreneurial Development, and Government Contracting. It \nalso requires the head of the Office to work with SBA's partners, trade \nassociations, and business groups to identify more effective ways to \nmarket to minority business owners, and to work with the head of Field \nOperations to ensure that district offices have staff and resources to \nmarket to minorities. The latter is important because when SBA \nimplemented its extensive workforce transformation plans several years \nago, it eliminated lending-related jobs with a partial justification \nthat remaining staff would be trained to do outreach and marketing to \nthe community. However, district offices are not provided with \nsufficient funds or resources to do the job.\n  In addition to setting sufficient program levels, giving our \nborrowers maximum loan options, reaching the underrepresented, and \nlowering fees to our borrowers, my bill makes great improvements in our \nlender operations. Lenders are key to providing these loans to small \nbusiness borrowers throughout our nation. An exceptional lender in the \n7(a) program will often become a ``preferred lender,'' with the \nauthority to approve, close, service and liquidate loans without the \nlender obtaining the prior specific approval of the agency. SBA \nrequires that lenders request preferred lender status in each of the 70 \ndistricts it desires to operate. There are many problems with this \nsystem, and this bill streamlines and makes uniform the process, an \nadvantage to borrowers, lenders and the SBA.\n  This preferred lender problem is not a new issue. During our last \nreauthorization in 2003, lenders complained that applying for lending \nautonomy in each of the 70 district office and branches is \nadministratively burdensome, both for them and for the Agency staff, \nand that some district offices have taken advantage of the power to \napprove or disapprove lenders when they apply for this special lending \nstatus. I was very disappointed that this issue was not resolved in our \nlast reauthorization. My bill attempts to alleviate this administrative \nburden on lenders and SBA staff who must process the application. My \nbill creates a National Preferred Lenders Program to allow lenders that \nhave already demonstrated proficiency as a preferred lender the \nauthority to operate in any state where it desires to make loans. To \nensure that national preferred lenders are proficient and experienced, \nthis bill requires the Administrator, no later than 60 days after \nenactment, to establish eligibility criteria for national preferred \nlenders but suggests that the criteria established include several \nthings--consideration of whether the lender has experience as a \npreferred lender in not fewer than 5 district offices of the \nAdministration for a minimum of 3 years in each territory, uniform \nwritten policies on the 7(a) loan program, including centralized loan \napproval, servicing, and liquidation functions and processes that are \nsatisfactory to the administration.\n  If a national preferred lender fails to meet the eligibility \nrequirements established by the Administrator, the lender shall be \nnotified of this deficiency and allowed a reasonable time for \ncorrection. Failure to correct the deficiency may result in suspension \nor revocation as a national preferred lender.\n  Last, my legislation directs the SBA to establish a simple and \nstraightforward alternative size standard for business loan applicants \nunder section 7(a), similar to what is already available for borrowers \nin the 504 loan program, which utilizes maximum tangible net worth and \naverage net income as an alternative to the use of industry standards. \nCurrently, in order to be eligible for an SBA business loan, the \nborrower must meet the definition of small businesses. Pursuant to the \nSmall Business Act, SBA has promulgated size standards by industry \nutilizing the North American Industry Classification System. The SBA \ntable based on this system is over 20 pages, single-spaced, which has \nmade this size standard very complicated for lenders to utilize.\n  In closing, I want to commend the community of 7(a) lenders for the \ntens of thousands of borrowers they reach every year, and for working \nwith us to understand how to improve the program to attract more \nlenders and reach more borrowers. I hope that the Committee will act on \nthis bill and other similar reauthorization bills before the current \nlaws governing the 7(a) loan program expire on September 30, 2006. I \nask unanimous consent that my remarks be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S3245]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Pryor):\n  S. 2595. A bill to amend the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to \nmodernize the treatment of development companies; to the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today, as Ranking Democrat on the Committee \non Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I am introducing a \nreauthorization bill for the Small Business Administration's (SBA) 504 \nLoan Guaranty Program. This legislation goes beyond simply \nreauthorizing the 504 loan program. Not only does this bill provide \nadequate authorization levels in the 504 loan program, but it also \ntakes on important oversight and accountability issues pertaining to \nthe operation of Certified Development Companies (CDC). The issues that \nI will present in detail below are well overdue and failure on \nCongress's behalf to deal with them before the end of the fiscal year \nwhen the program expires will shortchange our borrowers, and ultimately \nour communities who reap the benefits of the local economic development \nthat the 504 loan program is intended to provide.\n  For more than 20 years, the 504 loan program has provided long-term \nfinancing for growing businesses with long-term (up to 20 years), \nfixed-rate financing for major fixed assets, such as purchasing land \nand making improvements, including existing buildings, grading, street \nimprovements, utilities, parking lots and landscaping; construction of \nnew facilities, or modernizing, renovating or converting existing \nfacilities; or purchasing long-term machinery and equipment. The 504 \nloan is made through a collaboration between the Certified Development \nCompany (which provides 40 percent of the financing), a private sector \nlender (covering up to 50 percent of the financing) and a contribution \nof at least 10 percent from the small business being helped. This \nprogram is a national leader in federal economic development finance \nprograms and demonstrates it through, creating or retaining over 1.4 \nmillion jobs, backing more than $25 billion in loans, and leveraging \nover $30 billion in private investment.\n  These incredible returns to our community could not be possible \nwithout the solid mission of the program that drives the types of \nprojects and borrowers it serves. This program was not established to \nsimply make loans--it was established to promote local economic \ndevelopment and to create jobs. I cannot think of another federal \neconomic development program that has created over 605,000 jobs, as the \n504 program has done. Last year alone, the 504 program created over \n145,000 jobs. As the demand for 504 loans continues to grow, it is more \nimportant than ever to reaffirm the mission of the 504 program and to \nensure that the 504 program is reauthorized at adequate levels to meet \nthis growth.\n  To address this issue, my bill reauthorizes the 504 Loan Program for \nthree additional years at $8,500,000,000, fiscal year 07, \n$9,500,000,000 fiscal year 08, and $10,500,000,000, fiscal year 09. \nThese levels are based on the current pace of program growth to ensure \nthat there is more than adequate authorization. The fiscal year 06 504 \ndemand is projected to exceed $7 billion, and the last 3 years have \nshown growth rates of 28 percent, 26 percent, and 26 percent. A low \nauthorization level would either force the SBA to shut down the program \nor to ration credit throughout the year to avoid a shut-down.\n  As I mentioned previously, this bill goes beyond simply reauthorizing \nthe 504 loan program for an additional three years. It makes some much-\nneeded changes to the structure of our CDCs, which are responsible for \nthe delivery of this program and which are essential to the success of \nthe 504 loan program.\n  Year after year, I have heard about the dangers that structural \nchanges pose to the CDC industry and the 504 loan program in \nmaintaining the mission of economic development. One of the major \nchanges experienced by CDCs includes the centralization of all 504 loan \nprocessing, loan servicing and liquidation functions from 70 SBA \ndistrict offices to one or two centers in the country. This has \nresulted in a huge backlog, estimated at 900 loans waiting to be \nliquidated. This backlog results in a loss of revenue through delaying \nor completely writing off defaulted loans. This has the potential to \ndrive up subsidy costs of the program and therefore fees on borrowers, \nCDCs and lenders. This bill puts forward a solution to this issue by \ndecentralizing liquidation functions and allowing CDCs, if they choose, \nto foreclose and liquidate defaulted loans or to contract with a \nqualified third-party to perform foreclosure and liquidation of \ndefaulted loans in its portfolio. However, CDCs are not required to \nliquidate until SBA has come up with a program to compensate and \nreimburse them for all expenses pertaining to foreclosure and \nliquidation. The expenses would be approved in advance by the \nAdministrator or on an emergency basis.\n  The biggest structural change that has had a tremendous impact on our \nnot-for-profit CDCs is the ability to expand operations into multiple \nstates. This structural change, in conjunction with the growing demand \nfor 504 loans and CDC operations in providing these loans to small \nbusinesses, requires Congress to set a statutory course that preserves \nthe local economic development intent and mission of the program \nthrough accountability measures. The 504 program was not created for \nCDCs to expand operations and simply create revenue from one state to \nanother. CDCs are more than lenders and should not act like for-profit \nbanks. My bill ensures that local communities continue to be the main \nfocus of CDCs by requiring that the 25 members of their board and board \nof directors be residents of the area of operations. In addition, CDCs \nwill be required to annually submit to the SBA a report on the use of \nall excess funds and local economic development activities in each \nstate of operation. This ensures that the members engage, invest, and \nare held accountable to the communities they serve.\n  In addition to preserving and growing the 504 loan program, I think \nit is very important to ensure that low-income communities have access \nto 504 loans. As you may know, in 2000 Congress enacted the New Markets \nTax Credit program to facilitate private sector investment in low-\nincome communities.\n  Theoretically, the program was designed to encourage private \ninvestors who may never have considered investing in low-income \ncommunities to do so, thereby attracting new sources of private capital \nfor a variety of projects, including retail, childcare and primary \nhealthcare centers, which in turn attracts jobs, services and \nadditional opportunities to areas that have historically had a \ndifficult time sustaining economic development. My bill creates a new \npublic policy goal for the ``expansion of businesses in low-income \ncommunities'' and defines low-income areas as those areas which would \nbe eligible for new market tax credits. Under public policy goals, a \nborrower can get a higher loan than the standard limit of $1.5 million. \nFor example, a borrower could receive a 504 loan of up to $2 million if \nthe proceeds will be directed toward this new public policy goal, or \nany of the currently established eight public policy goals. It is my \nhope that this incentive will increase the number of 504 loans in low-\nincome communities and therefore build wealth, economic security, and \nemployment opportunities which benefit the entire surrounding \ncommunity.\n  I want to thank Senator Pryor for his sponsorship of this \nlegislation, and thank the many members of the 504 community for \nworking with us to identify ways to make this program better than ever. \nI look forward to working with them to enact this legislation before \nthe fiscal year expires on September 30, 2006, and ask unanimous \nconsent that my statement be included in the Record.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S.J. Res. 33. A joint resolution to provide for a strategy for \nsuccessfully empowering a new unity government in Iraq; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, 39 years ago this week Dr. Martin Luther \nKing gave a speech at the Riverside Church in New York about the war in \nVietnam. He began with these words:\n\n       I come to this magnificent house of worship tonight because \n     my conscience leaves me no other choice.\n\n  His message was clear. Despite the difficulty of opposing the \ngovernment's policy during time of war, he said, ``We must speak with \nall the humility that is appropriate to our limited vision, but we must \nspeak.''\n\n[[Page S3246]]\n\n  I am here today to speak about Iraq. There should be humility enough \nto go around for a Congress that shares responsibility for this war. I \nbelieve the time has come again when, as Dr. King said, we must move \npast indecision to action.\n  I have many times visited the Vietnam Memorial Wall, as many Vietnam \nveterans have. When you walk down the path of either side of that wall, \neast and west of the panels, you walk down to the center of the wall \nwhere it comes together in a V. That V represents both the beginning of \nthe war and the end of the war because the names start at that V and go \nall the way up one end, east, and then they come back from the west.\n  I remember standing there once after reading ``A Bright Shining \nLie,'' by Neil Sheehan, Robert McNamara's memoirs, and many other \nhistories of that war. One cannot help but feel the enormity of the \nloss, of the immorality that our leaders knew that the strategy was \nwrong and that almost half the names were added to that wall after the \ntime that people knew our strategy would not work. It was immoral then \nand it would be immoral now to engage in the same delusion with respect \nto our policy in Iraq.\n  Obviously, every single one of us would prefer to see democracy in \nIraq. We want democracy in the whole Middle East. The simple reality \nis, Iraqis must want it as much as we do, and Iraqis must embrace it. \nIf the Iraqi leadership is not ready to make the changes and the \ncompromises that democracy requires, our soldiers, no matter how \nvaliant--and they have been valiant--can't get from a humvee or a \nhelicopter.\n  The fact is, our soldiers have done a stunning job. I was recently in \nIraq with Senator Warner and Senator Stevens. I have been there \npreviously. No one can travel there and talk to our soldiers and not be \nimpressed by their commitment to the mission, by their sacrifice, by \ntheir desire to have something good come out of this, and by the \nremarkable contribution they have made to give Iraqis the opportunity \nto create a democratic future for their country. Our soldiers have done \ntheir job. It is time for the newly elected Iraqi leadership to do \ntheirs. It is time for America's political leaders to do theirs.\n  President Bush says we can't lose our nerve in Iraq. It takes more \nnerve to respond to mistakes and to adjust a policy that is going wrong \nthan it does to stubbornly continue down the wrong path.\n  Last week, Secretary Rice acknowledged ``thousands'' of mistakes in \nIraq. Amazingly, nobody has been held accountable for those mistakes. \nBut our troops have paid the price, and our troops pay the price every \nsingle day. Yet the President continues to insist on a vague and \ncounterproductive strategy that will keep U.S. forces in Iraq \nindefinitely.\n  I accept my share of responsibility for the war in Iraq. As I said in \n2004, knowing what we know now, I would not have gone to war, and I \ncertainly wouldn't have done it the way the President did. My \nfrustration is that many of us all along the way have offered \nalternatives to the President. Countless numbers of Senators, \nRepublican and Democrat alike, have publicly offered alternative ways \nof trying to achieve our goals in Iraq.\n  I have listened to my colleagues, Senator Feingold, Senator Biden, \nSenator Hagel, the Presiding Officer, and others all talk about ways in \nwhich we could do better. But all of these, almost all of them without \nexception, have been left by the wayside without any real discussion, \nwithout any real dialog, without any real effort to see if we could \nfind a common ground. My frustration is that we keep offering \nalternatives.\n  In 2003, in 2004, 2005, 2006, year after year, we put them on the \ntable, but they get ignored and then we get further in the hole, the \nsituation gets worse, and we are left responding, trying to come back \nto a worse situation than the one we were responding to in the first \nplace. And we keep putting out possibilities, and the possibilities \nkeep being left on the sidelines.\n  Time after time, this administration has ignored the best advice of \nthe best experts of the country, whether they be our military experts \nor former civilian leaders of other administrations or our most \nexperienced voices on the Committee on Armed Services and Foreign \nRelations Committee of the U.S. House and Senate.\n\n  The administration is fond of saying that we shouldn't look back, \nthat recrimination only helps our enemies, that we have to deal with \nthe situation on the ground now. Well, we do have to deal with the \nsituation on the ground now, but we have to deal with it in a way that \nhonors the suggestions and ideas of a lot of other people who have \nconcerns about our forces on the ground and our families at home and \nour budget and our reputation in the world and our need to respond to \nAfghanistan, North Korea, and Iran.\n  Frankly, accountability and learning from past mistakes is the only \nway to improve both policies and institutions. Let me, for the moment, \ngo along with this idea, the administration's idea. Let me focus on the \nhere and now and let's face that reality honestly and let's act \naccordingly.\n  You have to live in a fantasy world to believe we are on the brink of \ndomestic peace and a pluralistic democracy in Iraq. One has to be blind \nto the facts to argue that the prospects for success are so great they \noutweigh the terrible costs of the President's approach. And you have \nto be incapable of admitting failure not to be able to face up to the \nneed to change course now. Yes, change course now.\n  Our soldiers on the ground have learned a lot of terrible lessons in \nIraq. All you have to do is talk to some of the soldiers who have \nreturned, as many of us have. It is time those of us responsible for \nthe policies of our country learn those lessons. It is clear the \nadministration's litany of mistakes has reduced what we can reasonably \nhope to accomplish. Any reasonable, honest observer--and there are many \nin the Senate who have gone over to Iraq and have come back with these \nviews--knows that the entire definition of this mission has changed and \nthe expectations of what we can get out of this mission have changed.\n  I, for one, will not sit idly by and watch while American soldiers \ngive their lives for a policy that is not working. Let me say it \nplainly. Withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq over the course of the year \nin a timely schedule is actually necessary to give democracy the best \nchance to succeed, and it is vital to America's national security \ninterests.\n  Five months ago, I went to Georgetown University. I gave a speech \nwhere I said that we were then entering the make-or-break period, a \nmake-or-break 5-month, 6-month period in Iraq. I said the President \nmust change course and hold Iraqis accountable or Congress should \ninsist on a change in policy. And I set a goal then, back in November, \nthat we should try to reduce American combat forces and withdraw them \nby the end of this year.\n  The situation on the ground has now changed for the worse since then. \nIn fact, we are now in the third war in Iraq in as many years. The \nfirst war was against Saddam Hussein and his alleged weapons of mass \ndestruction. The second war was against Jihadist terrorists whom the \nadministration said it was better to fight over there than over here. \nAnd now we find our troops in the middle of a low-grade civil war that \ncould explode into a full civil war at any time.\n  While the events in Iraq have changed for the worse, the President \nhas not changed course for the better. It is time for those of us in \nCongress who share responsibilities constitutionally for our policy to \nstand up and change that course. We have a constitutional \nresponsibility, and we have a moral responsibility not to sit on the \nsidelines while young Americans are in harm's way.\n  That is why today I am introducing legislation that will hold the \nIraqis accountable and make the goal of withdrawing the most American \nforces a reality. I personally believe that most of those forces could \nbe and should be out of Iraq by the end of the year. This war, in the \nwords of our own generals, cannot be won militarily. It can only be won \npolitically.\n  General Casey said, of our large military presence, it ``feeds the \nnotion of occupation'' and it ``extends the amount of time that it will \ntake for Iraqi security forces to become self-reliant.''\n  That is General Casey saying that the large force of American \npresence in\n\n[[Page S3247]]\n\nIraq contributes to the occupation and extends the amount of time. \nZbigniew Brzezinski put it:\n\n       The U.S. umbrella, which is in effect designed to stifle \n     these wars but it is so poor that it perpetuates them, in a \n     sense keeps these wars alive . . . and [is] probably \n     unintentionally actually intensifying them.\n\n  Richard Nixon's Secretary of Defense, Melvin Laird, breaking a 30-\nyear silence, summed it up simply:\n\n       Our presence is what feeds the insurgency.\n\n  The bottom line is that as long as American forces remain in large \nnumbers, enforcing the status quo, Americans will be killed and maimed \nin a crossfire of vicious conflict that they are powerless to end. We \npay for the President's reluctance to face reality in both American \ndollars and in too many lives. American families pay in the loss of \nlimb and the loss of loved ones.\n  I don't think we should tolerate what is happening in Iraq today. We \ncan no longer tolerate the political games currently being played by \nIraqi politicians in a war-torn Baghdad. No American soldier, not one \nAmerican soldier, should be sacrificed for the unwillingness of Iraqi \npoliticians to compromise and form a unity government.\n  We are now almost 5 months since the election. What is happening is \nthe daily game being played by Iraqis who listen to the President say \nwe will be here to the end. There is no sense of urgency, there is no \nsense of impending need to make a decision. The result is they just go \non bickering and they go on playing for advantage while our troops \ndrive by the next IED and the next soldier returns to Walter Reed or to \nBethesda without arms and limbs.\n  Given the recent increase in deadly sectarian strife, Iraq urgently \nneeds a strong unity government to prevent a full-fledged civil war \nfrom breaking out and becoming the failed state that all of us have \nwanted to avoid. I believe the current situation is actually allowing \nthem to go down the road toward that sectarian strife rather than \nstopping them.\n  Thus far, step by step, Iraqis have only responded to deadlines. It \ntook a deadline to transfer authority to the provisional government. It \ntook a deadline for the first election to take place. It took a \ndeadline for the referendum on the Constitution. It took a deadline for \nthe most recent election. It is time for another deadline, and that \ndeadline is to say to them that they have to come together and pull \ntogether and put together a government or our troops are going to \nwithdraw. And under circumstances over a period of time, we will \nwithdraw in order to put Iraq up on its own two feet.\n  Iraqi politicians should be told in unmistakable language: You have \nuntil May 15 to put together an effective unity government or we will \nimmediately withdraw our military.\n  I know some colleagues and other people listening will say: Wait a \nminute. You mean we are going to automatically withdraw our military if \nthey don't pull it together?\n  The answer is: You bet we ought to do that. Because there isn't one \nAmerican soldier who ought to be giving up life or limb for the \nprocrastination and unwillingness of Iraqis who have been given an \nextraordinary opportunity by those soldiers to take hold of democracy \nand who are ignoring it and playing for advantage. We all know that \nafter the last elections, the momentum was lost by squabbling interim \nleaders. Everybody sat around and said, coming up to this election, the \none thing we can't do is allow the momentum to be lost. Guess what. It \nhas been lost. It has been squandered, again. We are sitting there with \noccasional visits, occasional speeches but without the kind of \nsustained diplomacy necessary to provide a resolution. It has gone on \nfor too long, again.\n  If Iraqis aren't willing to build a unity government in 5 months, \nthen how long does it take and what does it take? If they are not \nwilling to do it, they are not willing to do it. It is that simple. The \ncivil war will only get worse. And if they are not willing to do it, it \nis because there is such a fundamental intransigence that we haven't \nbroken, that civil war, in fact, becomes inevitable, and our troops \nwill be forced to leave anyway.\n  The fact is, we have no choice but to get tough and to ratchet up the \npressure. We should immediately accelerate the redeployment of American \nforces to rear guard, garrisoned status for security backup, training, \nand emergency response. Special operations against al-Qaida in Iraq \nshould be initiated on hard intelligence leads only.\n  If the Iraqi leaders finally do their job, which I believe you have a \nbetter chance of getting them to do if you give them a timetable, then \nwe have to agree on a schedule for leaving, withdrawing American combat \nforces by the end of the year. The only troops that remain should be \nthose critical to finishing the job of standing up Iraqi security \nforces.\n  Such an agreement will have positive benefits in Iraq. It will \nempower and legitimize the new leadership and the Iraqi people. It will \nexpedite the process of getting the Iraqis to assume a larger role of \nrunning their own country. And it will undermine support for the \ninsurgency among the now 80 percent of Iraqis who want U.S. troops to \nleave. In short, it will give the new Iraqi Government the best chance \nto succeed in holding the country together while democratic \ninstitutions can evolve.\n  This deadline makes sense when you look at the responsibilities that \nIraqis should have assumed by then. Formation of a unity government \nwould constitute a major milestone in the transfer of political \nresponsibility to the Iraqis. Even the President has said that \nresponsibility for security in the majority of the country should be \nable to be transferred to the Iraqis by this time. If the President \nbelieves that it should be able to be transferred to the Iraqis by this \ntime, why not push that eventuality and make it a reality? By the end \nof the year, our troops will have done as much as they possibly can to \ngive Iraqis the chance to build a democracy. I again remind my \ncolleagues, we are still going to have the ability to have over-the-\nhorizon response for emergency, as well as over-the-horizon response to \nal-Qaida. And we will have the ability to continue to train those last \nforces to make sure they are in a position to stand up for Iraq.\n  The key to this transition is a long overdue engagement in serious \nand sustained diplomacy. I want to say a word about this. I am not \noffering this plan in a vacuum. Critical to the achievement of all of \nour goals in Iraq is real diplomacy. Starting with the leadup to the \nwar, our diplomatic efforts in Iraq have ranged from the indifferent to \nthe indefensible. History shows that effective diplomacy requires \npersistent hands-on engagement from the highest levels of America's \nleadership. Top officials in the first Bush administration worked \ndirectly and tirelessly to put together a real coalition before the \nfirst Gulf War, and President Clinton himself took personal \nresponsibility at Camp David for bringing the Israelis and Palestinians \ntogether and leading the comprehensive effort to resolve the conflict \nin the Middle East. This type of major diplomatic initiative has proven \nsuccessful in many places in American history.\n\n  Most recently, in 1995, there was a brutal civil war in Bosnia \ninvolving Serbs, Croats, and Muslims. Faced with a seemingly \nintractable stalemate in the midst of horrific ethnic cleansing, the \nClinton administration took action--direct, personal, engaged action. \nLed by Richard Holbrooke, they brought leaders of the Bosnian parties \ntogether in Dayton, OH, with representatives from the European Union, \nRussia, and Britain to hammer out a peace agreement. NATO and the \nUnited Nations were given a prominent role in implementing what became \nknown as the Dayton Accords.\n  In contrast, this President Bush has done little more than deliver \npolitical speeches, while his cronies in the White House and outside \nblame the news media for the mess the administration has created in \nIraq. We keep hearing: They are not telling the full story. They are \nnot telling the story.\n  Secretary of State Rice's brief surprise visit to Iraq a few days ago \npales in comparison to the real shuttle diplomacy that was practiced by \npredecessors such as James Baker and Henry Kissinger. Given what is at \nstake, it is long since time to engage in that. I can remember Henry \nKissinger going from one capital to the next capital, back and forth, \nengaged, pulling people together. Jim Baker did the same thing.\n\n[[Page S3248]]\n\nThere was a genuine and real effort to leverage the full prestige and \nfull power of the United States behind a goal. That is absent here.\n  Ambassador Khalilzad is a good man, and he has done a terrific job, \nalmost by himself, left almost to his own devices. That is not the way \nto succeed. Given what is at stake, it is past time to engage in \ndiplomacy that matches the effort of our soldiers on the ground. We \nshould immediately bring the leaders of the Iraqi factions together at \na Dayton-like summit that includes our allies, Iraq's neighbors, \nmembers of the Arab League, and the United Nations. The fact is, a true \nnational compact is needed to bring about a political solution to the \ninsurgency. That is how you end the sectarian violence. Our soldiers \ngoing on patrol in a striker or a humvee, walking through communities \nwill not end this violence. Our generals have told us, it can only be \nended politically. Yet where is the kind of political effort that our \nNation has seen in history now, trying to effect what our soldiers have \ncreated an opportunity to effect through their sacrifice?\n  Iraqis have to reach a comprehensive agreement that includes security \nguarantees, disbanding the militias, and ultimately, though not \nnecessarily at this conference, confronting some of the questions of \nthe Constitution. All of the parties must reach agreement on a process \nfor reviving reconstruction efforts and securing Iraq's borders. Our \ntroops cannot be left hanging out there without that kind of effort to \nprotect them.\n  At this summit, Shiite religious leaders must agree to rein in their \nmilitias and to commit to disbanding them. They also have to work with \nIraqi political leaders to ensure that the leadership of the Interior \nMinistry and the police force under its control is nonsectarian. Shiite \nand Kurdish leaders must make concessions necessary to address Sunni \nconcerns about federalism and equitable distribution of oil revenues. \nThere is no way the Sunnis are going to suddenly disband or stop the \ninsurgency without some kind of adequate guarantee of their security \nand their participation in the process. That was obvious months ago. It \nis even more obvious today. It still remains an open question.\n  The Sunnis have to accept the reality that they will no longer \ndominate Iraq. Until a sufficient compromise is hammered out, a Sunni \nbase cannot be created that isolates the hard-core Baathists and \njihadists and defuses the insurgency itself. We must work with Iraqis \nat the summit to convince Iraq's neighbors that they can no longer \nstand on the sidelines while Iraq teeters on the edge of a civil war \nthat could bring chaos to the entire region. Where they can help the \nprocess of forming a government, they need to step up. And for my \ncolleagues who suggest that somehow withdrawing American forces will \nput that region at greater risk, I say ``no.'' I say that an over-the-\nhorizon deployment, a deployment in Kuwait and elsewhere, diffusing the \ninsurgency, and an adequate effort to diplomatically pull together this \nkind of summit is the only way to diffuse the insurgency and ultimately \nstrengthen the region.\n  The administration must also work with Iraqi leaders in seeking a \nmultinational force to help protect Iraq's borders until finally a \nnational army of Iraq has developed the capacity to do that itself. \nFrankly, such a force, if sanctioned by the United Nations Security \nCouncil, could attract participation by Iraq's neighbors, countries \nsuch as India and others, that would be a critical step in stemming the \ntide of insurgents and of encouraging capital to flow into Iraq.\n  To be credible with the Iraqi people, the new government must deliver \ngoods and services at all levels. It is absolutely stunning--I don't \nknow how many Americans are even aware of the fact--that today, several \nyears later, electricity production is below where it was before the \nwar. It is at 4,000 megawatts compared to the 4,500 before the war. \nCrude oil production has declined from a prewar level of 2.5 million \nbarrels per day to 1.9 million barrels per day. We were told that oil \nwas going to pay for this war. That has to change. Countries that have \npromised money for reconstruction, particularly of Sunni areas, haven't \npaid up yet. The money is not on the table.\n  We can also do our part on the ground. Our own early reconstruction \nefforts were--now known to everybody--poorly planned and grossly \nmismanaged. But as I saw on a recent trip to Iraq, the efforts of our \ncivilian military provisional reconstruction teams, which have the \nskills and capacity to strengthen governance and institution building \naround the country, are beginning to take hold. We need to stand up \nmore of those teams as fast as possible. If we do that in the same \ncontext as we find the political resolution, then you have a chance.\n  We must also continue to turn the job of policing the streets and \nproviding security over to Iraqi forces. That means giving our generals \nthe tools they need to finish training an Iraqi police force that is \ntrusted and respected on the street by the end of the year. It also \nmeans finishing the training of Iraqi security forces with U.S. troops \nacting only on the basis of hard intelligence to combat terrorist \nthreats.\n  The withdrawal of American forces from Iraq is necessary not only to \ngive democracy in Iraq the best chance to succeed, it is also vital to \nour own national security interests.\n  We need to pay more attention to our own vital national security \ninterests. We will never be as safe as we ought to be if Iraq continues \nto distract us from the most important war we need to win--the war on \nOsama bin Laden, al-Qaida, and the terrorists who are resurfacing even \nin Afghanistan.\n  To make it clear, despite everything this administration has said, \ntoday, al-Qaida, and the Taliban, even, are more dangerous in northwest \nPakistan and northeast Afghanistan than Iraq is to us at this moment in \ntime. There is a greater threat from al-Qaida, which has dispersed \ncells and through its training and abilities to organize, in \nAfghanistan than in the place that is consuming most of America's \nforces and money.\n  The way to defeat al-Qaida is not by serving as their best \nrecruitment tool. Even Brent Scowcroft, George H. W. Bush's National \nSecurity Adviser, has joined the many experts who agree that the war in \nIraq actually feeds terrorism and increases the potential for terrorist \nattacks against the United States. The results speak for themselves: \nThe number of significant terrorist attacks around the world increased \nfrom 175 in 2003 to 651 in 2004, and it has continued to increase in \n2005.\n  The President keeps talking about al-Qaida's intent to take over \nIraq. I have not met anybody in Iraq--none of the leaders on either \nside, not Kurds, the Shia, or Sunni--who believes a few thousand, at \nmost--and by many estimates, less than a thousand--foreign jihadists \nare a genuine threat to forcibly take over a country of 25 million \npeople. And while mistake after mistake by this administration has \nactually turned Iraq into the breeding ground for al-Qaida that it was \nnot before the war, large numbers of United States troops are not the \nkey to crushing these terrorists.\n  In fact, Iraqis have begun to make clear their own unwillingness to \ntolerate foreign jihadists. Every Iraqi I talked to said to me: When we \nget control and start moving forward, we will deal with the jihadists. \nThey don't want them on Iraqi soil, and they have increasingly turned \non these brutal foreign killers who are trying to foment a civil war \namong Iraqis. This process will only be complete when Iraqis have taken \nfull responsibility for their own future, and resistance to a perceived \noccupation no longer provides them any common cause with jihadists.\n  As General Anthony Zinni said on Sunday, building up intelligence-\ngathering capability from Iraqis is essential to defeating the \ninsurgency. He said:\n\n       We're not fighting the Waffen S.S. here. They can be \n     policed up if the people turn against them. We haven't won \n     the hearts and minds yet.\n\n  Once again, I remind my colleagues, the hearts and minds of the \nIraqis will be more susceptible to being won when American forces are \nnot there in the way they are now, in a way that can be used as the \nrecruitment tool that it has been, when 80 percent of the Iraqi people \nsuggest that American forces ought to leave.\n  After the bulk of U.S. forces have been withdrawn, I believe it is \nessential to keep a rapid reaction force over the horizon. That force \ncan be over the horizon within the desert itself, or it can\n\n[[Page S3249]]\n\nbe in Kuwait, and that can be used to act against terrorist enclaves. \nOur air power--the air power we used to police two-thirds of the no-fly \nzone in Iraq before the war--will always ensure our ability to bring \noverwhelming force to bear to protect the U.S. interests in the region. \nThe bottom line is that working together with Iraqis from inside and \noutside Iraq, we can prosecute the war against al-Qaida in Iraq more \neffectively than we are today.\n  Withdrawing U.S. troops will also enable us to more effectively \ncombat threats around the world. But winning the war on terror requires \nmore than the killing we have seen from 3 years of combat. The fact is \nthat just taking out terrorists, as our troops have been doing, is not \ngoing to end the flow of terrorists who are recruited, for all of the \nreasons that we understand. The cooperation critical to lasting victory \nin the region is going to be enhanced when Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo, \ncivil chaos, and mistake after mistake in Iraq no longer deplete \nAmerica's moral authority within the region.\n  This is also key to allowing us to repair the damage that flag \nofficers fear has been done to our Armed Forces. I know my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle--members of the Armed Services Committee \nand Intelligence Committee--have heard from flag officers in private \nabout what is happening to the Armed Forces of our country. We know it \nwill take billions of dollars to reset the equipment that has been \nlost, damaged, or worn out from 3 years of combat. In the National \nGuard alone, units across the country have only 34 percent of their \nauthorized equipment, including just 14 percent of the chemical \ndecontamination equipment they need. That is a chilling prospect if \nthey are ever asked to respond to a terrorist incident \ninvolving weapons of mass destruction.\n\n  The fact is the Army is stretched too thin. Soldiers and brigades are \nbeing deployed more frequently and longer than the Army believes is \nbest in order to continue to attract the best recruits. Recruiting \nstandards have been changed and recruitment is suffering. The Army fell \n6,700 recruits short of their needs in 2005--the largest shortfall \nsince 1979. Recruitment is suffering today. Not only are American \ntroops not getting leadership equal to their sacrifice on the civilian \nside, but our generals are not getting enough troops to accomplish \ntheir mission of keeping the country safe.\n  The fact is that in the specialties--special forces, translators, \nintelligence officers, for the Marines, for the Army, for the National \nGuard--our recruitments are below the levels they ought to be.\n  Withdrawing from Iraq will also enable us to strengthen our efforts \nto prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Iran, the \nworld's leading state sponsor of terrorism, is absolutely delighted \nwith our presence in Iraq. Why? Because it advances their goals, \nkeeping us otherwise occupied, and it allows them to make mischief in \nIraq itself at their choice. Their President is so emboldened that he \nhas openly called for the destruction of Israel, while defying the \ninternational community's demands to stop developing its nuclear \nweapons capability. Could that have happened prior to our being bogged \ndown the way we are?\n  North Korea has felt at liberty to ignore the six-party talks, while \nit continues to stockpile more nuclear weapons material.\n  Any effort to be stronger in dealing with the nuclear threat from \nIran and North Korea is incomplete without an exit from Iraq. It will \nalso enable us to more effectively promote democracy in places such as \nRussia, which is more than content to see us bogged down while \nPresident Putin steadily rolls back democratic reforms.\n  China benefits from us throwing hundreds of billions of dollars into \nIraq instead of into economic competition and job creation here at \nhome. Our long-term security requires putting the necessary resources \ninto building our economy and a workforce that can compete and win in \nthe age of globalization. We cannot do as much as we need to--not \nnearly as much as we need to--while the war in Iraq is draining our \ntreasury.\n  Finally, we have not provided anywhere near the resources necessary \nto keep our homeland safe. Katrina showed us in the most graphic way \npossible that 5 years after 9/11, we are woefully unprepared to handle \na natural disaster that we know is coming a week in advance, let alone \na catastrophic terrorist attack we have no notice of. Removing the \nfinancial strain of Iraq will free up funds for America's homeland \ndefense.\n  The time has come for the administration to acknowledge the realities \nthat the American people are increasingly coming to understand--the \nrealities in Iraq and the requirements of America's national security. \nStop telling us that terrible things will happen if we get tough with \nthe Iraqis, when terrible things happen every single day because we are \nnot tough enough. If we don't change course and hold the Iraqis \naccountable now, I guarantee you it will get worse.\n  Ignoring all of the warnings, and ignoring history itself, in a \nflourish of ideological excess, this administration has managed to make \nthe ancient cradle of civilization look a lot like Vietnam. But there \nis a path forward if we start making the right decisions.\n  As Dr. King said so many years ago:\n\n       The choice is ours, and though we might prefer it \n     otherwise, we must choose in this crucial moment of human \n     history.\n\n  Now is the moment of choice for Iraq, for America, and for this \nCongress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/06/senate-section/article/S3249-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 434--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF MAY 22, 2006, AS \n           ``NATIONAL CORPORATE COMPLIANCE AND ETHICS WEEK.''\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

and\n       (2) on December 14, 2005, when on Iranian television, he \n     remarked that ``They have invented a myth that Jews were \n     massacred and place this above God, religions and the \n     prophets'';\n       Whereas it is a crime in the Federal Republic of Germany to \n     deny the existence of the Holocaust;\n       Whereas on June 9, 2006, the Federation Internationale de \n     Football Association (referred to in this preamble as \n     ``FIFA'') World Cup soccer tournament is scheduled to begin \n     in the Federal Republic of Germany;\n       Whereas the Islamic Republic of Iran is a member of FIFA, \n     and the Iranian national team is scheduled to play its \n     opening match on June 11, 2006, in Nuremberg, Germany, which \n     was the site of war crimes tribunals that tried Nazi leaders \n     for atrocities and genocide against Jews during the \n     Holocaust;\n       Whereas the International Olympic Committee barred the \n     Republic of South Africa from the Olympics until 1992, when \n     the country repealed all of its apartheid laws during the \n     previous year;\n       Whereas, in October 1964, FIFA suspended the national \n     soccer team of South Africa from international competition \n     until the Government of South Africa ended its policy of \n     apartheid in 1991;\n       Whereas, on May 30, 1992, in a resolution imposing \n     diplomatic and economic sanctions on Yugoslavia, the United \n     Nations Security Council called on member states of the \n     United Nations to ``take the necessary steps to prevent the \n     participation in sporting events on their territory of \n     persons or groups representing Yugoslavia.'';\n       Whereas, in 1992, the Union of European Football \n     Associations banned Yugoslavia from participating in the \n     European soccer championships and prevented it from \n     participating in the 1994 World Cup qualifying matches; and\n       Whereas Article 3 of the ``Regulations Governing the \n     Application of the FIFA Statutes'' states that \n     ``Discrimination of any kind against a country, private \n     person or groups of people on account of ethnic origin, \n     gender, language, religion, politics or any other reason is \n     strictly prohibited and punishable by suspension or \n     expulsion.'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the terrible statements issued by the Iranian \n     president and demands that he repudiate them;\n       (2) calls on the United Nations Security Council and all \n     countries to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons;\n       (3) strongly urges the Federation Internationale de \n     Football Association (referred to in this resolution as \n     ``FIFA'') to ban persons or groups representing the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran from sanctioned international sporting \n     competition, including the 2006 FIFA World Cup, until such \n     time that Iran--\n       (A) rescinds its position disavowing the Holocaust;\n       (B) repudiates its calls for the eradication of the State \n     of Israel;\n       (C) ends its support for terrorism; and\n       (D) ceases its pursuit of nuclear weapons; and\n       (4) calls on all FIFA members to support such actions \n     within the appropriate FIFA governing bodies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/06/senate-section/article/S3250-2", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3250-S3251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 437--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF THE YEAR OF \n                               THE MUSEUM\n\n  Mr. ENZI (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \nColeman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Lautenberg, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. \nAkaka, Mr. Isakson, and Mr. Dodd) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 437\n\n       Whereas museums are institutions of public service and \n     education that foster exploration, study, observation, \n     critical thinking, contemplation, and dialogue to advance a \n     greater public knowledge, understanding, and appreciation of \n     history, science, the arts, and the natural world;\n       Whereas, according to survey data, the people of the United \n     States view museums as one of the most important resources \n     for educating children;\n       Whereas museums have a long-standing tradition of inspiring \n     curiosity in schoolchildren that is a result of investments \n     of\n\n[[Page S3251]]\n\n     more than $1,000,000,000 and more than 18,000,000 \n     instructional hours annually for elementary and secondary \n     education programs in communities across the United States, \n     creative partnerships with schools, professional development \n     for teachers, traveling exhibits to local schools, \n     digitization of materials for access nationwide, creation of \n     electronic and printed educational materials that use local \n     and State curriculum standards, and the hosting of \n     interactive school field trips;\n       Whereas museums serve as community landmarks that \n     contribute to the livability and economic vitality of \n     communities through expanding tourism;\n       Whereas museums rank in the top 3 family vacation \n     destinations, revitalize downtowns (often with signature \n     buildings), attract relocating businesses by enhancing \n     quality of life, provide shared community experiences and \n     meeting places, and serve as a repository and resource for \n     each community's unique history, culture, achievements, and \n     values;\n       Whereas there are more than 16,000 museums in the United \n     States and admission is free at more than half of these \n     museums;\n       Whereas approximately 865,000,000 people visit museums \n     annually and these people come from all ages, groups, and \n     backgrounds;\n       Whereas research indicates Americans view museums as one of \n     the most trustworthy sources of objective information and \n     believe that authentic artifacts in history museums and \n     historic sites are second only to their families in \n     significance in creating a strong connection with the past;\n       Whereas museums enhance the public's ability to engage as \n     citizens, through developing a deeper sense of identity and a \n     broader judgment about the world, and by holding more than \n     750,000,000 objects and living specimens in the public trust \n     to preserve and protect the cultural and natural heritage of \n     the United States for current and future generations;\n       Whereas museums are increasingly entering into new \n     partnerships with community educational institutions that \n     include schools, universities, libraries, public \n     broadcasting, and 21st Century Community Learning Centers, \n     and these partnerships reach across community boundaries to \n     provide broader impact and synergy for their community \n     educational programs;\n       Whereas supporting the goals and ideals of the Year of the \n     Museum would give Americans the opportunity to celebrate the \n     contributions museums have made to American culture and life \n     over the past 100 years; and\n       Whereas in 2006, museums of the United States are \n     celebrating 100 years of collective contribution to our \n     communities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate supports the goals and ideals of \n     the Year of the Museum.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/06/senate-section/article/S3251-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3251-S3253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3427.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING REIMBURSING STATES \n                   FOR THE COSTS OF UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) It is the obligation of the Federal Government to \n     adequately secure the borders of the United States and \n     prevent the flow of undocumented immigrants into the United \n     States.\n       (2) Despite the fact that, according to the Congressional \n     Research Service, Border Patrol agents apprehend more than \n     1,000,000 individuals each year trying to illegally enter the \n     United States, the net growth in the number of unauthorized \n     immigrants entering the United States has increased by \n     approximately 500,000 each year.\n       (3) The costs associated with incarcerating undocumented \n     criminal immigrants and providing education and healthcare to \n     undocumented immigrants place a tremendous financial burden \n     on States and local governments.\n       (4) In 2003, States received compensation from the Federal \n     Government, through the State criminal alien assistance \n     program under section 241(i) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1231(i)), for incarcerating \n     approximately 74,000 undocumented criminal immigrants.\n       (5) In 2003, 700 local governments received compensation \n     from the Federal Government, through the State criminal alien \n     assistance program, for incarcerating approximately 138,000 \n     undocumented criminal immigrants.\n       (6) It is estimated that Federal Government payments \n     through the State criminal alien assistance program reimburse \n     States and local governments for 25 percent or less of the \n     actual costs of incarcerating the undocumented criminal \n     immigrants.\n       (7) It is estimated that providing kindergarten through \n     grade 12 education to undocumented immigrants costs States \n     more than $8,000,000,000 annually.\n       (8) It is further estimated that more than $1,000,000,000 \n     is spent on healthcare for undocumented immigrants each year.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) States should be fully reimbursed by the Federal \n     Government for the costs associated with providing education \n     and healthcare to undocumented immigrants; and\n       (2) the program authorized under section 241(i) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1231(i)) should be \n     fully funded, for each of the fiscal years 2007 through 2012, \n     at the levels authorized for such program under section \n     241(i)(5) of such Act (as amended by section 218(b)(2) of \n     this Act).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3441.

neared;\n       Whereas these men from Brainerd fought hard and bravely as \n     American forces were pushed into the Bataan Peninsula and \n     ultimately endured the Bataan Death March;\n       Whereas men of the Minnesota National Guard's 175th Field \n     Artillery, as part of the 34th ``Red Bull'' Division, became \n     the first American Division to be deployed to Europe in \n     January of 1942;\n       Whereas when the 34th Division was shipped to North Africa, \n     it fired the first American shells against the Nazi forces;\n       Whereas the 34th Division participated in 6 major Army \n     campaigns in North Africa, Sicily, and Italy, which led to \n     the division being credited with taking the most enemy-\n     defended hills of any division in the European Theater as \n     well as having more combat days than any other division in \n     Europe;\n       Whereas the Minnesota National Guard served with \n     distinction on the ground and in the air during Operations \n     Desert Shield and Desert Storm;\n       Whereas Minnesota National Guard troops have helped keep \n     the peace in the former Yugoslavia, including 1,100 troops \n     who have seen service in Bosnia, Croatia, and Kosovo;\n       Whereas the Minnesota National Guard has participated in \n     keeping America safe after September 11, 2001, in numerous \n     ways, including airport security;\n       Whereas the Duluth-based 148th Fighter Wing's F-16s flew \n     patrols over cities after September 11, 2001, for a longer \n     time than any other air defense unit;\n       Whereas over 11,000 members of the Minnesota National Guard \n     have been called up for full-time service since the September \n     11, 2001, terrorist attacks;\n       Whereas as of March 20, 2006, Minnesota National Guard \n     troops are serving in national defense missions in \n     Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, and Iraq;\n       Whereas more than 600 Minnesota National Guard troops have \n     been deployed to Afghanistan in Operation Enduring Freedom;\n\n[[Page S3345]]\n\n       Whereas members of the Minnesota National Guard, serving in \n     the 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 34th Infantry Division, \n     have been a part of the State's largest troop deployment \n     since World War II, with more than 2,600 citizen soldiers \n     called to service in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom;\n       Whereas the Minnesota National Guard has greatly \n     contributed not only to battles but to the suppressing of \n     violent riots, such as the 1947 national meat processors \n     strike, in which they aided helpless police officers, and the \n     fight against natural disasters such as the Red River flood \n     in 1997 in which they organized search and rescue missions, \n     helped shelter people who were left homeless, ran logistics, \n     and helped sandbagging efforts; and\n       Whereas on April 17, 2006, the Minnesota National Guard \n     will celebrate its 150th anniversary along with its \n     historical and recent accomplishments: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) honors and congratulates the Minnesota National Guard \n     for its spirit of dedication and service to the State of \n     Minnesota and to the Nation on its 150th anniversary; and\n       (2) recognizes that the role of the National Guard, the \n     Nation's citizen-soldier based militia, which was formed \n     before the United States Army, has been and still is \n     extremely important to the security and freedom of the \n     Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url":

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 437, which was \nsubmitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 437) supporting the goals and ideals \n     of the Year of the Museum.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to support a resolution supporting \nthe goals and ideals of the Year of the Museum. I am pleased to be \njoined by Senator Kennedy and other members of the Cultural Caucus in \nsponsoring this resolution recognizing the vital role museums play in \nthe fabric of our American culture.\n  On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the American Association \nof Museums, we treasure the more than 16,000 museums in the United \nStates that house many of our greatest treasures. Museums inspire \ncuriosity in students of all ages and foster a greater understanding of \nthe world around us. Museums help us connect to the past and envision \nthe future. Today, we celebrate their contribution to the vitality of \nour communities and our culture over the past 100 years.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, today the Senate considers The Year of the \nMuseum resolution which asks for Congress to support the goals and \nideals of the Year of the Museum and asks the President to call upon \nAmericans to observe this year with appropriate programs and \nactivities.\n  I encourage citizens to utilize and support their local museums which \nserve as a wonderful resource for communities. There is great value for \ncitizens in the arts, historic collections and museums. They are a \nreflection of our culture and people, and are important to our history \nand national identity. Children and young learners benefit tremendously \nfrom art programs in the schools. These activities make for well \nrounded citizens, tomorrow's leaders. Museums play an important role in \nour lives.\n  The Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management, which I chair, held \na hearing on Federal funding of museums this week and found that \nFederal support of the arts and humanities, which includes museums, has \nincreased 25 percent in the last 5 years. During a time of tremendous \nfinancial challenge, we must exercise thrift and frugality with \ntaxpayer money.\n  Why not hold museum and arts funding steady at current levels? I \nbelieve that budget increases for nonessential activities during a time \nof great challenge to our Nation are indefensible. It is Congress that \nholds the purse strings and, frankly, we have been unwilling to make \nthe tough decisions today for the future well-being of our \ngrandchildren.\n  As a government we have spent over $7 billion on such programs and \ninstitutions since 2001, but where in the Constitution does it allow \nthe Federal Government support museums and the arts by taxing citizens \nto pay for museums in other cities and States? Essentially taxpayers \nare being forced to subsidize museums they do not attend. Museums spend \n$21 for every visitor while only earning $5.50 in revenue per visitor \naccording to the American Association of Museums.\n  I remind my colleagues that the current fiscal environment of war, \nKatrina and Social Security and Medicare insolvency is a very serious \nsituation. One criticism of the President I have is that he has not \nasked the American people to sacrifice during wartime. We cannot, as a \ngovernment, do everything we would like to do. I think the American \npeople would be very forgiving and willing to make sacrifices if only \nasked. During a time of war Presidents Roosevelt and Truman slashed \nnondefense spending by over 20 percent. It can be done.\n  There are several opportunities for Federal funding of museums \nthrough competitive grants administered by the Institute for Museum and \nLibrary Services and the National Science Foundation which are peer \nreviewed and grantees are held accountable and must meet financial \nmanagement requirements as well as other conditions.\n  Museum earmarks, however, proliferate, especially in the home States \nof members of the powerful Appropriations Committee. This year 69 \npercent of museum earmarks went to their home States. These museums get \nto cut in line and skip the competitive application. Favored projects \nreceive money without having to compete with the other museums. These \nprojects have not had to demonstrate their merit or worth to a \ncommunity, but get a cash award nonetheless. There is something wrong \nwith this system. What's more, several museums split their earmark \nrequests across bills in the same year to hide the true cost. The same \nmuseums request earmarks every year, and get them. Since 2001, over 860 \nearmarks have been handed out to museums.\n  I support the ideals of the Year of the Museum, but I ask my \ncolleagues to exercise fiscal restraint and stop focusing on political \nexpediency and start thinking about future generations.\n  Given the local nature of most of the grants and earmarks, it is \ndifficult to defend the expenditure of taxpayer dollars to benefit a \nsmall group of people in Muskogee, St. Louis, or Anchorage. If a \ncommunity truly wanted such an institution or program, they would and \nshould find a way to pay for it with local and State money, or through \nadmission fees.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 437) was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S3346]]\n\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 437\n\n       Whereas museums are institutions of public service and \n     education that foster exploration, study, observation, \n     critical thinking, contemplation, and dialogue to advance a \n     greater public knowledge, understanding, and appreciation of \n     history, science, the arts, and the natural world;\n       Whereas, according to survey data, the people of the United \n     States view museums as one of the most important resources \n     for educating children;\n       Whereas museums have a long-standing tradition of inspiring \n     curiosity in schoolchildren that is a result of investments \n     of more than $1,000,000,000 and more than 18,000,000 \n     instructional hours annually for elementary and secondary \n     education programs in communities across the United States, \n     creative partnerships with schools, professional development \n     for teachers, traveling exhibits to local schools, \n     digitization of materials for access nationwide, creation of \n     electronic and printed educational materials that use local \n     and State curriculum standards, and the hosting of \n     interactive school field trips;\n       Whereas museums serve as community landmarks that \n     contribute to the livability and economic vitality of \n     communities through expanding tourism;\n       Whereas museums rank in the top 3 family vacation \n     destinations, revitalize downtowns (often with signature \n     buildings), attract relocating businesses by enhancing \n     quality of life, provide shared community experiences and \n     meeting places, and serve as a repository and resource for \n     each community's unique history, culture, achievements, and \n     values;\n       Whereas there are more than 16,000 museums in the United \n     States and admission is free at more than half of these \n     museums;\n       Whereas approximately 865,000,000 people visit museums \n     annually and these people come from all ages, groups, and \n     backgrounds;\n       Whereas research indicates Americans view museums as one of \n     the most trustworthy sources of objective information and \n     believe that authentic artifacts in history museums and \n     historic sites are second only to their families in \n     significance in creating a strong connection with the past;\n       Whereas museums enhance the public's ability to engage as \n     citizens, through developing a deeper sense of identity and a \n     broader judgment about the world, and by holding more than \n     750,000,000 objects and living specimens in the public trust \n     to preserve and protect the cultural and natural heritage of \n     the United States for current and future generations;\n       Whereas museums are increasingly entering into new \n     partnerships with community educational institutions that \n     include schools, universities, libraries, public \n     broadcasting, and 21st Century Community Learning Centers, \n     and these partnerships reach across community boundaries to \n     provide broader impact and synergy for their community \n     educational programs;\n       Whereas supporting the goals and ideals of the Year of the \n     Museum would give Americans the opportunity to celebrate the \n     contributions museums have made to American culture and life \n     over the past 100 years; and\n       Whereas in 2006, museums of the United States are \n     celebrating 100 years of collective contribution to our \n     communities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate supports the goals and ideals of \n     the Year of the Museum.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/06/senate-section/article/S3346-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               AUTHORIZING THE USE OF THE CAPITOL GROUNDS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
