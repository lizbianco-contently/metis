Mr. President, just very briefly, I want to comment on the \nsupplemental appropriations bill we passed yesterday morning.\n  I commend Senator Cochran and really both of the managers, and all of \nour colleagues, as well as the House, and especially Congressman Lewis, \nfor their leadership in crafting a package that reflects our commitment \nto economic growth, that keeps America moving forward, that is fiscally \nresponsible.\n  As the majority says time and time again, the Federal budget is not \nthe Government's money. It is the taxpayers' money. Americans work hard \nto get what they earn. And it is our responsibility to spend that money \nwisely, appropriately.\n  That is why we are working hard to crack down on excessive Washington \nspending. And I think the way that supplemental bill was handled from \nthe beginning, and especially at the end, reflects that fiscal \nresponsibility. As we all know, that bill did reflect a lot of \npriorities of this body, but it grew and grew and grew. Once that bill \nwas taken to conference, under the leadership of Chairman Cochran and \nCongressman Lewis, it was scaled back down to meet the specific \nguidelines and request of the President of the United States. I think \nwe exercised fiscal restraint and responsibility, but still there is a \nlot more we do need to do in terms of demonstrating that fiscal \nrestraint and that responsibility.\n  One of our big challenges is the fact that much of our spending is on \nautopilot. We see that in our entitlement programs. Also, our budgetary \nprocess--the way it is conducted--leaves little time for oversight as \nto the spending.\n  I mention that because I want to express my strong support for the \nefforts of our budget chairman, Senator Gregg, for an act that is \ncalled the SOS Act, called the Stop Overspending Act, that will be \nmarked up by his committee, addressed in his committee next week. What \nit is--and he introduced it to many of us this week--is a broad package \non the budgetary process. It is a package of reforms that will tamp \ndown on and give us the tools and ways to control excessive spending.\n  It adopts the President's proposal to establish a legislative line-\nitem veto. It would reestablish spending caps which have been used \neffectively in the past. It initiates across-the-board reductions in \nentitlement spending if the Federal deficit fails to meet specific \nestablished targets.\n  It includes a proposal I have been very supportive of and introduced \nactually when I first arrived in the Senate to put the budget on a 2-\nyear budget cycle, thereby giving us time for appropriate oversight.\n  I realize enacting this entire bold package--comprehensive in many \nways, this SOS package--would be a huge challenge, particularly in \nWashington where the forces of spending from below, from within, remain \nso strong. But achieving even one of the reforms or, hopefully, several \nof the reforms of this package would be a major\n\n[[Page S5988]]\n\nvictory in the battle to control spending. It is my goal to accomplish \njust that before I leave the Senate.\n  So just like every family has to make tough tradeoffs and live within \ntheir means, Congress should, too.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/16/senate-section/article/S5988-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, our valiant troops are now serving in their \nfourth year in Iraq. Day after day, they have demonstrated courage, \nskill, and bravery. They do not ask for much. But all of us owe them a \nlot.\n  At the top of the list of things we owe them is an honest debate \nabout what is going on in Iraq.\n  Yesterday, Democrats offered an amendment to express the sense of the \nSenate that Iraq not grant amnesty to terrorists who kill our troops as \npart of their reconciliation plan. The amendment came in response to \nreports that the Iraqi Prime Minister was in favor of such a proposal.\n  But instead of joining us in a debate about this amendment, the \nmajority, the Republicans, decided to play a political game and quickly \nclaimed the Iraqi Prime Minister had been ``misquoted'' and offered \nsome procedural gimmicks to stop a vote from taking place on this \namendment.\n  But, just this morning, there is more news that the Prime Minister \nhas talked about and does favor amnesty to those Iraqis who kill \nAmerican troops. It is all over the country in the news. For example, \nit is on page 22 of the Washington Post. The aide who first leaked the \nstory has now resigned, but he stands by what he said. Today, he is \nquoted as saying:\n\n       The prime minister himself has said that he is ready to \n     give amnesty to the so-called resistance, provided they have \n     not been involved in killing Iraqis.\n\n  What that says is just what we said yesterday: Amnesty will be \ngranted to those who kill Americans, but not to those who hurt Iraqis.\n  I think this sounds like it deserves the Senate's attention. Doesn't \nit seem like we should weigh in on this, and tell the Iraqis there will \nbe no ``get out of jail free'' cards for those who kill our troops?\n  We should have had that debate yesterday. But instead of having the \ndebate, the Republicans cut and run from the debate. In effect, they \nare filibustering their own Defense authorization bill, not allowing \nthe matter to move forward--stopped in midday. It does not make sense. \nUntil we know exactly where the Iraqis stand, President Bush must come \nforward and tell the Iraqis to stand down.\n  Terrorists who kill our troops should not be set free. Our soldiers \nhave given too much in the name of Iraqi freedom.\n  Mr. President, there is something else we owe our troops: an \nacknowledgment of their tremendous sacrifice.\n  Yesterday, as we know, we had a moment of silence in this Chamber \nbecause we lost our 2,500th troop in Iraq.\n  Mr. President, 2,500 of our finest have been killed in Iraq. The \nreason we had a moment of silence is because it was a solemn milestone, \nwhich we should acknowledge.\n  But over at the White House, I guess they have a different feeling. \nThey apparently view this sad occasion differently. With all the news \naround the country today, there is a quote from Tony Snow, the \nPresident's Press Secretary, who said, in response to the news: ``It's \na number.'' ``It's a number.'' ``It's a number.''\n  I say to Tony Snow, and others at the White House, it is more than a \nnumber. It is somebody's son or daughter. It is someone's father or \nmother, a neighbor, an uncle, or an aunt.\n  Nevada has lost 39 soldiers in Iraq--39. Every one of them is more \nthan a number. I wonder how--and they are now my friends--two Nevadans, \nwho came to visit me before Memorial Day--and they came to the Memorial \nDay ceremonies we had at the Boulder City Veterans Home, where last \nyear we buried more than 2,000 veterans--I wonder how John Lukac's and \nWilliam Salazar's parents feel about their sons being just numbers.\n  They are not numbers. They are no more numbers than the people who \nhave been wounded. They are not numbers. They are people, in many \ninstances, who have lost arms or legs or eyes or are paralyzed. They \nare not just numbers.\n  I think maybe we should discuss briefly what a Republican Congressman \nsaid yesterday. I know this man. I know him well. I have been going to \nthe House gym for a lot of years. He is a man by the name of Wayne \nGilchrest. He is my friend. He is a Republican Congressman from \nMaryland.\n  We were standing in the House gym. I have known him for many, many \nyears. And because of our knowing one another--he was shaving actually, \nwith his shirt off. And on his back he had--I noticed it for years--a \nreal scar.\n  I said: Wayne, what is that scar?\n  He said: I was shot.\n  I said: Tell me about it.\n  He was in Vietnam. He was a sergeant. He raised his arm to fire, and \nas he did that, somebody shot him through the chest. The bullet came \nout of the back. He has a big scar in the back. The words he remembers \nare: ``Sarge's been shot. I hope he's not dead.''\n  He survived, but after many months in hospitals. He was a school \nteacher. He came back from Vietnam and taught kids. Now he is a Member \nof Congress, and has been for some time.\n  Here is what he said in yesterday's Washington Post:\n\n       I can't help but feel through eyes of a combat-wounded \n     Marine in Vietnam, if someone was shot, you tried to save his \n     life . . . While you were in combat, you had a sense of \n     urgency to end the slaughter, and around here we don't have \n     that sense of urgency.\n\n  That is a direct quote. He went on to say:\n\n       To me, the administration does not act like there's a war \n     going on. The Congress certainly doesn't act like there's a \n     war going on. If you're raising money to keep the majority, \n     if you're thinking about gay marriage, if you're doing all \n     this other peripheral stuff, what does that say to the guy \n     who's about ready to drive over a land mine?\n\n  Republican Congressman Wayne Gilchrest.\n  John Lukac is just a number? William Salazar is just a number?\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to talk \nabout the Indian Health Care Improvement Act and some frustration--I \nshould say enormous frustration--that I and Senator McCain have about \nwhat is happening with a piece of legislation that is so very \nimportant.\n  In this country, we have responsibility for health care for two \ngroups of people: Federal prisoners who are incarcerated in prison--we \nare responsible for their health care. If they get\n\n[[Page S5989]]\n\nsick, they go to an infirmary, they go to a hospital, we are \nresponsible. We provide health care for Federal prisoners. We also have \ntrust responsibility for providing health care for American Indians. \nThat is our trust responsibility.\n  It is interesting and enormously disappointing to me that we spend \ntwice as much per person on health care for Federal prisoners as we do \nin providing health care, as is our obligation, for American Indians.\n  I want to talk a little about that because we have written a piece of \nlegislation called the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, which builds \non a piece of legislation that was passed some while ago. I want to \ntalk about what American Indians are facing out in the country with \nrespect to health care.\n  Let me describe it first with respect to a story. This is a very \ntypical story about a member of the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara \nNation, which is called the Three Affiliated Tribes in North Dakota. It \nis a story about a fellow who had diabetes. By the way, I held a \nhearing some years ago on that reservation. On that reservation, the \nrate of diabetes is not double, triple, or quadruple the rate of \ndiabetes elsewhere. At that reservation, at that point, it was 12 times \nthe rate of diabetes that existed elsewhere.\n  The person I am speaking about on the Three Affiliated Tribes or Fort \nBerthold Reservation is Laidmen Fox, Sr. He was a Native American who \nhad struggled, as other members of his family had, with diabetes. He \nhad his feet amputated. Later he had his knees amputated. Finally, his \nentire legs were amputated. He was on dialysis. And, finally, the \ndoctors told him he would have to have his hands amputated. At that \npoint, Mr. Fox said he wanted to be taken off of the dialysis machine \nand to be taken home to die. He died 2 years ago. He went home to be \nwith family and friends, having lost his feet, his knees, then his \nlegs, and then told he would lose his hands. He died, was taken off \ndialysis.\n  Just this last February, his daughter--who was 41 years old, and \nblind from diabetes, and also on dialysis--chose do have herself taken \noff the machine and went home to die in a similar manner.\n  We now have in this country something nobody wants to talk about. We \nration health care for American Indians. Yes, there is health care \nrationing. There is something called contract health services. That \nmeans that when American Indians show up at a clinic or a hospital and, \nthrough the Indian Health Service, seek treatment for their problems, \nthe only treatment they will get and the only reimbursement they will \nget for that medical condition is if it means ``life or limb,'' \nthreatening ``life or limb.'' Otherwise, in most cases, under the \ncontract health provisions, there is no health care available.\n\n  Let me talk about some other examples, if I might.\n  A member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians in my State \nwas suffering from cancer. He went through chemotherapy, and went \nthrough chemotherapy again for a number of years through referral from \nthe Indian Health Service to the University of Minnesota. All of a \nsudden the Indian Health Service said to him: We don't have any more \nfunding. And they refused to pay for any additional treatment, even \nafter he had a number of relapses.\n  This is not unusual for American Indians to face this sort of thing.\n  Another American Indian fell as a result of insulin shock at his \nhome. He hit his hip, and hurt his hip badly in the fall. He was taken \nto a hospital by ambulance, given a shot for the pain and told he was \nto be released. His father objected because he said: My son can't walk. \nYou can't release him. And the father said: I can't carry him. He can't \nwalk. He must stay here.\n  The doctor said he could stay in the hospital for one night's \nobservation. The next day, when the pain did not subside, they gave him \nan x-ray, found out his hip was broken, and referred him to another \nfacility. And because so much time had elapsed since the accident, he \nhad to have a full hip replacement.\n  Another tribal member was a Vietnam veteran and should have had the \nservices of both the Indian Health Service and the VA available to him. \nHe died after the Indian Health Service denied his request for a \nreferral for him to be seen by a lung specialist at the Mayo Clinic. \nThe IHS told him they had no money to send him to a specialist, and \nthis Vietnam veteran died as a result.\n  In Montana, an Indian man went to the Indian Health Service clinic \nseeking assistance for gallstones. He was told it was not a ``life or \nlimb'' situation, which would get him referred to a health provider off \nthe reservation under the contract health provisions I have just \ndescribed. Subsequent to that, his duct ruptured and he became \ninfected. He had to have part of his pancreas removed, and now he is on \ndialysis.\n  Several months ago, a 24-year-old man at the Spirit Lake Nation went \nto the IHS clinic complaining he had abdominal pain. He was given some \nmedicine and was sent home because he was not considered a ``priority'' \npatient. He ended up in the emergency room in a nearby hospital, off \nthe reservation, and then transported to a larger medical center 125 \nmiles away. His appendix had raptured. That was 3 months ago, and he is \nstill in the hospital 3 months later, as they attempt to try to control \nhis body temperature and other related matters.\n  He was determined not to have a ``life or limb'' emergency medical \nneed, and so his actual condition was overlooked, with the results of \nseveral months now of acute care in a hospital.\n  Mr. President, I have spoken a number of times on the floor of the \nSenate about a young girl named Avis Little Wind. I brought her picture \nto the floor of the Senate. I did that with the permission of her \nrelatives. She was 14 years old, and she hung herself. She killed \nherself 2 years after her sister had killed herself.\n  I went to the reservation because we have had a cluster of suicides \nof young teenagers on Indian reservations. I talked to this young \ngirl's teachers, school administrators, people in the mental health \narea, tribal council folks, to try to understand what is wrong here.\n  What I discovered is this little 14-year-old girl, named Avis Little \nWind, laid in a bed for 90 days in a fetal position. Clearly, something \nwas seriously wrong with this young woman. Yet, it did not send a \nsignal to anybody. Her father killed himself. Her mother was \ndysfunctional, a substance abuser. This young girl somehow just slipped \nthrough the system, and she got up one day out of that bed and took her \nown life.\n  Avis Little Wind is one person, but a person whose future was stolen \nfrom her because she felt hopeless or helpless. And the fact is, on \nthat Indian reservation--as is the case for most Indian reservations--\nthere is no mental health treatment available. There are not enough \npeople available just for the diagnosis of serious problems. You would \nthink someone who misses 90 days of school at age 14 would send alarm \nbells all over, but it did not. There is not enough money in the Indian \nHealth System to deal with it.\n  Senator McCain and I have passed some legislation recently dealing \nwith the issue of Indian teen suicide and trying to begin to address \nthat issue. But there is a serious lack of attention to the health care \nneeds of Native Americans and, yes, teenagers like Avis Little Wind and \nthe tragedy that resulted in her death.\n  It is not uncommon to see 75 people stand in line waiting to have a \nprescription filled. It is not uncommon for them to stand in line only \nto find out they can't get the prescription filled because the medicine \nis not available there.\n  I have been to a health care facility where one dentist is working in \na small trailer house serving 5,000 people. Is that fair? Is that the \nright thing to do? We can do better than that as a country. Yet, \nsomehow, this issue of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act is not a \npriority. The administration has dragged its feet, and dragged its feet \nfor months and months. Senator McCain and I have just written the \nadministration a letter saying: How about some help here? How about \nsome cooperation? Let's find a way to solve this and fix it.\n  While we talk and while we dither and while the administration \ndecides to delay, we have people losing their lives, and we have people \ngoing to\n\n[[Page S5990]]\n\nhealth care facilities with very serious problems being told: We don't \nhave the money to refer you.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The tribal chairman for the Three Affiliated Tribes in \nNorth Dakota says: Everybody up there on the reservation understands, \ndon't get sick after June. Just don't get sick after June because the \nmoney has run out on contract health services. If you get sick after \nJune, there is no money. They are not going to send you to a hospital. \nOr if you go to the hospital, the hospital will charge back to you \nbecause they won't get the money from the Indian Health Service. It \nwill ruin your credit, and you will have to file for bankruptcy. But \ndon't get sick after June because the money won't be there.\n  What kind of message is that to the American people, especially the \nmost vulnerable in our society? These reservations are where there is \nsubstantial poverty, great difficulty.\n  I have not mentioned methamphetamine. We have had hearings about \nthat. It is unbelievable what is happening with respect to these \nreservations and health care, and yet somehow there is no urgency here.\n  Senator McCain and I are asking for a little cooperation from the \nadministration and some cooperation here in the Senate to move this \nbill.\n  We had a witness just the other day at a hearing about \nmethamphetamine on reservations. Methamphetamine is a scourge all \nacross this country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. One of the witnesses at that hearing on methamphetamine \non reservations, who is the chairperson of an Indian tribe, lives on a \nrural reservation with 13,000 Native Americans who live on that \nreservation. She told us that one-half of the babies who have been born \nto tribal members on that reservation--one-half of the babies--have \ntested positive for alcohol or drugs, including methamphetamine. Think \nof that.\n  I was in a hospital one day when they showed me a young baby that was \nborn with a .12 blood alcohol content lying in the nursery. This baby \nwas born with a .12 blood alcohol content, and the mother was down the \nhall and refused to see the baby because she did not want the baby. She \nchecked into the hospital dead drunk.\n  The fact is, we have serious problems with methamphetamine and \nsubstance abuse and teenage suicide, and all of these issues, and we \nhave a health care system on Indian reservations that is a rationing \nsystem. When the chairman of the tribe in my State says, ``All the \nIndians know: don't get sick after June because the money is not there \nunder contract health to help you,'' that is a serious problem.\n  All I am asking for and all Senator McCain is asking for is a little \nhelp and a little cooperation from the administration and, yes, from \nour colleagues to move this legislation called the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act. It is the right thing for this country to do. Mr. \nPresident, I see the chairman of the committee is here, and I will, at \nthis point, yield the floor.\n  I do have an amendment I wish to offer on the Defense authorization \nbill today, and I am available to do that when it is convenient. But \nthe chairman and ranking Member are here, so at this point I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I was much taken by the remarks of the \nSenator from North Dakota. I have great respect for the Senator from \nNorth Dakota. I tell you, you do a lot of homework. You do a lot of \nindependent work. And while I do not have the expertise with regard to \nthe reservations that you have, any of us listening to your comments \nwould immediately come to the conclusion that we better step in to \nhelp. And I say to the Senator, you can count on me when the time \ncomes. I think that matter should be addressed as quickly as we can by \nthe Senate.\n  I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/16/senate-section/article/S5990-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I say to my distinguished ranking member, \nI think at this time it would be appropriate if the Senator wishes to \nbring up his amendment.\n  We are in business, I say to my colleagues wherever they are, for \npurposes of amendments. The Senator from Michigan and I will be here \nfor some period of time in hopes of processing amendments.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota. He \ncovered such a wide range of issues with such depth and integrity that \nis really quite extraordinary. We are ready for his amendment. I think \nhe is prepared to proceed with the amendment. We look forward to \nhearing from him on that matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4292\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Harkin, proposes an amendment numbered \n     4292.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Senator from \nVirginia for his kind comments. He did not say he welcomed my amendment \nbecause he probably knows that this amendment is one which we have \ndealt with before. But I feel so strongly the need to continue to offer \nthe amendment, if only by voice vote, which says what is going on I \nthink is dreadfully wrong and needs to be corrected. I know the Senator \nfrom Virginia and the Senator from Michigan are legislators with \ngoodwill and good skills. I hope they will join with me as I once again \ndescribe the issues of contracting that exist because we are spending \nso much money in such a hurry that there is waste, fraud, and abuse \nwhich simply cannot be addressed in the regular order.\n  I believe this amendment is once again a proposal whereby there was a \nTruman-type committee, the type that existed when Harry Truman served \nin the Senate, a Democratic Senate then, with a Democrat in the White \nHouse. Harry Truman, I am sure, caused some real angst at the White \nHouse by saying: I think there needs to be a special bipartisan \ncommittee established to take a look at waste, fraud, and abuse in \nmilitary contracting. He traveled all across this country to military \ninstallations to meet with contractors. His committee unearthed a \nsubstantial amount of waste.\n  I offer it again, as I have offered it on previous occasions. I \nunderstand I have not been successful, but I offer it again only \nbecause I don't think the problem has abated. I think the problem still \nexists.\n\n[[Page S5991]]\n\n  Just the other day, in a supplemental emergency appropriations bill, \nwe spent $92 billion. Some of that was for Katrina relief, but the rest \nof it, by and large, will find its way into the Pentagon accounts--to \nrestore accounts.\n  The Senator from Illinois just came in, and the Senator from Illinois \nand I have jointly worked on this issue. Senator Harkin has asked to be \na cosponsor as well. I offer it on behalf of myself and Senators Durbin \nand Harkin. This is something that we have talked about at some length \nover a period of time.\n  We have approved emergency supplemental appropriations bills to the \ntune of tens and tens and tens of billions of dollars. I believe it is \nnow over $340 billion. Think of that: almost a third of $1 trillion \napproved without being paid for. This adds right on the top of the \nFederal debt.\n  This spending is in support of our military. I voted for it because \nwe can't send our troops abroad and not provide them the equipment and \nthings they need.\n  But when you spend this much money, including $18 billion-plus for \nreconstruction in Iraq, and then begin to see who gets hold of this \nmoney, it is hair raising to hear the stories about what is happening.\n  I am not suggesting that there would never be any waste as a result \nof this war. Wartime is a different circumstance. I understand that. \nBut I think it is safe to say that there has been more waste, more \nfraud, and more abuse of the taxpayers' money in the recently short \ntime, several years, than in the history of this country. I think it is \nunparalleled. I think we have a responsibility to deal with it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Through the Chair, I am happy to join him in this effort \nin which we are trying to have some oversight on tax money being spent \non this war. The Senator and I have worked on this concept together. We \nwent back to a day when the Senator from Missouri, Harry Truman, \ndecided to ask the same hard questions of the administration during the \nSecond World War, trying to find instances where tax dollars were being \nwasted and people were profiteering and soldiers were getting equipment \nthat wasn't up to standard.\n  I ask the Senator from North Dakota: Isn't it curious that Senator \nHarry Truman, a Democrat from Missouri who created this commission and \nasked hard questions, when there was a Democratic President named \nFranklin Roosevelt, was suggesting that when it comes to profiteering, \nCongress doesn't do the administration nor the people of this country \nany favors by saying we are going to protect our own party in the White \nHouse? Shouldn't we be dealing with a nonpartisan issue of waste at the \nexpense of taxpayers and, more importantly, at the expense of soldiers?\n  Isn't it true that at the hearings which Senator Dorgan has chaired \nbringing together whistleblowers who tell us these terrible stories of \nwaste of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money, that absent these \nhearings there has been very little done on Capitol Hill by way of \noversight of the giants who are winning these no-bid contracts, \nmultibillion-dollar contracts, and wasting too much of taxpayer \ndollars?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is the case that whistleblowers from \nKuwait, Iraq, and various parts of the United States have come to me \nand said: What is going on is wrong. We have held some hearings through \nour policy committee to take a look at it. They have wanted to testify.\n  Let me give you one example. I talked about Rory before. A man named \nRory, an engaging fellow, who was a supervisor at a food service \noperation in Iraq, he said to us that what was going on was wrong. He \nworked for Kellogg, Brown & Root, a subsidiary of Halliburton.\n  No. 1, he said we were charging for thousands of meals that we \nweren't serving.\n  No. 2, we were feeding the troops food that had expired date stamps \non them.\n  He brought it to the attention of his superiors. They said: It \ndoesn't matter. Feed it to the troops. It doesn't matter.\n  He said: We had convoys of trucks that were attacked on the road with \nfood in them. He was told: You go into that truck bed and you find out \nwhat food has shrapnel in it. If you find good pieces of shrapnel, you \ngive it to your supervisors as souvenirs, but feed the food to the \ntroops.\n  The other thing that was very interesting, talking about employees of \nKellogg, Brown & Root, a subsidiary of Halliburton, he said: We were \ntold that when Government auditors come around, don't you dare talk to \nthem. You are forbidden to talk to them. If you do, one of two things \nwill happen. You will either be fired, or you will be sent to a part of \nIraq where there is active, hostile shooting going on.\n  This fellow, in fact, was sent to one of the active areas of Falluja. \nHe had the courage, guts, and temerity, and decided he would talk to \nGovernment auditors.\n  It is unbelievable to me to hear a whistleblower say that a \ncontractor which was being paid with Government funds told the \nemployees: Don't you dare talk to Government auditors. If you do, you \nwill be fired.\n  That is so fundamentally wrong.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if I may ask one more question, in one of \nthe hearings that I attended, I recall that Senator Dorgan brought in \none of these whistleblowers who talked about the monogrammed towels \nthey were charging the Government to be put into certain facilities. \nThe Senator talked about running up the price of gasoline that they \nwere charging to the Government. I hope the Senator will recount those \nparticular instances.\n  But I would like to ask the Senator, when Members of Congress get up \nhere and say: We love our soldiers and we love our troops and we stand \nbehind them, how can we then cast a blind eye and overlook the obvious? \nWhen our soldiers aren't getting the right equipment, when our soldiers \naren't getting the goods they deserve, when they are not getting the \nsupplies they need to be safe and successful, how can that reflect any \nlove of our troops? If we are truly committed to these soldiers, \nwouldn't we be holding oversight hearings, bringing in under oath these \nwhistleblowers and their bosses? Let us bring them in and put them \nbefore the cameras and ask them if they are wasting taxpayer dollars \nand endangering the lives of our troops. Wouldn't that be the true \nmeasure of our commitment to these men and women in uniform?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, clearly that is what we ought to do on \nbehalf of soldiers.\n  I tell the Senator that the most recent allegations have been made by \ntwo people who worked for, once again, Kellogg, Brown & Root, a \nsubsidiary of Halliburton Corporation, about the water that was \nprovided to the military installations. Let me describe that.\n  Taking water from the Euphrates River--and some of it goes into a \nsystem where it is purified and used as potable water to drink. Some of \nit is used as nonpotable water. But the way they designed the lines to \nserve nonpotable water to the base, which is used for showering, \nshaving, and brushing teeth, and so on, the water that was coming out \nnonpotable areas was actually more contaminated with E. Coli, bacteria, \nthan the raw water coming out of the Euphrates River from the sewage \ndisposal.\n  Halliburton said it is not true. The Pentagon said it is not true.\n  It just wasn't one base. We have a memorandum from the person from \nKBR, a Halliburton subsidiary in charge of water to all the military \ninstallations in Iraq. That memorandum, which has now been made public, \nwas from the person who was in charge on behalf of Halliburton, or KBR, \nof all the water for all the installations. That memo admits that they \nhave a serious problem, and they have made big mistakes that could have \ncaused serious problems, including death.\n  After we held hearings, a young woman, an Army captain in Iraq, wrote \nus a long, unsolicited e-mail. She said: There is something going on on \nmy base. I saw there was some questions about water to our military \ninstallations in Iraq. I am here. I am treating people for all kinds of \nskin problems. And I began to see things that made me suspicious that \nthere was something wrong with the water.\n  She said: I had my staff track back to the water line.\n  She said: What I found out was they were providing nonpotable water \nto the\n\n[[Page S5992]]\n\nsoldiers on this base that was contaminated.\n  This is from a doctor who is there today. This isn't conjecture, \nspeculation, or accusation. This is from a doctor who is actually \ntreating people. Yet, once again, the company that we are paying as a \ncontractor to provide water service to these bases, connect and purify \nthe water and provide the water to soldiers, denied publicly that \nanything was wrong. We have two eye witnesses who have testified, \nwhistleblowers one that worked for the company. We have the internal \ndocument from the company that discussed how they had made these \nmistakes, and we have a doctor, a physician, who works for the \nArmy. This is like the old Western movie: Who are you going to believe, \nme or your own lying eyes?\n\n  The fact is, we know what is happening there, yet no one seems much \nconcerned about it. I write to the Defense Secretary about this and say \nit is quite clear that unhealthy water is being supplied to troops for \nshowering, brushing their teeth, and shaving. No one seems to get \nreally excited over that. It seems to me the Secretary of Defense ought \nto say, Wait, what on Earth is going on? Let's put a stop to this.\n  I will talk in a few minutes about how all of this happens. It \nhappens because we have sole-source, no-bid contracts and very little \noversight.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield for one last question, what \nstrikes me is there is not a sense of outrage that American tax dollars \nare being wasted but, even more important, that American troops are \nbeing shortchanged.\n  What do we ask of these men and women in uniform? Quite simply, we \nsay, take an oath to wear this uniform and risk your life for America--\nhow much more could we ask--and they do it. And then they expect from \nus support--support when they are in the field and support when they \ncome home.\n  I don't understand why there isn't a sense of outrage in this \nCongress on a bipartisan basis, on both sides of the aisle, that we are \nnot only being ripped off as taxpayers by these no-bid contracts but \nthat we are shortchanging these men and women who are risking their \nlives while we stand in the comfort and safety of this Senate.\n  I know Halliburton is a big political force in this town. I know in \nsome quarters you are not supposed to question Halliburton. This is \nsome sacred institution politically. I don't buy it. I count the \nsoldiers that are putting their lives on the line to be much more \nsacred and much more valuable than any big, huge, no-bid corporation.\n  I say to the Senator from North Dakota, we have done this before, the \ntwo of us have joined together, and said let's put together a \nbipartisan commission that will ask the hard questions, a commission \nthat will bring people in and put them under oath, find out if they are \ncheating us, find out if they are profiteering during a war, find out \nif they are shortchanging our soldiers, and let the chips fall where \nthey may. If we find there is a violation of law, even if it reaches \nall the way to the boardroom, so be it.\n  How many times have we come to the Senate, I ask the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, refresh my memory, how many times have we brought this \noption to the Senate and said to our colleagues, please, for the sake \nof the troops, let's have real oversight, let's ask these questions.\n  How many times have we done this during the course of this 3-year \nwar, I ask the Senator from North Dakota who has been the leader in \nthis effort, and I have been glad to join him, how often have we tried?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we have had three recorded votes on this, \nand we have brought this to the Senate maybe six times now, altogether. \nI know it is repetitious. I know it probably is not pleasant to hear \nall of these things again, yet I don't think there is any choice.\n  If I might, just for the benefit of my colleague from Illinois, \nSenator Durbin and I began talking about this some long while ago when \nwe began to see the evidence of waste. We have worked at it since then.\n  When Senator Durbin was asking a question, I described the water \nissue. I want to read a quote from a memorandum that was written May \n13, 2005, an internal Halliburton memorandum, written by Will Granger, \nthe man who was paid with taxpayer funds to do this contract for \nHalliburton for all of the water issues in Iraq. These are the water \nissues for the U.S. bases in Iraq that directly affect United States \nsoldiers.\n  Will Granger, the Halliburton employee:\n\n       No disinfection to the non-potable water was occurring [at \n     Camp Ar Ramadi] for water designated for showering purposes. \n     This caused an unknown population to be exposed to \n     potentially harmful water for an undetermined amount of time.\n       This event should be considered a ``NEAR MISS'' as the \n     consequences of these actions could have been VERY SEVERE \n     resulting in mass sickness or death.\n       The deficiencies of the camp where the event occurred is \n     not exclusive to that camp; meaning that country-wide, all \n     camps suffer to some extent from some or all of the \n     deficiencies noted.\n\n  That is what was covered up. This was not made public until I was \nable to dig it out. But when a whistleblower said this is happening--\nand I am not referring to Will Granger, but to a whistleblower who said \nthis is happening in his testimony to our committee--Halliburton said \nthat it is not happening, you are not telling the truth, the Pentagon \nsays there is no evidence of it.\n  And here is the internal Halliburton report that says it is \nhappening, No. 1; and, No. 2, this camp was a ``near miss'' and:\n\n     . . . the consequence could have been VERY SEVERE resulting \n     in mass sickness or death.\n\n  A lot of people are making a lot of money, spent by this Congress, in \nsupport of our soldiers who are at war, and we have some contractors \nwho are not playing straight with the soldiers or the American people.\n  I ask consent to show two items on the floor of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. A man whose name was Henry Bunting came to a hearing I \nheld. I believe Senator Durbin was at that hearing. Henry Bunting \nworked for Kellogg, Brown & Root, a subsidiary of Halliburton in \nKuwait. In Kuwait, he was the purchaser of supplies for the U.S. Army. \nThey wanted some hand towels, needed some towels, so a purchase \nrequisition goes to Henry. Henry is going to buy some towels. Except \nwhen he put in the order for the towels, his company said, no, no, no, \nyou cannot buy those regular towels that way. Towels have to have our \nlogo embroidered on them.\n\n  So this is what he had to buy, at more than double the cost of the \nregular towels, so that the company logo could be put on the towels, \nand the taxpayers could be charged twice as much.\n  I am sure the soldiers didn't care one way or another whether there \nwas that embroidered logo on the towel. But Henry, the purchaser, was \ntold: You buy these. And don't ask any questions.\n  Henry says, You know, the American taxpayer got charged double and he \ndidn't like it and he want to speak publicly. And not just this, it was \na thousand other examples of costs being run up, from $45 for a case of \nCoca-cola, to $7,500 a month to lease an SUV. Henry said, It is not \njust the towels, but he brought the towels along to show us what is \ngoing on is really wrong. The American people are taking a bath here \nand it undermines the soldiers, as well.\n  Thank God there are some whistleblowers who are willing to come \nforward.\n  What we need now, of course, is the opportunity to legislate and see \nif we can't stop this.\n  I will not go much longer, although I don't see anyone preparing to \noffer another amendment yet. I do want to make a couple of points I \nmade the other day on the broader amendment that was turned down by the \nSenate. That amendment dealt with contracting as well, but it was a \nmuch broader amendment than this.\n  I made the point then, and this actually had to do with Bunnatine \nGreenhouse. I know there are some who do not want to hear about this \nanymore. But I don't think we have any choice. This was the top \ncivilian contracting official at the Corps of Engineers. She was the \none responsible for overseeing the contracts.\n  Through the Corps of Engineers, Halliburton and KBR got no-bid, sole-\n\n[[Page S5993]]\n\nsource contracts, giant contracts. Over one half of the contracts in \nthe war theater are Halliburton.\n  By the way, this has nothing to do with the Vice President. Whenever \nyou mention that term, they say, You are attacking the Vice President. \nNo, he has been gone a long time. It doesn't have anything to do with \nhim. It has to do with a company that got over 50 percent of the \ncontracts in Iraq.\n  Bunnatine Greenhouse, the top contracting officer at Corps of \nEngineers who lost her job, now, as a result of telling the truth, \nsays:\n\n       I can unequivocally state that the abuse related to \n     contracts awarded to KBR represents the most blatant and \n     improper contract abuse I have witnessed during the course of \n     my professional career.\n\n  For that, she got demoted. Pretty harsh treatment for people who are \nwhistleblowers in this town. She has been replaced, by the way, by \nsomeone without experience. When I have asked the general who runs the \nCorps of Engineers, he said the person that is replacing Bunnatine \nGreenhouse is now being trained. Not much consolation or confidence, in \nmy judgment, in that for the American people.\n  One final story. If the issue of water does not motivate someone, let \nme talk again about Custer Battles. I have plenty of people come to me \nabout Mr. Custer and Mr. Battles. This is an example of what is going \non with so much money available.\n  Mr. Custer and Mr. Battles show up in Iraq without any money, without \nmuch experience in contracting, and decide, I will get some of this; I \nwant to get some of this contracting that is available. It was not very \nlong and they got some contracts very quickly. In fact, they ultimately \ngot over $100 million in contracts.\n  The first contract was to provide security. They set up a little firm \nto provide security at the Baghdad airport. Now, among other things, \nwhistleblowers from their own company came forward and said, Here are \nthe things they were doing. They are cheating you blind. They took the \nforklift troop trucks out of the Baghdad airport, took them somewhere \nelse, put them in the warehouse, painted them blue and sent them back \nand sold them to the Coalition Provisional Authority. They do not \nbelong to them. They repainted them and sold them back to us. They set \nup subsidiaries in Lebanon and other places to buy and sell to and from \nthemselves, and inflate the price, and, therefore, injure the taxpayer.\n  Here is what the fellow who runs the security system at the Baghdad \nairport said. The Baghdad airports director of security in a memo--a \nguy, also, that was trying to provide some warning--a memo to the \nCoalition Provisional Authority, and that is us in Iraq; it was set up \nby Donald Rumsfeld and that was the United States--here is what he \nsaid:\n\n       Custer Battles have shown themselves to be unresponsive, \n     uncooperative, incompetent, deceitful, manipulative and war \n     profiteers. Other than that they are swell fellows.\n\n  This from the director of security at the Baghdad airport. These guys \nended up getting over $100 million in contracts. I will show you a \nlittle bit of their money. This is a picture of $2 million in cash, \n$100 bills wrapped in Saran Wrap. I happen to know this guy; you do not \nsee his head, just his body standing in front of the $2 million. He \nshowed up here. He wanted to talk about this. Here is what he wanted to \nsay.\n  What he wanted to say was, When I was there, standing in Baghdad, \nworking on these accounts, the word went out to all of the contractors: \nWe pay in cash; bring a bag. He said it was like the Wild West. Bring a \nsack because we pay in cash.\n  This $2 million actually went to Custer Battles. They took a picture \nof it. He said they used to throw these around as footballs, Saran \nWrapped $100 bills. They threw them around as footballs in the office. \nAnd down below they had billions and billions of dollars, apparently.\n  Lest there be any question about the misuse of money, let me show $2 \nmillion Saran Wrapped just before it went to Custer Battles. How did \nthis happen? Because this guy right here, this fellow right here, told \nme that our message to everyone was ``bring a bag because we pay in \ncash.''\n  Does anyone doubt there is going to be dramatic waste, fraud, and \nabuse in those circumstances? Does anyone doubt that at all, and after \nall of these stories? Doubling the price of hand towels; 25 tons, \n50,000 pounds of nails laying on the sands of Iraq because they were \nordered in the wrong side, dumped in the sand.\n  I could go on forever from what I learned from whistleblowers. I will \nnot do that, only to say this: The next step for this Congress, I \nthink, is to establish a Truman-type committee. We have done it before \nand we can do it again. Never has it been more needed than now. There \nis, I think, plenty of evidence that the most significant waste, fraud, \nand abuse that has ever been visited on the taxpayers of this country \nis occurring now and has occurred in the last 3 years.\n  The remedy for that? It is not to blame anyone here. The remedy for \nthat is for us to fix it, for us to do something. What should we do? \nLet's put together the type of thing that worked previously. Harry \nTruman had the guts to do it.\n  Harry Truman was a Democrat. There was a Democrat in the White House. \nI am sure they all were gnashing their teeth at what Harry Truman was \ntrying to do, but on a bipartisan basis Harry Truman put together, with \nthe consent of the Senate, the Truman Committee that sunk their teeth \ninto this issue and really did investigate and came up with a massive \namount of waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  That is a minnow compared to the whale that exists at the moment in \nwaste, fraud, and abuse. It is required of us, in my judgment, required \nof us to pass this legislation.\n  Having said all of that, let me compliment the chairman and the \nranking member, but let me not do it because it is obligatory but \nbecause I really do think they do a great job. I hope they decide to \nstrongly support this amendment. Then I will come back and compliment \nthem some more.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first let me compliment the Senator from \nNorth Dakota. He has been absolutely steadfast on this issue. He has \nmade a major contribution on this issue.\n  If the Senator will stay for a moment, I want to ask him a question \nabout the Truman Committee which he has made reference to. Perhaps I \nwill make a brief statement and then ask him if he concurs with this \nhistory.\n  When then Senator Truman was appointed to head up the special \ncommittee to look into the abuses of contracting during World War II, \nhe did an incredible job for a lot of reasons. One, he took on the \nabuse, the waste, the fraud that existed. He unearthed it. He brought \nit out in the daylight. He made a major contribution to our troops and \nto the taxpayers. It was such an important contribution that his \ntemporary ad hoc special committee then became a Permanent Subcommittee \non Investigations.\n  So that the origin of our Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations \nwhich now exists over at the Homeland Security Committee was the \nspecial Truman Committee. That is how big an impact that Truman \nCommittee had. And I am wondering whether or not that little bit of \nhistory shows us in addition to all of the reasons that were given by \nthe Senator from North Dakota how vitally important these special \ncommittees can be, what a contribution they can make to the war effort \nand to saving taxpayers' dollars.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator is absolutely correct, first, \nabout the history and, second, about the importance of this. Harry \nTruman used to have a sign on his desk saying, ``the buck stops here.'' \nWell, the buck stops here in the Congress on this issue. We are the \nones who have to go find this waste, fraud, and abuse and put a stop to \nit. If we don't do it, it won't happen.\n  Harry Truman was a straight talker, a straight thinker. He used to \nsay he would only accept one-armed economists because he didn't want \npeople around him saying ``on the one hand'' and ``on the other hand.'' \nHe decided to sink his teeth into the issue of waste, fraud, and abuse, \nand he made a big difference at a time when there was substantial \nwaste, fraud, and abuse.\n  But I would venture to say there has never been a case in our history \nwhere\n\n[[Page S5994]]\n\nwe have pushed hundreds of billions of dollars out the door in a very \nlarge hurry and put them in the hands of no-bid, sole-source contracts \nwith big companies and said, ``Have a good time.'' It is unbelievable \nwhat is going on, and it is our responsibility to stop it--not \ntomorrow; it is our responsibility to stop it now.\n  This is the bill in which we should do it. This amendment fits \nexactly in this piece of legislation. My hope is that when the dust \nsettles, we will have decided to accept this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I again thank the Senator from North Dakota for the \namendment and I hope that we can get some bipartisan support for it.\n  There have been reports on abuses. Reports are no substitute for \nhearings. When you have hearings following a special committee \ninvestigation, you have people who are put under oath, who are in the \npublic spotlight so that we can bring a focus on these whistleblower \ncomplaints, and that is what has been missing. We have not had a place \nwhere the whistleblowers and the people who defend against their \ncharges are brought together, both put under oath in a public forum so \nthat we can then try to end what seems to be so clearly the abuses \nwhich have existed.\n  One of these contracts is a $10 billion contract-plus, basically. It \nis for indefinite delivery of goods, and it is for an indefinite amount \nquantitatively. So you have this contract which exists with \nHallliburton or the company that they own which allows them to have the \ntotal, complete, unilateral sole-source ability to be given a work \norder--sometimes the money is agreed upon in advance, sometimes the \namount of the contract is not agreed to until afterwards--indefinite \ndelivery for indefinite quantities of indefinite goods.\n  Now, that kind of a contract just automatically lends itself to \nabuses, which should not happen here. This is something I spoke about \nyesterday. There should have been at least two and perhaps three \ncontractors who were put in the exclusive contract to provide goods and \nservices in support of the troops.\n  This is an open-ended contract of undefined scope which then later on \nbillions of dollars of work orders are then put in place. It just lends \nitself to excess and to abuse. This is something again which I have \nspoken on a number of times. You need to have competition--not just for \nwho is going to get an open-ended contract but in the implementation of \nwork orders you need some competition. The only way you are going to \nget it in this circumstance when we are at war is if you have two or \nthree contractors that are awarded these so-called IDIQ contracts so \nthat when it comes to supplying the goods underneath it, they can \ncompete against each other. It is the only hope that you have for a \nfair price for an amount of goods that is not known at the beginning \nbut which has to be then supplied during the contract.\n  What these hearings which Senator Dorgan has spearheaded have shown \nis this kind of a contract and the potential for abuse that it leads \nto. It has raised all kinds of questions as to whether Halliburton \novercharged the Coalition Provisional Authority for several million \ndollars for oil that was purchased in Kuwait and delivered to Iraq.\n  It raised the question of whether Halliburton overcharged the \nDepartment of Defense for thousands of meals that were not actually \nserved.\n  It raised the question of whether Halliburton had the estimating \nsubcontracting and financial management systems needed to run two \nmulti-billion-dollar contracts in Iraq.\n  It raised the question of why did Halliburton receive a follow-on \ncontract for the reconstruction of the Iraqi oil industry at a time \nwhen the DCAA, the Defense Contract Audit Agency, had warned that the \ncompany's systems were not up to this challenge.\n  It raised the question, these hearings that were spearhead by Senator \nDorgan, as to whether Halliburton knowingly supplied our troops with \nspoiled food or unsafe drinking water.\n  It raised the question as to whether Halliburton intentionally \nwithheld information from the Government to avoid raising questions \nabout the quality of its performance.\n  There have been only two hearings in our subcommittee. I compliment \nour chairman. Our committee and our subcommittee every year have to \ndeal with a bill, and this bill is in the Chamber. It takes a huge \namount of our time as a practical matter. The two subcommittees that \nhave hearings on this issue which Senator Dorgan raises simply have not \nbeen able to put in the kind of time that a special Truman Committee \ncan to focus on this kind of issue. And that is why I very much support \nthe appointment by the Senate of a Truman Committee on Iraq \ncontracting.\n  When you have this many tens of billions of dollars which are being \nspent and when you have allegations by whistleblowers, people who are \nin the know, that we have been unable to get into or have not gotten \ninto for one reason or another, they have not been investigated or \noverseen by the other committee that might do this, this really needs a \nfocus if we are going to have some credibility in the expenditure of \nthese huge amounts of money in the Iraq war. And this should be done on \na bipartisan basis. It would be with a Truman Committee. It needs to be \ndone in a way which is free of any kind of political taint or political \nslant. But it needs to be done. We have to restore credibility and \nconfidence in this contracting system, and the only way we are going to \ndo that I can see is to have a bipartisan Truman-like committee that \nspends the time, has the staff focus on it, making recommendations \nwhich I think will be similar to the ones that were defeated yesterday \nbut they should not be prejudged. In any event, it could make \nrecommendations to this body, and I would hope we would all welcome \nthose kinds of recommendations.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I could engage my distinguished ranking \nmember in a colloquy, historically this amendment is almost identical \nin form to what came before the Senate on 14 September last fall, 2005. \nIt was defeated by a vote of 53 to 44. And that was on the Commerce-\nState-Justice appropriations bill. Then, with the tenacity of our good \nfriend from North Dakota, he brought the same amendment up again on \nOctober 19, 2005. Again, it was defeated by a vote of 54 to 44 on the \nTransportation appropriations bill.\n  So the Senate on two occasions has examined this before other \ncommittees and defeated it.\n  Now, let's go back a little bit in history, and this is a part of \nSenate history that you have greater familiarity with than do I. Your \ndistinguished predecessor, Senator Nunn, when I worked with him--he was \nchairman, I was the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee--\nthere would be times when he would say, ``John, I simply have to take \noff a week; I have this special committee.'' He was then on the \ncommittee on which you served, I think, throughout your tenure in the \nSenate; now called Homeland Security, it used to be called Government \nOperations. And the Senate as a body some time ago decided to take the \nroots of the Truman Commission, which, indeed, was a successful \noperation, and repose it, place it into the Government Operations \nCommittee, now the Homeland Security Committee.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have been on that committee as long as I have been here.\n  Mr. WARNER. Another 28 years.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That subcommittee has a major agenda and a whole host of \nareas that the chairman has identified, frequently with my support, and \nit has a very full plate. This committee, our committee, has something \nthat that committee does not have, and that is we have the knowledge, \nwe have the information because we are the committee that specializes \nin the work of Halliburton in the field. We are the people who have the \nexperience in terms of what the troops need and how it is provided to \nthe troops. And so our committee also has the ability to handle these \nhearings. Neither committee has seen fit, either because it has too \nfull a plate already--and I think our committee from firsthand \nknowledge is in that situation--has a very full plate, and therefore \nhas not been able or for whatever reason has decided not to look at \nwhat are clearly excesses which need to be reviewed.\n  So it is a matter of finding, identifying Senators who have an \ninterest in this matter who would focus on this\n\n[[Page S5995]]\n\nmatter because of the attention that it deserves.\n  Now, it could be an outside commission. If the chairman would prefer \nthat there be an outside commission to do this, perhaps Senator Dorgan \nwould be willing to do it. But this requires a major undertaking with \nan investigative--you have to identify and set out special staff that \nwill do the investigations on this, and then prepare for hearings. If \nour committee were able to do this, I would be all for it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my good friend, yes, there are \ninstances of fraud and abuse, and work has been done by the Armed \nServices Committee Readiness Subcommittee. I believe Senator Akaka is \non that committee from your side of the aisle. It is a lot of work. It \nis not as if somebody is sitting on their hands.\n  Fraud, waste and abuse within the Federal contracting system, while \nnot pervasive, is a significant problem that we as a Congress must, and \nare, addressing.\n  The potential for fraud, waste and abuse is not limited to just Iraq \nand Afghanistan. Through the use of normal committee legislative tools \nand processes we have uncovered fraudulent and wasteful cases and are \nconducting systemic oversight.\n  The Armed Services Committee has conducted numerous hearings and \nbriefings on acquisition oversight and reform (including oversight of \ncontracting in Iraq) and has initiated investigations by the GAO and \nthe Inspector General on DOD acquisition practices and programs.\n  Other committees, such as Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nand Foreign Relations, with jurisdiction over government contracting, \nhave similar oversight records.\n  The Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction \nwas established to look at Iraqi contracting. The special IG routinely \nbriefs this Committee and others on its findings.\n  Just yesterday we approved an amendment to expand the special IG's \noversight to include a broader range of funds being used to contract \nfor Iraq reconstruction activities.\n  And, as I noted earlier this week, the special IG submits quarterly \nand semi-annual reports to Congress. The inspector general operates a \nhotline for reports of possible waste, fraud and abuse and has \nuncovered criminal activity that has been referred for prosecution.\n  The special inspector general's efforts have yielded important \noversight results and have prompted three specific lessons learned \ninitiatives.\n  The lessons learned initiatives are: (1) human capital management; \n(2) contract management; and (3) program management.\n  The contract management report should be out later this summer.\n  The committee has also addressed contract and acquisition reform \nthrough a series of legislative provisions and initiatives.\n  I will highlight three recent examples:\n  No. 1, Section 817 of last year's defense authorization act addressed \nthe need for a joint contingency contracting plan;\n  No. 2, Section 841 of that same legislation required GAO to review \nefforts of the Department to identify and assess areas of vulnerability \nfor contracting waste, fraud and abuse. This report should be completed \nsoon;\n  No. 3, the committee included a provision in this year's bill to \nbuild on previous oversight efforts in the contracting area. Section \n864 of our bill would require the Department to develop contingency \nprogram management plans. This section is part of a series of \nprovisions designed to improve acquisition and contracting outcomes \nacross the department through better overall program management.\n  I believe our activities, which I have very briefly outlined here, \nrepresent the best approach to conducting oversight. We bring in the \nexperts and have them address systemic and specific problems.\n  We want to avoid an approach that would lead to wasting much of our \noversight efforts on anecdotes of individual fraudulent acts which \nmayor may not show that we have a systemic problem.\n  We need to prosecute those singular cases and protect against fraud, \nwaste and abuse in a way that can still deliver goods and services to \nthe warfighter as quickly as possible.\n  So I say to my colleague, I appreciate his concerns and I look \nforward to working with him to address problems with Federal \nacquisition.\n  However, I do not support the establishment of a new special \nCommittee which would duplicate the work of this Committee and would \nonly look at selected Federal expenditures and contracts.\n  I come back to this creation of the entity that the Senator from \nNorth Dakota wants and I again draw attention to the fact that Homeland \nSecurity has been given by the Senate the overall responsibility and an \ninvestigating committee with special funding, special staff to do \ninvestigations. Senator Nunn utilized it frequently when he was \nchairman of our committee. But there isn't a committee in this body \nthat is not faced from time to time with the subject of fraud, waste, \nand abuse. And the Senate decided, rather than have each of the \ncommittees have their own special investigating team, to put together \nthis subcommittee in the Government Operations Committee to do this \nwork.\n  So I come back to my friend and just ask, why should we create \nsomething additional to what is already present, structured by the \nSenate to address the fraud, waste, and abuse problems in all the \ncommittees that we serve on and it was placed in the Homeland Defense \nCommittee?\n  Mr. LEVIN. There have been requests--I believe from the chairman of \nthe Homeland Security Committee--to get into this. And if the chairman \nwould be willing to sign a letter with me making another request to \nthat chairman to try to find time in either her committee work or in \nSenator Coleman's committee, I would again be very happy to join in \nthat request.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would certainly entertain that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If we are unable do that on our committee, which we have \nnot been able to do anything that needs to be done here--and I \nunderstand the time pressures on the committee because of this annual \nbill we have; I know what is on the plate over at the Governmental \nAffairs Committee and on the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations--\n  Mr. WARNER. You serve on that committee.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is exactly right. I have been there throughout my \ntenure. I am personally familiar with the work they have undertaken. \nBut if Senator Warner would be willing to sign a request to Senator \nCollins, I would be delighted to join in that.\n  Mr. WARNER. What I would suggest we do is have a consultation with \nSenators Collins and Lieberman and then follow up with a letter, if we \ndeem appropriate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That would be fine.\n  Mr. WARNER. That committee has done a prodigious amount of work. I \ncertainly commend the chairman and ranking member of the Homeland \nSecurity Committee. They are workers.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am on that committee, as you pointed out. I know the \nworkload they have. Just yesterday, they completed a markup on one bill \nwhich took 2 days. I don't know of any people who work harder in the \nSenate than do Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman.\n  Mr. WARNER. So we have a procedure on that. For the moment, I suggest \nwe set aside the pending amendment and turn to the matter of trying to \nclear some amendments on this side. Is that appropriate at this time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. That would be fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n\n\n         Amendments Nos. 4254 and 4295, 4296, and 4297, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send a series of amendments to the desk \nwhich have been cleared by myself and the distinguished ranking member. \nI ask unanimous consent that the Senate consider the amendments en \nbloc, the amendments be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating to any of these \nindividual amendments be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not, I just \nwonder if the Senator would identify the Senator who has sponsored the \namendment so that they will hear their amendments have now been \ncleared.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. The Senators I have indicated here on my sheet are\n\n[[Page S5996]]\n\nSenators Sessions, Obama, Allard, Salazar, and I judge that scribbling \nis Senator Warner of Virginia.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4254\n\n  (Purpose: To require the use of competitive procedures for Federal \ncontracts worth over $500,000 related to hurricane recovery, subject to \n    existing limited national security, public interest, and other \n                              exceptions)\n\n       At the end of subtitle I of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1084.

Mr. President, the Senator from Michigan and I have been \nhere, together with the leadership of both sides, making it clear we \nare ready to conduct business on such amendments as may be brought \nbefore the Senate on this bill. I believe at this time we have now \ncompleted such business as was ready. I anticipate the leadership will \nadvise us with regard to the schedule on Monday, and most certainly we \nwill be back up at some point in time during that day to continue. I \nhope I will be joined by my distinguished colleague from Michigan \nurging Senators to come to the floor.\n  On our side of the aisle, I only know of perhaps two amendments that \nmight be offered--one, as you are quite familiar with, by the Senator \nfrom Georgia with regard to certain aircraft programs. That is clear on \nits face. The other one I will work through. Frankly, I would have to \nsay to my colleagues throughout the Senate, most particularly to my \nranking member, I begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel, \ncertainly as regards the amendments that could be forthcoming from this \nside of the aisle.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I was hoping the Senator was referring to Iraq, but since \nhe is referring to our bill, I also see that we ought to be able to \nfinish this next week. We will have a good debate on Iraq, I guess \nprobably next Tuesday. Next Monday, I believe we have an amendment \nlined up.\n  Mr. WARNER. I know the Senator from Georgia wishes to offer his.\n  Mr. LEVIN. On your side of the aisle. After Senator Dorgan offered \nhis today, it would then go to your side of the aisle to offer the next \namendment, if we want to keep that informal order which has been \nestablished.\n  Mr. WARNER. Correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Then we could perhaps pick up the debate on the Dorgan \namendment on Monday after the debate on the judge.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \nintends to revisit his strong approach to some of the situations in \nIraq, particularly regarding troop structure.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wouldn't want to speak for the Senator from \nMassachusetts. I\n\n[[Page S5997]]\n\ndo believe, though, he is working on an amendment. There will be at \nleast two amendments on this side relative to Iraq.\n  Mr. WARNER. In addition to the one from the Senator from \nMassachusetts?\n  Mr. LEVIN. There is one Senator Jack Reed and I are working on, and I \nthink there is one Senator Kerry is working on. I can't speak for \nothers. There may be a number of amendments on this side.\n  Mr. WARNER. I see the distinguished minority whip here. Maybe he \ncould advise us what his ascertainment might be with regard to the \nbalance of amendments on that side.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment related to the \nrendition of prisoners which I would like to say a word about before we \nadjourn today. There may be an indication that there are still a few \nmore amendments to be forthcoming. I will bring my amendment to your \nattention today, and I hope all Members will do the same so that you \ncan plot the schedule for the upcoming week.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we believe there are a number of amendments \nwhich will need debate. It would be useful for all Senators on either \nMonday or Tuesday morning, if they could, to let us know what \namendments they are planning on offering so we could get an estimate--I \nknow you would agree as the floor manager--as to how many amendments \nare out there.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, Senator Frist and I have discussed that. I \nbelieve he is in conversation with the leadership on your side. I \nheartily endorse that approach. Perhaps we could formalize it in some \nway.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think we might be better off not formalizing it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Only in the sense that the two leaders and you and I come \nto the floor. I am not suggesting cloture or anything of that nature. I \nwould hope this bill could be passed on by the Senate without the \nbenefit of any cloture motion.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to ask through the Chair, if \nthis would be an appropriate moment, I would like to speak to the \namendment which I will offer and a few other remarks not to exceed 5 or \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Whatever the distinguished Senator from Illinois wishes, \nplease proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to recognizing the Senator \nfrom Illinois for 10 minutes?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, after wars are completed, history stands \nin judgment of the leaders, not just whether there was a victory or \ndefeat in the war but whether the war was conducted properly. Almost \nwithout fail, history has been a brutal, sometimes difficult judge of \nthe conduct of war. Caught up in concern about protection and security, \nnations do things which don't stand the test of time and reflection. \nThe man I think was our greatest President, Abraham Lincoln, in the \ncourse of the Civil War suspended the writ of habeas corpus. By \nsuspending that writ, he held prisoners without charges and without due \nprocess for long periods of time. It was controversial. Later on, it \nwas judged that perhaps President Lincoln had gone too far.\n  In the midst of the First World War, with our concern over espionage, \nCongress enacted the Sedition Act which unfortunately tarred and \ncondemned innocent Americans, and later on we came to realize that. In \nWorld War II, the most notorious conduct by our own Government was \nagainst our fellow citizens of Japanese ancestry who were interred in \ncamps, innocent people. I know some of them. I have grown up with some \nof them. I know they carry scars from that incarceration. Throughout \nour history, as we reflect, we find there are things we should not have \ndone in the course of a war.\n  I have said on this floor several times that I believe eventually \nhistory will be a very strenuous judge of our conduct in this war on \nterror when it comes to the use of torture. For decades, the United \nStates had established a clear standard that we would never engage in \ntorture--cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. Then after 9/11, in \nthe shock and fear that followed, this administration ended up trying \nto rewrite the standards for interrogation and torture. It wasn't a \nproud chapter in our history. We now know the administration abandoned \nthat effort after some time. We know as well that some of the people \nwho were involved in it have been reluctant to even discuss what they \nwere doing. But there was a good ending when last year Senator John \nMcCain offered an amendment in the Senate to state unequivocally that \nthe United States would not engage in the torture of prisoners, not \nengage in cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment of prisoners.\n\n  The reasons are obvious. Prisoners who are being tortured will say \nanything. It doesn't have to be true. Secondly, the standard we set in \nthe treatment of our prisoners could one day be used against Americans \nwho are taken as prisoners. So not only does it give you invalid \ninformation, it sets a standard that we never want our soldiers to be \nsubjected to.\n  By a vote of 90 to 9, the Senate enacted John McCain's standard for \ntorture, saying that we were not abandoning our longstanding commitment \nto it. I was happy to cosponsor that effort. There was a debate where \nVice President Cheney came forward and said we need to make an \nexception for agents of intelligence agencies in our Government. Thank \ngoodness, the Vice President's recommendation was rejected. The \nPresident signed it, and I hope he is living by it. Sadly, most of that \nis being done behind closed doors, and we won't know for a long time, \nif ever, whether it is being followed. I trust the word of the \nPresident when he says we are not engaging in torture. Now comes the \nnext chapter.\n  If the President's words are an indication, Guantanamo Bay is likely \nto be closed. That is a good thing. Guantanamo Bay and the prisoners \nwho are being held there have to be moved to a different situation. If \nthey are in fact a danger to the United States or to any soldiers or \nany person we value, they should be charged and held or held as enemy \ncombatants. But if they are being held for intelligence purposes, we \nshould be honest. After 3 years, for goodness' sake, what value could \nthey possibly bring to our intelligence?\n  Several hundred men are being held. Last week, there was the \nstartling discovery that three had committed suicide. It is an \nindication to me that Guantanamo Bay should be closed, as the President \nhas suggested. I hope it is sooner rather than later.\n  Then what will happen to the prisoners? The amendment I will offer \nsays that if we are going to be involved in the rendition of these \nprisoners, the transfer of these prisoners to some other place, some \nother country, we need to make sure that country abides by the same \nstandards of humane conduct to which the United States ascribes. We \ncannot be content in sending these prisoners to some other place where \nthey will be subjected to torture if, in fact, we have expressed a \nvalue in the United States that we are opposed to torture. That is what \nthe amendment will say, that we make that effort to ascertain and to \nreview regularly those detention facilities to make sure they live by \nthat same standard.\n  There has been a debate this week in Washington over the war in Iraq. \nIt was also a week when the Department of Defense reported that we have \nlost 2,500 soldiers. White House spokesperson Tony Snow was asked to \ncomment on this loss of 2,500. I am sure the statement he made doesn't \nreflect what he really feels in his heart when he said:\n  It's a number.\n  I am sure he feels as we all do that it is more than a number. It is \nmore than an aggregate. It is 2,500 precious lives that have been lost \nby men and women in uniform willing to stand and serve and risk their \nlives for America.\n  I have attended some of the funerals. They are heartbreaking. Most of \nthe soldiers are very young. I recall going down to southern Illinois \nwhere the funeral service was right outside the farmhouse where this \nyoung man grew up, down in Perry County. His mom and dad brought out \nfor us to see, around the tent where the service was taking place, \nlittle souvenirs from his life--his fishing rods, his hunting rifle. We \nwere just a few feet away from the tree house he and his dad built. I \nwill never forget that scene as long as I live. It was a reminder that \nbefore he was in uniform, he was a son, he was a boy. Their \nheartbreaking experience will be with them for a long time. There are \n2,499 other stories just like\n\n[[Page S5998]]\n\nthat of grief which will be shared by families for years to come.\n\n  We are debating now what should we do in Iraq. The idea that we pull \nout our troops quickly, precipitously, is unacceptable. It would leave \na situation which I am afraid would descend further into chaos and \nmaybe create more instability and more problems to come.\n  But here is what worries me. When the President of the United States \ngoes to Iraq and says to our enemies in Iraq that we are here to stay, \nthat may be a strong message to our enemies of our resolve, but it is \nthe wrong message to our allies and friends. The Iraqis have to \nunderstand we are not going to stay indefinitely. Think of what we have \ndone in this country, not only giving 2,500 of our best and bravest \nlives, not only having 20,000 of our soldiers come home, half of them \nwith serious permanent injuries, 2,000 of them with head injuries, not \nonly spending $300 billion in behalf of this effort in Iraq, not only \nsacrificing at home where we can't afford to fund medical research, \nAmtrak, education, health care, and the programs which Americans value, \nnot only all these things, but we have been successful; we have deposed \ntheir dictator, Saddam Hussein; we dug him out of a hole in the ground \nand put him on trial.\n  We have given the Iraqis more than ample opportunity to control their \nfate and future. We offered them free elections. We have given them a \nchance to form a government. We have given this country so much in the \n3 years we have been there. Now we must say to them: The day has come \nwhen you must stand and defend your own country. If you value Iraq as a \nnation, be prepared to stand and fight and maybe even die on behalf of \nthat nation. But if we say to the Iraqis that we are staying there \nindefinitely, it is the best deal on Earth because it is the best \nmilitary on Earth that will be there for them serving as a babysitter \nand a referee in an ongoing civil war for an indeterminate amount of \ntime.\n  How many more lives will America give to this conflict before the \nIraqis stand and defend their own nation? And when the President and \nmany in the Chamber here don't want to speak to any kind of withdrawal \ndate, they are suggesting to the Iraqis we are there to stay. That is \nthe wrong message. We need to tell them that we have fought and offered \nour best for their future and that they need to accept that \nresponsibility from this point forward.\n  This week, I stood in silence at my desk on the floor of the Senate \nwith my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in reverence to the 2,500 \nlives that have been lost, saying a prayer for their memory and their \nfamilies, thinking as well of the veterans who have come home, some \nbroken in body and in spirit, who have done so much for this country. \nWe owe it to them, we owe it to their families to reach a point where \nwe can come home with our mission truly accomplished.\n  It is more than just a number. Mr. President, 2,500 of our soldiers \nhave given their lives. When this came up initially, I voted against \nauthorization for war. I believed at the time that the administration \nhad misled us as to what was happening there, this threat of weapons of \nmass destruction and nuclear weapons and connections with \n9/11. It turned out they were all false. None of it was true, and we \nwent to war anyway. We were told as soon as we arrived that the Iraqi \nArmy would turn on Saddam Hussein and join us in the fight, and that \ndidn't happen. We were told the Iraqi people would greet us with open \narms, and I know many are appreciative for what we have done, but it is \nstill so unsafe in that country. The average soldier just going down \nthe street in a military vehicle is risking his life every single day, \nmore than 3 years after our invasion.\n  Having voted against that authorization for war, though, I have voted \nfor every penny this President asked for. I lived through Vietnam. I \nremember what happened. An unpopular war was taken out on our soldiers, \nand that is not fair. Our soldiers did what we asked of them in the \nVietnam war, as they are doing today. Politicians and elected officials \ncan debate and differ on policy, but the bottom line is our soldiers \nare serving us and we should stand by them. I voted for every penny \nbecause of one basic standard: If it were my son or daughter in \nuniform, I would want them to have everything they needed to come home \nsafely. That is the way I feel, and that is why I voted this week for \nthe supplemental appropriation. But that won't stop me today and in the \ncoming days from challenging this administration and challenging this \nCongress to make it clear that the Iraqis have to stand and fight and \ndefend, and the American troops are coming home. It is only when that \nhappens that we can truly say that our mission is accomplished.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to share a few thoughts \nabout the Strategic Forces Subcommittee of the Armed Services \nCommittee, which I chair, which deals with space, missile defense, \nsatellites, and many of the other high-tech systems on which our \nDefense Department relies. But I just want to respond to my colleague, \nSenator Durbin. I don't think he actually meant to say that our \nsoldiers are coming home broken in body and spirit, but he came close. \nThat is not what I am hearing. Go out to Walter Reed. They may have \nbroken bodies and broken bones, but they are not broken in spirit.\n  The night before last, I attended a wonderful ceremony of the 231st \nbirthday of the U.S. Army. I was talking with soldiers there. We were \ntalking about the war and the politics of the Capitol. They are aware \nof what is going on. I told them that I thought the Congress would not \nvote for any immediate withdrawal, and indeed we voted yesterday 93 to \n6 against any kind of withdrawal requirement for this year. That vote, \nrepresents a strong bipartisan consensus of the Senate. One of those \nsoldiers said: I will tell you what we want, Senator; ``We want to \nwin.'' We want to win this war. That is what the American people want, \nthat is what the soldiers who have gone there and sacrificed want, and \nthat is what they believe in. The soldiers who have been there believe \nin what they have done. They have been courageous in performing their \nmission.\n  It is difficult for me and for them to understand this idea that we \ncan support the soldiers but not support the mission we sent them on, \nsent them by a three-fourths vote of this Senate. A majority of \nDemocrats and Republicans voted for this war, and we are going to stay \nthe course, we are going to help our military succeed, and we are going \nto help them win.\n  The point I pick up more and more as I talk with these soldiers, what \nI am hearing from them, is they are afraid we are going to mess it up. \nThey believe they are winning. They believe they are doing their job. \nThey believe they will be successful. And they are really worried that \nthis Congress will be the one that will lose its nerve and not stand \nwith them after they put their lives on the line for this country.\n\n  I believe this is a big deal, and that success in Iraq is important \nfor our Nation. I visited that region recently. I talked to the leaders \nof Turkey, Kuwait, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. What would it mean for us \nif we had a disastrous event in Iraq where the terrorists take over \nthat country? What would it mean to their neighbors? What would it mean \nto the region? All nations of good will know we must succeed.\n  Iraq is stepping up. There are now 260,000 Iraqi soldiers and \nsecurity personnel in uniform and reaching higher and higher levels of \nperformance. They are doing a much better job every day. They will soon \nbe at 350,000 by the end of this year. They are being better equipped \nand better trained, and I believe we are doing a much smarter job of \nimbedding our soldiers with the Iraqi units so we can call in air \nsupport, we can provide mentoring, we can provide advice, we can call \non other kinds of support, if they need it, to be effective.\n  A majority of the raids and actions that are taking place in Iraq are \ntaking place by the Iraqis. Iraqi soldiers are taking more casualties \nthan American soldiers. We are not babysitting them. This image of \nmillions casting their ballots for a freely elected government of Iraq \nis not a bad image for us to remember. We need to remember that, and it \nis important for us, let me note first and foremost, that this Nation \nnot allow the terrorists to win in Iraq.\n\n[[Page S5999]]\n\n  We are going to be successful. But I realize the American people are \nconcerned. They don't like to see violence and continued death. They \ndon't like to see our soldiers at risk. I certainly understand that; \nneither do I.\n  I have been an admirer of General Abizaid, CENTCOM commander, and his \nteam of generals because General Abizaid has always resisted the \ntemptation to see how many troops we can put in Iraq. He said that is \nnot the way to win this war. We need the right number of troops, and we \nneed to begin to draw them down as soon as it is appropriate to draw \nthem down and lift up the Iraqi Army. That is what we need to do.\n  Some want to have the President set forth a detailed plan so they can \ncriticize it, basically. How will some sort of formalized plan help our \nsoldiers be effective in the battle? It just tells your enemy what you \nare going to be doing. More importantly, a detailed plan is not going \nto be permanent. It will have to change because the enemy changes. As \nsoon as you shut off one avenue of enemy success, they take another one \nand you have to respond to that. That is the history of warfare. That \nis the way wars have always been fought: you constantly adjust and \nconstantly alter your efforts to be successful toward your ultimate \ngoal of victory. That is what our military is doing.\n  Trying to demand a date from our military to withdraw or trying to \ndemand from them a plan of what they are going to do 5 months from now \nfails to understand and recognize the nature of this conflict, and this \nconflict more than most conflicts because we face an asymmetrical \nenemy, a nontraditional enemy, who knows it cannot stand and fight our \nmilitary successfully, so it devises devious and sneaky ways to pit one \nreligion against another, to attack American soldiers, to attack the \nlocal police, all designed to crumble the Government of Iraq. But it \nhasn't happened. Iraqis are still signing up and becoming policemen. \nIraqis are still signing up and the army is growing. The Government of \nIraq has elected, for the first time, their permanent leadership.\n  Prime Minister Maliki is in office. His whole Cabinet now has been \nestablished. The two key Cabinet positions on which they spent extra \ntime, Defense and Interior, have now been established, confirmed and \nvoted by the 275 member Parliament. So they have their government now, \nfully elected, a permanent government, just like any other nation in \nthe world. There is no interim government now.\n  I believe they are going to be successful, and I tell you, it is \ngoing to be important for the United States that they are. We have \ninvested a lot; our soldiers have invested a lot. They are proud of \nwhat they are doing. They are not broken in spirit. They want to be \nsuccessful and win.\n  I have some numbers I will share with my colleagues and those around \nthe country who might be listening. In this conflict, the Army has had \nthe largest number of people serving in Iraq, yet their enlistment rate \nthrough May of this year was 104.3 percent. They have exceeded their \nenlistment goals for this year. They have exceeded their reenlistment \ngoals. The Army for a few months did miss their goals, and some critics \nsaid it was a broken Army and predicted disaster. The Army said: No, we \nare not broken, and we are going to meet our goals. For 13 consecutive \nmonths, the Army has met its goals. The highest retention reenlistment \nrates come from the units that have just come back from Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n\n  Staff Sergeant Barr, who was at Walter Reed, was injured by an \nexplosive device. He was punctured by as many as 100 different pieces \nof shrapnel. He was told he would have difficulty walking and would \nprobably never run again. He said he was going to run again, and he was \ngoing back to Iraq with the unit that he came with. And he worked at it \nand he worked at it and he ran. He eventually went back to Iraq and \nserved again. That is the kind of spirit that we have. That is the kind \nof spirit that you see in our Army.\n  I was told by an officer who knew that story that every single \nsoldier in his squad reenlisted. This is the spirit that this Congress \nneeds to strive to be worthy of. This is the kind of professional \ncommitment and courage that inspires us, or should inspire us. We \nshould not be whining around here and trying to find some error that \nwas made somewhere where body armor did not get to a soldier. Body \narmor is out there protecting soldiers. It is not a problem. To say \nthat there has never been a shortage somewhere or somehow a supply \nfailed to get where it was supposed to, I can't say; but it is not a \nsystemic problem. But to go around and suggest to the citizens of our \ncountry that this Congress and the military is not committed to \nproviding body armor to our soldiers is bogus and false and undermines \nwhat they are doing. It must be most confusing to our soldiers there.\n  But I think the vote yesterday should give them confidence that most \nof this talk is simply politics. Most of it is just complaining and \nsecond-guessing, like is done on the floor of the Senate every day. We \nhear it every day on many issues and debate and criticism is passed of \nthe strength of American Government.\n  But I would urge my colleagues to think differently about soldiers in \nconflict, soldiers in harm's way. We need to be careful what we are \nsaying here. It may sound good, it may hurt President Bush, to make \nthis allegation or that allegation, but is it perhaps creating in the \neyes of our enemies a belief that we are divided, that we won't stay \nthe course, and that if they just kill enough people, civilians, \nAmericans, Iraqis, that somehow, it will all just fail. Is that the \npossibility that we are creating? That is why I urge my colleagues to \nbe very careful and watch what you say in terms of attacks on the \nefforts that our military have so courageously undertaken in Iraq. \nThings happen in war. Bad things happen. But no military has done a \nbetter job of striving for perfection than ours has.\n  I would also like to respond to charges that this Nation is going to \nbe embarrassed historically because we have tortured people that were \ncaptured in this war on terrorism. We talked about Lincoln. Lincoln \neliminated the writ of habeas corpus. Roosevelt, as Senator Durbin \nsaid, locked people up, Japanese Americans, in a way that was not \njustified. He basically takes a view, as so many seem to be saying on \nthe left and on the Democratic side, that we have a policy of torture \nin the United States. That is not so. The President has repeatedly, \ntime and time again, said: We have no policy of torture; we do not \ntorture.\n  There is a statute in the United States Code passed shortly before I \ncame here that defines and prohibits torture. It does not say you can \nnever put any stress on someone, but it says you can't subject them to \ntorture, and it defines it precisely.\n  They say, well, what about Abu Ghraib. Let me remind everybody, we \nlearned about Abu Ghraib when the Army general reported what happened \nin Abu Ghraib. Let me remind people that what happened to those \nprisoners in Abu Ghraib, so wrong that it was, had nothing to do with \ninterrogation, had nothing to do with any plan of torture. These were \nnot even prisoners who had any intelligence. It was the late graveyard \nshift and a group of soldiers lost their discipline--lost their \ndiscipline under the stress of war--and performed in a way that got \nthem prosecuted and sent to jail by the U.S. military. That was not the \npolicy of the United States of America. We have heard this most complex \nchain of thoughts and reasoning, this complex chain of reasoning which \nis almost laughable, and is worthy of the most incredible conspiracy \ntheorists, that somehow President Bush is responsible for what happened \nin Abu Ghraib.\n  It is not so. The military responded firmly and aggressively to this \nterrible wrong. And do you remember the story--I know the Presiding \nOfficer does--of the fine African-American colonel under the stress of \nattacks on his men in Iraq, he fired a gun near the head of an enemy \nthat had been captured in order to attempt to frighten him and to get \nintelligence from him. Apparently, he got some intelligence of value \nthat he believed helped protect the lives of his soldiers. But do you \nknow what. He was booted out of the military because we don't tolerate \nthat kind of thing. His actions went beyond what our standards allow, \nand he was cashiered from the Army. A fine person with a fine career \nwho made a big mistake, and he paid for it because we don't accept that \nkind of thing.\n\n[[Page S6000]]\n\n  It is demeaning, it is dishonest, it is wrong to suggest that we have \na policy to torture prisoners. With regard to Guantanamo, I know the \nPresident said he would like to see it closed. Well, I want to know \nwhat he is going to do with those prisoners. I have been there twice. \nThose soldiers do their jobs under difficult conditions every single \nday. They are highly professional. They do not allow themselves to be \nbaited into overreacting when these prisoners display the worst kinds \nof anti-Americanism.\n  Until just recently, not a single captive had died at Guantanamo. Now \nwe have three suicides. So I suppose that is our fault now, that we had \nthree people commit suicide who were being held down there. These are \nnot bad conditions at all. They are good conditions. They are treated \nfine. They are given the Koran, given places to worship, given places \nto exercise, and given all kinds of things that most prisons around the \nworld don't give to the prisoners of their own countries, much less to \nthe people who want to destroy their country.\n  But what I would say is this: They committed suicide. Those suicides \nwere a political statement. They were their efforts to attack and \nundermine the United States. Their fervent desire was that Members of \nthis Senate and the House of Representatives would use their deaths to \nspeak on the floor to try to undermine our war against terrorism to \nmake us less successful in the war on terrorism. That is exactly what \ntheir goal was. And, I would say this: does anyone in this Chamber \ndoubt that if they had access to a bomb, they would have put that bomb \non their body and killed anybody they could have? They would have \nkilled themselves to promote their terrorist agenda. If they had been \ngiven the opportunity, wouldn't they have put a bomb on and killed \nothers at the same time?\n  I say those suicides are an absolute indication that we have in \nGuantanamo some of the most dangerous terrorists in the world.\n  Now, I heard an official of our great ally, the United Kingdom, say \nwe ought to close Guantanamo. I wanted to write him and say: Do you \nwant to take these prisoners to the U.K.? Do you want to hold them? And \nthen if you get tired of holding them, are you just going to let them \ngo in London on your subways and on your buses? Then the critics worry \nthat if we turn them back to their home countries and we have a \nrendition of the prisoners back to their home countries, that we have \nto guarantee that they are going to be treated wonderfully. So we can't \nkeep them in Guantanamo, we can't--who else wants them? We can't even \nsend them back to their home countries to be held in prison, \napparently.\n  So this reminds me of nuclear waste. Everybody has nuclear waste, but \nnobody wants to do anything with it, and they use the argument that you \ncan't dispose of nuclear waste to try to block nuclear power. So this \nis just another attempt to make it more difficult, in my view, for us \nto be successful in handling these prisoners. They are not being \ntortured at Guantanamo. It is not the policy of the United States to \ntorture anyone, and they are not being tortured. The few people who \nviolated our high standards have been disciplined and punished.\n  So let me say this in conclusion, Mr. President. The good news is \nthat we have free debate here, and we get to duke it out and we get to \nhave our say. We just voted yesterday 93 to 6 to declare we have no \nintention of any precipitous withdrawal from Iraq; that we are going to \nstand there with our soldiers, and we are going to stand with our \nallies in Iraq and help them establish a free, decent, democratic \ngovernment, a government that will be to our national interests to an \nincredible degree. It will be more valuable than most people can \ncomprehend to us and to the world to have a decent, peaceful Iraq and \nto defeat the terrorists there who want to take it over and make it \ntheir place.\n  The other good news is that we have had a very successful attack on \nthe CEO of terrorism, Zarqawi, and he has been killed. He clearly was \nthe No. 1 executive officer of terrorism in the world, and that was a \nbig victory.\n  We also now completed the confirmation of the Defense Minister and \nthe Interior Minister for Iraq, so the entire Cabinet is in place, and \nan entire government is in place. The Iraqi Army continues to get \nbetter, and it continues to grow, and we are beginning to see the \npossibility that our troops can be withdrawn. If we have to send more \ntroops there, I will listen to the commanders. If they can bring the \ntroops down, that will make me happy. We are going to listen to our \ncommanders and do what it takes and continue this process in a way that \nleads to--what? Victory. That is what the soldiers we have sent there \nwant, that is what the American people want, and that is what we in \nthis Congress have to do; to figure out how to help our military people \ngo forward and achieve victory. That will be my effort, and I think for \nthe most part that is the bipartisan consensus of this Senate.\n  Mr. President, again, I finish with a tribute to the professionalism \nof those in service, to the risk they have incurred; how they have \nattempted to conduct the violence of war in a way that mitigates \ncivilian casualties and that reflects the highest ideals of the United \nStates of America. I could not be more proud of their service. The \nconduct of this war on terrorism will be received as the most humane \nand careful war in history.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, let me begin by saying I very much share the view of \nthe Senator from Alabama about our troops. Day in and day out, they \nbring the utmost professionalism and the utmost courage and valor to \nthe cause of standing up for American values. I very much share his \nviews with respect to the tribute we ought to be paying to those who \nserve us, who wear the uniform of the United States and who do it with \nsuch extraordinary patriotism and service to our country.\n  (Mr. SESSIONS assumed the Chair.)\n  What I am here to talk about, though, is the political decisions that \nare made and how they affect those courageous troops and how they \naffect the security of the country.\n  In March of this year, at a press conference, a reporter asked \nPresident Bush:\n\n       Will there come a day, and I'm not asking you when, not \n     asking for a timetable--will there come a day when there will \n     be no more American forces in Iraq?\n\n  The President responded:\n\n       That, of course, is an objective and that will be decided \n     by future Presidents and future governments of Iraq.\n       . . . decided by future Presidents. . . .\n       . . . decided by future Presidents. . . .\n       . . . decided by future Presidents. . . .\n\n  I found that statement troubling for two major reasons. First, \nstaying in Iraq for years and years, in my view, will threaten \nAmericans' preparedness to deal with a host of other threats that ought \nto concern all of us. Certainly at the top of that list would be Iran \nand North Korea, but suffice it to say, it is a dangerous world.\n  I serve on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. I know the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama has a great interest in military \naffairs. No Senator who looks at the facts and the world in a realistic \nway would conclude otherwise. It is a dangerous world. There are real \nthreats to our country. It is my view that to stay and stay and stay in \nIraq will threaten the preparedness of our country at a dangerous time.\n  Second, it seems to me that making this kind of open-ended commitment \nto stay in Iraq, an open-ended commitment that in effect says we will \nbe there at least until 2009, doesn't send the right message to the \nIraqis about getting serious about their most serious challenges. For \nexample, when I was recently in Iraq with my colleague, Senator Snowe, \nI was especially troubled by the Iraqis' response to my concerns about \ncorruption in the Iraqi oil sector. We all know that 90 percent of the \nrevenue generated in Iraq comes from oil, and there has been one \nindependent analysis after another documenting widespread corruption in \nIraq's oil sector. I brought that to the attention of the officials \nSenator Snowe and I met with on our trip. Essentially, the response was \none of denial: Well, Senator, it really isn't that bad; well, Senator, \nwe are getting serious about it; well, Senator, we are thinking about \ntrying X, Y, and Z.\n  But I say to the Senate today that we continue to read these \nindependent\n\n[[Page S6001]]\n\nanalyses which have documented widespread corruption and malfeasance in \nthe Iraqi oil sector. Yet it is not being dealt with. My view is that \nto say the future of American forces in Iraq will be decided by future \nPresidents is yet another signal to the Iraqis that they have plenty of \ntime to deal with serious problems like corruption in the oil sector, \nwhich should have been dealt with some time ago.\n  Again, I share the view of the Senator from Alabama concerning the \nprofessionalism of our troops. Our country and the world is better as a \nresult of the death of Mr. Zarqawi. The kind of carnage and the brutal \ncampaign that Mr. Zarqawi conducted is well understood. We are all very \nhopeful, because we all root for success in Iraq, that this will deal a \nblow to the insurgency. Our soldiers and all concerned ought to be \nproud of what they accomplished in taking down Zarqawi. I am proud of \nthem. I know the Senator from Alabama is as well.\n  But let us think about the implications of overstretching our Armed \nForces. That is why I say I am troubled about what is going to happen \nto American preparedness for a dangerous world if we stay and stay and \nstay--until at least 2009. Oregon Guard members, for example, of whom \nwe are exceptionally proud, are on their third rotation in the theater. \nSome Active-Duty Forces are on their fourth rotation. Others are \ngetting ready for their fifth rotation into harm's way. I am sure that \nis also the case in Alabama. I am sure it is also the case in every \npart of the United States. I will tell the Senate today that I think \nthe stress our courageous Armed Forces are dealing with now is at the \npoint where, if we can't get the Iraqis to speed up securing their own \ndefense, this is going to undermine America's preparedness to deal with \na dangerous world.\n  Our Armed Forces are maintaining an exceptional level of \nprofessionalism under exceptional stress, but at a certain point it is \njust not possible to continue in that way and be ready for the kinds of \ncrises and the kinds of national security challenges that exist today. \nSo the preparedness of our U.S. military to deal with a host of \nnational security challenges hinges on what happens in Iraq. The more \nresponsibility the Iraqis take for their future, the less the United \nStates must shoulder, and the sooner we can start bringing our troops \nhome.\n  When our President says that a future American President will decide \nwhen to bring U.S. troops home, it seems to me that sends a message to \nthe Iraqis that they have a lot more time. For the sake of \npreparedness, for the sake of Iraq securing its own future, we have to \nspeed this timetable up. American troops cannot and should not be in \nIraq forever.\n  Shortly, I will introduce a very simple resolution. It is a sense of \nthe Senate on the President's intention to keep U.S. forces in Iraq \nuntil at least 2009. The resolution is very simple. I will just read it \nthis afternoon:\n\n       That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the members of the Armed Forces deserve the enormous \n     respect and support of the Senate and the American people for \n     the sacrifices that they are making on behalf of our country; \n     and\n       (2) the President's intention, as stated on March 21, 2006, \n     that ``future Presidents'' will determine whether to keep \n     members of the Armed Forces in Iraq undermines the \n     preparedness of the United States military to respond to \n     other crises and should not be supported.\n\n  I will close. Again I pick up on the Chair's statement about the \ncommitment of our troops and their courage and their valor. This is \nnot, today, a debate about whether it was right to go to war. We had \nthat debate. I was on the side that voted against, and other Senators \nwere for it. We are long past that point. What we are dealing with now \nis how to win the peace. That is something which all Senators should be \nlooking to try to work together on and find some bipartisan common \nground.\n  I commend the Senator from Alabama for his statement about our \ntroops. But I do believe we have to find a way to get beyond some of \nthese artificial choices--like cutting and running or staying the \ncourse. Hopefully we can do that. I believe one area for bipartisan \ncooperation should be to try to speed up Iraq taking over its own \nfuture.\n  I was very troubled by the statement that it was the President's \nintention that the future of our Armed Forces in Iraq would be dealt \nwith by future Presidents. We have to deal with it now. We have to find \na way to win the peace and do it on a bipartisan basis. I intend to \nwork with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to advance this goal, \nwhich is not about whether you are for the war or against the war, it \nis today about winning the peace, and that is why I will be offering my \nresolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, as chairman of the Budget Committee, I \nregularly comment on appropriations bills that are brought to the \nSenate for consideration and present the fiscal comparisons and \nbudgetary data. I believe it is useful to expand that practice, when \nrequired, for authorization bills that we consider.\n  S. 2766, the national Defense authorization bill for fiscal year \n2007, is, of course, one of the most important bills the Congress \nbrings up on an annual basis. As Senators know, the Budget Committee \ndoes not enforce the levels of the authorizations of appropriations \ncontained in the bill, even though they constitute the vast majority of \nprograms and projects addressed. Ultimately, those authorizations of \nappropriations only spend money once the Appropriations Committee acts \non its Defense bill.\n  But there is another category of spending in the Defense \nauthorization bill which the Budget Committee does enforce because \npassage of this bill and its signature by the President would create \nautomatic spending. By that, I mean the direct spending or mandatory \nspending provisions in the bill.\n  According to a Congressional Budget Office estimate of June 9, 2006, \nS. 2766 as reported increases budget authority for mandatory spending \nby $458 million in fiscal year 2007 and $1.508 billion over the next 5 \nyears. Corresponding outlays are $307 million in fiscal year 2007 and \n$1.416 billion over the next 5 years.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table of direct \nspending for S. 2766 excerpted from CBO's official cost estimate be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      TABLE 4.--ESTIMATED IMPACT OF S. 2766 ON DIRECT SPENDING AND REVENUES\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                          By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--\n                                           ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                             2007   2008   2009   2010   2011   2012   2013   2014   2015   2016\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                           CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING\n \nMilitary Housing in Korea:\n    Estimated Budget Authority............    160    160    160      0      0      0      0      0      0      0\n    Estimated Outlays.....................     10     58    109    126     92     48     22     10      5      0\nPilot Projects for Military Housing:\n    Estimated Budget Authority............      0      0     30      0      0      0      0      0      0      0\n    Estimated Outlays.....................      0      0      4     14      9      2      1      0      0      0\nMaximum Term of Leases for Overseas\n Facilities:\n    Estimated Budget Authority............      1      2      5      5      5      5      5      5      5      5\n    Estimated Outlays.....................      *      1      3      5      5      5      5      5      5      5\nSBP Benefits:\n    Estimated Budget Authority............     53     57     61     63     66     68     70     72     74     76\n    Estimated Outlays.....................     53     57     61     63     66     68     70     72     74     76\nPaid-Up SBP:\n    Estimated Budget Authority............    202    213      0      0      0      0      0      0      0      0\n    Estimated Outlays.....................    202    213      0      0      0      0      0      0      0      0\nTRICARE Pharmacy Program:\n    Estimated Budget Authority............     42     61     62     54     46     39     31     22     12      2\n    Estimated Outlays.....................     42     61     62     54     46     39     31     22     12      2\n\n[[Page S6002]]\n\n \n    Total Changes:\n        Estimated Budget Authority........    458    493    318    122    117    112    106     99     91     83\n        Estimated Outlays.................    307    390    239    262    218    162    129    109     96     83\n \n                                               CHANGES IN REVENUES\n \nThrift Savings Plan: Estimated Revenues...      *      *      *      *      *      *      *      *      *      *\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNOTES.--Numbers in the text may differ from figures shown here because of rounding.

Mr. President, in evaluating our needs in the Department \nof Defense authorization bill, key factors will be our relationship \nwith Iran and North Korea as we face two major problems of two nations: \none having nuclear weapons and the other appearing to be intent on \ndeveloping nuclear weapons. I applaud the President's recent move to \nagree to bilateral negotiations with Iran subject to certain \nconditions, and I think he was precisely correct in saying that \nnotwithstanding the difficulties with Iran and their apparent \nintransigence, that all diplomatic efforts ought to be explored before \nany consideration is given to the use of military force. I think that \nis a way to approach the international issues. While we deal with some \nof these tough adversaries, all options should theoretically remain on \nthe table. But to the extent that these problems can be solved through \ndiplomacy, that is obviously the preferable course.\n  In dealing with countries such as Iran and North Korea, it is \ndifficult when the United States has branded them as the ``axis of \nevil.'' But President Reagan invited Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev to a \ndialogue within weeks after labeling the U.S.S.R. as the ``evil \nempire.'' So it is possible to have some tough dialogue and some tough \nrhetoric and, at the same time, work toward negotiations, no matter how \ndifficult the adversary or potential adversary may be.\n  Early in my activities and public service, when I was an assistant \ndistrict attorney in Philadelphia, I had an occasion to interview \ninmates at the State prison, Rockview, who were under the death \nsentence. Joining the district attorney's office, I was low man on the \ntotem pole, and the low man got the job of traveling to the State \nprison and talking to people under the death penalty, people who wanted \nto have their death sentences commuted. It was quite an experience. \nVery, very tough people who had committed heinous crimes, outrageous \nlives, bad backgrounds, about as tough a gang as you could find off the \nstreets of Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and other parts of the State who \nhad committed murders so atrocious that they had gotten the death \npenalty. That taught me a lesson, leading me to the conclusion that if \nyou could talk to people like that, you could talk to anybody. You \ndon't have to agree with people, but there is no reason not to talk. I \nam aware that it is a significant transfer to apply that kind of an \nexperience to international diplomacy, but I think it has some weight.\n  There are those who oppose talking to Iran or North Korea on a \nbilateral basis because we don't want to recognize them, we don't want \nto give them any status. I think a comprehensive answer was made to \nthat by Richard Armitage, who was Deputy Secretary of State right under \nColin Powell during President Bush's first term. This is what Mr. \nArmitage had to say:\n\n       It appears that the administration thinks that dialogue \n     equates with weakness, that we have called these regimes evil \n     and, therefore, we won't talk to them. Some people say that \n     talking would legitimize the regimes. But we are not trying \n     to change the regimes, and they are already legitimatized in \n     the eyes of the international community. So we ought to have \n     enough confidence in our ability as diplomats to go eye-to-\n     eye with people, even though we disagree in the strongest \n     possible way, and come away without losing anything.\n\n  Our relationship with Iran has obviously been extremely difficult \nsince the Shah was deposed in 1979. And Iran is a proud country with a \nproud history. There is, at least, some part of the motivation to \nbecome a nuclear power, nuclear military force to be with the big boys \nas a matter of international status. I think if we were willing to meet \nwith Iran in a straightforward, diplomatic way as negotiating equals--\nthe United States is never going to be equal with Iran because of the \ngreat difference in our power in the international field--but I do \nbelieve that our foreign policy would be enhanced if we treated foreign \nleaders, foreign countries with more dignity and respect. I think it \nwould be a significant step forward if Iran were treated as a \ndiplomatic and negotiating equal, that it might take some of the \npressure off their determination to be a nuclear military power or, at \na minimum, I think it is worth a try.\n  I made my first trip to the Mideast back in 1964, and in the \nintervening 42 years I have made almost 30 trips to the region. I tried \nto go to Iran shortly after the Iran-Iraq war ended in 1988, and my \nefforts to go there have never been successful. It is possible to \ntravel to Iran as a tourist, but it is not--they are not receptive to \nhaving an official visit.\n  In the absence of being able to go to Iran, I have contacted and had \ndiscussions with two of the Iranian Ambassadors to the United Nations. \nI made my first contact back in May of the year 2000, a little more \nthan 6 years ago, and I discussed with the Iranian Ambassador to the \nUnited Nations the possibility of an exchange of parliamentarians; that \na group of Members of the Senate and the House of Representatives might \nmeet with a group of parliamentarians from the Iranian Parliament. I \ninvited the Iranian Ambassador to the United Nations to a dinner in my \nhideaway, my office here in Washington, attended by a number of \nMembers. I then met with his successor in August of 2003 and had moved \ntoward concrete plans to have a group of Iranian parliamentarians meet \nwith Members of Congress in Switzerland in January of 2004, but \nunfortunately, those plans fell through because there was a concurrent, \nharsh exchange of rhetoric, and the Iranians were not willing to meet \nat that time.\n  There was a significant development when the Iranian President, on \nMay 8 of this year, sent President Bush an 18-page letter, and the \nPresident appropriately responded, showing interest in having \nnegotiations with Iran. We had been pursuing efforts to have diplomatic \npressure applied by Iran in concert with our European allies, trying to \ninvolve China and trying to involve Russia, and then Secretary of State \nRice signified a shift of U.S. policy by indicating our willingness to \nnegotiate directly with Iran by putting conditions on that offer to \nnegotiate. To repeat, I believe that we ought to be willing to \nnegotiate without conditions. We have similarly sought to deal with \nNorth Korea in collaboration with other nations, including Japan and \nSouth Korea, China, and Russia, and here again, it would be my hope \nthat we would seek and be willing to have those talks without \npreconditions.\n  I was part of a CODEL led by Senator Biden in August of 2001, at the \ntime when Senator Biden was chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, and we traveled to the Far East and had plans to meet with \nthe North Korean President, and that did not materialize because at \nthat same time, the North Korean President made an unexpected trip to \nChina. In looking toward the future, it is my hope to be able to go to \nNorth Korea. I think there is a climate there of receptivity to meeting \nwith Members of Congress, and that is a course which I intend to \npursue.\n  I have found that in the meetings I have had on foreign travels that, \nat least in my opinion, they have been a bit productive. In the 25 \nyears of my service in the Senate, I have been on the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Foreign Operations, and for 8 years I served on the \nIntelligence Committee, chairing that committee during the\n\n[[Page S6003]]\n\n104th Congress in 1995 and 1996, and those committee assignments and my \ninterests generally in foreign policy have taken me to some 93 \ncountries.\n  One of the countries I have visited on many occasions is Syria. I \nhave visited Syria on 15 trips. On nine occasions I have had an \nopportunity to meet with President Hafez al-Assad. I was the only \nMember of Congress to accompany the Secretary of State to his funeral \nin the year 2000, and I have since had an opportunity to visit on three \noccasions with President Bashar al-Assad.\n  In the course of those meetings I got to know President Hafez al-\nAssad. The first meeting was in 1988, and it lasted for approximately \n4\\1/2\\ hours. I had long heard about President Assad's willingness to \nengage in extended discussions. We covered a wide variety of subjects. \nWe talked about Syrian relations with Israel. We talked about the \nPalestinian problems. We talked about the Iran-Iraq war. We talked \nabout U.S.-Soviet relations. On a number of occasions I suggested that \nI had taken too much of his time. On each occasion he would say: No, I \nam interested in talking more.\n  In the course of meeting President Hafez al-Assad on some nine \noccasions, it developed into a cordial relationship, even, you might \ncall it, a joking relationship. I would urge President Assad to meet \nwith Israeli Prime Ministers and say that our meeting, always attended \nby the local photographers, would appear on the front page of the \nSyrian newspaper, the Damascus newspaper, but if President Assad would \nmeet with the Israeli Prime Minister, it would be world news.\n  I told him when Prime Minister Rabin and Foreign Minister Perez and \nPalestinian Authority Chairman Arafat got the Nobel Peace Prize, if he \nwould work for peace with Israel, that he would get the Nobel Peace \nPrize in Stockholm.\n  He replied: Well, I might be welcome in Stockholm under the \narrangement you suggest, but I might not be able to get back to \nDamascus.\n  In 1988 I suggested to President Assad that he permit the Jewish \nwomen in Syria to leave the country because there were very few Jewish \nmen for them to marry. That was a subject which Congressman Stephen \nSolarz had undertaken, and I was carrying forward some of what \nCongressman Solarz had sought to do. President Hafez al-Assad said to \nme that anyone who came to claim a Syrian Jewish bride would be \npermitted to take the bride with him out of the country. I relayed that \nmessage to the large Syrian community in Brooklyn, NY. Nothing much \never came of it. But in 1992, President Assad permitted all the Jews to \nimmigrate out of Syria. My exhortations might have had some effect--who \nknows as to what that might have been.\n  I consistently would urge President Assad to negotiate with Israel, \nand he would say that he would not do so but entertained the \npossibility of negotiations with Israel if sponsored by the big 5: \nsponsored by the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France, and \nthe China. Israel was unwilling to engage in those negotiations because \nonly the United States would be neutral or perhaps friendly toward \nIsrael. Finally, President Assad did agree to go to Madrid, in 1991, to \nnegotiate with Israel.\n  I had extensive discussions with a very distinguished Syrian \ndiplomat, Walid al-Moualem. When Benjamin Netanyahu was Prime Minister \nof Israel, in 1996, upon taking office Prime Minister Netanyahu made a \nforceful declaration that Israel and he would hold Syria responsible \nfor the actions of Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. That led to a \nrealignment of the Syrian military, and for a time it looked as if that \nwas a tense situation. I was in Israel at that time and was asked by \nPrime Minister Netanyahu to carry a message to President Assad that \nIsrael wanted peace. I conveyed that message to President Assad, and \nlater, when I met with Walid al-Moualem, the Syrian Ambassador to the \nUnited Nations--met with him here in Washington--he told me that the \nconversations I had and the message I carried from Prime Minister \nNetanyahu to President Assad had been, as he put it, ``helpful in \ndeescalating the dangerous tensions.''\n  Ambassador Moualem later told me I had gained the trust and \nconfidence and personal relationship with President Assad because, as \nhe put it, ``they viewed me as being objective'' even though, as he put \nit, ``nobody could question my support for Israel.''\n  I am not making any major contentions, or making any claims as to \nwhat effect these visits would have had. But every little bit helps. In \ngetting to know Assad and getting to know his son, it does provide an \nopportunity for a statement as to our values in the United States, what \nwe would like to see happen. I think it is helpful and certainly can do \nno harm.\n  In January of 1989, I made my first trip to Iraq and returned a year \nlater with Senator Shelby.\n  I will conclude briefly and will supplement my remarks today with \nmore specification at a later time on exact dates, based on trip \nreports which I make after coming back from each of my travels.\n  I had referenced the conversation which Senator Shelby and I had with \nSaddam Hussein in January of 1990. I do not know if it would have ever \nhave been possible to have dissuaded Saddam Hussein from his practices \nof aggression, but on that occasion Senator Shelby and I had a \nprofessional conversation with him, and it is my view conversations of \nthat sort have the potential to be helpful.\n  I have had occasion to visit with Palestinian Authority Chairman \nYasser Arafat on some eight occasions. I have conveyed messages from \nPrime Minister Netanyahu to Chairman Arafat about the terrorism issue. \nWhether it had any effect or not I do not know. I have had occasion to \nvisit Cuba on three occasions, meeting with President Fidel Castro on a \nwide range of conversations, urging him to have respect for human \nrights. I questioned him about the deployment of Soviet missiles in \n1962, asking about possible involvement in the assassination of \nPresident Kennedy, which he denied in talking to him about \nassassination efforts. I believe there is a fruitful basis to have \ncooperation with Cuba on drug interdiction, and it is something I have \npursued and intend to pursue in the future.\n  I have had occasion to visit China on four visits. I have had \ndiscussions with the Chinese leader about their failure to respect \nhuman rights, about the detention of a librarian from Dickerson \nCollege, who later was freed after a condemnatory resolution was filed \nin the Senate, and I have taken the lead in urging Temple University to \nestablish a school in Beijing to inform Chinese leaders about the due \nprocess of law.\n  I had an opportunity to meet with President Chavez in Venezuela last \nAugust. There was a controversy on drug enforcement. The Venezuelans \nwould not meet with our ambassador, and I asked for a meeting of \nPresident Chavez with our ambassador. I met with the Venezuelan \nMinister of the Interior. I don't have time to summarize it now, but \nPresident Chavez was willing to discuss a protocol for drug \ncooperation.\n  I believe the talks with people, even our tough adversaries, our \ntoughest adversaries, can be fruitful. As we structure our legislation \nfor the Department of Defense and look later to the Department of \nDefense appropriations subcommittee, a subcommittee on which I serve, \nit is my hope that the United States would be vigorous in the pursuit \nof negotiations with Iran to diffuse the risk there, to try to find a \nway of recognizing them in respect and dignity, persuading them not to \nbecome a nuclear power, and to have bilateral talks with North Korea on \nthe same unconditional basis--again treating them with respect and \nseeking to find a way to have an international protocol which would \ncontain and control the significant threat posed by North Korea.\n  As I say, Mr. President, I have generalized. Most of what I have said \nhas come from floor statements which I have made in the past 25 years. \nAnd I will document this further at a later time when there is more \ntime for the presentation.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to thank the Democratic Leader, \nSenator Reid, for his leadership and the hard work he has done to \ninclude an amendment to National Defense Authorization Act which \nincreases protections for the dedicated women and men throughout our \njudiciary. The recent\n\n[[Page S6004]]\n\nshooting of a State judge in Nevada provides another terrible reminder \nof the vulnerable position of our State and Federal judges. \nUnfortunately, this is not the only recent reminder. Last May, the \nJudiciary Committee heard the courageous testimony of Judge Joan Lefkow \nof Chicago, the federal judge whose mother and husband were murdered in \ntheir home. We must protect judges where they work and where they and \ntheir families live.\n  The amendment now incorporated into the bill which I cosponsored with \nSenator Reid, Chairman Specter, and Senator Durbin, would enact \nprovisions from the Court Security Improvement Act of 2005, CSIA, S. \n1968, which Chairman Specter and I introduced last November. Our bill \nand this amendment authorize additional resources to improve security \nfor State and local court systems. We also respond to requests by the \nFederal judiciary for a greater voice in working with the U.S. Marshals \nService to determine their security needs. This amendment provides \ncriminal penalties for the misuse of restricted personal information to \nseriously harm or threaten to seriously harm Federal judges, their \nfamilies or other individuals performing official duties. It provides \ncriminal penalties for threatening Federal judges and Federal law \nenforcement officials by the malicious filing of false liens, and \nprovides increased protections for witnesses. It also includes an \nextension of life insurance benefits to bankruptcy, magistrate and \nterritorial judges, and provides health insurance for surviving spouses \nand families of Federal judges, both of which are provisions that I \nsuggested be included.\n  Finally, this amendment contains provisions which have passed the \nSenate several times extending and expanding to family members the \nauthority of the Judicial Conference to redact certain information from \na Federal judge's mandatory financial disclosure. This redaction \nauthority is intended to be used in circumstances in which the release \nof the information could endanger the filer or the filer's family. I \nhope that the House of Representatives finally takes up and passes this \nextension and expansion of redaction authority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/16/senate-section/article/S6004-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        U.S. MARINE CORPS BASE CAMP LEJEUNE WATER CONTAMINATION\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the motto of the U.S. Marine Corps is \nSemper Fidelis. Translated, it means, ``Always Faithful,'' but among \nmembers of the Marine Corps the motto holds a deeper meaning. Semper \nFidelis represents our Nation's shared commitment to those who dedicate \ntheir lives to protect us. As a Navy veteran, I know we must always \nhonor the men and women of our Armed Forces and their families for the \nsacrifices they make for our Nation everyday.\n  Lately, I am afraid Congress has not fulfilled its commitment to our \nmen and women in the military, and this is especially evident in the \nlack of support for our military veterans and their families. Our lack \nof assistance for those exposed to the highly contaminated drinking \nwater at U.S. Marine Corps base Camp Lejeune in North Carolina is one \nof the best examples of this body's shortcomings.\n  Camp Lejeune is the site of one of the largest drinking water \ncatastrophes in our Nation's history. Between 1980 and 1985, Camp \nLejeune drinking water samples conducted by the Marine Corps found high \nlevels of volatile organic compounds used by the Marines in solvents \nfor industrial degreasing. The contaminated wells were closed in 1985; \nhowever, the contamination itself may date back until the late 1950s. \nTo put the contamination in perspective, the current EPA health \nstandard for these chemicals is 5 parts per billon. The tap water \nsamples taken at homes and the elementary school between 1980 and 1985 \nreached levels as high as 1,400 parts per billon.\n  While the health effects of exposure to the contaminates at Camp \nLejeune are still being studied, the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances, \nATSDR, has documented at least 100 babies exposed in utero to the \ncontaminated drinking water at Camp Lejeune have birth defects and \ncancers, including spina bifida, leukemia, and clef palates. This is at \nleast twice the rate found in the general population.\n  For the last 20 years, the calls for assistance from those affected \nby this contamination have gone unanswered. The Department of Defense's \ncooperation has been slow, and the political will in Congress has been \nlacking. I will offer a modest amendment to answer the call for help.\n  Senator Dole's amendment would do two things. First, it would provide \nveterans' health care benefits to those exposed in utero while at Camp \nLejeune. The in utero exposures to Camp Lejeune's contaminated water \nhappened under the Marine Corps watch, and it is our responsibility to \nassist those who were harmed. Medical assistance is a modest step to \nhelp restore faith among our veterans and their family members in the \nGovernment's commitment to them.\n  Second, it requires the Marine Corps to notify those who may have \nbeen exposed to the water contamination upon the completion of the \nATSDR's study on the human exposures to drinking water. To date, the \nMarine Corps has issued targeted press releases, but information has \nnot been sent to all who may have been exposed. The ATSDR's modeling of \nthe contaminated water will make it possible to notify exposed segments \nof the Camp Lejeune population, without creating undue worry among the \ngreater population that resided on base. This amendment will require \nthe Marines to provide notice to those who may have been exposed, to \noutline the events leading to the exposures, to describe the potential \nadverse health effects, and to give the affected people resources they \ncan use to obtain more information.\n  I thank Senator Dole for her leadership on this issue. Without her, \nthis tragic situation would not have gotten the attention it deserves.\n  Nevertheless, concerns have been raised about this amendment. The \npeople exposed to the highly contaminated drinking water at Camp \nLejeune have waited for decades for answers. Congress needs to take \nsteps now and not delay for years debating this issue.\n  For this reason, I have worked with Senator Dole on a second, \ncompromise Dole-Jeffords amendment. This amendment would require a \ncomprehensive National Academy of Sciences study to be completed within \n18 months to evaluate the strength of the link between TCE and PCE \nexposure and adverse health impacts for prenatal, childhood, and adult \nexposures at Camp Lejeune.\n  It also requires the Navy to notify those potentially affected by the \nwater contamination at Camp Lejeune so they can learn what happened, \nhow it may have affected them, and what steps they may want to consider \ntaking now to minimize the potential health impacts. While I am told by \nthe Defense Department that individual notification by letter to each \nperson affected is impractical, under this compromise amendment, the \nNavy would carry out a media blitz and place a letter on its Web page \nproviding the information that those affected deserve to have.\n  Again, I thank Senator Dole for taking a bipartisan approach to this \nissue and for pushing to make constructive progress. We have a moral \nresponsibility to support our troops and their families, and any \nfailure to do so, is a failure to fulfill our commitment embodied in \nthe Marine's motto Semper Fidelis. I urge my colleagues to approve this \ncompromise amendment.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in a few moments we will be closing for the \nweek. Before we leave, I want to take just a few moments to reflect on \na very special holiday coming up this weekend, and that is Father's \nDay.\n  On Sunday, families all across America will celebrate their dads with \ndinners and lunches and gifts and, if my\n\n[[Page S6005]]\n\nfamily is typical, some gentle teasing over the course of the day.\n  It is a day that we show our gratitude and how important our dads \nare--and have been and continue to be--in our lives.\n  In my own case, I cherish my memories of my dad. I think of him each \nand every day. He was my mentor in medicine, mentor in public service, \nmentor in humanitarian efforts, and my friend. It was his love and his \nwisdom and his encouragement that gave me the confidence to work \noutside of the box, to take risks, and to set high goals.\n  As I was thinking back a few moments ago as to what I would say, I \nremembered and recall most vividly, after returning back to Nashville, \nTN, and working at Vanderbilt--after having been away from Nashville \nfor a long period of time with college and medical school and my \ninternship and residency and training and moving back to Nashville--\nevery day I would drive by my parents' home on the way to work at \nVanderbilt Hospital.\n  As I would go by that house--and, ironically, it is the same house I \nlive in today, but as I would go by that house, I would think, each \nday, about the values that dad--both parents and really the entire \nfamily--instilled in each of us.\n  I also used it as a marker place in coming home every night. As I \ndrove by that white house, I would call. That number would be dialed as \nI was driving by. And by the time I got home, we would complete our \nconversation, on a daily basis--each and every day.\n  Indeed, he was an extraordinary man in many ways, not in his \naccomplishments or just being a great physician, a humble physician \ntreating people throughout middle Tennessee, but in his acts of \ngenerosity and in his kindness, known throughout the community for his \ngood works.\n  My father died in 1998. Mother and Dad both died within about 36 \nhours of each other of totally independent causes. In truth, it was \nreferred at the funeral as a great love story. A lot of people arrived \nfor the funeral of my dad--my mother died about 30 hours later--and \nthere were two caskets there. Thinking about how tragic it was, in \ntruth it was a manifestation of what was a great love story, a marriage \nof over 65 years.\n  Dad, not too long before he died, wrote a letter to his grandchildren \nand great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren that he would \nnever know--that is the way he opened the letter to them--passing on in \nabout a two-page letter the insights he had in very simple ways, humble \nways. It is a long letter, and I won't read the whole of it but just a \nfew paragraphs.\n  Again, this is a letter he left to be passed on to future \ngenerations. His advice was:\n\n       Be happy in your family life. Your family is the most \n     important thing you can ever have. Love your wife or your \n     husband. Tell your children how great they are. Encourage \n     them in everything they do.\n       Be happy in your community. Charity is so important. \n     There's so much good to do in the world and so many different \n     ways to do it.\n\n  A little bit later in the letter he wrote:\n\n       The world is always changing, and that's a good thing. It's \n     how you carry yourself in the world that doesn't change. \n     Morality, integrity, warmth, and kindness are the same things \n     in 1910, when I was born, or in 2010 or later when you will \n     be reading this. And that's a good thing, too.\n\n  Dad is the one who had the high ideals. I have done my best to try to \nlive up to those ideals and to that sterling example he set before us. \nI have worked hard as a dad to instill those same values and \ncommitments in my own sons.\n  This weekend, as we celebrate our fathers and the good news that \nAmerica's fathers are more present in their children's lives than ever, \nwe all realize that they have a huge impact. Children involved with \nloving fathers are more likely to do well in school, to have healthy \nself-esteem, to show empathy, to avoid destructive behaviors. Kids do \nbetter with their dads around.\n  For a while, America seemed to forget this. But now we know in our \nkids what we have always known in our hearts: America's dads deserve \nour respect and our support, dads on the frontline who risk their lives \nfor our freedom, dads on the home front who work hard to support their \nfamilies.\n  Fatherhood is the most important responsibility a man will ever take \non. It is also the most rewarding.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, banks of day lilies are celebrating their \nbrief moments of glory as they turn their vibrant orange faces to the \nsun. The days are warm and mellow, not too hot for working in the \ngarden or in the yard. The evenings linger, fading slowly into velvet \nnights filled with the trill of crickets, the sparkle of lightning bugs \nand the soft songs of whippoorwills. These are perfect evenings to \nspend on a country porch, watching the day slide into night. Late \nspring, almost summer--it is a lovely time of year.\n  On Sunday, June 18, the Nation will celebrate Father's Day. Father's \nDay does not arrive with quite the same fanfare as Mother's Day. To be \nsure, stores have been busy reminding us to shop for Father's Day, and \nthe racks are full of Father's Day cards, but there doesn't seem to be \nthe same level of intensity as that which surrounds Mother's Day. The \nlong distance lines will not be as busy. Florists will not be swamped \nwith orders. But fathers around the country will be treated to brunch \nor to some other family gathering. They will open presents of golf \nshirts, ties, or cologne bought by family members frustrated because \ndad always just buys what he really wants whenever he wants it. He is \nforgiven for this fault only because his family is fairly sure that dad \nis unaware of the approach of any holiday, including Father's Day. Of \ncourse, fathers will put their dramatic skills to the test in order to \nexpress their gratitude. The comedian Bill Cosby famously once said, \n``Fatherhood is pretending the present you love most is `soap-on-a-\nrope.' ''\n  This is not to say that Nation does not appreciate men. Far from it. \nWe observe the birthdays of our Founding Fathers. We celebrate the \nfathers and other men who brave the terrors of distant battlefields to \ndefend the Nation. We have monuments and parks, schools and mountains \nnamed after men who have won battles, made important discoveries, or \nwho have contributed to the growth and prosperity of our Nation. But \nrarely, if ever, are these memorials dedicated to the important role \nthat men play in their own families. The role that fathers play in the \nlives of their children, in helping to shape the future of the Nation, \ncertainly merits this one day of recognition. The poet William \nWordsworth observed: ``Father!--to God himself we cannot give a holier \nname.''\n  Fathers carry a heavy load of duty, responsibility and worry. Every \nday, and during many sleepless nights, they worry about big things, \nlike the state of the economy or the impact of trade agreements on \ntheir jobs. Will they be able to support their families and make their \nmortgages on time? Will they keep their job or lose it to an overseas \ncompetitor? Is their pension secure? Will they have health care--not \nfor themselves, for men are not very good about going to the doctor \nregularly, but for their families. Fathers also worry about small \ndetails, like oil level in the lawn mower or that suspicious drip under \nthe sink. Is the prime interest rate going up or down, and how will \nthat affect their ability to pay the monthly bills? Everything that can \naffect their families is a concern for fathers, who take their role as \nproviders for their families very seriously, indeed.\n\n  By June 18, children are out of school at last. In days past, that \nwould mean long summer days to while away with swimming and in play, \nand idle hours spent reading a book in the shade. In today's world, \nhowever, summer vacation for children out of school is often a headache \nfor families with two working parents. Summer becomes instead a \nscheduling nightmare of day camps or sitters, or of latchkey kids who \nmust spend the day indoors behind lock and key because there is no \nadult available to supervise their play. Instead of two working parents \nmeaning a better life, today two working parents may as easily signal a \nfamily working hard just to keep up. Many fathers endure long commutes \nbetween work and home so that their families can live in a nicer \nneighborhood than those same fathers did growing up. Fathers are often \nportrayed as workaholics who live for their jobs and who see families \nas a minor annoyance, if they notice them at all. In truth, fathers \nworry about their jobs because they fear that, if they do not \nconcentrate on their work,\n\n[[Page S6006]]\n\nthey will lose their jobs and not be able to provide for their \nfamilies. Today's economy is too uncertain, too volatile, and too \nglobal to take for granted.\n  This Father's Day, so many fathers are in harm's way in Afghanistan \nor in Iraq facing daily dangers that have already taken too many other \nfathers from their wives and children. To them and to their families, I \noffer my prayers of thanks and of safekeeping. May God bring them \nsafely home. The families for whom this Father's Day will be a mix of \nloving remembrance and painful loss, I can offer only the comforting \nwords of sympathy and the acknowledgment of their sad, sad loss. These \nfathers in heaven, for there they surely are, still have an important \nplace in the family. Like all fathers, they teach by example. In this \ncase, their example is one of bravery and sacrifice, patriotism and \nservice.\n  Clarence Budington Kelland once wrote of his father: ``He didn't tell \nme how to live; he lived, and let me watch him do it.'' These fathers \nin uniform, like good fathers everywhere, teach by the example of their \nown lives. ``The words that a father speaks to his children in the \nprivacy of home are not heard by the world, but, as in whispering-\ngalleries, they are clearly heard at the end and by posterity.'' Jean \nPaul Richter made that observation, and that truism captures the \nessence of a father's importance. Each day they gird themselves for \nbattle, whether that battle be in Iraq or in an office or a factory. \nThey go, and they return. They do not complain, or at least not much, \nabout how much time they must spend away from home. They simply do the \nbest that they can for their families, day after day, year after year. \nThey love their children. They play with them when they can. They \nmonitor schoolwork and behavior. They set standards and measure \nperformance. They mete out discipline. They scrutinize their children's \nfriends. They say ``yes'' as often as they say ``no.'' Good fathers \nparticipate in all aspects of their children's lives.\n  Our families are our Nation's greatest resource and greatest \ntreasure. I am proud each year to take a few minutes to recognize the \ncritical role of mothers and fathers on the days set aside for each of \nthem. It reminds me to think always of how families are affected by the \nvotes I cast here in the Senate. The votes we cast here affect the \nlives and well being of mothers and fathers and families. We need to \nmake life easier for families, not harder. We should not send fathers \ninto battle without good cause. We should not add to the burden of debt \nwithout good cause. Our spending decisions should add to the prosperity \nand well-being of the Nation and our families, first and foremost.\n  I close with a favorite poem of mine, one that I often recite for \nFather's Day. I learned it as young boy, and the words and the lesson \nhave come to mean more to me with each passing year:\n\n                            That Dad of Mine\n\n     He's slowing down, as some folks say,\n     With the burden of years from day to day;\n     His brow bears many a furrowed line;\n     He's growing old--that dad of mine.\n\n     His shoulders droop, and his step is slow;\n     And his hair is white, as white as snow;\n     But his kind eyes sparkle with a friendly light;\n     His smile is warm, and his heart is right.\n\n     He's old? Oh, yes. But only in years,\n     For his spirit soars as the sunset nears.\n     And blest I've been, and wealth I've had,\n     In knowing a man like my old dad.\n\n     And proud I am to stand by him,\n     As he stood by me when the way was dim;\n     I've found him worthy and just as fine,\n     A prince of men--that dad of mine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/16/senate-section/article/S6006-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6006-S6008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REFERRAL OF NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Pursuant to section 17(b)(1) of S. Res. 400 of the \n     94th Congress (as amended by Section 506(d) of the USA \n     PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005, Pub.

Mr. President, I today salute a hero for all \nAmericans, a leader for his party, and my friend, Senator Robert Joseph \nDole.\n  This week marks 10 years since Senator Dole retired from this \nChamber, a day I remember well. Senator Dole left as the longest-\nserving Republican leader in Senate history. In fact, the beginning of \nhis leadership tenure coincided with my first term in the Senate, \nstarting in January 1985.\n  Even then, it was clear that Senator Dole was and is not just another \nSenator, but a national fixture in American politics. Author Michael \nBarone, writing in his Almanac of American Politics, has this to say \nabout our friend from Kansas:\n\n       Senator Bob Dole is one of the large political figures of \n     our time, in the middle 1990s towering over everyone else in \n     the political landscape, even the president . . . for Bob \n     Dole is not only one of the most successful politicians of \n     the second half of the 20th Century but also one of the most \n     enduring.\n\n  Powerful words about a powerful leader. Many of my colleagues have \nalready recounted Senator Dole's extensive political career, his record \nof legislative accomplishment, and his leadership of the Republican \nParty, here in the Senate and as the Republican candidate for both \nPresident and Vice-President of the United States. Beginning with his \nchairmanship of the Republican National Committee in 1971, Senator Dole \nwas a prominent player on the national stage for a quarter-century.\n  Senator Dole's heroism on the battlefield is well-known and revered \nby us all as well. In 1945, a young Lieutenant Dole from Russell, KS, \nfound himself on the hills of Italy, fighting the Nazis. Suddenly pain \nexploded in his back. Paralyzed by his war injury, Bob Dole spent 4 \nyears in hospital wards, relearning how to do simple tasks, like button \nhis shirt. To this day his right arm remains largely paralyzed.\n  I believe the determination and focus Senator Dole must have had to \nrecover from that injury explains his success in politics, and with the \nAmerican people. After struggling to regain control of one's body, \nlining up a vote on a difficult bill might be a little less daunting. I \nhave heard Senator Dole say before that no honor that has come his way \nhas ever surpassed the pride he felt at wearing his country's uniform.\n  As a Republican Leader, Bob Dole was about results, not symbolism or \nshowmanship. President George H.W. Bush, for instance, cited him as \ninstrumental in the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act in \n1990. Out of office, he has continued to serve his country, fundraising \nfor worthy causes and raising awareness of the dangers of prostate \ncancer.\n  Senator Dole is also famous for his dry, Midwestern wit, which has \nlifted many of us here in the Senate in times of despair as well as \nlevity. This is a man who, after losing the Republican Presidential \nnomination in 1988, assured an audience that he ``went home and slept \nlike a baby. Every couple of hours, I'd wake up and cry.''\n  My colleagues and I continue to be graced every day in this chamber \nby the presence of another prominent Senator Dole, the Senator from \nNorth Carolina. Elizabeth, I wish to express how happy we all are Bob \nhas found you, and you have found Bob. You remind us of him every day, \nand we hope that you will tell him how much we all respect and miss \nhim, and how pleased we are to honor his service.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, last Sunday marked the 10th anniversary of \nSenator Bob Dole's retirement from the Senate. Bob Dole served the \npeople of Kansas and the people of the United States of America as a \nMember of Congress for more than three and a half decades. He was \noutspoken on many issues, but, above all, I will always admire his \ntireless, passionate advocacy on behalf of people with disabilities.\n  The first speech that Bob Dole ever made on the floor of the Senate--\non April 14, 1969--was about the challenges faced by Americans with \ndisabilities. That date was the 24th anniversary of the day he was \ngravely wounded in\n\n[[Page S6007]]\n\nWorld War II. In fact, every year that he was in the Senate, on or \nabout April 14, Bob Dole made a statement on the floor about the \nchallenges faced by individuals with disabilities. But Bob Dole did \nmuch more than just talk about expanding access and opportunity for \npeople with disabilities. He was an outstanding leader in bringing \nabout change for the good.\n  Most importantly, I will always be grateful for Senator Bob Dole's \nleadership in helping to pass the Americans with Disabilities Act in \n1990. Both he and I remember the day that it was signed into law as one \nof the proudest in our entire legislative careers.\n  It is hard to believe, but it has been nearly 16 years since we \npassed the Americans with Disabilities Act. Just as many predicted, ADA \nhas taken its place among the great civil rights laws in our Nation's \nhistory. Today, the impacts of ADA are all around us. Drive-through \nrestaurants have visual displays allowing the deaf and hard of hearing \nto place their orders. Banks have talking ATMs, now, to assist those \nwith visual impairments. Cities have installed curb cuts and ramps to \nallow wheelchair users easier access. And on and on. Just as important, \nbecause of ADA, we have seen an enormous change in attitudes. These \nchanges that we see today, that we feel today, would not have been \npossible without the hard work and dedication of Senator Bob Dole in \nworking cooperatively to help get the ADA passed.\n  On a bipartisan basis, we miss Bob Dole here in this body. But the \ngood news is that there is still a Senator Dole in the Senate, and our \nfriend Bob has found a richly satisfying life after the Senate. Today, \nhe continues to serve the American people in a whole range of voluntary \ncapacities, proving President Reagan's dictum that ``you don't have to \nbe on the public payroll to be an outstanding public servant.'' I \nsalute my good friend, Bob Dole, and I wish him all the best.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, of all my colleagues, I suppose that in \n1996 I was the one most hoping that Bob Dole would not retire from the \nSenate. That was because I was doing my best to defeat him in the New \nHampshire Presidential primary. If I had, Bob had told several friends \nhe was ``going back to the Senate.'' Well, Pat Buchanan beat both of us \nby a few percentage points, and Bob beat me. Within a few weeks, I was \nback in Tennessee at a press conference endorsing Bob Dole and \npresenting him with one of my red and black plaid shirts. ``I hope it's \nhis last one,'' Bob's friend Howard Baker was heard to mutter, \nreferring to my shirt.\n  I should have known better. In my first Iowa poll in June of 1995, \npollster Whit Ayres said, ``Governor, this is the professional \nchallenge of my career. The poll says, `Dole 54, Alexander 3, margin of \nerror 4 percentage points.''' The end result in the caucuses 6 months \nlater was a good deal closer, but Bob Dole won because he had earned \nfor himself the unofficial title of ``President of Iowa.'' Iowans liked \nhis spare talk, his good humor, his war record, and his middle-America \nbrand of politics.\n  So did and does the rest of America. Not everyone comes out of a \nPresidential race more admired than when he or she went in. But Bob \nDole did. He ran three times, the last time securing the Republican \nnomination. And, I would judge, he is even more admired today than he \nwas 10 years ago when he retired from the Senate.\n  Bob Dole is an emblem of America's greatest generation. He and our \ncolleague Elizabeth are together one of our country's most admired \ncouples. When we think of him, and of them, we think of what is best \nabout public service in America and about our country itself.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, today I honor a great American, a man \nwho devoted his life to this nation and to the just principles he \nbelieved in. Born in Russell, Ks, Robert J. Dole would serve his \ncountry as a war hero, risking his life for a fellow soldier fighting \nthe forces of fascism and Nazism in Italy, as a Senator, a great \nMajority Leader, my party's candidate for Vice President and President \nand today as an active private citizen fighting for veterans and the \ncauses in which he believes.\n  For his bravery in World War II, Bob Dole received two Purple Hearts \nfor his injuries, and the Bronze Star Medal for his attempt to assist a \ndowned radio man. Bob Dole served in the House and Senate representing \nhis home State of Kansas. In 1971, President Nixon asked him to be the \nChairman of the Republican National Committee, a post he held for 2 \nyears. Then in 1976, President Ford selected Bob Dole as his running \nmate for the Republican nomination.\n  Recognizing his leadership, Bob Dole rose to the pinnacle of our \nleadership here in the U.S. Senate as the Majority Leader. He was a \ntireless worker and effective champion of conservative principles, a \nstrong foreign policy and personal freedom and responsibility.\n  One decade ago, Senator Dole resigned his post to devote himself \nfully to his 1996 presidential campaign. As my party's nominee he \ncrossed the country running on a platform of lower taxation and \nsmaller, more accountable government. Unfortunately, he didn't win, but \nhe developed a good working relationship with President Clinton and the \ntwo leaders have devoted their time and energy to many notable causes \nover the years. Shortly after the 1996 election, President Clinton \nbestowed upon Senator Dole the highest civilian award in Government, \nthe Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n  To those who know him, Senator Dole is a regular comedian. One story \ngoes that on the campaign trail in his home state of Kansas, he would \nspend an hour at each stop telling jokes and only 10 minutes talking \nabout politics. Senator Dole was always able to demonstrate a quick \nwit, while also showing that he was well grounded in decency.\n  Senator Dole continues today to serve the many veterans of World War \nII who fought so valiantly to liberate Europe and defeat the Japanese. \nMost recently, it was his personal dedication and determination to see \na monument honoring the sacrifice of the World War II veterans that led \nto the construction of the beautiful tribute to selfless service that \nnow graces the National Mall.\n  I wish Senator Dole and his lovely wife, my colleague, Senator \nElizabeth Dole, more happy years together and many happy returns to the \nUnited States Senate.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I was first elected to the Senate in \n1993 in a special election to fill the remainder of Lloyd Bentsen's \nterm. Bob Dole, like my predecessor Lloyd Bentsen, is a member of the \n``Greatest Generation'' --the generation of men who never wavered in \nanswering the call to duty, fighting in distant lands to protect the \nfree world, and returning home to build the greatest Nation on Earth. \nBob Dole epitomizes the ``Greatest Generation,'' not only for his \nheroic service in battle, but also for what he did when he came home, \nultimately serving in the U.S. Senate.\n  When I first arrived in Washington, Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas was the \nonly other female Republican Senator. Fortunately, our leader Bob Dole \nunderstood the unique and important voice women brought to the Senate. \nHe graciously welcomed me from the first day, and I enjoyed working \nwith him as he ascended from minority leader to majority leader. He was \ngreat in both roles, and I appreciate the leadership and support he \nprovided in my early days.\n  One of my first discussions with Bob was committee assignments. I \ntold him I wanted to serve on the Armed Services Committee, as there \nare more military members serving in Texas than any other State. I \nhoped to carry on the great tradition of helping our men and women in \nuniform like so many Texas Senators before me. He understood why this \ncommittee assignment was important to me and realized the unique \nperspective I would bring to the national discussion. I was the first \nwoman to sit on this committee in over 30 years. Today, there are three \nwomen serving on the Armed Services Committee, including Bob's wife, \nSenator Elizabeth Dole, who was elected after Bob retired from her home \nState of North Carolina.\n  On the 10th anniversary of Bob Dole's retirement from the Senate, I \nam proud to honor him for his many accomplishments and tireless service \nto our country. While we all regretted to see him go, we are grateful \nfor the legacy he left behind, and I hope we can carry it forward for \ngenerations to come. He was a giant during his time\n\n[[Page S6008]]\n\nin this institution, and when the history of the Senate is written, I \nam confident that he will be fondly remembered as one of our great \nleaders.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, it was just about 10 years ago that Bob Dole \nannounced his retirement from the Senate. It was 1996 and the Nation \nwas in the midst of an intense campaign for the Presidency. Bob Dole \nhad decided to resign his Senate seat for the good of his home State of \nKansas, his party, and his country. He knew he would have to focus all \nhis energies on his campaign for President if he were to be successful, \nso he left Washington to answer another call to serve his country and \nprovide a choice to the people of Kansas and the rest of the United \nStates when the election was held in November of that year.\n  We really shouldn't have been surprised. Answering the call to serve \nhis country was nothing new for Bob Dole and he was proud to be able to \ndo it. Over his life he had been many things, a legislator, a decorated \nwar hero, and a leader both inside and outside of the Senate. Through \nthe years, Bob Dole had always answered the call to serve his country \nwhen he was needed, and I have no doubt that he will continue to do so \nfor many years to come.\n  It's no secret. Bob Dole has made it clear all his life. You want to \nknow and understand him, you must first understand Russell, KS--the \npeople who live there and the values and principles they hold dear. By \ncoming to know the people of Russell, you understand the philosophy \nthat Bob Dole has lived by his entire life. It's a philosophy ard work, \nand of always giving your best to whatever you choose to do. It is a \nreflection of his father's view of the world--``stewers versus doers.'' \nNeedless to say, you will always find Bob Dole in the ``doers'' group.\n  That is why the story of Bob Dole's life is thoroughly intertwined \nwith the story of Russell, KS. For it was when he was growing up in \nRussell that Bob Dole committed himself to the service of God, Country \nand family. They came to become his core values as he learned at a \nyoung age that there are things worth fighting for and that is what \ndrew him to his service in the military.\n  Those who have chronicled those difficult years in our history have \ncalled him part of our greatest generation. Without any regard for \nhimself, Bob Dole left everything he called dear behind to face a \nchallenge as great as any generation had faced before. Pearl Harbor had \nbeen attacked and the whole world had taken up arms in a battle against \nan unspeakable evil that had been unleashed upon the world. World War \nII had called him to action and Bob Dole was a young man serving in the \nU.S. Army. He would never be the same again in mind or body. Given the \ncircumstances, I don't think anyone would have returned home from the \nbattlefields of Europe and the South Pacific and not have been changed \nforever.\n\n  As he bravely fought in the mountains of Italy, he was wounded in \naction, but still he fought on. Then, he was wounded again, this time \nfar more seriously. The odds were against him, but he somehow made it \nthrough those vital first days. He then began what would be a lengthy \nrecovery. He had a long stay in the hospital and despite the efforts of \nthose who attended him, he had lost the use of an arm.\n  When he was released from the hospital, he returned home, and that \nspecial place of Russell, KS, again reached out to him with open arms \nand provided him with the support he needed to continue to recover from \nthe wounds he had suffered on the battlefield. Once again, the bonds \nthat tied him to the people of Russell and Kansas became stronger. \nThose bonds helped Bob Dole to regain his strength and begin to plan \nfor the future.\n  Soon he heard the call to serve again. With the support of the people \nof his home town, he left to work for the people of Kansas in the State \nhouse and then in the U.S. Congress. His leadership skills were quite \napparent and he compiled quite a record in the Senate. He progressed \nthrough the ranks and served his party as minority and then majority \nleader. Every day on the Senate floor, he took a leadership role on a \nwide variety of issues that he knew were important to the people of his \nhome State. Through the years he worked to ensure that our American \nvalues we protected and preserved in all the proceedings of Congress. \nIt was a remarkable record of service that continued until that day, \nten years ago, when he resigned to pursue the call to carry the \nRepublican banner for President.\n  Although that final political campaign of his was not successful, Bob \nDole will always be remembered for a lifetime of service to the United \nStates. He has received many honors for his service to the United \nStates, and for being a part of a noble cause that the greatest \ngeneration took up for which so many fought and died. He never forgot \nthose with whom he served or the needs of our Nation's veterans. In \nfact, it was those ties from so many years ago that led him to join the \neffort to construct a memorial for World War II to recognize those with \nwhom he served--especially those who never returned. His leadership in \nthat effort resulted in the dedication of a beautiful memorial that \nwill stand forever in the shadows of the Lincolm Memorial and the \nWashington Monument on the Mall in our Nation's Capital.\n  Today, Bob Dole and his wife Elizabeth continue to be a great team as \nshe serves the people of North Carolina with the same care and \nattention that Bob Dole has always provided the people of Kansas.\n  Bob Dole has always said that his goal in life was to defend and \nserve the America he learned to love in Russell. I think the record \nshows that he succeeded in that effort and, in so doing, left his mark \nthroughout much of the world as he fought in Europe to free the \noppressed, and, in the Senate, for the principles and values he had \nlearned to cherish as a young boy growing up in Russell, KS.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/16/senate-section/article/S6008-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6008-S6010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO SENATOR ROBERT C. BYRD\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to congratulate \nmy friend, the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, who has \nachieved the distinction of being the longest serving Senator in the \nhistory of the Senate. Even though this is definitely a noteworthy \nachievement, what has set Senator Byrd apart from all others who have \nserved as Senators is the dedication he has shown to the duties of his \noffice, his respect for the traditions of the Senate, and his \nleadership of this body during his service in the Senate.\n  As President pro tempore, majority leader, and chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, he has succeeded in protecting and enforcing \nthe rules of the Senate, first written by Thomas Jefferson during his \nservice as Vice President and the Presiding Officer of the Senate, and \nhe used his leadership skills to successfully lead the Senate in \nchanging the rules when a consensus for modernizing the rules \npermitted. His insights into the needs of his constituents and his \ndevotion to their well-being have been admirable.\n  Perhaps his greatest contribution to our understanding of the Senate \nwas his authorship of the ``Addresses on the History of the United \nStates Senate,'' the most comprehensive account of the role the Senate \nhas played over the years.\n  I commend the Senator from West Virginia for his illustrious and \nrecord-breaking career in the Senate, and I wish for him many more \nyears of service in this body.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr President, I am sorry that I was not present on the \nfloor on Monday when my colleagues paid tribute to my friend, Robert C. \nByrd, but I would like to add my voice to the chorus speaking on his \nunsurpassed contributions to the U.S. Senate and to America.\n  I say without hesitation Senator Byrd is one of the most remarkable \nmen I have ever had the privilege to work with. Although I have been \nhere for 33 years, he is the only Member whom I have looked up to as my \nsenior--my senior in every way.\n  When my days are finished in this Chamber, my children, my \ngrandchildren, and my great-grandchildren will know that I served with \nthe greatest servant of the U.S. Senate of all who have served.\n  Once someone said of another West Virginian, Stonewall Jackson, that \n``his character and will make him a stonewall and more of a stonewall \nthan any man I've ever known.''\n  I say the same of Robert Byrd. When he walks on the floor, \nConstitution in\n\n[[Page S6009]]\n\nhis pocket, and he looks around, raises his voice, points his finger, \nhe is our stonewall. He is the unshakeable rock of this institution. He \nis our foundation. He is the protector of this body.\n  I am absolutely certain that the Senator's service, knowledge, and \ncontributions to the Senate will never be surpassed. This country \ngentleman has no peer. No one has given as much to this institution or \nloved it as much as the senior Senator from West Virginia.\n  The Senate is what it is because of Robert Byrd. And he is our wise \nsenior, not because of the records but because he is a man of his \nconviction. He has told the truth on every issue that confronts our \ncountry. He is our rock of integrity.\n  When I was elected at age 29, and 6 weeks later, before I was sworn \nin, my wife and daughter were killed in a terrible car accident, \nSenator Byrd came to the funeral home. He waited in a long line to pay \nhis respects. It was an act of kindness that I have never forgotten.\n  I know how bittersweet this honor is for him, as his lifemate, Erma, \nwould have been 89 years old this week. We all admire the love and \ndevotion the two of them had for each other, in health and in sickness. \nWe know his first love was not in the Chamber; it was at home. We also \nknow how proud she would be of him this week.\n  One of America's favorite West Virginians, who also set a lot of \nrecords in his day, is Mr. Clutch, Jerry West. He once said: ``You \ncan't get much done in life if you only work on the days when you feel \ngood.''\n  Senator Byrd has worked 17,331 days--days that have been good and \nbad. In all that time, he has made the most out of every one of them \nand gotten more done than anyone will ever know. It has been an honor \nserving with him for 12,209 of those days. I look forward to many more \ndays and years together.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in paying tribute to \none of our most distinguished Members, the Senior Senator from West \nVirginia, Mr. Byrd.\n  As he passes the milestone of becoming the Senate's longest serving \nMember, I would remind him of a statement by Yogi Berra when they asked \nhim about one of his many records. He said, ``I knew that one would \nstand until it was broken.'' Perhaps when medical science allows us to \nlive to be 150 years old his record may be broken, but until then, I \nthink he is safe.\n  Knowing the Senator's affection for the simple truth, I just want to \nmake three points in recognizing this achievement which he embodies to \nan extraordinary degree.\n  The first is: Your life is what you make it.\n  Our former colleague, Senator Dave Durenberger told me the story of a \nFriday afternoon in the Senate in 1987 when he was standing in for \nSenator Dole for the procedural ``wrap up'' with Senator Byrd. The \nTwins were in the World Series at the time and on the Record, Senator \nDurenberger asked Senator Byrd if he wanted to come to Minnesota to see \none of the games.\n  Senator Byrd said he has not seen a professional baseball game, or \nfootball game, or Hollywood movie for more than a decade. But he said \nhe had not been idle. He shared that he had read the Bible cover to \ncover many times, had read all the plays of Shakespeare, all the Lives \nof Plutarch and the entire Oxford Unabridged Dictionary.\n  Many of us wonder what we might accomplish without the many \ndistractions of modern life. We should look to Senator Byrd for the \nanswer.\n  The second point I would like to make is: People change.\n  When we look at Robert Byrd's upbringing and the person he has \nbecome, it underlies a basic truth which has been made clear by all the \ngreat hearts and minds of history. Life is not what happens to you: \nlife is what you choose to do with what happens to you.\n  Change and growth is always possible in people's lives, if they have \nthe courage to change and discipline to grow.\n  And my third point is: This Senate is unique.\n  For the sake of the 100 of us who temporarily occupy these seats, \nSenator Byrd has embodied the truth that the Senate is unique in human \nhistory and its value must be preserved.\n  The genius of our Founders was their understanding of the heights and \ndepths of human endeavor and their ability to translate those thoughts \ninto practical institutions which maximized the heights and minimized \nthe depths.\n  They knew that the philosophy of democracy must honor both the \nprinciple of majority rule and the protection of minority rights. And \nso in article I of the Constitution they created a House to operate \nmostly by majority rule and a Senate mostly to protect minority rights. \nThe balance they struck has given a dynamic quality to the Congress \nthat serves our Nation well on every conceivable issue.\n  I have often gone up to Senator Byrd on this floor and told him that \nhe has given me something I could not get from any other source: a \nproper appreciation for the living history of the Senate that leads to \nreverence for this institution.\n  Robert Byrd and his service in the Senate is a great American story. \nIt tells anyone who will listen how a person from humble origin can \nrise to leadership and then strive his whole life to keep the way open \nfor those who would come up behind him.\n  We know that great ideas are just a generation from extinction. I am \ngrateful to have had the chance to see many of those great ideas \nembodied and standing on this floor in the person of Senator Robert C. \nByrd.\n  My tribute to him will be to try to learn and live out the lessons he \nhas lovingly and forcefully tried to teach us all in this Chamber.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a tribute to my \ncolleague Senator Robert Byrd. Few men in our Nation's history have had \nsuch a large hand in shaping the U.S. Senate and the destiny of our \ncountry as Robert Byrd. No one in our country's history has served in \nthe Senate longer or with more distinction.\n  Senator Byrd's Senate career truly is a remarkable American success \nstory. Only in America could a young man from the coal fields of \nAppalachia use hard work, intelligence, and determination to one day \nbecome the longest serving Senator in U.S. history.\n  He has often been called the Senate's historian. I have often been \namazed at Senator Byrd's prolific ability to weave the great authors \nand poets of the past into modern relevant lessons for today's society. \nCicero, Shakespeare, Tacitus, Aquinas, Jefferson, and Washington are \nnot simply names memorized from a textbook for Senator Byrd. They are \nliving characters with indelible truths that we should all spend more \ntime studying and give more time to in quiet reflection. Senator Byrd \nreminds us all of the importance of the august traditions of the Senate \nand why this is the world's greatest deliberative body.\n  You will never find Senator Byrd without his copy of the \nConstitution. I dare say there are few individuals here in this body \nwith a greater love or commitment to those noble ideas our Founding \nFathers fought and died defending.\n  But above all, I have been most impressed with his love and \ndedication to his family.\n  Senator Byrd and his beloved wife, Erma, were an amazing example for \nwhat we should all strive for in a loving marriage. For nearly 69 years \nRobert and Erma were together side by side, living and loving together. \nI would like to share some touching words that Senator Byrd gave in \ntestament to his great wife--his greatest treasure:\n\n       She met with kings and shahs, princes and princesses, \n     Governors and Senators, Presidents. She entertained the high \n     and the mighty, the powerful and the wealthy of this Nation \n     in a foreign land because it was important to her husband who \n     served as the majority leader of this Senate and various \n     other Senatorial offices. She did it all with an innate, \n     inherent graciousness, incredible patience, and a soft, warm \n     smile. She was a remarkable lady of great wisdom, but most of \n     all, great gentleness, yet she could be tough when she saw \n     injustice or unfairness.\n\n  I think America could use more devotion like that.\n  In closing, I congratulate Senator Byrd on his amazing \naccomplishments and to his 17,329 days in service to his country in the \nU.S. Senate. When the history books record his deeds and actions, he \nwill truly be remembered in the pantheon of legends that have forever \nleft their mark on our great nation.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, just a few days ago Senator Robert C. Byrd \nset a\n\n[[Page S6010]]\n\nvery remarkable record. He is now the longest serving Senator in the \nhistory of the Senate. The Senate, the legislative body that means so \nmuch to him, now honors him for his achievement and for the remarkable \nrecord of service that he has given to the United States. I appreciate \nhaving the opportunity to be a part of our recognition of our colleague \nand his commitment to public service and the people of his home State \nof West Virginia.\n  For almost 48 years now, Robert C. Byrd has carried the title of U.S. \nSenator. I think it is fair to say that no one has done so with a \ngreater awareness of what it means to be a Senator and of all the \ninstitution of the Senate represents. He is truly our institutional \nmemory and he is the master of the Senate's rules and procedures. No \none knows better than he the precedents and prerogatives of the Senate, \nand no one is a better protector, promoter and defender of them than he \nis.\n  It is not just for the length of his service that Senator Byrd is \nbeing honored, however. It isn't so much the years he has served but \nthe service he has provided to the people of the United States and his \nState of West Virginia that has earned him the accolades he has \nreceived and will continue to receive from his colleagues and his \nconstituents.\n  Our celebration of this moment and all he has achieved is softened by \nthe loss of his beloved wife Erma, his greatest friend and supporter, \nhis companion through life and almost 69 years of marriage, who passed \naway recently. I am sure she is looking down on us all, proud and \nthrilled to see Senator Byrd's continued efforts to address the issues \nof importance to his beloved friends of West Virginia and to note his \nrecognition for being their champion for so many years.\n  During my service in the Senate I have appreciated working with \nSenator Byrd on a variety of issues, most recently the Miner Safety \nAct. We were both there at the President's side as he took up his pen \nand signed the bill into law. As he did, he noted Senator Byrd's \npresence because he knew the bill was the result of Senator Byrd's \nheartfelt concern for the miners of his State, for their safety, and \nthe security of their families.\n\n  I have no doubt that if we were to look up the words ``constituent \nservice'' in any book it would immediately refer us to Senator Byrd's \nwork in the Senate. He has been an active and effective advocate for \nthe people of West Virginia and he has worked tirelessly and diligently \nto address their needs in the Congress.\n  Looking back, Senator Byrd's life reads like a Hollywood movie \nscript. He graduated first in his high school class and married his \nhigh school sweetheart. He then spent 12 years saving the money he \nneeded to start college.\n  Through the years that followed, he held a variety of jobs that gave \nhim an understanding of the needs of the working people of his State. \nHe also developed his talent for the fiddle, and soon became known for \nthat as well. Before long he was a member of the State legislature and, \nnot too long thereafter, he came to the Senate.\n  Here in the Senate, no one has shown a greater understanding of the \nhistory and meaning of the U.S. Constitution and the role it plays in \nshaping our values and our way of life as Americans. We both have a \nhabit of carrying a copy in our pocket to remind us of our job here in \nthe Senate and our responsibility as Senators to adhere to the \nprovisions of the Constitution and all it says and requires us to do.\n  Whenever I think of Senator Byrd, the first thing that comes to mind \nis his incredible knowledge and understanding of world history and the \nAmerican experience. He also has a profound and substantive mastery of \nthe legacy of the written word. Whenever he takes to the floor to \npresent his views on an issue he always has a ready reference to the \nprecedents of the past, or the words of some great author who had \nwritten something appropriate to the moment.\n  Now, Senator Byrd, the great student of the history of our Nation and \nso much more, is himself a part of the great story of America and the \ntraditions of the Senate. Every day he joins us here to deliberate on \nthe issues before the Senate, he writes another chapter of his own \nlife's story, a story that will be forever told and retold back in his \nhome State, in the mountains and valleys of West Virginia, by the \npeople who live there who will forever remember him and his legacy as \ntheir Senator--a legacy that will never be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/16/senate-section/article/S6010-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     1st Sergeant Michael Matthews\n\n                         Sergeant Kenneth Kraus\n\n                       Staff Sergeant Jacob Long\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, it is my honor today to pay tribute to \nthree courageous soldiers from the city of Roswell, GA, whose service \nto country and community merits grateful recognition.\n  1SG Michael Matthews has served 21 years in the U.S. Army and Army \nNational Guard and is currently a member of Charlie Co., 108th Armored \nRegiment, 48th Brigade of the Georgia Army National Guard. On August \n30, 2005, Sergeant Matthews was seriously wounded when two Iraqis \ndetonated an Improvised Explosive Device next to his convoy 25 miles \nsouth of Bagdad. Sergeant Matthews continues to recover from his \ninjuries, and following his recovery, the Roswell Police Department \nwill welcome him back to his position on the force. Sergeant Matthews \nworked for 17 years as a uniform police officer and SWAT team member \nand, in 2005, was named the Police Officer of the Year.\n  SGT Kenneth Kraus served as a U.S. Marine on duty at the U.S. Embassy \nin Iran during February of 1979. As revolutionaries overpowered the \nEmbassy, Sergeant Kraus successfully negotiated the release of several \nAmerican civilians before he was wounded and taken hostage himself. \nBeaten and interrogated repeatedly, he was given a 20 minute trial and \nsentenced to die the next day. Sergeant Kraus was pulled from his cell \nin the hours after his sentence while a representative from the U.S. \nEmbassy finally secured his release.

Mr. President, a unique type of gun trafficking sting \noperation was completed recently. Teams of undercover law enforcement \nofficials wearing hidden cameras traveled to Georgia, Ohio, \nPennsylvania, South Carolina, and Virginia to make purchases which were \ndesigned to appear to be what are known as ``straw purchases.'' Straw \npurchases are transactions that violate Federal law in which one \nindividual submits to the required Federal background check for a gun \nthat is clearly intended to be used by someone else. These purchasers \nplay a crucial role in the illegal trafficking of guns by purchasing \nwith the intention of reselling them to prohibited buyers.\n  In addition, a lawsuit was filed by the city of New York. The suit, \nfiled in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York in \nBrooklyn, asks the court to enforce gun laws regarding such sales and \nrequire extra training for and supervision of dealers. The lawsuit also \nseeks punitive and compensatory damages. According to New York City's \nWeb site, its police have\n\n[[Page S6011]]\n\nconfiscated more than 500 guns that were sold by the 15 dealers named \nin the lawsuit and subsequently used in crimes there.\n  In January 2001, a 12-year-old boy in New York City, playing with a \nsemiautomatic handgun from a pawnshop in Summerville, SC, accidentally \nshot someone in the chest. The gun involved was one of 49 such guns \nfrom the store linked to crimes and accidents in New York City. As New \nYork Mayor Michael Bloomberg pointed out, ``Our suit offers clear and \ncompelling evidence that guns sold by these dealers are used in crimes \nby people ineligible to own a gun far more frequently than guns from \nother dealers.''\n  To build its case, the city of New York compiled a list of gun \ndealers based on data it received from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, \nFirearms and Explosives. Investigators worked in pairs. One looked at \nthe merchandise, talked with the salesman and handled the weapon, while \nthe other wandered the store, seemingly uninterested. When it came time \nto complete the necessary background check forms, the first operator, \noften a man, would call over his partner, frequently a woman, who had \nnot been part of the discussion of the weapon. The second investigator \nwould fill out the background paperwork, and the first one would pay \nfor the gun in cash. This procedure was used to clearly illustrate that \nthe second person was making a ``straw purchase'' for the first person.\n  Gun-control advocates praise the sting operation and the lawsuit. \nThis type of action sends a message to dealers that more government \nofficials are not willing to look the other way. Other cities, \nincluding Gary, Indiana, Chicago and Detroit, have taken similar \napproaches in their own jurisdictions, often using local law \nenforcement officials. This operation however, marks the first time \ninvestigators across the country participated in such a sting involving \na number of States.\n  I would like to commend everyone on both the Federal and local levels \nwho aided in this investigation. This kind of illegal activity can be \nstopped by vigorously enforcing our existing gun laws, providing law \nenforcement with more tools to crack down on gun trafficking and \ncorrupt gun dealers, and by passing sensible gun safety legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/16/senate-section/article/S6011-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6011-S6012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PRELIMINARY 2005 UNIFORM CRIME REPORT\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a very sobering \nreport just issued by our FBI--its Preliminary 2005 Uniform Crime \nReport. This is the gold standard of crime reports in our country, \ntaken from statistics by more than 12,000 law enforcement agencies all \nacross our country.\n  Here is what the report says: Murders are up 4.8 percent. This means \nthat there were 16,900 victims in 2005--16,900 in a single year. This \nis the most murders since 1998 and the largest percentage increase in \n15 years. Violent crime more generally, which also includes forcible \nrape, robbery, and aggravated assault, rose 2 percent after seeing \ndecreases over the last 3 years.\n  Some areas of the country were especially hard hit. The Midwest, for \nexample, saw violent crime rise 5.7 percent. Medium-large towns--those \nwith populations between half a million and 1 million--saw an increase \nin violent crime of 8.3 percent. Murders increased more than 12 percent \nin towns with populations between 50,000 and 250,000. These troubling \nincreases come after more than a decade of record decreases in crime.\n  These historic decreases in crime happened for a reason and, I fear, \nthe recent and dramatic increase in murders and violent crime are also \nhappening for a reason.\n  Let me explain. In 1994, we passed the most sweeping anticrime bill \nin history. At the time, we faced a national crisis with respect to \nviolent crime. Despite the tough-on-crime rhetoric of the 1980s, the \nFederal Government until that point had very little impact on crime \nrates. This is largely because only about 3 percent of all crimes are \nhandled by the Federal Government.\n  We recognized in 1994 that the only way to seriously address crime in \nour communities would be to vigorously and consistently support State \nand local law enforcement. We made a commitment to do just that by \ncreating the Community Oriented Policing Services Program--more \ncommonly known as COPS.\n  This ambitious new program committed to put more than 100,000 new \nofficers on the streets and to expand the concept of community-oriented \npolicing. Crime rates went down every year for 8 consecutive years. \nViolent crime was reduced by 26 percent. The murder rate went down by \n34 percent.\n  In just a few short years, Americans went from being afraid to go out \non their streets to living in the safest neighborhoods in a generation. \nBy giving State and local law enforcement the support they needed, we \nwere able to improve the lives of millions of Americans.\n  I recognize there are many factors involved in whether crime rates go \nup and down and that the COPS Program was not the sole reason for this \nhistoric drop in violent crime. At the same time, the legacy of COPS is \nunmistakable. The Government Accountability Office, GAO, released a \nreport in October 2005 that concluded what many police chiefs and \nsheriffs have said all along--the COPS Program helps reduce crime. \nSpecifically, the GAO found that ``as a demonstration of whether a \nfederal program can affect crime rates through hiring officers and \nchanging policing practices, the evidence indicates that COPS \ncontributed to declines in crime above the levels of declines that \nwould have been expected without it.'' For every $1 in COPS hiring \ngrant expenditures per capita, there was a reduction of almost 30 index \ncrimes per 100,000 persons.\n  Former Attorney General John Ashcroft called the COPS Program a \n``miraculous success.'' But, unfortunately, I fear that some of us have \ntaken our eyes off the ball. Specifically, the Bush administration has \nforgotten the lessons we learned from the COPS Program. Despite the \ndramatic and historic COPS successes, President Bush has systematically \neliminated the programs that helped to lay the foundation for our low \ncrime rates.\n  President Bush has proposed to cut support for State and local law \nenforcement every year for the past 5 years, proposing a budget in 2007 \nthat cut $2 billion in guaranteed funding for State and local law \nenforcement from the amount we provided only 5 years ago. President \nBush has steadily tried to kill the COPS hiring program, routinely \ntrying to zero out all hiring funding.\n  And Congress has not held the line. During the 1990s, roughly $1 \nbillion per year was allocated for the COPS Program. In 2002, $385 \nmillion was allocated to hire officers. That allocation was steadily \nreduced until last year when, for the first time, funding to hire \nofficers was completely eliminated. Let me repeat: No Federal COPS \nfunding whatsoever to hire officers. Adding insult to injury, President \nBush has also proposed to zero out the Byrnes Justice Assistance Grant \nProgram.\n  From 1994 to 2003, this wildly popular program provided around $900 \nmillion per year to our States to improve their criminal justice \nsystems, providing vital resources to our men and women officers. Since \n2003, this number has steadily eroded, with President Bush proposing \nabsolutely no funding in his 2007 budget request. And I fear that we \nare now seeing the results of this vast defunding of the COPS Program \nand the Byrne Program--a result that was certainly not unpredictable.\n  Earlier this year, in response to the President's latest budget \nrequest, the President of the International Association of Chiefs of \nPolice, Mary Ann Viverette, stated: ``these cuts have the potential to \ncripple the capabilities of law enforcement agencies nationwide and \nwill undoubtedly force many departments to take officers off the \nstreets, leading to more crime and violence in our hometowns and \nultimately less security for our homeland.''\n  Many of us in Congress have also tried to raise the warning flags \nrepeatedly. This February, I released a report entitled, ``Abandoning \nthe Front Line: The Bush Administration's Record of Support for State \nand Local Law Enforcement'' which warned that we need to keep our eye \non the ball, otherwise we risk seeing dramatic increases in crime \nrates.\n  Another problem facing our local law enforcement agencies is the fact \nthat the FBI is getting out of the crime business. Since 9/11, the \nnumber of FBI agents focusing on crime has gone\n\n[[Page S6012]]\n\ndown by over 1,000 agents. As a result, drug investigations have \ndropped by 60 percent and violent crime investigations have been \nreduced by 40 percent.\n  This has created a perfect storm for law enforcement, and I hope that \nthese latest dramatic and troubling crime statistics serve as a wake-up \ncall to Congress and the President.\n  We must build on the successes of the past; we must never become \ncomplacent. When I speak to law enforcement groups on the subject of \ncrime, I make the point that keeping crime rates low is like cutting \nthe grass. You mow your lawn and it looks great. You let it grow for a \nweek, and it starts looking ragged. You let it grow for a month and you \nhave a jungle.\n  The preliminary numbers released yesterday show that we have not been \ncutting the grass. In Cleveland, from 1994 to 2001, we spent $3.2 \nmillion per year for COPS hiring. From 2002 to 2005, we only spent \n$875,500 per year. A 2004 news article noted that Cleveland lost 250 \nofficers, a reduction of 15 percent in their force. In their latest \ncrime numbers, murder is up 38 percent; violent crime is up 7 percent. \nIn St. Louis, from 1994 to 2001, we spend $770,000 per year for COPS \nhiring. From 2002 to 2005, that number was zero. A 2003 study found \nthat St. Louis had lost 168 officers, a reduction of 11 percent in \ntheir force. In their latest crime numbers murder is up 16 percent, \nviolent crime up 20 percent. The pattern is, unfortunately, clear.\n  In Philadelphia from 1994 to 2001, we spent $5,250,000 per year for \nCOPS hiring. From 2002 to 2995, that number was again zero, Last year, \nI asked the Philadelphia police chief about the number of officers they \nhave lost recently. He said since 2003, they were down 600 officers. In \nPhiladelphia's latest crime numbers, murder is up 14.2 percent, violent \ncrime up 3.4 percent.\n  Now is the time to see the error in our recent ways. It is my hope \nthat the Appropriations, Commerce, Justice, and Science Subcommittee \nwill see fit to fully fund the COPS Program, the Justice assistance \ngrants, and other critical crime control programs when it reports out \nits appropriations bill later this summer. If they do not, I will be \noffering an amendment to restore full funding for the COPS Program. I \nhave done this for the past several years.\n  The Senate has previously not adopted my amendments, however--with \nopponents arguing that the COPS Program has worked, so we should kill \nit, or that it is not a Federal responsibility to fund local law \nenforcement. Critics will also argue that adding funding to the COPS \nProgram will bust the budget.\n  I believe that the safety of the American citizens is our No. 1 \npriority, and I cannot accept the argument that we cannot find funding \nfor local law enforcement at the same time we are giving a tax cut to \nour nation's millionaires. They did not ask for this tax cut, and I \nknow that they would be willing to give that back in order to keep \ntheir communities safer.\n  The COPS Program helps us prevent both crime and terrorism, and I \nhope my colleagues will support me in restoring funding for this \ncritical program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/16/senate-section/article/S6012-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     THE LIFE OF DR. JAMES CAMERON\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, Dr. James Cameron, sadly, passed \naway on June 11, and with his passing, the Nation has lost one the 20th \ncentury's greatest civil rights pioneers.\n  James Cameron was born in 1914 in La Crosse, WI, but it was during \nthe time that he lived in Marion, IN, that he would have a terrifying \nexperience that would forever change the course of his life.\n  On August 7, 1930, when he was just 16, he was wrongly accused of and \narrested for the murder of a White man and the rape of a White woman. \nWhile in jail, a mob broke in and dragged him, and the other two \ncharged with the crime, out into the street. A rope was placed around \nCameron's neck, but he was spared when a man in the crowd proclaimed \nCameron's innocence. While Cameron survived the beating and attempted \nlynching, the other two men were lynched and killed.\n  Cameron was convicted as an accessory to involuntary manslaughter--\nfor which he was later pardoned--but no one was ever accused, charged, \nor arrested for the lynching and murder of the other two men.\n  After surviving this horrific experience, Dr. Cameron dedicated his \nlife to raising awareness of racial injustice in America. In the 1940s, \nhe organized several chapters of the National Association for the \nAdvancement of Colored People, NAACP, in Indiana. As the Indiana State \ndirector of civil liberties from 1942 to 1950, Dr. Cameron worked to \nend segregation. The strong presence of the Ku Klux Klan in Indiana at \nthe time made his job that much more difficult and dangerous. Dr. \nCameron faced threats of violence, including threats to his life.\n  After he moved to Milwaukee, he continued his civil rights work by \nprotesting against segregated housing and police brutality. During the \n1960s, he took part in marches in Washington, DC, with civil rights \nleaders Martin Luther King, Jr., and Coretta Scott King.\n  Furthering his commitment to civil rights education, Dr. Cameron \nmortgaged his home in 1982 to publish 5,000 copies of his memoir, ``A \nTime of Terror.'' The book provides a moving account of his near-death \nexperience in 1930.\n  After visiting Israel's Holocaust Museum, Dr. Cameron was inspired to \nconstruct a similar museum in Wisconsin, dedicated to the history and \nstruggles of African Americans. His dream became a reality in 1988 when \nhe opened the Black Holocaust Museum, which has made an important \ncontribution to Milwaukee and an invaluable contribution to our \nunderstanding of American history.\n  It was particularly fitting that Dr. Cameron was able to watch in \nperson as the U.S. Senate finally passed a resolution apologizing to \nvictims of lynching. His monumental efforts were central to that \nimportant and long-overdue moment.\n  Dr. Cameron dedicated his life to ending racial injustice. Now his \nstrength and resilience must inspire all of us as we carry on that \ncritically important work. James Cameron's incredible story of survival \nis a part of history. But Dr. Cameron was more than just a part of \nhistory--he helped to shape history, with his determined commitment to \npromoting civil rights. With everything James Cameron did, he served \nthe cause of justice. He led a courageous, remarkable life, and he will \nbe greatly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/16/senate-section/article/S6012-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6012-S6013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n              100TH ANNIVERSARY OF MADISON, WEST VIRGINIA\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it is with great honor that I \nrecognize the 100th anniversary of the founding of the town of Madison, \nWV. A celebration will take place this month, and I would like to take \nthis opportunity to speak for a few moments about this wonderful \nAppalachian community. Madison was incorporated as the county seat of \nBoone County, which it remains today. It is also the home of a number \nof exemplary schools and dedicated churches. Madison has long been \nnoted for its rich coal mining heritage, and was named for Colonel \nWilliam Madison Peyton, pioneer coal operator and leader of the \nmovement that led to the establishment of Boone County.\n  A significant percentage of Madison residents are employed by coal \nmining corporations, or related businesses. That makes it fitting that \nthe township is the home of the Bituminous Coal Heritage Foundation \nMuseum and the location of the West Virginia Coal Festival. Each year, \nthousands of people travel to Madison for this festival to celebrate \ncoal heritage. This year, the festival will include a memorial service \nto the 18 West Virginians who tragically lost their lives in recent \nmonths in mining accidents. In light of these events, along with State \nand local officials and I have been working to better ensure the safety \nof all West Virginia coal miners. Another important asset to the City \nof Madison is Boone Memorial Hospital which serves the community with \npersonalized care and respect for all in need of medical attention.\n  The town of Madison is the historical site of a crucial Union victory \nduring\n\n[[Page S6013]]\n\nthe Civil War. The Battle of Boone County Courthouse, the name of the \ntown before it was known as Madison, occurred early in the war on \nSeptember 1, 1861, at a time when the Union army had suffered many \ndevastating defeats. The original court house in Madison was burned by \nUnion soldiers as a result of the skirmish. Madison's centennial \ncelebration will take place on the grounds of the restored structure.\n  On the grounds of that courthouse stands a memorial to soldiers who \ndied in service of their Nation. Madison and Boone County, as all of \nWest Virginia, have given more than its share of brave men and women to \nthe service of our Nation. Boone countians are fiercely patriotic and \ndedicated to their families, their community and their God. They are \nresilient and determined, having suffered the ups and downs of the coal \neconomy. They are also kind-hearted people. When I first came to West \nVirginia as a young man in the VISTA program over 40 years ago, it was \nto a community on the Boone-Kanawha county line. The people of that \ncommunity taught me so much and forever changed my life. I will forever \nhave a special place in my heart for Boone County, the town of Madison, \nand their residents. I certainly wish the town and its people the best \nfor the centennial celebration and much success during the next 100 \nyears.\n  I hope my fellow Senators and fellow West Virginians will join me in \ncelebrating this special occasion, the centennial of Madison, \nWV.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/16/senate-section/article/S6013-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                       ST. ALBANS FIRE DEPARTMENT\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the St. \nAlbans Fire Department for 100 years of dedicated service to its \ncommunity. Their outstanding achievement has not only improved the town \nof St. Albans, but West Virginia as a whole. I am proud to represent \nsuch a courageous and selfless group of individuals, who serve West \nVirginia well every day. All first responders are enormously important \nto our well being and to their communities, but the longevity of this \ndepartment deserves special recognition.\n  The St. Albans Fire Department was started in 1906 as the St. Albans \nSalvage Corps. The small group of committed volunteers ventures to \npreserve property and save lives in this small Kanawha County \ncommunity. Their goal created a foundation on which the St. Albans Fire \nDepartment--SAFD--was built. Today, the SAFD is a 26 person team of 19 \nfull time and seven part time firefighters. Although the operation has \ngrown tremendously, the firefighters still strive to protect every \naspect of the community. They respond not only to fires, but also to \nautomobile accidents, water rescue, as well as providing emergency \nmedical service. The firefighters that represent St. Albans are highly \ntrained and capable of handling all types of emergencies.\n  The SAFD was presented with the Life Safety Achievement Award for the \nsixth time in 2005. This award is given to the departments that help \nreduce the number of fire related deaths each year. In 2004, St. Albans \ndid not have any structural fire deaths. The Department was also able \nto improve their Insurance Safety Office rating from a Class 4 to a \nClass 3. The better rating will help not only the fire department, but \nthe people they serve as well, by lowering their insurance premiums. \nThis achievement shows the true dedication of the St. Albans Fire \nDepartment. Congratulations on such an amazing accomplishment, and let \nthe next 100 years be as strong as the first.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/16/senate-section/article/S6013-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/16/senate-section/article/S6013-3", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/16/senate-section/article/S6013-4", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bill was read the first time:\n\n       S. 3534.

A bill to amend the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to \nprovide for a YouthBuild program; read the first time.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the YouthBuild \nTransfer Act. I am pleased to be joined in this important effort by \nSenator Kennedy, the ranking member of the Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee, and Senators DeWine, Kerry, and Murray.\n  This bill transfers the YouthBuild program from the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development, HUD, the Department of Labor, DOL, as an \namendment to the Workforce Investment Act, WIA. YouthBuild was enacted \nin 1992. It provides programs for young adults aged 16 to 24 to build \nor rehabilitate housing for homeless or low-income individuals in their \ncommunities while they study to earn their own high school diploma or \nGED. These youth gain occupational and technical skills while building \ntheir knowledge to help them become and remain productive participants \nin the workplace.\n  By transferring YouthBuild to DOL, the program will be more closely \naligned with and benefit from collaboration with the larger workforce \nsystem at the State and local levels. It will continue to serve those \nyoung adults most in need of these services, and enable them to serve \ntheir communities by building affordable housing, and assists them in \ntransforming their own lives and roles in society.\n  YouthBuild assists young adults not currently enrolled in school gain \nneeded education, skills and knowledge. The skill and literacy \nrequirements of today's and tomorrow's workplace cannot be met if we do \nnot provide everyone access to lifelong education, training and \nretraining.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n  (The bill will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor and express my \nstrong support for the YouthBuild Transfer Act which will preserve and \nextend the YouthBuild Program by transferring its operations from \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, to the Department of \nLabor, DOL.\n   Last year, President Bush's budget request recommended transferring \nthe operations of the YouthBuild Program from HUD to DOL. In November \n2005, I introduced the YouthBuild Transfer Act of 2005, S. 1999, to \nauthorize that transfer, and it is very similar to this legislation \nbeing introduced today.\n  I express my appreciation to Senate Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Chairman Enzi and the ranking member, Senator \nKennedy, for their work in developing this consensus legislation. I \nalso thank Senator DeWine for his efforts in both developing this \nlegislation and for his efforts to obtain funding for YouthBuild for \nmany years. I believe this bill continues the bipartisan spirit which \nhas been the hallmark of the YouthBuild Program.\n  Poverty, neglect, abuse, and deprivation of all kinds can prevent \npeople\n\n[[Page S6015]]\n\nfrom reaching their true potential. Many of those who have fallen off \ntrack, suffered losses, and made mistakes can recover. If given the \nopportunity, they can learn to cope with obstacles and care effectively \nabout themselves, their families, and their communities. YouthBuild \nhelps young people who have lost their way to turn their lives around.\n  YouthBuild is a uniquely comprehensive program that offers at-risk \nyouth an immediate productive role rebuilding their communities. While \nattending basic education classes for 50 percent of program time, \nstudents also receive job skills training in the construction field, \npersonal counseling from respected mentors, a supportive peer group \nwith positive values, and experience in civic engagement. They build \nhouses for homeless and low-income people while earning their own GED \nor high school diploma.\n  YouthBuild is built on success. During the 1960s, YouthBuild's future \nfounder, Dorothy Stoneman, formed the Youth Action Program to rebuild \nhomes in New York City. The successful renovation of an East Harlem \ntenement led to a citywide coalition and in 1990, led to YouthBuild \nUSA, an organization created to replicate this program around the \nNation.\n  After visiting a YouthBuild site, I introduced legislation in 1992 \nauthorizing Federal funding for YouthBuild through the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development which was enacted into law as part of the \nCranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act. Since then, I have \nled a coalition of Senators in support of Federal funding for this \nimportant program. The $600 million that has been appropriated through \nHUD since fiscal year 1993 has leveraged over $1.5 billion of \nadditional public and private investment at the local level due to the \nresourcefulness of local leaders and the high demand for YouthBuild \nprograms.\n  The results have been dramatic. Since 1994, YouthBuild has helped \nmore than 60,000 disadvantaged youth into productive employment, higher \neducation, and civic engagement across the Nation. At the same time, \nYouthBuild has helped rebuild low- and moderate-income communities by \ncreating more than 15,000 units of affordable housing. Over 1,000 local \norganizations, in every State, have applied for HUD funds to bring \nYouthBuild to their communities.\n  Research on 900 YouthBuild graduates, several years after they had \ncompleted the program showed that more than 75 percent of them were \neither employed at an average wage of $10 an hour or attending college \nand were positively contributing to their communities. Of those who had \ncommitted felonies, the recidivism rate was a strikingly low 15 percent \nand all studies to date have shown a recidivism rate below 20 percent \nstrikingly lower than the 60 percent recidivism rate for most prison \nsystems.\n  Today there are over 226 YouthBuild programs in 43 States engaging \n8,000 young adults, and the number of programs could easily be \nexpanded. Last year alone, 260 communities were denied YouthBuild \nfunding. The demand is equally great from young people--in 2003 local \nprograms turned away over 10,000 applicants solely for lack of funds, \nand in 2004 they turned away 12,000. The 20 percent cut suffered for \nfiscal year 2006 could cause the closing of 25 local programs; if the \nfunds are restored and expanded, some of these closings can be averted. \nI am hopeful that the YouthBuild Transfer Act will be enacted into law. \nHowever, YouthBuild must continue to receive Federal funds in fiscal \nyear 2007 in order to remain a successful program. President Bush \nincluded $50 million for YouthBuild in his fiscal year 2007 budget \nrequest to Congress. Senator DeWine and I have sent a letter to the \nSenate Appropriations Committee in support of $90 million for the \nprogram. I look forward to working with the members of the \nAppropriations Committee to insure that this critical program receives \nan increase in Federal funding next year.\n  Increasing Federal funding for YouthBuild will help address critical \nnational problems that cost society dearly. Over 32 percent of \nAmerica's youth are dropping out of high school with no prospect of \nbecoming gainfully employed, contributing members of society, \ntaxpayers, and in inner-city communities, that percentage- rises toward \n50. States are spending $36,000 per year per person to house 365,000 16 \nto 24 year olds, 65 percent of whom have dropped out of high school. In \naddition, the construction industry is short 80,000 workers. \nFurthermore, in the aftermath of Katrina, the need for construction \nworkers is increasing, and YouthBuild programs are a resource in the \ngulf, sending trained crews to Mississippi to rebuild homes as part of \ntheir service to the Nation.\n  YouthBuild is also on the cutting edge of education reform for \ndropouts and effective re-entry for offenders. Forty YouthBuild \nprograms have now been chartered by their States or authorized by their \nsuperintendent of schools to provide high school diplomas and to \nreceive public funds as successful public schools reclaiming high \nschool dropouts. In several States, the criminal justice departments \nare now supplementing HUD funds to expand capacity of YouthBuild \nprograms as successful re-entry programs for ex-offenders. To maximize \nthe investment already made in YouthBuild as a resource for education \nof dropouts and reentry of ex-offenders, it is imperative to keep the \nfoundation of its Federal funding strong.\n  I ask all of my colleagues to support the YouthBuild Transfer Act to \nallow the YouthBuild Program to expand this unique comprehensive \nprogram to provide at-risk youth an immediately productive role \nrebuilding their communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/16/senate-section/article/S6015-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 514--TO AUTHORIZE TESTIMONY AND LEGAL REPRESENTATION \n              IN CITY OF EUGENE V.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have exerted very \n     large demands on the Treasury of the United States and \n     required tremendous sacrifice by the members of the Armed \n     Forces of the United States.\n       (2) Congress has a constitutional responsibility to ensure \n     comprehensive oversight of the expenditure of United States \n     Government funds.\n       (3) Waste and corporate abuse of United States Government \n     resources are particularly unacceptable and reprehensible \n     during times of war.\n       (4) The magnitude of the funds involved in the \n     reconstruction of Afghanistan and Iraq and the war on \n     terrorism, together with the speed with which these funds \n     have been committed, presents a challenge to the effective \n     performance of the traditional oversight function of Congress \n     and the auditing functions of the executive branch.\n       (5) The Senate Special Committee to Investigate the \n     National Defense Program, popularly know as the Truman \n     Committee, which was established during World War II, offers \n     a constructive precedent for bipartisan oversight of wartime \n     contracting that can also be extended to wartime and postwar \n     reconstruction activities.\n       (6) The Truman Committee is credited with an extremely \n     successful investigative effort, performance of a significant \n     public education role, and achievement of fiscal savings \n     measured in the billions of dollars.\n       (7) The public has a right to expect that taxpayer \n     resources will be carefully disbursed and honestly spent.\n\n     SEC. 1502.

EDUCATION OF FUTURE NUCLEAR ENGINEERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Department of Defense and the United States depend \n     on the specialized expertise of nuclear engineers who support \n     the development and sustainment of technologies including \n     naval reactors, strategic weapons, and nuclear power plants.\n       (2) Experts estimate that over 25 percent of the \n     approximately 58,000 workers in the nuclear power industry in \n     the United States will be eligible to retire within 5 years, \n     representing both a huge loss of institutional memory and a \n     potential national security crisis.\n       (3) This shortfall of workers is exacerbated by reductions \n     to the University Reactor Infrastructure and Education \n     Assistance program, which trains civilian nuclear scientists \n     and engineers. The defense and civilian nuclear industries \n     are interdependent on a limited number of educational \n     institutions to produce their workforce. A reduction in \n     nuclear scientists and engineers trained in the civilian \n     sector may result in a further loss of qualified personnel \n     for defense-related research and engineering.\n       (4) The Department of Defense's successful Science, Math \n     and Research for Transformation (SMART) scholarship-for-\n     service program serves as a good model for a targeted \n     scholarship or fellowship program designed to educate future \n     scientists at the postsecondary and postgraduate levels.\n       (b) Report on Education of Future Nuclear Engineers.--\n       (1) Study.--The Secretary of Energy shall study the \n     feasibility and merit of establishing a targeted scholarship \n     or fellowship program to educate future nuclear engineers at \n     the postsecondary and postgraduate levels.\n       (2) Report required.--The President shall submit to the \n     congressional defense committees, together with the budget \n     request submitted for fiscal year 2008, a report on the study \n     conducted by the Secretary of Energy under paragraph (1).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4300.
