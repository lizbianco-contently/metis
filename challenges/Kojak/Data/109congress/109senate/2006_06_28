Mr. President, as you know, outside these doors to my left \nis a beautiful room called the President's Room, or the Red Room. We \ncall it the President's Room because for many decades, this was the \nplace where Presidents came to sign legislation. During the past \ncentury, the 20th century, it wasn't used often at all. Rarely was it \nused for Presidents to come and sign legislation. But on August 6, \n1965, it was used. The last time the Red Room, or the President's Room, \nwas used for signing a bill into law was on a hot summer day of 1965. \nIt had been a very hot summer. The purpose of President Lyndon Johnson \ncoming to the Capitol to sign the bill here, rather than in the White \nHouse, was because it was the Voting Rights Act. The reason I say it \nwas a very hot summer, it had been a hot couple of years.\n  I would direct everyone's attention to a wonderful book written by \nTaylor Branch, a relatively new book, published recently, called ``At \nCanaan's Edge.'' This book tells the story of a number of things, but \none is how the Voting Rights Act became law. People\n\n[[Page S6592]]\n\nsacrificed their lives to allow this movement to go forward and, \nultimately, to have this legislation passed.\n  So if we look back historically, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is one \nof the most magnificent pieces of legislation ever passed by Congress \nbecause what it did is jump forward 100 years following the Civil War \nand give African Americans the ability to register to vote. Counties \nand various States in the South that were basically all African \nAmerican had no African-American voters. The Voting Rights Act changed \nthat. And now African Americans all over this country, but especially \nin the South, have had their lives changed by not having to feel the \ncrash of a baseball bat on their head like Reverend Reeb, who came to \npeacefully demonstrate to allow people to have the right to vote and \nwas killed with the smash of a baseball bat on the side of his head. \nLives were lost, I repeat, and many people were injured. Many were \nseriously injured in an attempt to exercise the basic right of voting \nin America.\n  Why do I bring this to the Senate's attention today? The reason I \nbring it to the Senate's attention today is, it was a short time ago, \nearly May, and it was very hot in Washington, and we went to the east \nfront on the House side to have a press conference. There were dozens \nof Members of Congress there. Cameras were there, and people were \nshoving for position so the camera could see them. Everybody was there \nto talk about the need to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act. The press \nevent took a long time. We had a number of speakers there, and they all \ntalked about how important it was that we reauthorize the Voting Rights \nAct. I was there, Senator Frist was there, House leaders were there, \nchairman and ranking members of the Judiciary Committees were there, \ncivil rights leaders were there to announce their support for the \nreauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. We stood together that day on \nthe steps of the Capitol and announced a bipartisan, bicameral \nintroduction of that bill.\n  I thought that day held great promise for the Congress and the \nNation. The old days of the early 1960s were put behind us, and this \nwould just go through here very quickly. I thought the legislation \nwould be reauthorized and we would move down the road. I thought it \nshowed great possibilities that leaders of both parties recognized that \nprotecting the right to vote is not a partisan issue, it is an American \nissue and one we would join to support without qualification.\n  While finding common ground seems increasingly beyond our reach on \nmany debates in the Senate, our joint support for the Voting Rights Act \nstood as a sign that we could still readily stand together to protect \nthe rights upon which this Nation was founded.\n  In the weeks that followed, some progress was made in moving the bill \nforward in the House and the Senate. In both Chambers, an exhaustive \nrecord was built, demonstrating without question the continued need for \nthe Voting Rights Act protections.\n  I am sorry to report that progress has stalled. It has really \nstalled. Last week, House leaders failed to follow through on their \ncommitment to move this reauthorization in that body. It is now not \nclear when or even if the House will act. We urge them to do so \nquickly. But the fact that the House hasn't acted doesn't mean we \ncannot act in the Senate. The commitment we all made in May on the east \nfront of the Capitol is a commitment that the American people are going \nto hold us to. As I have said, we need not wait for the House. I am \ntold the Senate Judiciary Committee is going to complete a markup of \nthis important legislation in July. I hope so. As we know, the original \ntimetable was May.\n  Mr. President, I stand ready to work with my friend, the \ndistinguished majority leader, to move this matter forward in the \nSenate, and let the House do what they feel they need to do. We need to \nhave the Judiciary Committee complete its work, bring this to the \nSenate floor in July, and spend time on it, talking about how important \nthis legislation has been and how that President's Room back there \ncould be used by President Bush to come and sign the reauthorization of \nthis bill. Hopefully he can do it this summer.\n  I don't stand alone in the pursuit of passing the reauthorization of \nthe Voting Rights Act. More than 40 Democratic and Republican Senators \nhave signed as cosponsors of this legislation. I really believe that \ntogether we can fulfill the commitment we made in May to support the \nvoting rights of all Americans, without equivocation, by calling this \nbill up in July and moving forward with its swift passage.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDING pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/28/senate-section/article/S6592-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6592-S6599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CHECKLIST FOR CHANGE\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, last week, the Democratic women of the \nSenate, led by our dean, Senator Barbara Mikulski, held an event at the \nSewall Belmont House, which I am very proud to say put forth what we \nare calling the checklist for change. We came together around the \nimportance of an agenda in Congress that meets the needs of all of the \nAmerican people.\n  We have been given an hour this morning to discuss these issues. Our \nfirst speaker, our leader, is the Senator from Maryland, who has paved \nthe way for women not only in the Senate but in our country on so many \nissues. I am, with great pride, yielding to the Senator from Maryland.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York, as \nwell as all of my colleagues, the nine Democratic women from the U.S. \nSenate.\n  We are united today. We, the Democratic women of the Senate, rise in \na united way to launch something we are calling the Democratic Women \nfor Change. We want to change the agenda that is going through the \nSenate. We want to change the tone in the Senate for one of more \ncivility, and we want to change the schedule to get things done.\n  The Senate has only been in session about 75 days, less time than \nmost State legislatures. And what have we debated? Divisive \nconstitutional amendments and tax breaks for zillionaires.\n  I regret that the Republican leadership has squandered time, \nsquandered opportunity, and squandered taxpayers' money. We spent time \nwith bills focused on reelecting Republicans instead of helping \nAmerican families. It is time we bring real issues to the floor. We \nhave only 50 days left before this Senate adjourns. This is why we have \ndone our checklist.\n  We have a must-do list for change. It is specific, it is immediate, \nit is realizable, and it is also affordable.\n  We women know about checklists. We remember all the important things \nthat we need to get done by having a checklist. It is what we use to \nkeep our families on track, and now we bring a checklist to the Senate \nto get America on track.\n  These are the challenges that we can meet right now by the time \nCongress adjourns for the fall elections. Each and every one of us has \na specific issue we want to see done, and we want to check that off.\n  I am advocating for reliable pensions. I want to talk about \nretirement security and giving help to those people who practice self-\nhelp all of their lives. In the United States of America, everyone \nshould retire with financial security.\n  Honoring your father and your mother is not only a good commandment \nto live by, it is a very good policy by which to govern. That is why we \nthe Democratic women of the Senate fought to stop the privatization of \nSocial Security, and we were successful. Now we stand sentry on the \nSenate floor to make sure Social Security is never ever privatized.\n  We believe that Social Security should be a guaranteed benefit, not a \nguaranteed gamble. We want to make sure Social Security is reliable, \nundeniable, and inflation proof.\n  But as we stand sentry, we are alarmed to see that a budget bill will \ncome soon to the Senate floor that\n\n[[Page S6593]]\n\ncould be a backdoor way of privatizing Social Security. The so-called \nbudget reform bill will create a commission on entitlements, fast-track \nauthority, but it is really a backdoor way to privatize Social \nSecurity.\n  Under the guise of empowering an unelected commission, they would \nhave the authority to cut benefits, to turn it over to Wall Street \nwhere seniors would have to rely on the bull of political promises or \nthe bear of a market. We, your Democratic women, are standing sentry, \nand we will not let this happen.\n  But we also want to support the private sector, the good guys in \nAmerica's entrepreneurial and business community who provide pensions. \nSo we are fighting for pensions that workers can count on and so that \ngood-guy businesses would have clear rules coming out of the \nlegislative framework on which they could depend. And we want to \nprotect taxpayers from a bailout of companies dumping their programs on \na government program.\n  Where are we now? A pension bill has been languishing. We are \nstalled, we are sputtering, we are dithering. It has been 180 days \nsince the House and the Senate passed each bill on pensions, and 110 \ndays since conferees were named--110 days.\n  After all is said and done, more is being said than gets done. Time \nis running out. We must pass this bill. But most of all, time is \nrunning out on this Congress. The American people are running out of \npatience. That is why we bring to the Senate our economic list for \nchange, and we ask that we adopt this checklist and let's bring about \nchange that will make a difference for our constituents.\n  I now yield the floor to my wonderful colleague from New York, Mrs. \nClinton, and thank her for all of the extra work she is doing in \nstanding up for New York and standing up for America.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I applaud my friend and colleague, \nSenator Mikulski, who is speaking out eloquently and strongly about the \nimportance of pension and retirement security and pointing out the \ndangers of the legislation--coming out on a totally party-line vote--\ncoming out of the Budget Committee that we believe would once again \nraise the specter of Social Security privatization.\n  So we are sounding the alarm, and we are making clear that the \nDemocratic women of the Senate will stand sentry, as Senator Mikulski \nsaid, and we will stand firmly to protect Social Security because we \nknow how many women depend on Social Security.\n  Part of our effort is to in very simple terms put forth this \nchecklist for change. We know we have to secure our economy in a more \ncompetitive world and secure our energy supplies in that competitive \nworld.\n  Our current energy policy is weakening our national security, hurting \nour pocketbooks, violating our common values, and threatening our \nchildren's futures. Right now, instead of our national security \ndictating our energy policy, our failed energy policy dictates our \nnational security. We want and need a fundamental change in direction \nto secure our Nation's energy future.\n  I believe a strong, balanced national energy policy is a key to \nstrong economic and environmental policies as well.\n  It is time we decide do we allow our economic security and our \nnational security to be weighed down by a failed energy policy or do we \nchoose a new path? We think, the Democratic women of the Senate, that \nwe need a new path.\n  Here is a concrete goal. Let's reduce our dependence on foreign oil \nby at least 50 percent by 2025. How will we get there? It starts by \ngetting back our American can-do attitude and a new commitment, such as \nthe Apollo project that sent a man to the Moon. We know how to do this. \nAmericans are better at setting goals and solving problems than any \npeople in the history of the world, but we are acting as though we \ncan't control our own destiny when it comes to energy, that we can't \npossibly do what needs to be done to break our addiction to foreign \noil.\n  I have introduced legislation to create a strategic energy fund, to \ncommit our Nation wholly to a new energy future, to invest in \nalternatives and efficiency, to create jobs, to strengthen our economy, \nand to free our hands fully to protect our Nation in the world. I don't \nwant to see one more year go by where we are not doing what it takes to \nprevent us from being blackmailed and extorted by oil regimes that have \nus literally over a barrel.\n  The strategic energy fund will invest in renewable energy, such as \nwind and solar, transform America's vehicles by expanding consumer tax \ncredits, and making sure we have more hybrids and other advanced clean \ndiesel automobiles and trucks.\n  We will accelerate home-grown biofuels by investing in research and \nloan guarantees for cellulosic ethanol production.\n  We will speed fuel infrastructure by pairing increased tax incentives \nfor installation of E-85 pumps with a mandate to have them at 50 \npercent of our gas stations within 10 years.\n  And we will unleash American ingenuity by investing $9 billion in a \nnew energy research agency modeled on DARPA, which was created in the \nDefense Department after Sputnik went up and has given us so much, \nincluding the Internet.\n  We challenge the Republican Congress to make energy independence a \npriority by passing meaningful energy legislation, such as a strategic \nenergy fund, this session.\n  I am so proud to stand with my Democratic women colleagues and put \nforth this checklist for change. It will make a difference in America's \nfuture. Let's get about doing the business of America.\n  I yield the floor for my distinguished colleague from California, \nSenator Boxer.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Clinton. I am also very \nproud to be on the floor of this great body with my Democratic women \nSenate colleagues.\n  We held a press conference in which we challenged the Republican \nleadership to bring up issues on this floor that are meaningful to our \nfamilies. Here is our checklist for change. Each of us has taken one of \nthese issues. Mine happens to be protecting our air, land, and water.\n  The message we are here today to convey is that the Republicans run \nthe Senate, the White House, and the House of Representatives. They \ncontrol what issues come to the floor of the Congress for debate. We \nspent yesterday debating an amendment to the Constitution to ban flag \nburning. We also debated a bipartisan proposal by Senators Bennett and \nClinton to ban flag burning via a statute.\n  Every one of us in this body voted to ban flag burning, be it by a \nstatute or by an amendment. But one has to ask the question: Is that \ndebate, which we have had four times, more important than the issues \nthat are on our checklist for change?\n  There have been four reports of flag burnings this year. That is four \ntoo many, but they were four. Yet there are 44 million Americans whose \npensions are at risk while this Congress fails to act to protect those \npensions.\n  Four flags burned versus 7.5 million Americans who have been denied \nan increase in the minimum wage. And this Congress, under the \nRepublicans, sees nothing wrong with giving themselves a pay raise, but \nthey can't raise the minimum wage, and it has been flat for 9 years, \nwhich means it has gone down in value and people cannot make it on \n$5.15 an hour.\n  Four flags have been burned--four too many--versus 170,000 talented \ncollege-ready students each year who stay home because they can't \nafford tuition.\n  Four flags burned--four too many--yet 30,000-plus veterans have \nwaited in 2006 for their first medical appointment, an issue that will \nbe taken up by Senator Murray.\n  Four flags burned versus 200,000 people in New Orleans living in \ntrailers, unfinished houses, or tents in the front yards of their \nKatrina-ravaged homes.\n  Four flags burned this year--four too many--versus $2.89 a gallon for \nregular gas. By the way, that is the national price. In California, we \nare looking at well over $3 a gallon.\n  Four flags burned--four too many--versus 46 million Americans with no \nhealth insurance, and Senator Lincoln will talk about that.\n\n[[Page S6594]]\n\n  Four flags burned--four too many--versus over 500,000 Americans who \nhave lost their lives while we wait for this Republican Congress to \ntake action on stem cell legislation, an issue that has been championed \nby many of us in this Senate and on this checklist carried by Senator \nFeinstein.\n  And, finally, four flags burned--four too many--versus 75 million \nAmericans living near our most polluted toxic waste Superfund sites.\n  In conclusion, because my checkpoint is protect our air, land, and \nwater, I call on this Republican Congress to address two pressing \nenvironmental crises: global warming and Superfund cleanup.\n  It is easy to put global warming on the back burner as long as our \neveryday lives are not affected, but some people think their everyday \nlives are beginning to be affected. The best scientists in the world \nwarn us that we are near the tipping point on global warming.\n  Just the other day, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, along with \nthe national academy of science for 10 other nations, agreed that \nclimate change is real and it has to be addressed. So we call on this \nRepublican Congress to do something about it. Don't sit back and say \nthis doesn't exist because you are ignoring science.\n  I am proud to say that in the State of California, they are \nlistening. This week a historic global warming bill cleared the first \nhurdle and passed the California Senate Environmental Quality \nCommittee. California has been a leader in the environment, and Senator \nFeinstein and I want to make sure that we can bring some of that action \nright here to the Senate.\n  Last point: We need to clean up these Superfund sites that are \nhurting our families and hurting our communities. Under the Clinton \nadministration, we cleaned up 80 of these sites a year. Now it is down \nto 40 sites a year. We owe our children a clean and healthy \nenvironment.\n  Mr. President, it is time for you and the Members of the Republican \nCongress to call on the Republican leadership to take up our checklist \nfor change. We are very proud to be talking about this all together \nthis morning on the Senate floor.\n  I am proud to yield now for Senator Patty Murray of Washington.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am very proud to be here this morning \nwith the other Democratic women of the Senate in urging the leadership \nto talk about the issues that are the true priorities of the American \npeople. The issue I am talking about today is so important, and that is \nthe treatment of our Nation's veterans. Our military men and women and \ntheir families are sacrificing every day for all of us. It should be \nour duty to honor that sacrifice, whether it is with jobs or training, \nsupport or health care. But on this issue, the Republican leadership \nhas failed miserably.\n  Today, the Department of Veterans Affairs continues to be overwhelmed \nand underfunded. Listen to what we know. The VA is currently seeing 38 \npercent more Iraq war veterans than they budgeted for--38 percent more. \nIn fact, in fiscal year 2006, the VA expected to provide medical care \nto 110,000, but that number is now closer to 170,000, and those \nveterans are waiting over a year to get the specialty care they need \nand deserve.\n  In Seattle, we have VA medical centers with over 2,000 veterans on \nwaiting lists to get an initial doctor's appointment. Veterans around \nthe country are waiting 18 months just to get their benefits. On Monday \nit was reported in the New York Times that veterans' spouses are being \nfaced with an impenetrable wall of bureaucracy as they try to collect \ntheir survivor benefits.\n  To me, and to my women colleagues, that is simply intolerable. We are \nalso woefully unprepared for the rising toll of post-traumatic stress \ndisorder and other battlefield-related mental illnesses that are \nhitting our troops. Right now, it is estimated that one-third--one-\nthird--of the 1.3 million Americans who have served in Iraq and \nAfghanistan are facing mental health challenges when they get home. The \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs recently revealed to us that it is on a \npace to see nearly 20,000 new cases of postcombat stress this fiscal \nyear among troops. Guess how many they estimated to see: 2,900. So they \nthought they would have 2,900, but they are on a pace to see 20,000. A \nVA Under Secretary noted that some of our VA clinics don't provide \nmental health care, or if they do, she said, waiting lists render that \ncare virtually inaccessible. Our service men and women, veterans, and \ntheir families deserve more than virtually inaccessible care. We have \nto do more.\n  On top of that, we have to be working to pass Federal legislation \nthat addresses the employment needs of veterans who are coming back \nhome from the battle front. Do my colleagues know that among 20- to 24-\nyear-olds, unemployment for veterans is double that of nonveterans, and \nit is three times the national average? That is unacceptable. Iraq war \nveterans are coming home, they are losing their jobs, they are not \ngetting medical care, they are having a hard time accessing benefits, \nand they are struggling to just get by.\n  We have a job to do in this Senate, and that is why the Democratic \nwomen are here today to talk about our checklist for change and \nfocusing on our veterans. Last week, I successfully amended the fiscal \nyear 2007 Agriculture appropriations bill to include $160 million to \ndeal with the data theft of 26.5 million veterans. We have to make sure \nthat our veterans don't have the double whammy of losing their data and \nthen losing their health care to pay for it.\n  Our service men and women deserve a new direction. So today we \nchallenge the Republican leadership to include the real cost of care \nfor our veterans when they submit their budget and to do right by our \nveterans and our military families by holding hearings on the holes in \ntransition assistance, mental health care, and health care that our \nveterans and families need.\n  Caring for our veterans is not a Republican or Democratic issue, it \nis an American issue. We call on this Congress to right now do the most \npatriotic thing we can do, and that is to fulfill our promise to our \nNation's veterans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter to Senator Frist from all of the Democratic women outlining \nour checklist for change and our call for action.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  Democratic Women for Change,\n\n                                                    June 21, 2006.\n     Hon. William H. Frist,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist, We, the Democratic women of the Senate, \n     are writing to challenge you to change direction, change the \n     tone, and change the agenda to match the priorities of the \n     American people.\n       There are approximately 50 days left in this legislative \n     session--still plenty of time to change direction and focus \n     instead on meeting the challenges that affect the American \n     people in their daily lives.\n       To that end, we present you with our ``Checklist for \n     Change''--nine challenges that Congress can meet right now. \n     We ask that these goals be considered during the remainder of \n     this session of Congress:\n       Safeguard America's Pensions: Americans deserve to retire \n     with dignity and financial security. We will continue to \n     oppose any plan to privitize social security, because seniors \n     deserve a guarantee rather than a gamble. Recent corporate \n     corruption and mismanagement has shown us that we must also \n     protect employee pension plans. The Republican Congress has \n     stalled these efforts. For the good of all American workers, \n     we challenge the Republican Congress to pass a clean pension \n     reform bill.\n       Keep Good Jobs in America: We need a jobs agenda that \n     fights for American workers and businesses. The flight of \n     American jobs overseas must be reversed. Currency \n     manipulation and the free flow of counterfeit goods from \n     countries like China have put American workers at an unfair \n     disadvantage for too long. We challenge the Republican \n     Congress to enact tax policies that Stop the outsourcing of \n     American jobs, to level the international playing field by \n     enforcing our trade agreements, and to raise the minimum \n     wage.\n       Make College Affordable for All: The best guarantee of a \n     good job is a quality education. In America, 170,000 college-\n     ready students don't attend college each year because the \n     cost is too high. Yet the Bush Administration has taken $12 \n     billion from student aid programs to pay for tax cuts for the \n     wealthiest Americans. We cballenge the Republican Congress to \n     increase the maximum Pell Grant, make the college tuition \n     tax credit permanent, and cut student loan interest rates.\n       Protect America and our Military Families: It is our duty \n     to care for the brave men\n\n[[Page S6595]]\n\n     and women who defend our nation at home and abroad. Yet the \n     Bush Administration consistently shortchanges healthcare and \n     other benefits for veterans, leaving many soldiers waiting a \n     year or more treatment. We challenge the Republic Congress to \n     provide benefits funding for veterans and to hold hearings on \n     mental health care and transition assistance for those coming \n     back from war abroad.\n       Prepare for Future Disasters: Nearly five years after \n     September 11th and ten months after Hurricane Katrina, the \n     Federal Government is still woefully unprepared to deal with \n     potential future disasters. We challenge the Republican \n     Congress to restore disaster to cabinet-level status; to \n     implement the recommendations of the September 11th \n     Commission; to develop safe evacuation plans; and to reform \n     the Stafford Act to better manage large catastrophes.\n       Make America Energy Independent: America's lack of a \n     coherent energy policy is weakening national security, \n     hurting our pocketbooks, violating our common values and \n     threatening our children's future. The Strategic Energy Fund \n     bill will cut our dependence on foreign oil in half by 2025, \n     invest in efficient energy alternatives and create good \n     American jobs. We challenge the Republican Congress to pass \n     the Strategic Energy Fund bill.\n       Make Small Business Healthcare Affordable: More than 46 \n     million Americans are uninsured. Small businesses create two \n     out of every three new jobs in America and account for nearly \n     half of America's overall employment, yet just 26% of \n     businesses with 50 or fewer employees provide health \n     insurance. The Small Employers Health Benefits Program will \n     create affordable, private health insurance for small \n     businesses and give parents the comfort of knowing that their \n     children are protected. We challenge the Republican Congress \n     to pass this crucial legislation.\n       Invest in Life Saving Science: Stem cell research provides \n     real hope for cures to many of the world's deadliest \n     diseases. Against the wishes of the American people, the Bush \n     Administration and the Republican Congress have blocked \n     efforts to expand stem cell research so that scientists and \n     doctors have every tool at their disposal to keep us healthy \n     and safe. As a result, America trails the rest of the world \n     in research. We challenge the Republican Congress to pass \n     stem cell legislation this summer.\n       Protect our Air, land and Water: The Bush Administration \n     has been negligent in protecting Americans from environmental \n     hazards. They have ignored the consensus of the best \n     scientists in the world when it comes to the threat of global \n     warming, and they have recklessly reduced clean ups of toxic \n     waste at Superfund sites. We challenge the Republican \n     Congress to pass a comprehensive science-based bill to reduce \n     greenhouse gases and to restore funding for Superfund \n     cleanup.\n       We hope that you will put these bedrock issues on the \n     agenda, because the American people are counting on us to \n     fight for them. We can and must do better.\n           Sincerely,\n         Barbara Mikulski, Barbara Boxer, Maria Cantwell, Hillary \n           Rodham Clinton, Diane Feinstein, Mary Landrieu, Blanche \n           Lincoln, Patty Murray, Debbie Stabenow.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am proud to yield the floor for my \ncolleague from Washington State, Senator Cantwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Murray \nfrom Washington, for her eloquent statement about the state of veterans \naffairs in our country and to make sure that those who patriotically \nserved our country are taken care of in their time of need.\n  Many of my colleagues are here--and I appreciate being with my women \nSenate Democratic colleagues--to talk about our checklist for change \nand talk about the important issues we believe Congress and the Senate \nshould be focusing on. But I know that people all across my State are \nwondering what we are doing here in the few days left before our Fourth \nof July recess.\n  In fact, one of the newspapers in my State basically said: If Members \ndon't have better things to do than some of the proposals they have \nbeen bringing up to amend the Constitution, then we should just go \nhome. Or, as one newspaper said: The checklists that we have been \ndealing with are full of political gimmicks and not national needs.\n  I would like to say that these are the national needs that we ought \nto be dealing with, and making college education affordable for all is \na huge priority. As we have spoken out on this issue as a group of \nwomen Senators talking about the checklist for change, I am now hearing \nfrom students all over America who are feeling the same pinch.\n  A student from Central Washington University said: Like many others, \nI am feeling the cuts that affect financial aid.\n  Even students from outside the State of Washington are e-mailing me. \nOne student from the University of Florida basically said they were \ncoming here to Capitol Hill soon with their full group of presidents \nand vice presidents and student vice presidents. They reminded me that:\n\n       We are the future of America, and we must ensure that \n     future by making sure students, regardless of wealth or other \n     socioeconomic factors, have access to a good college \n     education.\n\n  Mr. President, I couldn't agree with that student from the University \nof Florida more, and I look forward to seeing them in their efforts \nhere on Capitol Hill to be successful.\n  But we are here this morning because we all know the best way to \nsecure a good job is a quality education, and we know that the doors to \neducational opportunity are slamming shut for many Americans. This is \nsomething that is very personal to me as somebody who went to school on \nfinancial aid, and I can literally say I don't think I would be in the \nSenate or have been a successful executive at a business enterprise if \nI didn't have access to that good college education.\n  We can't let college education become a privilege for just a few of \nthe wealthy, and we have to make sure that families and students can \nafford college, regardless of their financial resources.\n  Let me just lay out a few facts. Since 2001, the cost of a public \nhigher education has increased by a staggering 46 percent. In \nWashington State alone, tuition costs at 4-year public schools have \nspiked, an increase of 63 percent since the fall of 2000. Tuition costs \nare skyrocketing, but family income, particularly of those with \ncollege-age students, has only risen about 3.4 percent between 2000 and \n2003. So the challenge is we haven't seen income opportunities go up, \nbut yet the cost of education has gone up. So while those costs have \nsoared, almost 350,000 Washington students have basically had their \nFederal financial aid slashed. And families have to tell their children \nthey can't afford to send them to college this year or next.\n  Well, I can tell you, Mr. President, that is unacceptable. We need to \ndo better to make sure that we make college education affordable.\n  What have we been doing? Last January, we had the largest raid on \nstudent financial aid I have ever seen. The legislation that was passed \nby this body cut $12.7 billion straight from student loan programs, the \nbiggest single cut in the history of the Federal student loan program. \nThat was coming on top of the President's budget, which basically also \nproposed a $2.2 billion cut in the Education Department budget, which \nis the largest cut in the Education Department in 26 years of history.\n  So we are here this morning, and this Senator is here, because we \nbelieve we need a new direction. Today we are standing here to \nchallenge Congress to act now in the best interests of American \nstudents, America's families, and certainly for the competitiveness of \nAmerica's future economy. We challenge this Congress to make college \neducation more affordable now, to help families save for college \neducation.\n  Specifically, we are asking the leadership to make a priority \nlegislation that would increase the Coverdell education savings account \ncontribution to $5,000 and let families make that tax deduction \ncontribution to help them pay for that increase in college education; \nsecondly, to make the college tuition tax deduction permanent, making \nit possible for families to put money into education and not feel the \npinch; third, to pass my ``GI Bill for Life'' legislation that gives \nthose returning from Iraq and Afghanistan who served in our military \nthe opportunity to complete their college education and get the \nfinancial support, as they have supported our country, no matter how \nlong it takes for them to complete that course in education.\n\n  It is time that we invest in the future of America and provide \nAmericans the next opportunity of leadership in our economy by giving \nthem access to a good education. We can act now and we can pass these \nlegislative issues before Congress adjourns this year. We hope this \nchecklist for change will be a priority--not some of the issues we have\n\n[[Page S6596]]\n\nbeen focusing on, but a real checklist to get busy with the priorities \nand needs of American families.\n  Now I would like to yield the floor for my colleague, Senator \nLincoln, who is going to talk about the affordability of health care in \nAmerica.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Washington for \nher incredible focus on educating our children and making sure our \nfamilies can afford higher education, and certainly focusing on energy \nindependence, which is critically important to all of our households.\n  I am proud to be here today with all of my Democratic women \ncolleagues to talk about the things that are so important to America's \nfamilies, the working families who are the fabric of this Nation, who \nmake us strong, who make us proud as Americans to look at the Nation \nand see what the foundation of our country is really all about.\n  Mr. President, I know that you and many of our other colleagues \nprobably think this is just a honey-do list. Well, we all have our \nhoney-do lists. For myself, as a mother of twin 10-year-olds and \ncertainly a wife who wants to be supportive and caring for my husband, \nand as a daughter who is looking at aging parents and in-laws, and all \nof the many responsibilities in my life, I know that keeping a list to \nmake sure I am actually accomplishing the things that are important to \nthe people I love is critically important so that I know I am doing \nwhat I need to do.\n  I have a list on my refrigerator. I have a list on my desk. I carry a \nlist in my car and in my purse to make sure that I can keep up with the \nthings that are important, the responsibilities I have as a person not \nonly for the things I want to do not just for my family but for my \nneighbors and for all of the people I report to and am responsible to. \nAt home, my husband and I have a honey-do list that we share the \nresponsibility for. Just last night, we were making sure we changed the \nair filters and the batteries in our smoke detectors which are \ncritically important to the safety of our children and our home. We \nwere making sure that we adjusted our budget to deal with the \nunbelievable increase in energy costs. Don't think that every household \nis not looking at how important that is. Or making sure that our \nchildren get their health checkup and that they are up to date on their \nimmunizations.\n  How blessed I felt when I walked into that pediatrician's office to \nknow that through the Federal employees, I have insurance that will \ncover that. But it is important to make sure the things on my list get \ndone so that the people in this world whom I love so dearly are as safe \nand as healthy as they possibly can be.\n  On that list is also setting aside dollars each year and every \nquarter in order to know that when my children become college age, they \nare going to have at least some kind of a nest egg, perhaps not enough \nto cover all that they need in order to get that education that I know \nis so critically important to their success and to the success of this \ncountry. These are the things that we want to challenge and to \nencourage our colleagues in the Senate to take up. These are the issues \nthat American families see on their checklist every single day. These \nare things that we can do--we know that we can do. These are issues \nthat affect every American family.\n\n  My good friend and colleague from California, Senator Feinstein, is \ngoing to talk about a humane and moral solution to stem cell research, \non which she has worked for over 8 years now. There was a wonderful \nevent in Arkansas for the Diabetes Association where I met a young \nwoman with a daughter who talked about the transition, the complete \nchange in life for their family in order to deal with a disease like \ndiabetes in a child who is only 12 years old.\n  Mr. President, we plead with you, take a look at this list. Look at \nthe reasonable items we are talking about that mean so much to the \nAmerican families of this country.\n  I am here to talk about the keen awareness that we have of the \nchallenges that are faced by working families who want nothing more \nthan the security that health insurance offers. We, as Federal \nemployees, enjoy a tremendous security. For over 40 years, the Federal \nGovernment has figured out that if it pools all 8 million of the \nFederal employees across this great country, it can provide greater \nchoice at a lower cost.\n  We, too, can do that for the small businesses of this country. If we \nlook around, we realize that nearly 46 million Americans lack health \ninsurance, including 456,000 of my own Arkansans. Small businesses are \nthe No. 1 source of jobs in Arkansas and in most parts of our country. \nYet only 26 percent of businesses with fewer than 50 employees offer \nhealth insurance coverage today. Workers at these businesses are most \nlikely to be uninsured. Yet they are the engine of our economy. They \nare the jobs that are not going to go offshore. They are the companies \nand the businesses in our communities that support our Little League \nand that sponsor our scouting events. These are the fabric of our \ncountry. Yet fewer than 26 percent are insured.\n  Small businesses need innovative ways to offer affordable, accessible \nhealth care to their employees. Recognizing that need for a new \ndirection, Senator Durbin and I proposed the Small Employers Health \nBenefit Program. It is a comprehensive solution to our small business \ninsurance crisis. It is based on 40 years of success with the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefit Plan. It will create affordable private health \ninsurance choices for small employers, and it will give working \nfamilies the security and the comfort of mind that they need.\n  We challenge--we encourage--we plead with our Republican Congress and \nleadership to pass the Small Employers Health Benefit Program this \nsession. It is something we can do that will make a tremendous \ndifference in the lives of Americans.\n  We are going to keep fighting because we believe that working \nfamilies should have the comfort of knowing that they can take their \nchildren to the doctor--whether it is for just a common cold or a \nbroken arm or, heaven forbid, something much more serious--and be able \nto afford and access the care that they need.\n  We believe that expanding coverage for small businesses will go a \nlong way toward making sure that the millions of Americans should and \nwould have access to medical care. We believe that providing that kind \nof security is worth fighting for, and that is why we have joined \ntogether today to point out to the American people, particularly to our \ncolleagues, the list that we carry around every single day in our \npocketbooks, on our desks, and on our refrigerators at home. It is no \ndifferent than the list that we present to you, and it is no different \nthan the list that every American family has in their home.\n  We ask you, Mr. President, take a look at what we propose. Look at \nthe time that we have remaining and know that we can make a difference \nin the fabric of this country by looking at the list of what America's \nworking families need the most in their households.\n  I am proud to yield for my good friend and colleague from California, \nSenator Feinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arkansas for \nher remarks. I don't think anyone speaks more eloquently about the \nneeds of American families than Blanche Lincoln. It is always real and \nit is always practical. I am just delighted to be a colleague of hers.\n  I rise today to say why stem cell research should be part of this \nDemocratic Women's Checklist for Change. The reason is very simple, and \nthat is because stem cell research offers the promise of historic \nadvances in the treatment of catastrophic disease. It is that simple.\n  The potential for this research was in the news again last week, as \nscientists at Johns Hopkins announced that they used embryonic stem \ncells to regenerate damaged nerves in paralyzed rats. That is something \nthat no one ever thought could be done. After being treated with cells \nharvested from mouse embryos, most of the rats regained enough strength \nto walk and bear weight on their previously paralyzed hind legs.\n  Just imagine what this discovery could one day mean for patients with \nspinal cord injuries, multiple sclerosis or ALS. It could be \nrevolutionary because one thing science believed was that the spinal \ncord, once severed,\n\n[[Page S6597]]\n\ncould never be regenerated. Now, for the first time in history, we see \nthere may be a solution to that and it rests with stem cell research.\n  Translating this discovery into treatment of human patients will \nlikely take several years, and it will likely not see fruition without \nFederal research dollars. Here is the rub. Our researchers face a major \nroadblock imposed by the President in August of 2001, when he limited \nFederal funding to 22 lines of stem cells. All of these available lines \nare now contaminated with mouse feeder cells, so virtually there is no \nFederal ongoing research.\n  Thirteen months ago, the House approved a bipartisan bill by Mr. \nCastle and Ms. DeGette, a bill that would remove this roadblock. It \nwould permit promising research to go forward. It would offer new hope \nto millions of Americans suffering from disability, diseases, and \nspinal cord injuries. The Castle-DeGette bill essentially says that it \nwould be possible to use embryos that are rejected in IVF clinics; that \nis, in vitro fertilization clinics. All of us know that tens of \nthousands, if not millions, of these embryos are rejected and they are \ndestroyed. Those embryos could be taken to form new stem cell lines \nunder this bill.\n\n  The votes are here to pass this bill today, but the President has \nvowed a veto, and the Republican leadership refuses to bring it to the \nfloor. In the year that we have waited for Senate action, millions more \nare now waiting for cures that one day could come from stem cell \nresearch. In the last year, consider this: 1.4 million Americans were \ndiagnosed with cancer; 60,000 Americans were diagnosed with Parkinson's \ndisease; 11,000 Americans suffered spinal cord injuries; and 1.5 \nmillion adults were diagnosed with diabetes.\n  These are just new diagnoses. Think of all the Americans who continue \nto suffer cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, spinal cord \ninjuries, and catastrophic diseases which could potentially be helped \nby embryonic stem cell research.\n  The administration's policies have left our researchers far behind \nthe rest of the world. In fact, other countries are, today, laying the \nfoundation for groundbreaking cures, while U.S. scientists are not able \nto gain Federal funding for research. Evidence that the United States \nis no longer the world leader in embryonic stem cell research is \nmounting. Scientists around the world have created 128 new embryonic \nstem cell lines since President Bush announced his policy. Only 34 of \nthese new lines were created in our country. The proportion of \nembryonic stem cell papers published by U.S. research groups has fallen \ndramatically in the past 2 years. At least 10 other nations--Germany, \nFinland, France, Sweden, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Singapore, \nIsrael, China, Australia--are investing substantial sums of government \nmoney in embryonic stem cell research. That is totaling hundreds of \nmillions of dollars. Other nations are constructing facilities, they \nare attracting our American researchers who should be here at home \ndoing this research, and they are learning more every day.\n  The United States, on the other hand, remains at the starting line. I \ndon't think we can afford to watch other nations move ahead. Eight \nyears ago, I introduced one of the first bills addressing stem cell \nresearch, so we have waited this long--8 years--for action. Time and \ntime again, we have pressed for action on the floor of the Senate. We \npressed for it privately. We pressed for it by letter. We pressed for \nit by press conference with groups of sufferers of catastrophic \ndiseases. All of this has been to no avail. I can't believe it. I can't \nbelieve this kind of recalcitrance. And all of this is despite the fact \nthat every poll shows a dominant majority of Americans support stem \ncell research.\n  It is time the Senate place the health of Americans ahead of the \nviews of a limited number of people whose views are apart from the \nmainstream of America. We owe it to the 110 million Americans suffering \ndaily from debilitating and catastrophic disease. Every day that we \nwait, more people develop diseases that could one day be cured. Every \nday we wait, other nations move further ahead.\n  I urge the Republican leadership to bring the Castle-DeGette stem \ncell bill to the floor and allow Federal research to move forward. A \nDemocratic Senate would listen to the American people. A Democratic \nSenate would make the promotion of this promising research a reality. \nThis Senate is in Republican control. The Republican-controlled House \nhas passed this bill. A dominant majority of the American people say \nenact this bill. Yet this Senate, Republican controlled, becomes the \nroadblock.\n  I urge the Republican leadership to reconsider and bring the Castle-\nDeGette bill to the floor of the Senate for a vote.\n  Mr. President, I would like to yield for my colleague, the \ndistinguished Senator from the great State that harbors the great city \nof New Orleans, LA. She will speak about making Americans upwardly \neconomically mobile in the American workplace.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for \nher remarks and her passion and her focus on the issue of stem cell \nresearch. One day when millions of Americans have been cured of \ndiseases that afflict us today because the research is just not there, \nwe can thank Senator Feinstein for staying on point, every month, every \nyear--staying on point on stem cell research. It is something the vast \nnumber of Americans support. They understand the importance of pressing \nforward on this science to find real cures for real people, for real \nfamilies. That will not only relieve the pain and suffering that comes \nwith disease but also promote the general economic well-being of a \nnation based on a free enterprise system that works much better when \npeople are healthy than it does when they are sick.\n  I stand in awe of Senator Feinstein's focus on this issue, and I \nsupport her wholeheartedly.\n  It is my opportunity to speak about one of the very important aspects \non this checklist. We talked about safeguarding America's pensions, and \nwe have talked about good jobs in America. Senator Cantwell talked \nabout college affordability for all Americans, about being the first \nperson from her family to graduate from college, and as she has shared \nwith us, going on to create a multimillion-dollar software business \nthat, of course, helped her personally and her immediate family. But \nthink of all the other people it helped because she received a great \neducation from our system--protecting America and our military families \nand making America energy independent, as Senator Clinton was so \nclearly stating, and small business health care as Senator Lincoln \nspoke to this morning.\n  I am going to focus my attention on preparing for future disasters. \nIt is, unfortunately, something that we in Louisiana have become \nsomewhat experts on lately, having lived through and still trying to \nlive and survive after the greatest natural disaster to hit our country \nin some time.\n  I begin by saying that if there was ever a wonder why our country was \ncreated, you can find the answer in the Preamble of the Constitution, \none of the greatest documents ever written. It talks about providing \nfor the common defense, promoting the general welfare, and securing the \nblessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity. Our Federal \nGovernment, which was established over 220 years ago, has established \ninstitutions, large and small, to meet the promise of the Preamble of \nthe Constitution.\n  We established the Department of Defense to support and provide for \nthe common defense. It was called the War Department. Now it is called \nthe Department of Defense. We established the Department of Health, \nEducation, and Labor to promote the general welfare.\n  Thirty years ago we established the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency to help keep Americans secure in the blessings of their liberty \nin the middle of natural disasters.\n  On August 29, when Katrina hit land, a category 5 storm to hit the \ngulf coast and to hit the southeastern part of Louisiana and the \nsouthwestern part of Mississippi, and 3 weeks later when Hurricane Rita \nbarreled into the southwestern part of our State, the Federal \nGovernment failed the people of the gulf coast.\n  Amazingly, nearly 1 year after this unprecedented failure, we have \ndone\n\n[[Page S6598]]\n\nlittle, if anything, to ensure that this will not happen again.\n  Studies have been completed. Reports have been drafted. Senator \nLieberman and Senator Collins have been exemplary in their work in a \nbipartisan fashion in the Senate--1,000 hours of hearings, dozens of \nfield hearings--to come up with comprehensive legislation. However, \nsomewhere between the Republican leadership in the White House and the \nRepublican leadership in Congress we have failed to come up with a \nsingle recommendation or a piece of legislation to come before this \nCongress to make sure that some of these recommendations are put into \nplace.\n  The White House has not asked for a single law to be changed based on \ntheir own report of 125 recommendations. Contrast that with what \nhappened after September 11. This Government was literally turned \nupside down and inside out. Laws--dozens of laws, maybe even hundreds \nof laws--were changed so that we could try to get to core answers to 9/\n11. Yet after the greatest natural disaster in American history, with \nthe failure of the Federal Emergency Management, a failure that will be \nrecorded in history for generations, not one law has been permanently \nchanged. And it is almost 11 months after that storm.\n  Billions of dollars have been thrown at the problem. And at the \nrequest of myself and a few Members of our delegation, we have managed \nto move a few billion of those dollars out from this morass of a \nFederal agency that doesn't work to try to get money directly to \nparishes, counties, to economic development departments for the \nrecovery and rebuilding.\n  I raise this point on this checklist not just for Louisiana which we \nare going to rebuild regardless of the mess we find ourselves in, but \nwe want to raise this issue--I want to raise this issue--in hopes that \nit can prevent this kind of recovery taking place in Seattle, in the \nevent of a tsunami, or in California in the event of an earthquake, or \nin Tennessee which also sits on a fault line of a geological structure.\n  I raise this point to honor the 1,836 victims of Katrina and the 120 \nvictims of Rita. Surely there is enough sacrifice for people to make \nbefore their Government, led by a Republican Congress, takes the steps \nto make sure it will never happen again. I know that no Congress run by \nDemocrats or Republicans can prevent a natural disaster. We understand \nthat. We are going to have earthquakes, hurricanes, and we are going to \nhave volcanic eruptions. While we can't prevent that, we can most \ncertainly improve the response from the Federal level so that people do \nnot have to suffer through the rebuilding that is going on now in \nLouisiana.\n\n  The first thing that must be done, which is part of our checklist, is \nto give the Director of FEMA the authority and the access he had under \nthe stewardship of its most successful Director, James Lee Witt, under \nthe previous administration. At that time, it was a Cabinet level \nposition that had the trust and access of the President and the full \ncommand of Federal resources during such disasters.\n  Regrettably, we have all watched in horror on the television screen, \nand I have watched personally upfront as a witness of the failings of \nFEMA on the ground, constrained by the priorities of the Homeland \nSecurity Director, which is different than what the needs of this great \ncity and region are. And after reading the exchanges between Director \nBrown and Secretary Chertoff, it most certainly doesn't seem to be \ntheir focus on emergency response in homeland security. FEMA needs to \nstand and win the internal battles to get priorities on the budget. \nMoving boxes around in the Federal Government organizational charts \nshould not be our focus. And that is not the solution. The issue is \nthat FEMA must be a priority for the highest levels of leadership. It \nmust be able to command the attention of the Federal Government and the \nmany resources and assets that this Federal Government has to help \nrebuild and reestablish confidence in any community that would find \nitself virtually destroyed, as in the case of St. Bernard Parish, a \nsmall parish that doesn't get the attention of the national media. But \n60,000 people live there, and 95 percent of their homes were destroyed \nwith 15 to 20 feet of water.\n  Senator Bayh and I had the pleasure of visiting down in that great \nparish with the great spirit, and just last Friday we walked into an \nunbelievable sight. A small trailer was sitting in the middle of \ncomplete ruin, with brave teachers and administrators inside this \ntrailer trying to conduct what I guess is a summer school for children. \nWe walked into this classroom with the lights low at naptime, with \nmusic, where 20 little children were sleeping. When we walked out of \nthat trailer, all you could see was destruction as if you were in a war \nzone. Yet the happiness on the faces of the children and the spirit of \nthose teachers was really a testament to the resilience of people \ndespite the fact that their Government is failing them. They are not \ngoing to fail themselves or their children. But we can do better.\n  On 9/11, when the terrorists attacked New York, everyone said that \none of the major failings was the failure of the communications system. \nWe lost 335 firefighters--not because they lacked bravery, not because \nthey lacked leadership, not because they lacked the armor or the \ncovering to protect them from the fire as they ran to the building when \neveryone was running away--we lost many of them because their radios \ndidn't work. We couldn't find a few hundred dollars to buy a radio for \nfiremen running into a skyscraper that was falling down. We all know \nwhat we did wrong.\n  Today, we still don't have a system of communication that can operate \nwhen the cell phone towers go down, whether they are burned down, blown \nout, or flooded out. It doesn't exist. Five years is a long time.\n  I will tell you what we have done in 5 years. We built a continental \nrailroad in 5 years. From the time of Pearl Harbor to Victory Day was 5 \nyears. From the time the Apollo drawings were on paper until we hit the \nMoon was 5 years. But it is 5 years since 9/11.\n  When the people of the gulf coast had two major hurricanes barrel \ndown on them and they went to use a cell phone, a land line, or a \ncomputer, the communications system was down. We were blamed for not \nhaving an evacuation plan. Let me say for the last time that the best \nevacuation plan doesn't work if you can't communicate it to your \nneighbors, let alone to the doctor in the emergency room or the \nambulance driver or the bus driver trying to run the bus or the \nSuperdome operator trying to keep thousands of people safe and fed and \ncared for.\n  I know our time is up in just about 2 minutes. I have gone a little \nover my time. I want to say in closing that there is a lot the \nRepublican Congress could do to keep us on point, to keep us focused on \nthe things that matter to the American people dealing with natural \ndisasters, helping them to rebuild their shattered lives, their homes, \ntheir schools, their churches, and their businesses. When these storms \nand floods come through is one thing. It is very important to the \npeople of this country.\n  I wish, as a Democratic Senator from Louisiana, that we would spend a \nlittle bit more time making sure the communications system works, that \nFEMA works, and that all the money the taxpayers are spending is being \nspent well and not wasted. That is sort of the third disaster--not the \ndisaster itself but the disaster of wasting money when people are so \ndesperate for the resources they need to rebuild.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, for presiding this morning. It is probably \nnot the easiest thing to listen to. But these are some shortcomings \nthat we believe we need to step up to and address for our country and \nput before the American people, the practical solutions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \ncalling for a ``Checklist for Change.'' We need a real jobs agenda in \nthis country--one that stands strong and fights for American workers \nand American businesses.\n  This is about our way of life--a way of life based on good-paying, \nmiddle class jobs and the promise that--with hard work--every American \ncan aspire to do better tomorrow than they did yesterday.\n  We need to stop the flow of American jobs overseas. Last year, a new \n$2 billion tax cut that I authored took effect, rewarding companies \nthat create\n\n[[Page S6599]]\n\nmanufacturing jobs here in the United States.\n  We need to level the playing field for American businesses. Currency \nmanipulation and the free flow of counterfeit goods from countries such \nas China have put American workers at an unfair disadvantage for too \nlong.\n  It is time we had an international trade prosecutor who can go after \ncountries that cheat and make sure that America is getting a fair deal \nin the world market.\n  We need a new direction for American workers.\n  We challenge the Republican Congress to enact tax policies that stop \nthe outsourcing of American jobs.\n  We challenge them to stand up and enforce our trade agreements so \nAmerican businesses can compete on a level playing field and keep good-\npaying jobs here at home.\n  Americans want to export our products, not our jobs.\n  And we challenge the Republican Congress to follow the lead of my \nState of Michigan and raise the minimum wage\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/28/senate-section/article/S6599-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6599-S6600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESPONSE TO THE CHECKLIST\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have listened to part of the \nprevious presentations. I think the impression has been given that if \nwe just had a Democratic Senate we could accomplish so much more. But I \nthink in the process of making such a presentation many things have \nbeen overlooked or not quite stated in a factual way.\n  Let me start by saying what has been said--that Republicans have cut \n$12 billion from college student aid, frozen Pell grants for higher \neducation. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Republican \nCongress, since President Bush has been in office, has dramatically \nincreased the absolute commitment to helping lower income students, \nmany who are first-time college graduates in their family, and we are \nhelping at the Federal level to an extent never seen before.\n  For instance, Pell grants will grow by $240 million. The number of \nrecipients will increase by 59,000 to 5.3 million students. Funding for \nPell grants rose from $8.8 billion in 2001 to $13 billion in 2006. In \n2006, the Department of Education expects to make over $77 billion in \ngrants, loans, and other aid to over 10 million students. It is a fact \nthat we are increasing Pell grants. We are increasing the number of \nstudents who are eligible for Pell grants. We need to be honest when we \nare talking about what the difference would be if there were a \nDemocratic Senate versus the Republican accomplishments.\n  In addition, the Department of Education in 2006 will make or \nguarantee more than $60 billion in new student loans, a $4 billion \nincrease over the previous year. That is a huge accomplishment in just \none year.\n  In addition, one of the things this Senate is focusing on currently \nis trying to get more of our students into the areas of math, science, \nand engineering because that is where the jobs are in the future. To \nmake sure our students from low-income areas are able to pursue this \ntype of career and to give them special attention, we have added a \nSMART grants program for Pell-eligible students that will give them a \nbonus if they pursue a degree in math or science, or a foreign language \ndeemed to be critical for national security. We have taken steps so \nlow-income students, only Pell grant-eligible students, will get this \nbonus to move in the direction of good jobs in our country.\n  It is important to stay on the facts and talk about some of the \nthings we have tried to do. ``Tried to do is key.'' Many of the things \nI have heard in the last hour about what the Democrats would do if they \nwere in charge were somewhat amusing because we have tried to do those \nvery things; it is the other side of the aisle who has kept us from \nachieving those goals. Consider association health plans--small \nbusiness health plans that would give millions of workers the \nopportunity to have affordable health care. Because they work for small \nbusinesses--maybe 10 employees or 20 employees--that employer cannot \nafford to offer health insurance options because the options are too \nexpensive, and employers are not eligible for the big plans that bring \nthe cost down.\n  We brought to the Senate floor, after trying for years, we passed \nlegislation out of committee and brought to the Senate the small \nbusiness health plans that would give millions of employees of small \nbusinesses the opportunity to have affordable health care. It was the \nDemocrats, by an overwhelming majority of their caucus, who voted \nagainst association health plans again and again.\n  Making health care more affordable is a goal we have. One of the most \nimportant things we can do this year is to broaden the number of people \nwho have health care coverage in our country. If the Democrats would \nsit down and work with us, we could do that. We cannot do it by \nourselves. I am very concerned when it is implied that a Democratic \nCongress could produce this when it is the Democrats who have \nobstructed Republican initiatives.\n  Border security. I live in a border state. We have a northern border \nand a southern border. Since I came to the Senate, we have probably \nquadrupled the number of Border Patrol agents in both the northern and \nthe southern sectors. We have put billions into more border control \nfacilities, into surveillance techniques that extend the reach when you \ncannot have a person every mile. You cannot have a person every mile, \nbut you can certainly extend your reach with infrared and UAVs. This is \nvery helpful. We have put our money into this area, and we have made it \na focus. Securing our border is going to continue with a Republican \nCongress.\n  Tax cuts. I have heard many people say: How can you have tax cuts \nwhen we have deficits and so many needs in our country? Let's put the \nfacts on the table. Every time in recent history when we have had tax \ncuts in this country--from President Kennedy, President Reagan, and \nPresident Bush--the revenue of our country has increased. It happened \nagain after the tax cuts of 2003. When people can keep more of the \nmoney that they have worked for and earned in their pocketbooks, they \nwill either reinvest it in capital, which will increase jobs and \nprosperity and, therefore, revenue to our country; or they will save \nit, which does the same thing; or they will spend it and create new \nopportunities for jobs in the manufacturing sector.\n\n  That is exactly what has happened when the Republicans, over the \nobjections of the Democratic caucus, did push through tax cuts giving \nmarriage penalty relief, giving lower tax brackets for every American \nwho pays taxes, giving a 15-percent capital gains and dividends rate, \ngiving relief across the board to the people who are earning the money \nin this country that has caused a revenue increase.\n  Therefore, the deficit of this country is going to be $100 billion \nless this year than we thought might happen. If we do not continue the \ntax cuts, it will be a tax increase, and that will stall the economy. \nWe will see the jobless rate rise and our economy will be adversely \nimpacted. So tax cuts are a difference that we will see with a \nRepublican-controlled Congress.\n  Now I will talk about energy. One of the things we have done in this \nCongress, which has not gotten very much play, is the Energy bill that \nwas passed through the leadership of Senator Pete Domenici as chairman \nof the Energy Committee. For the first time in 10 years, we passed a \nsignificant Energy bill last year through this Republican-led Congress. \nThe focus was on renewables, tax credits for renewables, increased \ninvestment in research into renewable energy.\n  Anyone who has filled up a gas tank, anyone who runs a small business \nand has higher costs of electricity and natural gas knows we have an \nenergy crisis in this country. One of the reasons why is because we are \nover 60 percent dependent on foreign sources for our energy needs. \nThese foreign sources are unreliable. We need to do what Americans do. \nThat is, stand up and take control of our destiny. That means we are \ngoing to create energy that is renewable and clean, that protects the \nenvironment, energy such as biodiesel, made from soybeans; energy such \nas ethanol, made from corn. Wind energy is producing almost 10 percent \nof the electricity in my home State of Texas and Texas is a big State. \nIt is very important that we have the wind energy credits we passed in \nthat tax bill because it has enhanced energy resources\n\n[[Page S6600]]\n\nin our country. This is a significant contribution to diversifying our \nenergy sources, and it is so important for our country.\n  My point is this: This Republican Congress has been a steady hand at \nthe wheel. We have supported America's commitment in the war on terror. \nWe have made it a policy that we will not leave when our commitment is \nnot fulfilled. And when it is, and when the generals on the ground say \nIraq can secure itself and Afghanistan can do it by themselves, we will \nthen leave. We want to do that. We do not want to stay indefinitely in \nIraq or Afghanistan, but we want to keep the terrorists where they are. \nWe will keep our commitment to lower taxes and clean energy. We will \nkeep our commitment to the small business people who are working in \nAmerica and contributing to the economy. They are the heart of our \ncountry. That is what a Republican Congress would do. That is what we \nare going to continue to fight for.\n  I hope, rather than saying a Democratic Congress would do it \ndifferently, when they have blocked so many of the things we have done, \nthey would cross the aisle and say: Let's do these things together. We \ncan do something bipartisan. People in this country do not care about \nRepublicans or Democrats. They want results. We can do it if we work \ntogether across the aisle instead of making so many issues political \nthat do not need to be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/28/senate-section/article/S6600-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6600-S6602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WAR ON TERROR\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nTexas for outlining so many of the very important issues facing this \ncountry and the Senate today.\n  I will talk about something that is extremely important to families, \nto people through the United States. That is the war on terror. How are \nwe going to take the steps to prevent another September 11 attack in \nthe United States?\n  I don't think anyone who has followed the progress of the \nIslamofascist terrorists who have threatened us believe we are going to \nbe safe if we try a fortress mentality, to step back and say no one is \ngoing to hit us, they don't care about the United States. They do.\n  We work in a very secure place. People who visit us have to go \nthrough all kinds of security. Yes, we have built up some good \nbarriers, good protections. High target areas such as the Congress and \nthe White House are protected.\n  For the vast majority of places in America, there is no way you can \nbuild a security system such as we have here because of the high \npriority this rates in terms of terrorist interests. After September \n11, we started some very serious consideration of what we needed to do \nto fight against terrorism.\n  I will read a very good editorial that appeared September 24, 2001.\n\n       The Bush administration is preparing new laws to help track \n     terrorists through money-laundering activity and is readying \n     an executive order freezing the assets of known terrorists. \n     Much more is needed, including stricter regulations, the \n     recruitment of specialized investigators and greater \n     cooperation with foreign banking authorities.\n       Washington should revive international efforts begun during \n     the Clinton administration to pressure countries with \n     dangerously loose banking regulations to adopt and enforce \n     stricter rules. These need to be accompanied by stronger \n     sanctions against doing business with financial institutions \n     based in these nations.\n\n  That is exactly what the Bush administration did. They set up the \nTerrorist Financing Tracking Program, a very effective program. This \nprogram went on clandestinely without any public notice or disclosure.\n  As the chairman of the subcommittee that funds the Treasury \nDepartment and as a Member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I was \nbriefed on it. I was briefed on the effectiveness of it and how \nvaluable a tool it is to be able to follow the money because the \nterrorists did not know we could follow when they transferred money \nfrom al-Qaida or Hamas or Hezbollah to someone in the United States; or \ntransferred money from a so-called charity in the United States back to \na terrorist organization. They did not know how we were doing it. It \nwas effective.\n  A number of the major terrorist captures we have made, the terrorist \noperations designed for the United States that we have interrupted, \nwere enabled by the terrorist tracking program.\n  When the 9/11 Commission made its final report of its recommendations \non December 5, 2005, they gave varying degrees of ratings, from the \nvery best being A, to F being a very bad job, to all of the different \nactivities we had undertaken to make our country safe, to make our \nhomeland safe. Regrettably, many of them only got Bs. The Director of \nNational Intelligence, the National Counterterrorism Center, they got \nBs. Some of them got even lower grades, working with other countries.\n\n  But the one that led the rating was terrorist financing. We were \ndoing the best job fighting terrorist threats to the United States by \nterrorist-financing tracking. We were, until last week. Because that \neditorial I read from about the need for that, about the need for \ninternational cooperation, was a New York Times editorial of September \n24, 2001.\n  Well, the New York Times has blown the cover--blown the cover--on \nthis very important terrorist-financing activity. Now the terrorists \nknow there is a Belgian-based cooperative called SWIFT, the Society for \nWorldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. The SWIFT operation \nhas a facility in the United States to which the Treasury Department \nissued narrowly targeted administrative subpoenas to get information on \nspecific terrorist organizations and where their money transfers went. \nBut now the terrorists know.\n  SWIFT is regulated by central bankers. The oversight committee knew \nabout it. The oversight committee had in it the Federal Reserve, the \nEuropean Central Bank, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the Bank \nof Belgium. Their committee members overseeing SWIFT knew how this \nprogram was operating, and they knew it was operating lawfully.\n  But the New York Times, continuing its recent tradition, has decided \nthat its right to publish is more important than the American public's \nright to be safe from terrorist activities. This is another chapter in \na very sad series of revelations of our most sensitive intelligence-\ntracking activities.\n  Newspapers knew in World War II we could crack the codes of the Axis, \nthat we were able to monitor the defense and military moves of Germany. \nBut they did not expose it. Why? Because they knew our national \ninterest required us to be able to keep confidential, to keep out of \nthe hands of our enemies, the techniques by which we gathered the \nintelligence, which helped us win World War II--and which had, until \nrecent disclosures, helped us be able to win the war against terrorist \nattacks in the United States.\n  Well, the New York Times has decided that its right to publish takes \nprecedence over America's right to have intelligence collection methods \nthat are not disclosed to the people of the United States and, thus, to \nthe terrorists we attempt to track.\n  Sadly, as I have traveled around the world, meeting with our \nintelligence agencies, our military people--all across the globe--I \nfound out, since the disclosures--beginning with the disclosure of the \nrenditions of terrorists to other countries, the activities of the \nPresident's terrorist surveillance program--our intelligence \ncapabilities have been compromised. Intelligence operatives tell us \ncollections are way down. We don't know how we can replace these tools \nthat have been disclosed by the New York Times and others.\n  In February, at the open hearing in the Intelligence Committee, I \nasked CIA Director Porter Goss: What has the damage been? What has the \ndamage been to our intelligence system from this disclosure? He said: \nIt's been very severe. Let me repeat, very severe.\n  Then again, when Michael Hayden was in a public hearing on his \nconfirmation to be Director of the CIA, I asked him again--and this was \nbefore the disclosure of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program--I \nsaid: What has been the impact of these disclosures on our intelligence \nsystem? He said: These disclosures have now applied the Darwinian \ntheory to terrorists because the only terrorists we are capturing are \nthe dumb terrorists. The smart terrorists know what we are doing, and \nthey know how to avoid it. Therefore, they can plan their attacks, and \nwe are severely crippled.\n\n[[Page S6601]]\n\n  Well, disclosure of this Terrorist Finance Tracking Program is a very \nsevere blow. This one particular program has had, in my view, as many \nsuccesses as any of the other programs, and it has been a vital part of \nbuilding the intelligence network that we need, gathering the \ninformation we need to identify and take out those people who are \nplanning to launch deadly terrorist attacks in the United States.\n  I regret to tell my colleagues, my constituents in Missouri, and the \npeople in America that we are much less safe.\n  This program, the SWIFT Program, did not need to be exposed. The \nSecretary of the Treasury has written to the New York Times a rebuttal \nto the disclosure they made. They said: Oh, there is a great need for \nthe people to know this. Well, unfortunately, when the people of \nAmerica know it, the terrorists know it.\n  Secretary John Snow, with whom I have worked on this program, laid it \nout very well. He said in a statement on June 22 of this year: After \nPresident Bush made it clear that ensuring the safety of our people \nfrom terrorist attacks was our No. 1 priority, one of the most \nimportant things the Treasury could do is to follow the flow of \nterrorist money. They don't lie. Skillfully followed, they lead us to \nterrorists themselves and, thereby, protect our citizens.\n  He said:\n\n       Given our intimate knowledge of the global financial system \n     and financial flows, along with our close working \n     relationships with financial institutions around the world, \n     Treasury is uniquely positioned to track these terrorist \n     money flows both internationally and domestically.\n\n  He said:\n\n       I am particularly proud of our Terrorist Finance Tracking \n     Program which, based on intelligence leads, carefully targets \n     financial transactions of suspected foreign terrorists. . . . \n     It is an essential tool in the war on terror. . . . It is not \n     ``data mining''. . . . It is not a ``fishing expedition''. . \n     . . today's disclosure [is] so regrettable, because the \n     public dissemination of our sources and methods of fighting \n     terrorists not only harms national security but also degrades \n     the government's efforts to prevent terrorist activity in the \n     future.\n\n  If there are people sending money to help al Qaeda, then we need to \nknow about it. We also need to take advantage of that knowledge to \nfollow the money trail and thwart them.\n  He reports that the 9/11 Commission gave its highest level of \nrecognition to this work.\n  Well, Mr. President, when we disclose how our allies are working with \nus, we not only give the terrorists information on how to avoid \ndisclosure, how to keep their activities secret, what we do, and what \nis very serious, is we tell our allies that we cannot keep a secret. \nOur allies are getting more and more reluctant to deal with us on any \ninternational cooperative missions when everything we do is blown and \nall of a sudden they read in their papers in the United States how they \nhave cooperated with the United States.\n  Now, that is not a very popular thing for some of these governments \nto do, and it makes it far more difficult for us to say: Hey, let's \nwork together on a clandestine intelligence-gathering program that will \nkeep your country safe and our country safe. Bam, they read about it in \nthe newspapers. Well, this makes not only terrorists more able to get \naround our existing intelligence-collection assets, but it makes our \nallies far more reluctant to cooperate with us.\n  Mr. President, I regret to tell you and my colleagues how serious \nthis has been.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the \nletter to the editors of the New York Times by the Secretary of the \nTreasury, John Snow; a copy of the September 24, 2001, editorial from \nthe New York Times; and a copy of the Final Report on 9/11 Commission \nRecommendations, in which they said this terrorist financing program \nwas the best.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         U.S. Treasury Department,\n\n\n                                     Office of Public Affairs,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 26, 2006.\n     Mr. Bill Keller,\n     Managing Editor, The New York Times,\n     West 43rd Street, New York, NY.\n       Dear Mr. Keller: The New York Times' decision to disclose \n     the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program, a robust and \n     classified effort to map terrorist networks through the use \n     of financial data, was irresponsible and harmful to the \n     security of Americans and freedom-loving people worldwide. In \n     choosing to expose this program, despite repeated pleas from \n     high-level officials on both sides of the aisle, including \n     myself, the Times undermined a highly successful counter-\n     terrorism program and alerted terrorists to the methods and \n     sources used to track their money trails.\n       Your charge that our efforts to convince The New York Times \n     not to publish were ``halfhearted'' is incorrect and \n     offensive. Nothing could be further from the truth. Over the \n     past two months, Treasury has engaged in a vigorous dialogue \n     with the Times--from the reporters writing the story to the \n     D.C. Bureau Chief and all the way up to you. It should also \n     be noted that the co-chairmen of the bipartisan 9-11 \n     Commission, Governor Tom Kean and Congressman Lee Hamilton, \n     met in person or placed calls to the very highest levels of \n     the Times urging the paper not to publish the story. Members \n     of Congress, senior U.S. Government officials and well-\n     respected legal authorities from both sides of the aisle also \n     asked the paper not to publish or supported the legality and \n     validity of the program.\n       Indeed, I invited you to my office for the explicit purpose \n     of talking you out of publishing this story. And there was \n     nothing ``half-hearted'' about that effort. I told you about \n     the true value of the program in defeating terrorism and \n     sought to impress upon you the harm that would occur from its \n     disclosure. I stressed that the program is grounded on solid \n     legal footing, had many built-in safeguards, and has been \n     extremely valuable in the war against terror. Additionally, \n     Treasury Under Secretary Stuart Levey met with the reporters \n     and your senior editors to answer countless questions, laying \n     out the legal framework and diligently outlining the multiple \n     safeguards and protections that are in place.\n       You have defended your decision to compromise this program \n     by asserting that ``terror financiers know'' our methods for \n     tracking their funds and have already moved to other methods \n     to send money. The fact that your editors believe themselves \n     to be qualified to assess how terrorists are moving money \n     betrays a breathtaking arrogance and a deep misunderstanding \n     of this program and how it works. While terrorists are \n     relying more heavily than before on cumbersome methods to \n     move money, such as cash couriers, we have continued to see \n     them using the formal financial system, which has made this \n     particular program incredibly valuable.\n       Lastly, justifying this disclosure by citing the ``public \n     interest'' in knowing information about this program means \n     the paper has given itself free license to expose any covert \n     activity that it happens to learn of--even those that are \n     legally grounded, responsibly administered, independently \n     overseen, and highly effective. Indeed, you have done so \n     here.\n       What you've seemed to overlook is that it is also a matter \n     of public interest that we use all means available--lawfully \n     and responsibly--to help protect the American people from the \n     deadly threats of terrorists. I am deeply disappointed in the \n     New York Times.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     John W. Snow,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 24, 2001]\n\n                           Finances of Terror\n\n       Organizing the hijacking of the planes that crashed into \n     the World Trade Center and the Pentagon took significant sums \n     of money. The cost of these plots suggests that putting Osama \n     bin Laden and other international terrorists out of business \n     will require more than diplomatic coalitions and military \n     action. Washington and its allies must also disable the \n     financial networks used by terrorists.\n       The Bush administration is preparing new laws to help track \n     terrorists through their money-laundering activity and is \n     readying an executive order freezing the assets of known \n     terrorists. Much more is needed, including stricter \n     regulations, the recruitment of specialized investigators and \n     greater cooperation with foreign banking authorities. There \n     also must be closer coordination among America's law \n     enforcement, national security and financial regulatory \n     agencies.\n       Osama bin Laden originally rose to prominence because his \n     inherited fortune allowed him to bankroll Arab volunteers \n     fighting Soviet forces in Afghanistan. Since then, he has \n     acquired funds from a panoply of Islamic charities and \n     illegal and legal businesses, including export-import and \n     commodity trading firms, and is estimated to have as much as \n     $300 million at his disposal.\n       Some of these businesses move funds through major \n     commercial banks that lack the procedures to monitor such \n     transactions properly. Locally, terrorists can utilize tiny \n     unregulated storefront financial centers, including what are \n     known as hawala banks, which people in South Asian immigrant \n     communities in the United States and other Western countries \n     use to transfer money abroad. Though some smaller financial \n     transactions are likely to slip through undetected even after \n     new rules are in place, much of the financing needed for \n     major attacks could dry up.\n       Washington should revive international efforts begun during \n     the Clinton administration to pressure countries with \n     dangerously\n\n[[Page S6602]]\n\n     loose banking regulations to adopt and enforce stricter \n     rules. These need to be accompanied by strong sanctions \n     against doing business with financial institutions based in \n     these nations. The Bush administration initially opposed such \n     measures. But after the events of Sept. 11, it appears ready \n     to embrace them.\n       The Treasury Department also needs new domestic legal \n     weapons to crack down on money laundering by terrorists. The \n     new laws should mandate the identification of all account \n     owners, prohibit transactions with ``shell banks'' that have \n     no physical premises and require closer monitoring of \n     accounts coming from countries with lax banking laws. \n     Prosecutors, meanwhile, should be able to freeze more easily \n     the assets of suspected terrorists. The Senate Banking \n     Committee plans to hold hearings this week on a bill \n     providing for such measures. It should be approved and signed \n     into law by President Bush.\n       New regulations requiring money service businesses like the \n     hawala banks to register and imposing criminal penalties on \n     those that do not are scheduled to come into force late next \n     year. The effective date should be moved up to this fall, and \n     rules should be strictly enforced the moment they take \n     effect. If America is going to wage a new kind of war against \n     terrorism, it must act on all fronts, including the financial \n     one.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             FINAL REPORT ON 9/11 COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS\n                           [December 5, 2005]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                Homeland Security and Emergency Response\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRadio spectrum for first responders............................

The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/28/senate-section/article/S6602-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6602-S6604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RESPONSIBLE BUDGETING\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a package of \ninitiatives which were reported out of the Budget Committee, the \npurpose of which is to put some order into our financial house and to \ntry to make the Government of the United States an affordable event for \nits citizens, especially for younger people who will be working to \nsupport the next generation as it retires.\n  This package has been grossly misrepresented by the other side of the \naisle, especially by the leader on the other side of the aisle and by \nthe assistant leader and by other Members who have come to the floor. \nThey have taken out the bloody shirt of Social Security and waved it at \nthis package in a totally irresponsible manner. Therefore, I think it \nis appropriate to come to the floor and point out what the facts are \nversus what they believe the politics should be.\n  The facts are rather startling, regrettably, as we head into the \nretirement of the baby boom generation, which is the largest generation \nin our history. The cost of supporting that generation, which will have \nto be paid by our children and our children's children, is \nastronomical.\n  There is now pending on the books of the Government $65 trillion--\nthat is with a ``T''--of unfunded liability. What does that mean? That \nmeans we have programmatic obligations on the books of the Government--\nobligations to retired people, primarily--which will cost $65 trillion \nmore than what we know will come into the Government under the present \nprojections. In other words, we do not have the money to pay for it. We \ndo not know where the money is going to come from. But we do know we \nhave these obligations on the books.\n  To try to put a trillion dollars in perspective, or this number into \nperspective, since the beginning of the Nation, since the beginning of \nour country, we have only collected $40 trillion in taxes--only. We \nhave collected $40 trillion in taxes: a lot of money. The total net \nworth of America and Americans--if you take all our cars, all our \nhouses, all our stock, all our businesses--is $51 trillion. So we have \non the books an obligation which exceeds our net worth as a nation.\n  We have to figure out how we are going to afford to pay for that, \nespecially how our children are going to afford to pay for it because \nthey are the ones who are going to bear the burden.\n  To try to put this in even more precise perspective, three programs--\nthree retirement program, specifically; Social Security, Medicare, and \nMedicaid--will cost the American taxpayer more, as we head into the \nyear 2025, than what the total Government cost the American taxpayer \ntoday as a percent of gross national product. Traditionally, the \nGovernment of the United States has spent about 20 percent of the gross \nnational product of America. These three programs alone, as a result of \nthe retirement of the baby boom generation--which is the largest \ngeneration in the history of our country, by a factor of two--will cost \nthe American taxpayer everything that we presently pay into the \nGovernment by the year 2025.\n  So that means, at that point, to pay for those three programs, you \nwould be unable--if you were going to maintain the historical spending \nof the Government--you would be unable to pay for national defense, for \neducation, for environmental cleanup, for all the other things the \nGovernment does.\n  And that is only the start. Because as that baby boom generation gets \ninto fuller retirement, the cost of those programs continues to go up. \nWhat does that mean in practical terms? It means our children and our \nchildren's children, in order to support the retired generation, would \nhave to pay a dramatic increase in taxes under the present scheme.\n  Basically, it would mean our children would be unable to afford a \nbetter lifestyle. They probably could not send their kids to college, \nbuy a house or purchase a car the way our generation has been able to \ndo because they would be sending so much of their money to the Federal \nGovernment to support these basic programs which are mandatory. It is \nnot a tolerable proposal for our country. We cannot say, as one \ngeneration, that we are going to put on the books obligations that make \nthe next generation pay so much in taxes that they essentially would \nnot be able to live the quality of life we have. We would undermine \ntheir quality of life, and it is not fair to them.\n\n  What we did in the Budget Committee was try to address this, not by \npolicy changes but by putting in place processes which will force us to \nface up to fiscal discipline, which will force us as public \npolicymakers, the Senate and the House and the executive branch, to \nlook at these numbers, these facts which exist. And they will not \nchange unless we do something because the\n\n[[Page S6603]]\n\ngeneration that is going to cost all this money is already alive. It is \nmy generation, the baby boom generation. We are this huge generation. \nWe are going to cost our children these types of dollars. It is not \ngoing to change unless we do something.\n  It will force us, as public policymakers, to face up to this reality, \nthese proposals which came out of the Budget Committee. The major point \nis, we have a huge problem coming at us as a Government, as citizens, \nand as parents. You can't tax your way out of it. You cannot possibly \nraise taxes enough to pick up the cost of these programs and still give \nearning Americans an opportunity to live well.\n  So what is the reaction from the other side of the aisle? They want \nto immediately attack any proposal, even though this one has no policy \nattached to it--it simply has processes which force a policy to occur, \nno specific policy to occur--attack any proposal as an attack on Social \nSecurity. How grossly irresponsible is that? How incredibly \ninappropriate is that? Does the other side of the aisle believe that \nour children should be faced with a burden which they cannot possibly \nafford? That seems to be the case. They have walked off the playing \nfield of responsible public policy, waving the bloody shirt of Social \nSecurity for the purposes of political gain. It is inexcusable on their \npart.\n  What is the proposal we brought forward, this outrageous proposal \nwhich, according to the other side, is so outrageous? It is pretty \nsimple. It is very responsible. It is an attempt to get at the essence \nof the problem we have today. It has eight parts. The first part puts \nback in place an idea which the other side of the aisle offered 2 years \nago. Yet now they claim it is horrific, the statutory caps, which says \non discretionary spending, that when we put caps in place, they will be \nenforceable. Today we put caps in place, but they get waived around \nhere like buying peanuts. This goes back to the old Gramm-Rudman \napproach, where you have enforceable statutory caps. That means we set \na number. We agree, as a Congress, this is how much money we are going \nto spend. Then we say: You actually can't spend more than that, unless \nyou have a cut somewhere else.\n  That is totally irresponsible, according to the other side. We did it \na few years ago. It worked. In fact, Chairman Greenspan said it was the \nmost significant budgetary reform that has occurred around here in a \nlong time. We are suggesting we put it back in place. It affects \ndiscretionary spending, which is every year spending, not mandatory \nspending.\n  The second idea--I will skip down so we can go in order--is to put in \nplace a BRAC Commission. We had a BRAC Commission for defense spending, \nand it worked. We did it five times. This is a BRAC Commission for the \nwhole Government, same idea, same philosophy. It says, take a look at \nthe programs and then have the Commission send the ideas to the Senate \nand then the Senate has to vote for them or against them. It is a \nreasonable approach to trying to do something which we have not been \nable to do on a one-by-one basis. It is a broader approach.\n  It also has the President's proposal for a line-item veto or \nexpedited rescission. It is a better proposal than what the President \nactually sent us because it is more balanced relative to the \nlegislative branch and the executive branch. In fact, it is an idea \nthat passed the Congress. In 1996, we voted for a much stronger line-\nitem veto than this. It gives the President the ability, when we send \nhim these omnibus bills that have billions of dollars of spending in \nthem, rather than veto the whole bill and shut down the Government, for \nexample, he can now put together a package of specific programs in \nthose bills that he doesn't think make sense, send them up here, and \nCongress has to vote on them in an expedited process, for or against \nthem. Obviously, he will have to send up a package which has majority \nsupport or else it will not get passed.\n  And we put in language which says that to the extent there is a \nrescission as a result of this, the savings have to go to the deficit. \nThat is a very strong idea, in my opinion.\n  We also have biennial budgeting, an idea which people think will be a \nmore effective way for us to address budgeting. We are now effectively \nin a biennial process anyway since every year there is an election, we \ncan't pass a budget around here; at least we haven't in the last three \nelection cycles, both under Democrats and Republicans.\n\n  And then there is reconciliation reform. The essence of the package \nis the mandatory reform effort, the effort to try to address this chart \nwhere Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid are essentially going \nto bankrupt our children, unless we do something intelligent about it. \nThis is where the other side of the aisle has been so grossly \nirresponsible--first, in characterizing it, because they have been \nfactually inaccurate, and then abandoning the field of debating the \nissue and coming up with other processes, if they believe they are \nbetter ideas. The first approach is something that passed this Congress \nalready. It basically says that if Medicare for 2 years in a row is \nfound to take more than 45 percent of its support out of the general \nfund--Medicare is supposed to be a hospital insurance program, not \nsupposed to be supported by the general fund--if for 2 years in a row \nit is supported by general taxation by more than 45 percent of its \ncosts, then a point of order is put in place, which can be waived by 60 \nvotes, so it can be waived against any new entitlement spending. It is \na reasonable approach. It is actually not that strong an approach, but \nit is something that basically highlights the problem.\n  Then we get to the more substantive policy driving events. An \nEntitlement Commission is put in place. This is where the other side \nhas grossly misrepresented the facts and then taken out the bloody \nshirt and attacked the facts which they grossly misrepresent. And \nthat's a great idea. First, you make up what the position is, and then \nyou attack that position. And then you take absolutely no responsible \nposition on your own part, which is exactly what the other side has \ndone. Obstruction has become the only thing which the other side of the \naisle appears to be able to do, obstruction for the purpose of \nobstruction for the purpose of obtaining power around here.\n  When are they going to face up to the fact that we are supposed to be \ndoing policy which addresses the needs of our children especially and \nthe affordability of the Government specifically?\n  What is the Entitlement Commission? It is a group of people who are \nput together. They are chosen by the leadership of both sides of the \naisle. There will be eight Republicans and seven Democrats, if it were \nto be put in place today. Eight and seven, that is not an overwhelming \nmajority for our side of the aisle. And it takes 10 members of the \ncommission to put together a report to be sent under expedited \nprocedures.\n  The leader on the other side of the aisle says: This is an outrage. \nIt is a Republican steamroller. Tell me what is the steamroller. Eight \nto seven representation, takes ten people to put out a report? And then \nthe other side of the aisle goes so far as to say: And they can't \nconsider taxes.\n  That is a total misrepresentation also. They can consider taxes under \nthe Entitlement Commission. And then they say: 51 votes are going to \npass it. That is a total misrepresentation again. The proposal takes 60 \nvotes to pass.\n  In response to the issues raised by the Senator from North Dakota in \nthe markup of this bill and because I accepted the fact that maybe it \nwasn't structured correctly the first time around, we responded to that \nconcern. The other side of the aisle, the leadership of the other side \nof the aisle not only doesn't give us credit for responding to the \nconcerns of the Senator from North Dakota because we changed it so that \nit became a balanced commission--we changed it so that it takes a \nsupermajority to report from it and then it takes a supermajority to \npass it--they not only don't acknowledge the changes, they would say \nthat we didn't make the changes and then attack the proposal and put \nforward absolutely no policy of their own.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. No, I won't yield. I think I have heard a significant \namount from the other side of the aisle that has been irrelevant, \ninaccurate, and incorrect. And yielding at this time would limit my \ntime.\n  The third item in this is the ability of the Congress to reduce the \ndeficit as\n\n[[Page S6604]]\n\na percentage of gross national product. We know that if we don't get \nthe deficit down, our children are going to get all these debts. So \nwhat we put in a place as a mechanism that says essentially the \ndeficit, as a percentage of gross national product, shall be reduced as \na percentage of gross national product every year until we get to a \nbalanced budget, essentially a balanced budget by the year 2012, and if \nwe don't hit those deficit targets--and they are fairly reasonable \nbecause actually the next 2-year targets we have already hit or we will \nhit under present projections, so this doesn't even kick in, and it \ndoesn't look like it is going to kick in because it looks like we will \nget to a balanced budget--should we not continue on that path, then \nwhat will happen is there will be a reconciliation instruction because \nwe know that 60 percent of all spending around here goes to mandatory \naccounts. We will say to the mandatory account committees: Reconcile \nyour accounts so that they can be brought into line with these \nprojections for the deficit to head to zero.\n\n  What does that mean? That means that there will be policy changes \nwhich will allow savings to occur. I presume those policy changes, to \nthe extent they affect entitlement programs such as Social Security, \nMedicare, and Medicaid, will tie into the Entitlement Commission \nreport. Should those two mechanisms which force policy to be addressed \nnot be accomplished, then you go to a sequester on entitlement \nmandatory spending, something that has never happened around here. And \nI don't expect it would ever happen because one presumes responsible \npeople would want to make the policy changes to get to the targets \nrather than allow it to happen automatically.\n  So where is the irresponsibility here? Well, the irresponsibility is \non the other side of the aisle, which has buried its head in the sand \nof obstructionism because it wants to take power around here. It feels \nthat if it doesn't do anything, if nothing is done around here, then \noutrage will occur and people will vote them into power. How cynical is \nthat approach to governance?\n  I have said I am willing to adjust this. In fact, on the Commission, \nthe Senator from North Dakota suggested that we change the makeup and \nmake it all Members of Congress versus outside individuals. I am \namenable to that. If he wants to bring that amendment forward, fine. \nThe Senator from North Dakota at the markup said: It doesn't consider \ntax increases. Actually, the Commission can consider tax increases. But \nI said: Let's take it to the floor and discuss the issue of pay-go or \ntax-go, as I would call it, which is the only proposal from the other \nside of the aisle, to raise taxes. But no, the response is: This is \ngoing to savage Social Security. This is going to undermine Social \nSecurity. This is going to privatize Social Security--all the words the \npollsters have told them to use to try to get reelected.\n  I will tell you what is going to savage Social Security. It is going \nto be my generation retiring and demanding the benefits that they have \nbeen paying for all of our working life and having our children have to \npay for those benefits. Our children are going to get up in arms and \nsay: We would like to buy a house. We would like to send our kids to \ncollege. We would like to have the good life you had, and we can't \nafford it because you put this huge tax burden on us. Because you, \nduring your term of office, were unwilling to be responsible and \naddress these issues.\n  We have tried to be responsible. We have tried to bring forward a \npackage which should be debated and which should be effectively moved \nforward in order to try to reverse the direction which we are \ninevitably going toward, which means if we stay on this course, we will \neliminate the capacity of our children to look forward to the \nGovernment. So we brought forward this package which we call stop \noverspending. It may not have all the elements it needs. It clearly \nneeds some tweaking here and there. I don't limit that. But it should \nnot be attacked in the way that it has been attacked through the \ndemagoguery of Social Security's bloody shirt being waved at it.\n  That is not responsible. That is not governance. That is simply \nobstructionism for the sake of political gain.\n  At this point, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday, in the Joint Economic \nCommittee, we heard from the chairman of the President's Council of \nEconomic Advisers. As often happens in that committee, there were a \nnumber of issues raised. I would like to take the floor simply to \nclarify where we really are with respect to the economy. There are so \nmany things being said in this election period about the economy that \nit is always nice to reflect on what the late Senator Moynihan used to \nsay:\n\n       Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own \n     facts.\n\n  Let's spend a little time talking about the facts and understand \nwhere the economy is. With a series of charts, I will try to do it as \nquickly as I can, with an understanding of where the economy currently \nis.\n  This first chart demonstrates economic growth as measured by GDP, \ngross domestic product. The bars on the chart represent quarters. The \nquarters with positive GDP growth are represented by blue bars. \nQuarters with declines in GDP are represented by red bars. If you will \nnotice here in the beginning of 2000, the economy started to shrink--\nthat which we refer to as the recent recession which began in 2000. \nThese are the quarters in which that happened. We got a recovery \nstarting in the fourth quarter of 2001, but as these bars above the \nzero line demonstrate, the recovery was pretty anemic. Not much \nhappened for a little over a year, as the recovery did not get \ntraction. The recovery took off in the second quarter of 2003. That \nhappens to be the time that we passed tax relief. Economists will argue \nas to whether the tax relief that was passed at that time is \nresponsible for the recovery, but as they say in Manhattan, ``it \ncouldn't hurt,'' because the tax relief was passed there, and we see \nthe strong economic growth that has occurred ever since the second \nquarter of 2003.\n  Let's go to the next chart. There was talk that, well, we may be in \nrecovery, but we are not getting any jobs; this is a jobless recovery. \nWhere are the jobs? This chart demonstrates that, indeed, that is \ncorrect. Starting in 2000, the jobs started to disappear, and we had a \nlong period that went on where the job base was shrinking in this \ncountry. In 2003, that turned around, and we started to see strong job \ncreation since the second quarter of 2003. Once again, that is the \nquarter where we passed tax relief. Did the tax relief cause the job \nrecovery? Nobody can prove that it did or it didn't. Once again, it \ndidn't hurt.\n  Now we go to the question of business investment. The recession, once \nagain, started in 2000. Business investment went into negative \nterritory all through 2001, 2002, and then, in the third quarter of \n2003, after we passed tax relief, business investment picked up. All of \nthese things started going up after this one event of the passage of \ntax relief. Did the tax relief cause the business investment to go up? \nNo one knows, but once again, it couldn't hurt.\n  All right. With those facts before us, and they are indisputable, we \nnow hear the argument: Yes, maybe the GDP growth is occurring; yes, \nmaybe the jobs have come back; yes, maybe business investment has come \nback. But the big problem is that real wages are down; because \nproductivity has gone up, real wages have gone down.\n  Here is a historic demonstration of the tie between productivity and \nreal wages. This goes back to 1950. The blue line on the chart is \nproductivity growth; the red line is growth in real compensation \nincluding benefits. The two grow together. The outstanding increase in \nproductivity we have had since 2003 has not produced a lowering of real \ncompensation to workers. The best thing that can happen for real wages, \nhistorically, is for productivity to go up. So those who are bemoaning \nthe increase in productivity, saying, yes, but real wages are down, are \nignoring 50 years of history and the current facts.\n  We are told that the wages people take home are down; the wages \npeople have in their pocketbooks are down in this recovery. Here on \nthis chart, from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is the evidence of \nwhat is happening to real hourly wage growth. We can see that, in \nprevious recessions, every time\n\n[[Page S6605]]\n\nthere was a recession, real wage growth went down; recession, real wage \ngrowth went down; recession, real wage growth went down. In this \nrecession, real wage growth did not go down as much as it historically \nhas; real wages stayed higher than they have been in the past.\n  During this period of recovery, it looks like--yes, that argument has \nmerit--real wages are going down. However, one of the things we have to \nrecognize is that this chart does not include benefits. When you add \nbenefits to wages and get the total compensation that goes into \nsomeone's pocket, the picture changes. Consider the next chart. Again, \nthe dark blue line on the chart is productivity, and it shows that \nemployee compensation in total in a recession goes down as productivity \ngoes up. It goes down as productivity goes up. It goes down as \nproductivity goes up. It goes down as productivity goes up. And then, \nwhen the recovery takes hold, real compensation comes back up above the \nline.\n  Here are the facts. Taking this as the line between growth and \nshrinkage, real employee compensation, including benefits, has been in \npositive territory. It went below that, just as it has in every \nprevious recession, but when the recovery took hold, employee \ncompensation has gone into positive territory and come back up to join \nproductivity, just as it has done historically.\n  Where do we get these arguments that real wages are going down? It is \nthe difference between the two charts. The difference is that one chart \nlooks at wages only, and ignores benefits. The other shows total worker \ncompensation that includes wages and salaries, but also benefits \nworkers receive. Now we can consider some statistics that I hope make \nthe importance of the distinction between wages only and wages plus \nbenefits very clear. The employment cost index data shown in the final \nchart shows that in the 1980s, real compensation growth grew at a 0.82 \npercent rate. In the 1990s, coming after the recession--we have taken \nthe recession out of this--the period of growth during the Clinton \nadministration stayed at virtually the same level. But from 2001 to the \npresent, it is much stronger, at 1.11 percent.\n\n  How can that be, given the rhetoric we have heard? Well, if you go to \nthe salary growth, take out the benefits, you find that portion of that \nwage and salary growth was 0.46 in the 1980s. It was 0.82 percent in \nthe 1990s. It was only 0.39 since the beginning of 2001. This is the \nnumber which is being focused on as a demonstration of the fact that \npeople's wages are not that good. But when you look at the benefits \ngrowth, you find that benefits grew in the 1980s at 1.76 percent. In \nthe 1990s, at 0.73 percent growth, there was very anemic benefit \ngrowth. That is why this number is so close to this number, because the \nbenefit growth actually pulled this number down. But when you get to \nwhat has happened from the beginning of 2001 to now, people are \ncontracting for more benefits. The benefit growth is extremely strong, \nwhich is why real compensation is stronger in the post-2000 period than \nit was in either of the previous two decades--not a bad economic record \nsince the year 2000 and the recession we had.\n  I have more to say on this, but I recognize that other Senators wish \nto speak, so I will conclude here. I wish to make it clear that the \nfacts demonstrate that we have a strong economy currently going, and \nthe facts demonstrate that real compensation is keeping up with it. \nProductivity is going up at an accelerated rate, and real compensation \nis also going up at an accelerated rate. We should be proud of what we \nhave accomplished since coming out of the recession of 2000.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, can you tell me what the order before the \nSenate is at this moment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 2 minutes remaining in \nmorning business.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nLieberman and I be recognized for 30 minutes equally divided, but that \nprior to that recognition, my colleague from South Dakota be recognized \nfor not to exceed 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will not object, but I ask to be \nrecognized for 10 minutes after the Senator from South Dakota, and I \nbelieve the Senator from North Dakota will be seeking recognition for \n20 minutes. I don't know when Senator Lieberman is arriving. Would it \nbe appropriate now to lock in these three requests--10 minutes for the \nSenator from South Dakota, 10 minutes for myself, and 20 minutes for \nthe Senator from North Dakota?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I know of no objection to that request. I \nwould not object.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I make a unanimous consent request that \nthe Senator from South Dakota be recognized for 10 minutes, I be \nrecognized for 10 minutes, followed by the Senator from North Dakota \nfor 20 minutes, and the Senators from Maine and Connecticut be \nrecognized for 30 minutes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. If the Senator will withhold, I will object to that \nbecause the Senator from Connecticut and I had been planning to speak \nat 11:30. So what I would suggest, if it would be acceptable to the \nSenator from Illinois, is that the Senator from Connecticut and I would \ncut our time from 30 minutes to 20 minutes but proceed immediately \nbefore the other Members are recognized. Would that be acceptable to \nthe Senator from Illinois, since we were here first?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Maine is so persuasive. I don't know if \nthe Senator from South Dakota still wants recognition.\n  Mr. THUNE. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from South \nDakota be recognized for 10 minutes, the Senators from Connecticut and \nMaine for 20 minutes combined, and then the Senator from North Dakota \nand myself for 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/28/senate-section/article/S6605-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6605-S6606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE WAR ON TERROR\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise to speak today about one of the \ngreat issues that faces us in this era, the war on terror. I rise to \nspeak in support of the efforts being undertaken by our soldiers in \nIraq. I consider my place on the Armed Services Committee to be an \nhonor and a privilege. American soldiers are deployed the world over, \nand it is my duty to serve and to support them.\n  Today, our country is at war against an ideology of hate and \noppression that has turned a peaceful religion into a platform for war. \nOur soldiers have faced such adversities throughout our history and \ndefeated them. That is why yesterday I voted in favor of a \nconstitutional amendment to protect the flag, which represents what our \nsoldiers have always fought for.\n  The fight to combat Islamic fascism has not ended. Our soldiers, \nalongside Iraqi security forces, are fighting against the enemies of a \nfree Iraq--enemies like Zarqawi, who made war on Americans and Iraqis \nalike. Zarqawi butchered innocent Iraqis in the streets with the hopes \nthat he could intimidate them into submission or spark a civil war \nwhere his ideology of hatred could live. Zarqawi was wrong, and now he \nis dead.\n\n  Further, today we have reports that Iraqi security forces arrested a \nkey al-Qaida figure who was involved in the destruction of the golden \nal-Askariya Mosque. Moreover, the Iraqis have not abandoned hope and \nneither should we. To the contrary, Iraqi and American forces are \nworking together to bring a fledgling democracy into maturity. Iraqis \nare risking their lives so that their future generations can enjoy the \nfreedoms of liberty.\n  While the Iraqis work toward unity, the U.S. Congress seems to be \nheading toward disunity. I am concerned over the increasingly visceral, \nunobjective, and unconstructive rhetoric launched by some on the other \nside regarding the global war on terrorism. I tried to remain silent on \nthis matter waiting for the Democratic leadership to offer a \nconstructive plan or enter into a constructive dialog. Unfortunately, \nneither of these things has happened.\n\n[[Page S6606]]\n\n  To date, the Democratic plan for dealing with Iraq and the war on \nterror consists of simply quitting as soon as possible and launching a \ncampaign of personal and negative attacks on the President and his \nadministration. I suppose as we enter the beginning of an election \nyear, the rhetoric will only get worse, and the issue will become more \npolarized.\n  The unfortunate victims of this Democratic charade are not the \nAmerican people but the American soldier. Day after day, our soldiers \nsee and hear people in this Chamber hammering away at the point that we \nare losing the war in Iraq, that Iraq is a lost cause or that this is a \nwinless war, while all the time hiding behind the inconsistent mantra \nof opposing the war but supporting the soldiers. After visiting \nsoldiers in both Iraq and Walter Reed Hospital, I am confident that for \nAmerican soldiers there is no unwinnable war.\n  That is why I voted against Democratic amendments calling for troop \nwithdrawals or artificial timelines. I believe the troops in Iraq are \ndoing the work we have asked them to do, and that if we focus right now \non artificial timelines, we will be doing them a grave disservice. I \nbelieve the calls that have come out of here are wrong for a couple of \nreasons.\n  First of all, they violate the spirit of the separation of powers \ndoctrine that interferes with the President's ability to act as \nCommander in Chief.\n  Second, I think they turn what should be battlefield decisions into \ndecisions made by politicians. Our commanders should make troop need \ndecisions based on conditions on the ground.\n  The ``long war,'' as referenced by President Bush and also by Osama \nbin Laden, is not a war for Iraq, it is a war for hope, compassion, \nkindness, and a restoration of freedom to people the world over.\n  Now is not the time to send a message to Islamic fascists that they \nhave won and we are pulling out because America has lost its resolve.\n  It is important to spur the Iraqis on, but we cannot force them to \ntry and establish a working democracy by threatening to leave.\n  Since March of 2003, when American troops entered Iraq, there has \nbeen a great deal of advancement. While some on the other side take \nevery opportunity to point out flaws and failures, I would like to \npoint out that in January of 2005, 8 million Iraqis voted for a \nTransnational National Assembly, and in August Iraqi assemblymen \npresented a Constitution to their countrymen. In October, 80 percent of \nthe people voted to ratify that new Constitution, taking their first \nsteps to create a permanent government.\n  The people of Iraq have not undertaken this path to freedom without \ndanger. They risk their lives standing in lines at voting booths and \nrecruiting stations. Iraqis do these things because they know that they \nare taking the necessary steps which will govern their future.\n  While there have been positive advancements regarding the Government, \nthe private sector has also seen improvements as well. There is much \nwork to be done here. I will not stand before the Senate and state \notherwise. However, the road to progress in Iraq is paved with growth. \nOil production has increased from 1.5 million barrels per day to 2.25 \nmillion barrels per day. Electricity is also growing. U.S.-funded \nprograms have added 2,700 megawatts to the national grid. It is clear \nthat we need to inspire more Iraqi involvement, but that is not a \nfarflung goal.\n  Since April 2003, 30,000 new businesses have started in Iraq, and \ntheir stock market is trading over $100 million per day.\n  I am very proud of what American soldiers have done in Iraq, and I \nbelieve more needs to be done. Every day we help Iraq move to a \npermanent government is another day we help Iraq become stable and no \nlonger in need of America's servicemen. I will not abandon the idea \nthat a free Iraq can be achieved or allow my actions to be governed by \nopinion polls or popularity contests.\n  It is not just Iraq that we are talking about, it is about the global \nwar on terror and American security. Whether we want to acknowledge it \nor not, Iraq has become the front line in the war on terror, and those \nterrorists who are pinned down in Iraq are not planning and launching \nattacks against the United States.\n  In fighting and winning the war on terror, ``eternal vigilance'' is \nthe operative phrase. Thomas Jefferson said: ``The price of freedom is \neternal vigilance.''\n  Irrespective of how or under what circumstances we got there, we must \nnow complete the mission. We must win. Failure means relegating future \ngenerations to a world of terror and fear where thugs and rogues rule \nand where freedom, as we know it, becomes a thing of the past.\n  The global war on terror is about not only bringing stability and \nfreedom and democracy to that region of the world, it is also about \nensuring that Americans can live in peace and security in the future. \nEvery single day that our brave and courageous men and women are taking \nthe fight to the terrorists in Iraq, it means we are not fighting them \non American soil.\n  So I rise today again to congratulate and thank those brave men and \nwomen who are carrying freedom's torch in Iraq and doing the heavy \nlifting that is necessary to keep this country safe and secure for the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to amend my earlier unanimous \nconsent request to add the following: That after I have spoken for 10 \nminutes and Senator Conrad has been recognized for 20 minutes, the \nSenator from Colorado, Mr. Salazar, be recognized for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I came to the floor a few minutes ago \nwhen Senator Gregg from New Hampshire was here. Senator Gregg is the \nchairman of the Senate Budget Committee. I listened carefully as he \ntalked about a plan to reform budgeting in America. The first thing I \ncan recall was the phrase often used by a friend of mine who serves in \nthe House of Representatives, Congressman Dave Obey of Wisconsin, who \nfrequently chides Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle for \n``posing for holy pictures.''\n  I thought to myself, how interesting it is to hear the chairman of \nthe Senate Budget Committee coming to the floor preaching for dramatic \nreform when it comes to budgeting. If one were not aware of the history \nof budgeting under this administration and under Republican leadership \nin Congress, you might be able to sell this story. But it is hard to \nsell when you look at facts.\n  When President Bush took office, he inherited a surplus. It was one \nof the first surpluses in the Federal budget in decades. It was the \nresult of President Clinton increasing taxes and cutting spending, \ndetermined to reduce the deficit.\n  We reached the point where we had surpluses that were being generated \nso they could pay down the debt to the Social Security trust fund, give \nit longer life, make certain that we were moving toward a fiscally \nsound future. President Bush inherited a Federal budget surplus. He \nalso inherited a national debt of $5.3 trillion.\n  Now where are we today, almost 6 years into the Bush-Cheney \nadministration? The national debt in America has risen under the Bush-\nCheney administration from $5.3 trillion to almost $9 trillion. In 6 \nyears, it is a dramatic increase. During that 6-year period of time \nthis administration, with a Republican Congress, has consistently given \nus deficit after deficit after deficit, digging the hole deeper and \ndeeper.\n  So when you take a look at the situation, you say, clearly, the \nDemocrats\n\n[[Page S6607]]\n\nmust be at fault in this situation. But with the exception of 1 year, \nthese were Republican Congresses generating the spending bills. So how \nmany spending bills from Congress did President Bush veto in the 6 \nyears he has been President of the United States? How many times did he \nsay no to overspending by Congress? How many times did he use his \nPresidential veto pen denying earmarks by Congress? None. Not one. \nZero. In 6 years, never. This President has never used his veto pen to \nstop spending by this Republican Congress, not one time.\n  Now comes these Republican leaders, and they say the problem isn't \ndiscipline. The problem isn't the President's veto. We have to reform \nthe system. Now they are talking about this elaborate reform of the \nsystem.\n  If you are a student of political history, you have seen this before. \nWhen President Reagan's administration brought us the biggest deficits \nin the history of the United States, those who were responsible for the \ndeficits were quick to the floor of the Senate, pleading for an \namendment to the Constitution, a balanced budget amendment to save them \nfrom themselves. It did not pass, and it should not have passed \nbecause, as President Clinton demonstrated over 8 years, it isn't a \nmatter of a weakness in our Constitution. It was a weakness of \npolitical will by the Republican side.\n  If you will take control of this economy and of this budget, you can \ntruly reduce deficits and create a surplus. That isn't just a promise, \nit was a fact under the Clinton administration and evidence of failure \nin the Bush administration they have not come close to a surplus in any \nyear. Now, as we face these record deficits and record debt for \nAmerica, what do we hear from the Republican side of the aisle? It \nisn't our fault. We have to change the system.\n  No, you don't. The system worked under a Democratic President. The \nsystem worked to generate a surplus. Now to have them come as political \nsinners posing for holy pictures when it comes to balancing the budget \nis a very thin charade that most Americans will see through.\n  We understand what this is all about. It was not that long ago that \nPresident Bush decided to privatize Social Security. It was an idea \nthat flopped across America. The President took his road show out, and \nevery time he made a speech about privatizing Social Security, the \npopularity of the idea plummeted. Finally, he gave up on it, as he \nshould have. It is a bad idea to cut back on the cost-of-living \nadjustments that people living under Social Security count on. It is a \nbad idea to take money out of the Social Security system, when we know \nwe have made promises to future generations that must be kept. And it \nis a fact that the Social Security Administration untouched will be \nable to promise payments every year, with COLAs, through 2030. It is a \nstrong system. We can make it stronger, but privatizing Social Security \nis the wrong way to go.\n  I urge my colleagues, when Senator Gregg and Republicans come forward \nwith this so-called line-item veto, look closely. Line-item veto is the \nprivatization of Social Security. America rejected it once. We need to \nreject it again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I come to the floor to respond to \ncomments that were made by the chairman of the Budget Committee moments \ngo, that I don't think, if he were to have a chance to review what he \nsaid, would be what he intends to convey.\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee moments ago said that our side \ndid not offer alternatives to the proposal that he was making to get \nour deficit and debt under control. The Senator knows that is not true. \nThat is not accurate. That is not even close to being accurate.\n  Let me indicate that I have great respect for the chairman of the \nBudget Committee. He and I have a very good working relationship, \nalthough we disagree on some issues. We have, I have always felt, a \nrespect between us. But for him to say we did not offer an alternative \nis not true. I think, on reflection, he would acknowledge that is not \nthe case.\n  In fact, the record of the committee shows very clearly that we \noffered a comprehensive alternative to the one he was offering. In \nfact, he said publicly he appreciated the fact that I offered a \ncomprehensive alternative.\n  Let's get straight, on a factual basis, what occurred in the Budget \nCommittee. Here is the alternative I offered. It is an 11-point plan \nthat involves a fully comprehensive approach to the explosion of \ndeficits and debt. What was our alternative?\n  No. 1, we restored a strong Senate pay-go rule and statutory pay-go \nenforced with sequestration.\n  That is a lot of big words. The basic notion is pay-go. What is pay-\ngo? Pay-go simply says, if you want to have more spending, you have to \npay for it. If you want to have more tax cuts, you have to pay for \nthem. This is a discipline we had in the 1990s that worked extremely \nwell. Virtually every budget observer of either side said pay-go was an \nessential part of restoring budget discipline.\n  The second part of our proposal was to allow reconciliation--a \nspecial fast-track procedure in the Senate--for deficit reduction only. \nThat was the intention of reconciliation when it was put in place. \nUnfortunately, in the last 5 years, reconciliation has been used not to \nreduce the deficit but to increase it. That was never the intent of \nreconciliation, to provide special fast-track procedures, limited \ndebate, limited amendments. That was approved for one reason only, to \nreduce the deficit. We ought to go back to that plan.\n  Third, we suggest the budget ought to budget for the war instead of \ncoming forward with these supplemental appropriations bills with tens \nof billions of dollars not part of the budget. We are over 3 years into \nthis war. The President needs to be budgeting for the war.\n  Fourth, we reaffirmed the protections for Social Security--they exist \nin current law--ensuring its off-budget status so Social Security funds \naren't pooled with all the other funds to disguise from the American \npeople the seriousness of our fiscal condition. And to prohibit fast-\ntrack changes to Social Security--again, special rules that are outside \nthe normal rules of the Senate that could lead to a shredding of Social \nSecurity and Medicare with very little debate and with virtually no \namendments. I will get into that in a moment.\n  We also have a ``save Social Security first'' provision in our plan, \na 60-vote point of order against any new spending or new tax cuts that \nincrease the deficit until the 75-year Social Security solvency is \nrestored.\n  We also restore for 2006 the 60-vote point of order against \nconsidering tax cuts or new spending or debt limit legislation without \na new budget resolution.\n  It is amazing, but our colleagues on the other side last year put in \nplace new spending caps as part of the plan that the chairman of the \ncommittee presented moments ago. Last year they put in place spending \ncaps for 2006, 2007, 2008. Two weeks ago, when we passed the \nsupplemental, they wiped them out. So when the Senator suggests that is \nthe answer to our problems--no, it is not the answer to our problems. \nNo process is the answer to our problems, unless there is the will to \nactually do the job of reducing deficits and debt. No process is going \nto solve the problem.\n  That is made clear by what happened two weeks ago. Again, I say to my \ncolleagues, the Senator comes forward with a whole new package of \nspending caps--fine. Good. I am for spending caps--but spending caps \nthat are enforceable and real, that aren't waived the next year when \nthey start to pinch. That is what our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle did week before last. Now they come with a new package of \nspending caps and say that's the answer? Wait a minute. Two weeks ago \nthey undid the spending caps they put in place last year. Last year \nthey put in spending caps for 2006, 2007, 2008. Then they come week \nbefore last in the supplemental appropriations bill and eliminate them.\n  Last year they put in place a budget point of order that says you \ncan't have more tax cuts or more spending or more debt if you don't \nhave a budget. Guess what they did two weeks ago--they waived it. They \nsaid: Well, we weren't really serious about what we did last year. \nForget it.\n\n[[Page S6608]]\n\n  Forget it. Forget the spending caps we put in place last year. Forget \nthe budget point of order we put in place last year. Forget it.\n  Now what is their answer? Now they are under pressure in an election \nyear. They come out with this ``stop overspending'' plan that rehashes \na bunch of the tired old things that haven't worked in the past and \nthat they paid no attention to when they did put them in place.\n  We restore that 60-vote point of order they just waived. We also \nallow Congress to strip earmarks in other items inserted in the \nconference reports.\n  There is abuse going on in the Congress, and everybody knows it. \nMatters that are never considered in the Senate or the House are \ninserted in the conference committee in the dead of night, behind \nclosed doors, and come out here with a straight up-or-down vote. That \nshouldn't be permitted.\n  We require a 48-hour layoff period and a Congressional Budget Office \nscore of conference reports because all too often that has been abused. \nWe are presented with a 600- or 700- or 800-page bill nobody has ever \nread, and nobody has any idea what is in it. And we are told to vote in \na matter of hours. No. We ought to have 48 hours to study what is out \nhere, and we ought to have a CBO score of any legislation that is \nconsidered so we know what it costs and so we know what is in it.\n  In addition, we require the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint \nCommittee on Tax to score longer term revenue and outlays for us to \nenforce the Byrd Rule for reconciliation and to show fully phased-in \n10-year cost of legislation.\n  Once again, what is happening is colleagues are coming and they are \npresenting the 5-year cost of something, when they know that right \nbehind the 5-year window the cost explodes. That is true of tax cut \nproposals and spending proposals. And we need to put a stop to it.\n  Also, in my proposal we enforce the discretionary spending limits. We \nenforce spending caps that in conjunction with pay-go have been \neffective in the past. And we initiate a real bipartisan effort to \nreduce the deficit with the President and with lawmakers.\n  Here is the reality. This budget situation has gone totally red. \nThese are the biggest deficits in the history of the country in the \nlast 4 years.\n  Even more serious than the deficit is the growth of the debt.\n  Here is what has happened to the debt. After the first year of this \nPresident, the debt of the country was $5.8 trillion. The chairman of \nthe Budget Committee told us in committee we wouldn't have a budget \nthis year. There won't be a budget at all.\n  But if either the budget proposal that cleared the Senate and the \nseparate one that cleared the House were adopted, here is what would \nhappen to the debt by 2011. It would be up to almost $12 trillion. The \nconsequences of all of this are that our debt is exploding and our debt \nheld by foreigners is exploding.\n  This chart shows that it took 42 Presidents 224 years to run up $1 \ntrillion of our debt held abroad; that is, debt held by foreigners. It \ntook 42 Presidents 224 years to run up more than $1 trillion in U.S. \ndebt held by foreigners.\n  This President has more than doubled that amount in just 5 years.\n  This is an utterly unsustainable course. It is why I agreed with part \nof the chairman's message that we are on an unsustainable course, and \nwe need to address this. But we need to do it in a bipartisan way. That \nis the great flaw in what the Senator has proposed.\n  Here is what has happened, a consequence of these massive deficits--\nboth the trade and budget deficits.\n  We now owe Japan over $600 billion. We owe the Chinese over $300 \nbillion. We even owe Mexico now over $40 billion. Who would have \nbelieved it?\n  What is perhaps most stunning is if you look at the world's biggest \nborrowers, we are in the No. 1 position by far. In the 1980s, we were \nthe largest creditor nation in the world. More countries owed us money \nthan any other country in the world. We now owe more money than any \nother country in the world and by a large margin.\n  If you look at all the money that is available to borrow in the \nworld, we are borrowing about two-thirds of it. We are borrowing 65 \npercent of the money that is being borrowed by countries around the \nworld. Our country alone is borrowing 65 percent of the money that is \navailable to borrow. The chairman came out. He has a program he calls \nSOS, ``stop the overspending.'' Who is overspending? His party is in \ncontrol. His party has had control for 6 years. They control the White \nHouse. They control the House, and they control the Senate. There is \nnot one dime of this spending they are not responsible for.\n  What has happened to spending? Spending has gone up 40 percent while \nthey have had control--a 40-percent increase in spending.\n  The chairman comes out with this plan. He says stop overspending. But \nlook at it. A big part of this is these spending caps. As I have \nindicated, they put in spending caps last year, which they threw in the \nditch two weeks ago.\n  They have more budget points of order in their plan. They waived the \nbudget point of orders they put in place last year. They did it week \nbefore last.\n  If you look at that specifics of the proposal the chairman has made, \nhe goes back to the old Gramm-Rudman approach of setting targets. The \nproblem was it didn't work then, and it is unlikely to work now because \nall of these targets can be gamed. That is what happened under Gramm-\nRudman. They gamed them. So they meant nothing.\n  Here is the dotted red line that shows the first Gramm-Rudman \ntargets. Then they changed them to this dotted red line. But the black \nline shows what actually happened to the deficit. These deficit targets \ndidn't come within hailing distance of meeting these targets. Why? \nBecause they were gamed just like they have gamed the spending caps \nthat they themselves put in place last year when they started to pinch. \nThey eliminated them.\n  That is exactly what happened under Gramm-Rudman.\n  It was gamed, and it meant nothing; the great press releases, the \nsound and the fury, signifying nothing.\n  This shows that the 1986 deficit, when they started Gramm-Rudman, was \n$221 billion. In 1990, the last year of Gramm-Rudman, the deficit was \n$221 billion. It was supposed to be zero. They made no progress. It \ndidn't work.\n  The chairman comes out with a package that has Gramm-Rudman all over \nit again. It doesn't have pay-go; wouldn't want to do that. That \nworked. So let us go back to something that didn't work and act as \nthough we are doing something when we are doing nothing. The GAO has \nconcluded that Gramm-Rudman was ineffective.\n  Here is what they said:\n\n       GAO has criticized Gramm-Rudman procedures for leading not \n     to meaningful deficit reduction but rather to a whole \n     generation of off-budget and other misleading practices that \n     hid the true magnitude of the deficit problem.\n       When even these practices failed to avoid sequestration, \n     the deficit targets were simply revised and the date for \n     achieving a balanced budget was postponed. Thus, instead of \n     the government reaching a balanced budget in FY 1991, the \n     original Gramm-Rudman target, the deficit reached record \n     levels.\n\n  I appreciate the chairman's good intentions. I do believe he wants to \ndo something about these deficits and debt. But the package he has come \nup with is not going to do the job.\n  That is why we objected. That is why we offered an entire \nalternative.\n  Former Senator Hollings, was one of the original architects of Gramm-\nRudman, said this:\n\n       Instead of using Gramm-Rudman-Hollings to cut back some $35 \n     billion in spending each year, we were using it as a cover to \n     increase spending $35 billion each and every year. So I said, \n     Give me a divorce from that. I don't want my name connected \n     with it.\n\n  The chairman's package also includes a biennial budget. Instead of \nbudgeting every year, budget every 2 years. I guess we are not going to \neven have a budget this year. So maybe we are on a biennial budget \nwithout it even being in the law.\n  Can you think of any single major organization that just budgets \nevery other year? What a bizarre idea. We are paying little attention \nto the budget. So the idea from the other side is let us pay even less \nattention. That is a good idea.\n  It takes words away from me. To have the idea that because we are not \nbeing successful in managing our fiscal affairs, the answer is we only \nbudget every 2 years.\n\n[[Page S6609]]\n\n  That would simply lead to more supplemental spending.\n  While the President is calling for a biennial budget, and his budget \nfor 2006-2007 failed to provide a discretionary spending policy beyond \nthe first year.\n  For the first time since 1989, this President, when he put out his \nbudget, only gave 1 year of detail. Always before they had given 5 \nyears.\n  Why it makes any sense to go to 2-year budgeting is beyond me.\n  In addition, they have proposed a line-item veto, even though the \nSupreme Court said it is unconstitutional. In this package, they come \nwith line-item veto again. But they have done it in a way that requires \nour colleagues' attention. They have done it with no opportunity to \namend or to have extended debate on the proposed line-item veto target.\n  They also allow the President to cancel new mandatory spending \nproposals, such as those dealing with Social Security, Medicare, \nveterans, and agriculture.\n  That is an extraordinary grant of power.\n  What if we had a bipartisan agreement to deal with the long-term \nchallenges of Medicare and Social Security, and then the President \nwould be given the power, under this act, to go undo it based on what \nhe wanted to do, forget about the bipartisan negotiations? No, that \ncan't be the way we do business around here. We truly need, on a \nbipartisan basis, to get together and deal with our massive deficits \nand debt. We can't engage in a negotiation, a detailed, difficult \nnegotiation and then have the President, on his own authority, be able \nto undo the very agreements we have reached. What earthly sense does \nthat make? How could we possibly have a negotiation under those terms?\n  The CBO Director believes the line-item veto was unlikely to greatly \naffect the bottom line. He said:\n\n       Such tools cannot establish fiscal discipline unless there \n     is a political consensus to do so. In the absence of that \n     consensus, proposed changes are unlikely to greatly affect \n     the budget's bottom line.\n\n  He is right. No President needs the line-item veto.\n  This is from the Roanoke Times in Virginia. They said:\n\n       The President already has the only tool he needs, the veto. \n     That Bush has declined to challenge Congress in 5-plus years \n     is his choice. The White House no doubt sees reviving this \n     debate as means of distracting people from the missteps, \n     miscalculations, mistruths and mistakes that have dogged Bush \n     and sent his approval rating south. The current problems are \n     not systemic. They are ideological. A line-item veto will not \n     magically grant lawmakers and the President fiscal \n     discipline.\n\n  They are not alone in that view.\n  Here is a conservative columnist, George Will, who believes the line-\nitem veto will shift too much power to the executive branch. He said:\n\n       It would aggravate the imbalance in our constitutional \n     system that has been growing for seven decades. The expansion \n     of executive power at the expense of the legislature.\n\n  An American Enterprise Institute scholar calls the line- item veto \nproposal ``shameful.''\n\n       Shameful. The larger reality is this line-item veto \n     proposal gives the President a great additional mischief-\n     making capability, to pluck out items to punish lawmakers he \n     doesn't like, or to threaten individual lawmakers to get \n     votes on other things without having any noticeable impact on \n     budget growth or restraint.\n\n  He went on to say this:\n\n       More broadly, it simply shows the lack of institutional \n     integrity and patriotism by the majority in Congress. They \n     have lots of ways to put the responsibility on budget \n     restraint where it belongs, on themselves. Instead, they \n     willingly--even eagerly--try to turn their most basic power \n     over to the President. Shameful. Just shameful.\n\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee indicated he has changed his \nproposal so the Commission on Social Security and Medicare would \nrequire a 60-vote majority in the Senate. That is true. His original \nproposal did not do that. His original proposal had a simple majority \nbeing able to pass whatever a commission sent back.\n\n  What is wrong with the commission proposal he has left us with? What \nis wrong is, this proposal comes to us on a fast-track basis. In fact, \nthe way it is designed, you could have a circumstance in which no \namendments are permitted. I hope my colleagues are listening. They want \nto adopt a commission process that would permit the following: The \ncommission, which has a majority of Republicans, says we want to cut \nSocial Security 50 percent, comes up here to the Senate, the majority \nleader gets recognition, which he has the right to do under Senate \nrules, puts in an amendment, offers a quorum call, goes into a quorum \ncall for 50 hours, with no amendments, no debate, and at the end of the \n50 hours, we vote on the commission proposal. That is at the heart of \nwhat is wrong with what the chairman proposed. That is a completely \nunacceptable procedure.\n  We are not going to have a circumstance in which the future of Social \nSecurity and Medicare could be determined in the Senate under fast-\ntrack procedures that deny Senators a chance to amend or debate what \ncomes from an unelected, unaccountable commission. Is that what we have \ncome to in this country? I don't think so. This is not some \ndictatorship where things come up here and Senators could be precluded \nfrom their right to amend or debate. That is the genius of the Senate.\n  Under the chairman's proposal, that is exactly what could happen. He \nsays no majority leader would ever do that. Maybe not. Maybe what they \nwould do, using that power, is say: There can only be five amendments, \nor I will use my power to preclude all amendments.\n  Have we ever seen a majority leader do that? Yes, I have been here. I \nhave seen it.\n  I say, as one Member, I will never, ever, go along with something \nthat would be so consequential, determine the future of Social \nSecurity, the future of Medicare, and set up a circumstance in which no \nSenator could offer an amendment except the majority leader of the \nSenate. That looks like not just a fast-track process, that looks like \na bum's rush.\n  The Senator gets a big push back from our side, you bet. He will get \na real big push back because we are not going to agree to that. That is \nradical. That is reckless. We are not going to go along with that. The \nSenator can say it can never happen, but we all know it could happen.\n  I respect the chairman of the Committee on the Budget. I like him. We \nwork together well. When he came out here and said we offered no \nalternatives, that is flatly untrue. We gave a detailed, comprehensive \nalternative which he praised publicly in the committee. To come to the \nSenate and say we offered no alternative is just not true. He knows it; \nI know it. The record shows it.\n  I am quite certain the Senator was exercised and upset and probably \nmis-spoke. I hope he corrects the record on this question. It cannot \nstand. It does not enhance this discussion or debate for either side to \nsay things that are not accurate. He is upset that some of our side \napparently said the commission proposal would come up here on a simple \nmajority. That was his initial proposal. Under my criticism of that \napproach, he did alter that. But he still left us with a fast-track \nprocess that could preclude amendments and debate on something as \nfundamental as the future of Social Security and Medicare. That is just \nnot acceptable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/28/senate-section/article/S6609-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6609-S6611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, let me first say my colleague from \nNorth Dakota does an incredible job in terms of leading our country \nwith a voice that stands for fiscal discipline. When he talks about the \nmountain of debt that we are continuing to build in this country, and \npassing on that mountain of debt to our children and our grandchildren, \nthe American people deserve more of this Congress and more of \nWashington, DC, and more of this President. I look forward to his \ncontinuing leadership on this issue to try and bring about fiscal \nintegrity and fiscal honesty to the United States of America. The \nAmerican people deserve no less than that kind of candor and integrity \nfrom the Senate.\n  I rise today to talk about an urgent issue which we all ought to be \nvery concerned about in the United States of America. That is the issue \nof energy. Last year, this Senate put together a bipartisan template on \nthe National Energy Policy Act of 2005 which may go down in our history \nas being one of the most important achievements of the 109th Congress. \nNotwithstanding\n\n[[Page S6610]]\n\nthe fact that we put together energy legislation that did some great \nthings for conservation, that stood out for renewable energy, that said \nthat new technologies were part of how we could lock in the future of \nour Nation's energy independence, we have had many opportunities to \nmove forward and to continue to address the issue of energy. Yet we \nhave not done that as a Congress nor as a Senate.\n  Six months of this year have already passed. It has been 5 months \nsince the President of the United States, before the American people, \nsaid that we were addicted to foreign oil and we needed to take \naggressive steps to move forward to get ourselves to energy \nindependence.\n\n  I had the honor of hosting the President at the National Renewable \nEnergy Lab in Golden, CO, and we looked at the possibility of renewable \nenergy. Yet some 6 months after that January speech, we still are here \nin this Senate without having moved forward with any significant kind \nof energy legislation. That is wrong. Part of the people's business, \nthe highest priority, is for us to look at this energy dilemma we are \nfacing in this country and to embrace in a real, honest, and ethical \nway the imperative that moves us toward energy independence.\n  I will address part of what I think we ought to be doing with our \nmovement toward energy independence in our country today. The time to \nget serious about growing our way to energy independence is long \noverdue. If Brazil, a Third World country, can do it, it is inexcusable \nfor the United States of America, the strongest Nation on Earth, to do \notherwise.\n  Today in Brazil, ethanol substitutes for 204,000 barrels of gasoline \nsold every day. Over 40 percent of all the gasoline that is sold \nnationally in Brazil comes from ethanol, making that country energy \nindependent today.\n  In the last couple of months, we have had a lot of ideas discussed in \nthis Senate and through multiple press conferences about how we can \nease the pain at the pump for the American consumers. We have heard \nideas to give $100 tax rebates. We heard ideas to create a tax holiday \nfor gas, to enact a Federal gas price-gouging statute, to reduce the \nnumber of fuels that are currently on the market, to end royalty \nrelief, and on and on. There are lots of ideas talked about that we \nshould give careful consideration.\n  We should also talk straight to the American people. We are a nation \nthat relies on oil to power our economy. We import almost 60 percent of \nour oil from countries such as Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Iraq, and \nVenezuela. We are hostage to a cartel of oil-producing countries that \ndecide how much oil will reach the market at any given moment. Many \nMembers of this cartel are unfriendly to the United States. They know \nhow much power their oil has over our national security.\n  The bottom line is that energy independence is important to all of us \nin the 21st century if we are to achieve national security.\n  Without a reliable and affordable supply of homegrown energy, our \ndependence on foreign oil will only continue to increase, further \nwarping our foreign policy and jeopardizing the stability of our \neconomy. If we continue at our current pace, in two decades we will be \nimporting 70 percent of our oil from foreign countries. We cannot \nafford to stay that course on our energy policy.\n  Expanding our domestic production of oil and gas is an important \ncomponent in our Nation's movement toward energy independence. We \nshould continue to encourage the balanced development of the resources \nthat we have. We should accelerate our development of clean coal \ntechnologies to produce clean-burning synfuel gases and jet fuels from \ncoal, an abundant domestic resource. But none of the rhetoric can \nchange the fact that we just don't have enough petroleum resources in \nthis country to drill our way to energy independence.\n  Today, we are the world's third leading producer of oil, but our rate \nof oil consumption--primarily for transportation--is almost three times \nour rate of oil production. Furthermore, the sad truth is that we only \nhave 3 percent of the world's reserves in the United States of America. \nThat 3 percent includes the proven reserves in the State of Alaska.\n  We ought to look at our renewable energy future. If we make a \ndramatic, perhaps even a revolutionary new commitment to renewable \nenergy, the fuel grown in American fields can help power our vehicle \nfleet. With a bold new commitment, we can produce enough fuel on our \nfarm lands and ranch lands to meet 25 percent of our energy needs by \nthe year 2025.\n  Farmers and ranchers and all of rural America are rallying behind \nthis cry for a goal of ``25 by 25.'' Our farmers are growing corn, \nsoybeans, and sunflowers to be used for ethanol and biodiesel. Ranchers \nare building windfarms and using animal manure for power. Rural \nbusiness men and women are investing in biorefineries. New jobs are \nspringing up in many places where they had no jobs. Rural economies, \nlong forgotten, are starting to gather steam as part of the renewable \nenergy chapter opens in America.\n  It is time for Congress as a whole to embrace rural America's vision \nfor this renewable energy future. Senator Chuck Grassley and I have \nintroduced a resolution that would make ``25 by 25'' our national goal.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this resolution because producing \n25 percent of our energy on agricultural lands by 2025 is, in fact, a \nfully achievable goal. We can do it. We can do it if we get on task and \nwe make a bipartisan commitment to work toward this goal. We should \nbegin on this goal immediately.\n  First, we should raise the renewable fuel standards we set in last \nyear's Energy Policy Act. That goal, in law today, is to produce 7.5 \nbillion gallons of renewable fuels by 2012. That goal is far too \nmodest. We will easily meet this goal under current policies. Yet we \nwill not be putting enough renewable fuels on the market to give \nconsumers a real choice or to make a real dent in our oil dependence on \nforeign countries. We should increase this target so we are producing 9 \nbillion gallons of renewable fuel by 2012 and 30 billion gallons of \nrenewable fuel by the year 2025.\n  Second, we should extend the renewable energy production tax credit \nuntil 2012. The existing production tax credit is now set to expire in \n2007. That creates uncertainty for business people and investors who \nwant to invest in renewable energy.\n  We have legislation that I have introduced, S. 1093, the Research and \nDevelopment Investment Act, which extends the renewable energy \nproduction tax credits through 2012, allowing more investment and \nquicker growth in the renewable energy market.\n  Next, we should pass S. 2025, the Vehicle and Fuel Choices for \nAmerican Security Act. This is an important piece of legislation with \nbroad bipartisan support. S. 2025 will essentially do three simple but \nvery important conceptual things.\n  First, it will increase the amount of biofuels we currently are \nproducing in America. Second, it will ensure there are filling stations \nthat are available across the country that will provide alternative \nfuels to give that choice to the American consumer. And, third, it will \nalso help transform Detroit to embrace alternative fuel vehicle \nsystems.\n  Right now, the United States consumes around 20 million barrels of \noil every day. Twenty million barrels of oil every day are consumed in \nAmerica. Two-thirds of those 20 million barrels a day are consumed in \nour transportation system--by our cars and our trucks--across this \ncountry. This is alarming: The massive amount of oil we are importing \nis barley enough to cover the needs of the transportation sector.\n  S. 2025 tackles this problem head on. It brings more gallons of \nbiofuels to the market. It gives consumers access to alternative fuels. \nIt retools America's vehicle fleet to run more efficiently and to run \non alternative fuels. By passing S. 2025, we will give consumers more \nchoices of fuels and vehicles, lower and stabilize the cost of fuel, \nand reduce our reliance on foreign oil.\n  This is not a Republican or Democratic agenda. This is an American \nagenda. And this American agenda toward energy independence is \ndemonstrated by the group of Senators who are supporting S. 2025. They \ninclude Senator Brownback, Senator Bayh, Senator Graham, Senator \nCantwell, Senator Lieberman, Senator Coleman, Senator Dodd, Senator \nBill Nelson, Senator Isakson, Senator Kohl, Senator Lugar, Senator \nObama, Senator\n\n[[Page S6611]]\n\nSessions, Senator Clinton, Senator Chafee, and others. We think this \nbill is effective, and we would hope the Senate can move forward and \nembrace this bill and pass it so the President can sign it yet this \nyear.\n  What S. 2025 does, in more detail, is it is aggressive in encouraging \nthe increased production of biofuels. It provides loan guarantees to \nfarmer-owned ethanol producers, to help them make investments in \nrenewable energy systems and infrastructure. It also increases the \nethanol infrastructure tax credit that we passed last summer in the \nEnergy Policy Act so that credit is set at 50 percent. This will lower \nthe startup costs for farmers and communities and businesspeople who \nwant to build a biorefinery or a processing plant.\n  These producers will benefit from the bill's investments in biofuels \nresearch. By doubling the funding for biofuels research, S. 2025 will \nimprove yields and efficiencies and expand the range of feedstocks that \ncan be used for biofuels production.\n  Secondly, S. 2025 helps reduce our foreign oil dependency by giving \nconsumers access to alternative fuels at filling stations. Currently, \nin the United States, we have 5 million flexible fuel vehicles. These \nvehicles can run on either gasoline or E-85, an 85-percent ethanol-\ngasoline mix. We today are adding about 1.5 million of these flex-fuel \nvehicles to our national fleet every year. The trouble is, as you well \nknow, there are only 485 filling stations in the country that carry E-\n85. There are only 485 filling stations today in the country that carry \nE-85. We have the technology on the road that allows cars to run on \nbiofuels, but because consumers cannot pump E-85 fuel at their local \nfilling station, we are not taking full advantage of the oil-saving \nrewards of the flex-fuel technology, which is now being deployed into \nour national fleet.\n  S. 2025 would solve this problem. It would solve this problem by \nhelping to build the pumps and filling station infrastructure needed to \ndeliver biofuels to consumers. The bill provides loan guarantees and \ntax incentives to farmers and business owners for the construction of \npump stations to dispense fuels. It also uses CAFE penalties that have \nalready been collected by the Government from foreign manufacturers to \nexpand funding for grants to finance alternative fueling \ninfrastructure.\n  One of the DOE grantees from this year alone, the National Ethanol \nVehicle Coalition, will be able to build 300 stations with its $2 \nmillion grant. With at least 10 times the amount of that funding \navailable, we should be able to equip at least 3,000 filling stations \nacross America with the infrastructure that delivers biofuels to \nconsumers who are in search for these alternative fuels.\n  The economic benefits of giving these fuel choices to consumers are \nclear. If consumers can rely on filling their tank with E-85 fuel \nwherever they go, demand for the fuel and demand for cars that run on \nE-85 will increase dramatically, cutting demand for petroleum-based \nfuel. Not only will this help us deal with gas prices, but it will also \nstabilize them. We can count on our farmers to harvest their crops, but \nwe cannot count--we cannot count--on Iran or the Middle East to sell us \ntheir oil.\n  Finally, S. 2025 will help us retool our national vehicle fleet. S. \n2025 sets goals for improving the efficiency of our vehicle fleet and \nfor getting more advanced vehicles on the road. It sets these goals and \nthen helps manufacturers retool their vehicle fleets to meet them.\n\n  The bill sets targets for manufacturers to produce alternative fuel \nvehicles, plug-in hybrids, fuel cell vehicles, flexible-fuel vehicles, \nand other technologies which can run on regular gasoline or biofuel \nalternatives. By 2012, 1 in 10 vehicles produced will be advanced \nvehicles. By 2016, 1 in 2 vehicles produced will be advanced vehicles \nthat can run on these alternative fuels or these advanced technologies.\n  We will help manufacturers make these changes to their fleets. The \nbill establishes a tax credit for the costs the manufacturers incur \nwhen they are retooling or expanding their facilities to produce \nadvanced vehicles. The bill also authorizes support for research that \nwill provide lightweight materials to the auto industry and for \ntechnology for electric drive trains, batteries, and plug-in hybrids.\n  The bill closes the SUV tax loophole, limits idling by buses, and \nrequires that fuel economy standards be set for heavy duty vehicles so \nwe can stop burning fuel we do not need to burn. For each 1 mile per \ngallon efficiency we find in this country, we save 1 million barrels of \noil per day, or $20 billion a year.\n  These are sensible, easy-to-implement solutions. Many of them, many \nof these ideas, have now been included in two bills that Senator \nBingaman, Senator Chafee, Senator Lieberman, Senator Coleman, Senator \nCantwell, and I and others have introduced. These are the Enhanced \nEnergy Security Act of 2006, which will push the Federal Government to \nsave 2.5 million barrels of oil per day by 2016, and at least 10 \nmillion barrels per day by 2031, and the new energy tax bill, which \nprovides multiple incentives to manufacturers, businesses, and \nconsumers alike to utilize energy-efficient programs and alternatives \nthemselves.\n  The provisions of S. 2025 and the energy tax bill will give consumers \nmore choices at the pump and reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\n  Each of us should be asking: What if we do nothing? What if we do \nnothing? What if we continue our malignant neglect of the long-term \nenergy policy of the United States of America? If we do continue this \nmalignant neglect, we will become increasingly vulnerable to the \ninstabilities and whims of countries across the globe. The American \nconsumer will continue to suffer, and the American economy will have \nlost an opportunity that has come its way.\n  We have devoted a lot of time to many issues over the last 6 months \nof this year in this Congress. We have not devoted enough time on this \nfloor to the issue of energy and of energy independence. We need to do \nso because to do otherwise is to neglect the national security of the \nUnited States.\n  When you have a system that starts to break down, you have to address \nthe cause as well as the symptoms of the problem. If your roof keeps \nspringing leaks, you don't just put more and more buckets out. What you \ndo is you eventually build yourself a new roof. We need to build a new \nenergy policy in America, one that is built on the promise of renewable \nenergy, technology, and conservation.\n  I believe Americans are eager for us as a Senate to do this. In \nStates across the country, people are enacting renewable portfolio \nstandards and demanding access to alternative energies. They imagine a \nrenewable energy future that harnesses the business and work ethic of \nrural America and which breathes new life into sagging rural economies. \nThey look at fields of corn, soy, and sunflowers and see the raw \nmaterials for biodiesel and for ethanol.\n  The renewable energy revolution is already underway in America thanks \nto farmers and ranchers and businesspeople who have been leading it, \nwho have been doing their part. We now, as a Congress, need to do our \npart to push the renewable energy revolution forward.\n  I urge our Senate, in a bipartisan fashion, following the template of \nlast year's national Energy Policy Act, to move forward to secure \nAmerica's renewable energy future by making ``25 by 25'' our national \ngoal.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune).

Mr. President, I rise to speak about an issue of great \nimportance to the State of New Jersey, to the United States of America, \nand to all of those who stand against acts of terrorism and violence: \nthe attack on Pan Am flight 103.\n  The attack on Pan Am flight 103 shocked the world and claimed the \nlives of 189 Americans, including 38 citizens from my home State of New \nJersey.\n\n[[Page S6612]]\n\n  After these terrible attacks, and significant pressure from the \ninternational community, the Libyan Government finally agreed to pay \n$10 million to the families of those who were murdered.\n  The Libyan Government still owes $2 million to these families, which \nit promised to pay as soon as it was removed from the state sponsor of \nterror list, an action the State Department announced on May 15. The \n45-day waiting period ended today, and the Libyans will be off the \nlist. But we cannot allow them to be off the hook.\n\n  Libya, according to a Washington Post article, declared yesterday \nthat it no longer has a legal obligation to make the final payment of \n$2 million to the families of those killed. Libya is trying to argue \nthat it doesn't have to pay this money because they were ``supposed'' \nto be taken off the terror list earlier. But what Libya forgets is that \nit had to earn the right to get off the terror list and that Libya's \nown actions are what delayed the process. In fact, the reason the \nprocess was delayed is because we discovered that the Libyans had been \nplotting to kill a member of the Saudi royal family, among other \nincidents.\n  Why should American families be deprived of their payment because of \nLibya's mistakes? Libya's argument is not only factually incorrect, it \nis immoral. At a time when we are fighting terrorism around the world, \nat a time when our men and women in uniform are putting their lives on \nthe line to protect us from terrorists, at a time when we should send a \nmessage to the world that terrorism and the murder of U.S. citizens \ncannot be tolerated, we cannot allow the Libyans to get away with at \nleast paying these grieving families that which they are owed. This \nmoney is not going to bring back their loved ones. It is not going to \nheal the pain. But it is an obligation that should be met.\n  Let me be clear: This money in no way absolves Libya of its actions \nin this incident. This money in no way will replace those who were \nmurdered. This money in no way makes up for the loss, pain, and \nsuffering of the families. But a promise made should be a promise kept, \nand Libya must keep its promise, period.\n  I hope the Libyans hear this message loudly and clearly. I also hope \nthe administration hears the message loudly and clearly. Our State \nDepartment should be advocating for American families, not for \nfacilitating the Libyans in breaking their commitment. We should not \nallow any implementation of diplomatic engagement until the Libyans \nhonor their commitment.\n  I promise that, along with a number of other Members of Congress who \nrepresent families from different parts of the Nation who lost a loved \none on Pan Am Flight 103, we will not rest until this payment is made, \nuntil the Libyans fulfill their promise. A promise made must be a \npromise kept. It is outrageous for the Libyans to act any other way. It \nwould be equally as outrageous for our Government to act in any other \nway other than to make sure that we help these families in having this \ncommitment honored.\n  I thank the senior Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg, who has \nbeen a leader on the Pan Am Flight 103 attacks from the beginning, \ncontinuing to fight for the citizens of New Jersey and all of the other \nfamilies who suffered in these terrible attacks. I am proud to join \nhim, now that I am in the Senate, in this effort. I am committed to \nmaking sure that these families ultimately receive the commitment and \nthe fulfillment of that commitment that the Libyan Government made. Our \nGovernment should ensure that we do no less.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, June 28 is a great day in the history of \nmy State of South Carolina and in the formation of our great Nation. \nYou see, it is on this date that we celebrate Carolina Day.\n  Two hundred and thirty years ago today, a small but determined group \nof fewer than 1,200 South Carolina patriots held off a British force \nthat was more than twice their size.\n  The battle--which took place on Sullivan's Island, just outside the \nentrance to Charleston Harbor--became the first major American victory \nof the Revolutionary War.\n  Colonel William Moultrie, who commanded the colonist troops, had few \nresources at his disposal. So, he built a fort out of palmetto logs--a \nplentiful local resource.\n  Facing such make-shift opposition, the British commanders thought \nthey would easily sweep into Charleston.\n  But these amazing palmetto logs actually absorbed the impact of the \nBritish cannonballs. This strengthened the American defense and gave \nthe brave colonists a critical advantage.\n  The British were soundly defeated in a long, nine-hour battle. More \nthan 200 of the British were killed or wounded, compared to only 35 of \nColonel Moultrie's command.\n  Many historians consider this battle to be one of the greatest \ndefeats in the entire history of the British navy.\n  Many South Carolina heroes were made on that day.\n  One such, hero, Sergeant William Jasper, is recognized for saving the \nregiment's flag after it was shot down by British fire. Seeing that it \nhad been hit, Jasper exclaimed, ``Colonel, don't let us fight without \nour flag!''\n  Sergeant Jasper then jumped into the face of enemy fire, walked the \nentire length of the fort--in full view of the British and cut the flag \nfrom its broken pole. He then added a new staff and replanted the flag \nback on the fort wall. Turning to the enemy, he gave three cheers and \nreturned to his gun.\n  That flag--a blue banner with a white crescent--represented the dream \nof real freedom to these patriots. And today, that historic banner \nstill serves as a source of pride and inspiration, as part of South \nCarolina's official State seal.\n  The blue background and white crescent also serve as the basis of our \nbeautiful State flag, which incorporates a tall, proud palmetto tree . \n. . in recognition of the heroes of Fort Moultrie.\n  The resounding American defense of the City of Charleston at Fort \nMoultrie gave our fledgling Nation hope in the possibility of ultimate \nvictory. And less than one week later--on July 4, 1776--the Continental \nCongress forever changed the course of history, signing our Declaration \nof Independence.\n  This story has profound relevance to what we face today as we fight \nthe global war on terror. I can imagine those great patriots felt the \nsame kind of joy that is plainly visible in the eyes of Iraqi citizens \n. . . people who are only now beginning to share in the sweet taste of \nfreedoms that we so often take for granted.\n  Mr. President, as we celebrate Independence Day with friends and \nfamily, may we always remember the price that was paid for our freedom.\n  And may we resolve that the sacrifice of our brave soldiers across \nthe years--from Fort Moultrie, SC, to Kirkuk, Iraq--will never have \nbeen in vain.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/28/senate-section/article/S6612-3", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6612-S6615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STEM CELL RESEARCH\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, here we sit in the Senate, quorum call \nafter quorum call. Not much is happening. We just had our meeting of \nDemocratic\n\n[[Page S6613]]\n\nleaders for lunch, and we are wondering what is going on here. Here we \nsit. Nothing is happening.\n  Over a year ago, the House of Representatives voted on and passed \nH.R. 810, the Stem Cell Research Act, and sent it over to the Senate. \nIt is pending at the desk. That was over a year ago.\n  We have asked repeatedly--repeatedly--for the majority leader to \nbring up this bill so that we can debate it--I am sure under a time \nagreement--and pass it and send it to the President. The bill is \nsupported by a majority of Senators on a bipartisan basis. It enjoys \nlarge majorities in every public opinion poll, which is hardly \nsurprising because stem cell research holds tremendous promise for \ncuring illnesses and saving lives.\n  One obstacle stands in the way of moving ahead aggressively in stem \ncell research. The Senate has squandered over a year waiting for the \nmajority leader to make good on his pledge to bring H.R. 810 to the \nfloor for a vote. So here we sit.\n  Why aren't we bringing up H.R. 810? Families with children with \njuvenile diabetes, families with members who are stricken by \nAlzheimer's, people with spinal cord injuries either from birth or from \nan accident or other illnesses, and people with other neurological \ndisorders and diseases--these are the ones scientists tell us can be \nhelped the most and the fastest through the application of stem cell \ntherapy, which would be the result of stem cell research.\n  We just had a Health Week here, too. We had a Health Week about a \nmonth ago, and we didn't bring up H.R. 810 then. Everybody talked a lot \nabout everything, but we didn't do anything.\n  The fact is, I said H.R. 810 has support on both sides. I just \nmention that Senators Specter, Hatch, and Smith in particular have \nurged the majority leader to bring up the bill. As a matter of fact, \nlast year, Senator Frist himself gave a speech on the floor and \nendorsed H.R. 810. But again the majority leader has refused to bring \nit up for a vote.\n  We have written him letters. I have taken the floor numerous times, \nespecially in lulls such as this when nothing is happening. It looks as \nif we will go all through today and tomorrow and, of course, then we \nwon't be here on Friday. No wonder the American people have such a low \nopinion of this place. No wonder. They don't think we are doing \nanything, and they are right, we are not doing anything. Especially we \nare not attending to the urgent business of the American people.\n  People are suffering from incurable illnesses. People are hoping we \nwill move ahead aggressively in embryonic stem cell research and in all \nareas of stem cell research, but we still sit here and dawdle, take our \ntime, and don't do anything.\n  I don't mean to make it a partisan issue because it has never been a \npartisan issue. As I said, we have a number of Republicans supporting \nthis bill in this body, and it was passed in the House with both \nRepublican and Democratic support. I will say this: If the Democrats \nwere in charge of this Senate, we would have had H.R. 810 up by now and \nwould have passed it and would have sent it to the President.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, will the Senator from Iowa yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Is the Senator from Iowa aware of the fact that we \nhave come up with a terrific product, that science has discovered a \nvaccine which will prevent cervical cancer?\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is right.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, taking this vaccine can reduce \ncervical cancer deaths by 70 percent--70 percent. In America, we lose \nabout 4,000 women a year to cervical cancer. Across the world, the \nnumbers are over 230,000 annually. Is the Senator from Iowa aware that \nthere are detractors? The Senator is certainly aware, as he discusses \nstem cell research and conditions that are so painful for families, \nsuch as juvenile diabetes and other autoimmune diseases, that not \nenough money is going into these programs. But in this case, the chance \nto stop cervical cancer from killing women has detractors out there who \nsay: If we do that, we will encourage promiscuity. Did you ever hear \nanything so silly in your life? It is the same as saying: If you give \nseatbelts to people, they are going to drive more recklessly. It just \ndoesn't make sense.\n  So if the Senator is aware of these things, they will, I am sure, add \ninterest and fervor to his appeal to get on with finding out what is \nkilling people.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would respond by saying that if anybody \nknows about saving lives and providing good health to people in \nAmerica, it is the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg.\n  I was privileged to be here when the Senator got his amendment \nthrough to ban smoking on airlines. I remember the day you got on an \nairplane and it was packed with smoke. Then they had a divider, and in \none place you could smoke and in another place you couldn't, and still \nthe air would be filled with smoke. It was the Senator from New \nJersey--God bless him--who got that amendment through. I will never \nforget, right after that amendment passed, I used to fly back and forth \nto Iowa, and flight stewardess after flight stewardess would come back \nto me and say: Do you know Senator Lautenberg? And I would say: Sure, I \ndo. And they would say: Well, please tell him thanks. We have been \nbreathing that smoke for years, and now we don't have to. So I thank \nthe Senator for the countless lives he has saved and the working \nconditions he has made better for all of the people, and all of the \npassengers who fly on airplanes have the Senator to thank for that.\n  So when the Senator from New Jersey talks about the vaccine for \ncervical cancer, he is right on the mark, and he keeps up his long \ntradition of his focus on health care for all Americans. It is a shame \nthat we have a vaccine which could be given to women, young women--as \nyou know, I think it is three shots, if I am not mistaken, and I think \nit is good for life.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. For a lifetime.\n  Mr. HARKIN. So you could take it as a young girl. And what are we \ndoing right now? Nothing. We should be moving ahead aggressively in \nthis country and in other countries where cervical cancer is a killer. \nAs the Senator knows, it is a killer. Yet we are not doing anything. We \nsit here doing nothing. It is in that spirit which I thank the Senator \nfor bringing that up. I yield to him.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the Senator may be aware that I \nrecently sent a letter to the Centers for Disease Control saying: ``Get \non with it. Get the vaccine out there. And don't let opponents stand in \nthe way. You are responsible. The product has passed all the tests. It \nis considered safe and effective.'' So I sent this letter, and another \none to the Food and Drug Administration. I don't know whether the \nSenator is aware of these letters, but I am sure that, knowing his \ndisposition about these things, that he would want to join in this \neffort and say: `` CDC, don't you dare hold back on this information. \nDon't you dare.'' Right?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I say to my friend, sign me up.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We will do that. I would like to thank the Senator \nfor the compliment on the smoking prohibition in airplanes. It has \nfinally penetrated, after almost 20 years now, into homes, into \nrestaurants, into places where smoking just isn't an acceptable habit \nanymore. Today's papers have stories about how dangerous secondhand \nsmoke is; you don't have to smoke the cigarette yourself, you just need \nto be near someone who is. I am sure the Senator is aware of the fact \nthat breathing other people's smoke can be as dangerous to your health \nas if you engaged in smoking yourself.\n  What a coincidence it is that as we have been talking about the no \nsmoking in airplanes, our colleague from the State of Illinois, Senator \nDurbin, has joined us on the floor. At the time, he was the House \nauthor of the ban and I was the Senate author, so the two of us \ntogether were able to put that legislation into effect.\n  Returning to the vaccine, is the Senator aware of the fact that there \nare detractors out there who, even if you get the good product, will \nstand in the way of it being made readily available to people who need \nit?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I appreciate that. The fact is, yes, I \nthink it is sick. There is some illness people have when they say we \nshouldn't be giving cervical cancer vaccinations to women because they \nmay become more promiscuous. What kind of sick thought is\n\n[[Page S6614]]\n\nthat? What kind of sick thought is that? But we hear it. It is out \nthere. It is the same as those who are trying to stop embryonic stem \ncell research: Oh, no, we can't destroy these embryos. Well, we had a \nhearing yesterday morning on this issue. The Senator from Pennsylvania, \nMr. Santorum, has a bill in, and he testified before Senator Specter \nand me and Senator Durbin from Illinois, who was also there for that \nhearing. I think what came out of that hearing is we have over 400,000 \nembryos left over from in vitro fertilization which are now frozen \nwhich are going to be discarded because obviously the parents who had \nin vitro fertilization--once they have had their children and they \ndon't want to have any more, the in vitro fertilization organization \ncalls up and says: Do you want to keep these? And they say: Well, no, \nwe don't want to have any more children. And so they throw them \naway. They do this every day. They destroy these every day.\n\n  What we are saying is, why not take these things with about 16 cells \nin them and take the cells out and use them to derive embryonic stem \ncells, which can become any of the cells in our body--nerve cells, \nmuscle cells, tissue cells--and use them to advance the research so \nthat we can cure those illnesses from which so many people suffer?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will. Let me just say that a friend of mine recently \npassed away from ALS--Lou Gehrig's disease. If anyone has seen anyone \nget Lou Gehrig's disease and die of it, it is the worst. It is the \nworst. It is a death sentence as soon as you are told you have it, as \nsoon as you are diagnosed with it. No one lives, and usually death \noccurs within a year to 2 years. As your muscles deteriorate and your \nlungs give out and you are no longer able to walk, to write, to speak, \nthe mind continues on. You are aware of every second until the day, the \nminute you die. ALS--one of the most horrible diseases which afflicts \nmankind, humankind, and the scientists tell us one of the diseases \nwhich is in the target zone for embryonic stem cell research. Think \nabout that. Yet we are told it is better to throw these away, take \nthese in vitro fertilization leftover cells, throw them down the drain, \nbut don't use them for life-giving research. I say to my friend from \nNew Jersey, it is the same as those who want to stop women from getting \nvaccinations for cervical cancer because they think that, somehow, \nwomen will be more sexually promiscuous because of it. I don't \nunderstand that way of thinking.\n  I yield to my friend from Illinois who was at the hearing yesterday \nfor any comments he would like to make.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would ask the Senators who are engaging \nin this colloquy, through the Chair--it is also curious to note that \nwhile we are taking this moral position against certain vaccinations \nagainst cervical cancer, if I am not mistaken, we are also financing \nViagra products for some men through some of our same programs. A \nlittle hard to follow that logic.\n  But I would ask the Senator from Iowa or the Senator from New Jersey \nto make it clear on the embryonic stem cell situation: Were it not for \nPresident Bush's Executive order limiting Federal research with \nembryonic stem cells, we would be dramatically expanding research into \ndiabetes, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Lou Gehrig's disease, spinal cord \nregeneration, and a multitude of areas where we clearly need \nbreakthroughs in research?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is it not also a fact that the bill which passed the \nHouse of Representatives which has been sitting on the calendar in the \nSenate, our calendar of business, for 1 full year while people are \nsuffering from these problems, is it not also true that in this bill, \nwe are very clear: no human cloning. That is not a part of this, \ncorrect?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It includes ethical guidelines which will not allow the \ncommercialization of these stem cells: you can't sell them, and you \ncannot direct them. You cannot say: The leftover embryonic stem cells \nfrom my wife and myself are going to go to my Uncle Charlie. You can't \ndo that. So we have established strict ethical guidelines of \ncommercialization, direction of the cells, no human cloning. Yet the \nbill has sat on the calendar for a year, despite the fact that the \nRepublican majority leader of the Senate has promised us for a year he \nwould call up the bill. For a year, people with these diseases have \nbeen waiting patiently.\n  Perhaps I can put my finger on the problem. I ask the Senator from \nIowa, would we have a better chance calling the embryonic stem cell \nissue to the floor if we made it a constitutional amendment? It appears \nthose are very popular. We just did two of those in the last few weeks.\n  If we could make this a constitutional amendment, would we have a \nbetter chance with the Republican majority?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, if I may interject one point: is the \nSenator also aware, as the question of the Senator from Illinois is \nreviewed, that if we weren't busy giving tax breaks to the very \nwealthiest among us, to people who don't need the tax breaks and often \ndon't even want them, we would have the funding necessary to do \nresearch on all kinds of things? The National Cancer Institute doesn't \nget the kind of money it deserves in terms of the positive effect it \ncould have on our lives and on the financial condition in this country. \nThe National Institutes of Health don't get the kind of funding they \nneed. We see someone like Warren Buffett stand up and say that he is \ngoing to give nearly $40 billion away. That shows you what happens if \nyou work hard in this country. It just shows you. But the \nadministration and the other side want to give Warren Buffett more \nmoney. They want to give him more than he has, when he's busy giving it \naway. They want to give more to Bill Gates, who also is one of our more \nennobling figures in this country. Is the Senator aware these are \nresources which could be used far better elsewhere?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am aware, I say to my friend from New \nJersey. In fact, under the President's budget this year, as we are now \ngiving more and more tax breaks to the wealthy, there is a cut in \nfunding for the National Cancer Institute. For the first time in my \ncareer, since I have been here, we are actually cutting funding under \nthe President's budget for the National Cancer Institute. Now, we here \nare going to try to put that money back in sometime this year, but I am \njust saying that the President's budget, what he sent to us, cuts money \nfrom the National Cancer Institute.\n  I say to my friend from Illinois, he is right on target. On August 9, \n2001, President Bush got on television, national television--I remember \nwatching him--and it was shortly after 9 p.m., and he made this \nexecutive finding that stem cells derived by our Federal researchers \nprior to 9 p.m. on August 9, 2001, were OK. We could use those for \nresearch. That was OK. That was ethical, moral, legitimate. But any \nstem cells derived after 9 p.m. on August 9 of 2001 were not ethical; \nthey were immoral, not legitimate, and could not be funded by the \nFederal Government.\n\n  I thought about that. I thought, why did he pick 9 p.m.? Why didn't \nhe pick 9:15? Why wasn't it 10 p.m.? Or 8:52? Why 9? It was just \nplucked out of thin air. It seems to me if it was wrong before, it was \nwrong after. Or if it was correct and good before, it was correct and \ngood after 9 p.m. It was totally arbitrary.\n  I say to my friend from Illinois, the other thing we found out is, \nout of these so-called 75 lines which supposedly we had--which we \nthought at the time we had enough--it is now down to 21 cell lines. And \nhere is the kicker: Every single one of those cell lines that were \nderived have been contaminated with mouse cells. They have been grown \non mouse feeder cells, so not one of them will probably ever be useful \nfor human therapy. Not a one of them.\n  The Senator from Illinois is absolutely correct. If it had not been \nfor President Bush's announcement on August 9, 2001, right after 9 \np.m.--if it had not been for that, we would have had 5 more years, that \nhave now gone by, of good science, good research under the ethical \nkinds of guidelines, as the Senator from Illinois just outlined. And we \nwould be much further down the road toward saying to those families \nwith diabetes, kids with juvenile diabetes,\n\n[[Page S6615]]\n\npeople who have ALS, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's--we would be \ncloser to saying hope is there because we are doing the research and we \nare going to find the cures. It will not happen unless and until we get \nover that Presidential proclamation of August 9, 2001.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, first, I want to say to our friend \nfrom Iowa how much we appreciate his diligence in promoting better \nhealth in this country, and more opportunities for all Americans. I \nthink, for instance, of his work on the Americans with Disabilities \nAct. Because of that bill, people who have a disability and weren't \nable to get around as easily as some others, now have access to so many \nmore places. We are so grateful to the Senator from Iowa for his work \non that landmark legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/28/senate-section/article/S6615-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 LIBYA\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today the Bush administration is \ntaking an action that is almost incomprehensible. Frankly, it is \noutrageous, when you think about it. The administration is removing \nLibya from the State Department's list of state sponsors of terror even \nthough Muammar Qadhafi has not fulfilled his commitments to the \nAmerican victims of Libyan terror. Even though Qadhafi is not keeping \nhis promise to Americans who lost loved ones when agents of his \ngovernment bombed Pan Am flight 103, the administration is going to \ngive Libya full diplomatic privileges.\n  The President is taking this action even though this Senate recently \npassed my resolution which said that diplomatic credentials should not \nbe given to Libya until Qadhafi provides all of the restitution \npromised to the families of the victims of the Pan Am Flight 103 \nbombing and other acts of terror supported by Libya. I know a lot of \nthose families, families from New Jersey and in the area generally, who \nlost loved ones on that flight. Many of the victims were young college \nstudents from Syracuse University. I have a nephew who went there. He \nwas to take that trip but at the last minute had to change his plans. \nHe lost several very good friends.\n  I have been to Lockerbie, Scotland, and know too well what happened \nthat fateful day when 270 people were killed, with the airplane and \nhuman remains falling onto that beautiful little community, Lockerbie, \nin Scotland. I have seen the remnants, the souvenirs that the victims \nhad bought on that trip that was during the Christmas period. I saw \nMickey Mouse hats and things that college kids enjoy. Even bottles of \nwine that survived were then put in a warehouse of things that were \ncollected on the ground but could not be assigned to any single family \nbecause they didn't have any sort of identification attached to them.\n  It was a sad moment for mankind, for sanity in our world. Libya \nultimately was convicted of providing the resources for those \nterrorists who brought that airplane down. Libya has not paid all of \nthe claims that were awarded to the families of the victims; Libya has \nnot paid the last installment of compensation due as a condition of \nbeing removed from the list of state sponsors of terror. That was the \nagreement. That was the understanding.\n  No matter how many years pass, these families will never forget their \nloss, their grief; neither will anyone who knows these families, who \nknows the pain visited upon these people when they heard that their son \nor daughter was killed in the downing of that airplane.\n  If Libya has indeed renounced terrorism, that is great news, as is \nthe fact that Libya, which was thought to be engaged in the development \nof weapons of mass destruction, has agreed to stop that pursuit. Still, \nthe Libyan government has an obligation it agreed to meet so that it \ncould rejoin the community of nations, to achieve a level of acceptance \naround the world. Their past behavior cannot be excused. They murdered \nAmericans and they must be held fully accountable.\n  Today, the Bush administration has rejected accountability for Libya. \nToday, the administration has put other interests ahead of the \ninterests of the American victims of terrorism. What are those \ninterests that prevailed in the end? We will let the investigative \njournals figure that one out.\n  But when leaders of our country say ``we must never forget the \nlessons'' of acts of terrorism, I think they should mean it. Libya \nshould fulfill its promise, its commitment to the families of the \nvictims of Pan Am 103 and not let that commitment be forgotten because \npart of it has been fulfilled but not all of it. We must not forget \nthat Libya has failed to comply entirely with the basic promise to \nthose families.\n  We urge the President and the administration to hold fast and insist \nthat Libya pay its bills. The money will never compensate these \nfamilies for the loss of their child, brother or sister, father or \nmother--never. But at least it shows that Libya is serious about \nhonoring it commitments, something that is essential before it can \nachieve anything approximating the status of nations that follow the \nrule of law. So we must insist on that.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/28/senate-section/article/S6615-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

PAULSON, JR., TO BE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Henry M. \nPaulson, Jr., of New York, to be Secretary of the Treasury.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I hope before the day is out that we are \nable to help a very good American citizen by the name of Henry Paulson \nto be the next Secretary of the Treasury. Mr. Paulson had his hearing \nyesterday. That was before the Finance Committee that I chair. He was \nreported out on a unanimous voice vote this very morning in the Finance \nCommittee.\n  Since the Treasury Secretary is the top economic policy official in \nthe administration, and the Treasury Department implements so many of \nour Nation's laws--be it tax, trade, or commerce--we have a tradition \nin the Senate of moving with all deliberate speed on nominations to \nfill that post.\n  That tradition has held no matter which party controlled the White \nHouse or the Congress. I have moved aggressively on this nomination, \nbut the timeline is consistent with past Treasury Secretary \nnominations.\n  Just as an example, everybody remembers Secretary Rubin in the \nClinton administration. That timeline is something like: The Senate \nreceives his nomination January 4, 1995. That was the first day of the \nsession that year. The official ethics-related paperwork was received \non January 5 of 1995. The Finance Committee staff expedited review of \nthe complicated financial details of Secretary Rubin, also a senior \nofficial at Goldman Sachs--Henry Paulson being the CEO of that same \nfirm. The Finance Committee held a hearing 5 days later, on January 10, \n1995. On that same day, the committee reported Secretary Rubin's \nnomination. On that same day, the full Senate confirmed Mr. Rubin, and \nhe was sworn in as Treasury Secretary.\n  So we are moving with a similarly aggressive schedule. I appreciate \nthe cooperation of Members on what I will acknowledge is relatively \nshort notice.\n\n[[Page S6616]]\n\nI thank the committee tax staff on both sides, especially the joint \ncommittee staffer Gray Fontenot, and the hard work that not only he \ndid, but a lot of others, and it took a lot of long hours to process \nthese papers over just a period of a few days prior to today.\n  My staff examined Mr. Paulson's complicated financial records, his \ntax return, and the activities of his firm, Goldman Sachs. We do this \nmost often in the area of tax planning. We have received very good \ncooperation. Then, of course, after the review, we have high confidence \nin his qualifications for this position.\n  Mr. Paulson brings to the table an enviable set of assets, meaning \nqualifications to do a good job as Secretary of the Treasury, although \nI presume he brings a lot of other assets to the table as well. Mr. \nPaulson spent a good amount of his youth--would you believe it--in the \ncornfields of Illinois. As a bright young man with excellent academic \ncredentials, he served in the Pentagon and in the White House.\n  After Government service, Mr. Paulson joined Goldman Sachs and rose \nthrough the ranks to the highest position of chief executive officer.\n  When you look at Mr. Paulson's story, you come away with a view that \nthis is a guy who gets the best results at whatever he tackles, and \nthat is just the sort of a person we need as Secretary of the Treasury \nbecause we have a very good economy, measured by long-term standard \nmeasures of the economy--creating 5.3 million jobs in the last less \nthan 3 years, having 4.6 percent unemployment, having growth on average \nthat we had during the 1990s; lots of measurements of the economy that \nare very good.\n\n  I am not picking out things that are never used to measure the \neconomy. I am talking about things that have been used to measure the \neconomy over the last 60 or 70 years. Those measurements say it is \ngood. But if we don't have the right people setting the right policy \nfor carrying out those policies that Congress might set, it could be in \njeopardy.\n  That is why we need a person of Paulson's background--a person who \ncomes out on the right end of almost everything he tackles--to be the \nchief economic voice for our country and to be the voice for this \nadministration. But his work is the administration's work, his work is \nthe country's work, and I think he is up to doing the country's work.\n  The impression I have and gave you about Mr. Paulson is reinforced \nwhen you have a personal meeting with him. I think it is fair to say \nthat after yesterday's hearing, Members on both sides of the aisle came \naway very impressed with Mr. Paulson as a thoughtful and intelligent \nnominee who appreciates the concerns raised by Senators and will work \nwith Senators on trying to solve those concerns.\n  I will touch briefly on one matter that came up at the hearing, and \nwhich I know is of concern to some Members. It is well known that Mr. \nPaulson is active in environmental issues. He is an avid bird watcher \nand is chairman of the board of the Nature Conservancy. I share the \nworry that Mr. Paulson knows his job is to be Secretary of the Treasury \nand not head of EPA. Mr. Paulson's response on this concern to about \nthree of us on the committee who brought this up was this. He said:\n\n       The President of the United States has nominated me to be \n     Secretary of the Treasury, he hasn't nominated me to be \n     Secretary of Interior, he hasn't nominated me to be head of \n     the Environmental Protection Agency, that really big focus I \n     have is going to be dealing with so many of the issues that \n     we've been talking about today, the economic issues that are \n     the core of our agenda . . .\n\n  Considering his sincerity--and I don't think he is a person capable \nof misleading--I think he is very transparent. I came away with the \nconfidence that Mr. Paulson knows where his focus needs to be and where \nhis responsibilities lie.\n  I did kid him the other day. There is a superintendent of that \nbuilding you call the Treasury Department down there that is trying to \nget his favor. So they are probably right now building a bird-watching \nstation for him outside of the Treasury building someplace because he \nis known very much for that.\n  But I think he is going to tend to business and not get over into \nother areas of the Government.\n  I also note that Mr. Paulson is here at just the right time. He is \nhere to deal with tax reform, China currency, and with other major \neconomic issues facing America.\n  I am pleased that Mr. Paulson has answered the call to return to \npublic service.\n  I encourage Members to vote in favor of a highly qualified nominee to \nbe Secretary of the Treasury.\n  For the public at large that does not quite follow everything every \nday in Washington, DC, I hope you understand that there are some people \nin America who are willing to give up the multimillion dollar salaries \nas CEOs of Wall Street firms to serve the public good, to serve as \nSecretary of the Treasury and a lot of other positions in Government \nand make less than $200,000 a year compared to the tens of millions of \ndollars that they make. Most people who like to make big money like to \nkeep on making big money. But there are some people, such as Mr. \nPaulson, who are willing to serve the American public, to do what is \nright for our country and do it willingly and selfishly.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for a very good citizen, a person who I \nbelieve will be a very good Secretary of the Treasury.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend, Chairman Chuck \nGrassley, for the way in which he has moved this nomination. It is the \nright thing to do. I commend him for it.\n  Mr. President, I also support Hank Paulson, this administration's \nnominee for Secretary of the Treasury.\n  Throughout its history, the Department of the Treasury has required \nenormous innovation, vision, and perseverance. Our Nation's first \nTreasury Secretary, Alexander Hamilton, laid the foundation principles \nof America's public economy, its credit, its industrial development, \nand commercial activity.\n  In 1790, Hamilton presented to Congress his plan for public credit, \nassuming the States' war debts, implementing import duties and excise \ntaxes to repay these debts, and establishing a national bank. The next \nyear, he laid out a plan for an American manufacturing economy, so far \nahead of its time that it resonated well into the 20th century.\n  Henry Morgenthau Jr. steered the Treasury for over a decade in peace \nand in wartime. He defended the dollar against speculation through the \n1930s, financed the war effort with war bonds, and ushered in a new \nsystem of international financial stability after the Second World War.\n  Secretary James Baker embraced new challenges, including the Latin \nAmerican banking crisis and the Plaza Accords.\n  The Asian financial turmoil of the 1990s met the able and wise \nleadership of Secretaries Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers. They \nsteered the world economy through crises. And they managed our \neconomy's remarkable growth and return to fiscal discipline.\n  Today, leadership and vision are as imperative as during our Nation's \nfounding and in the two centuries since. The challenges are different. \nThe world economy is more complex. China and India are economic powers \non the rise. Speculative investments have grown. Twelve European \nnations are bound by a common currency. Financial markets are deeper, \nmore liquid, and more integrated than ever before. But global economic \ngrowth and international trade are fundamentally out of balance.\n  Faced with these challenges, I welcome this administration's \nnomination of Henry Paulson to become Secretary of the Treasury. I have \nknown Hank for many years. I believe that he is an outstanding choice \nfor this demanding position. Hank has demonstrated his knowledge of \nfinancial markets and helped guide them through three decades of \ntransformation. He rose to the helm of Goldman Sachs with our former \ncolleague Governor Jon Corzine, and as sole CEO, presided over some of \nthe most successful years of that company.\n  Hank is broadly respected by his colleagues. He has earned a \nreputation as a man of boundless energy and a relentless work ethic. \nHank proved himself an innovative and prescient thinker, able to \nconsider economic and financial challenges before they are upon\n\n[[Page S6617]]\n\nus. Today he has nobly answered the call to public service. And he will \nbring much-needed credibility to our economic message to hard-working \nAmericans, and to the world.\n  Hank Paulson understands that our economy's strength is rooted in the \nentrepreneurial spirit and the competitive zeal of the American people. \nHe understands just as well that our strength is not a given. That we \ncannot take our economic preeminence for granted. In the Rose Garden \nlast week, he rightly declared that ``We must take steps to maintain \nour competitive edge in the world.''\n  I welcome Hank's determination to take steps to boost our economic \ncompetitiveness. I am convinced that economic competitiveness is one of \nthe greatest challenges facing this administration, this Congress, and \nour Nation.\n  The competitiveness challenge comes from a rising China. China has \ntripled its share of global trade in 4 years. China has become the \nworld's top information technology exporter. And China has drawn much \nof the world's investment.\n  The challenge comes from India. India's IT sector has grown 50 \npercent a year since 1993. India's universities are top-notch. And \nIndia's research capabilities attract billions of dollars in \ninvestment.\n  The challenge comes from countless smaller economic dynamos in Asia \nand Europe. These emerging markets have transformed their economies to \nembrace globalization.\n  Yet our competitiveness challenge also comes from within. America too \noften looks back at what we have achieved. Rather, we should prepare \nfor tomorrow's challenge.\n  Our broadband infrastructure ranks 16th in the world. Our research \nand development spending ranks behind Sweden, Finland, Israel, Japan, \nand South Korea. Three out of 10 Americans do not graduate high school. \nOne-quarter of Americans read below basic levels. And our national \nsavings are negative.\n  These challenges are at our doorstep. We must act. That is why I urge \nTreasury Secretary Paulson, once confirmed, to lead this \nadministration's engagement with Congress on economic competitiveness. \nAs I have said in several dozen statements on competitiveness over the \npast months, we can wait no longer to implement a real competitiveness \nagenda. We in Congress are ready.\n  I have spent much of the past year developing a comprehensive \neconomic competitiveness agenda. This agenda focuses on education as \nthe foundation of a successful economy.\n  In the coming weeks I will introduce legislation that would provide \nscholarships and create tax incentives for early education, science, \nmath, and engineering teachers. It would provide matching funds to \noffer universal early education, lower barriers to higher education, \nand double the number of advanced placement courses in our high \nschools. My education competitiveness legislation would support \nafterschool and mentoring programs. It would restore our commitment to \nNative American education. It would direct grants to outstanding young \nscientists. And it would encourage companies to get involved in making \nour schools the world's finest.\n  Upon this foundation of education must stand strong pillars of a \ncompetitive economy. One such pillar is energy, which fuels a \nsuccessful economy. My energy competitiveness legislation would look to \nthe future. It would create the new Advanced Research Projects Agency--\nEnergy to conduct transformative research and create alternative energy \nsolutions. While this research would look for tomorrow's energy \nalternative, my legislation would also encourage today's alternative \nenergies, like coal gasification technology, wind, and other \nalternative fuels.\n  A second pillar of my agenda is the Research Competitiveness Act, \nwhich boosts what America does best--innovate. My legislation would \nsimplify and make permanent the research and experimentation tax credit \nfor innovators looking for tomorrow's next big thing. My legislation \nwould provide access to start-up capital for small, research-intensive \nbusinesses. And my legislation would encourage support of basic \nuniversity research.\n  The trade competitiveness initiative is the third pillar of my \nagenda. Trade is vital to American ranchers, farmers, and businessmen. \nBut they must have a level global playing field.\n  Legislation I have introduced would create a Senate-confirmed trade \nenforcement official who would be dedicated to guaranteeing that our \ntrading partners play by the rules. It would also give the Treasury \nDepartment the tools to keep countries from unfairly manipulating their \ncurrencies to keep their exports cheap.\n  A fourth pillar of my agenda is the Savings Competitiveness Act. It \nwould underscore savings as critical to households and vital to a \nhealthy economy. It would make the Saver's Credit into a refundable \nmatching credit. It would make enrollment in 401(k) plans automatic. It \nwould offer savings plans for small business employees. And it would \ncreate Young Saver's Accounts for parents' contributions to their \nchildren's savings.\n  Friends warned Alexander Hamilton against accepting a position as \nTreasury Secretary. They said the position was too difficult, too \ncontroversial. He replied simply: It is the situation in which I can do \nthe most good.\n  I believe Hank Paulson can also do much good. I hope my colleagues \nwill join me in welcoming this nomination. I hope we can work together \nto implement a comprehensive agenda to improve America's economic \ncompetitiveness.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I commend Chairman Grassley and Senator \nBaucus for moving quickly to have the Senate consider the nomination of \nHenry Paulson. I am convinced he is the right man at the right time. It \nis my intent to strongly support his nomination and vote for him later \nin the course of this afternoon.\n  My hope, in particular, as Henry Paulson moves to this vital \nposition, is that he will move quickly to set in place a strategy for \nreforming our Tax Code. Suffice it to say, a lot has happened to our \ntax system since 1986, the last time the Tax Code was overhauled.\n  For example, since 1986, there have been more than 14,000 changes to \nthe Tax Code. It comes to three changes for every working day for the \nlast 20 years.\n  There are substantial questions with respect to fairness in the Tax \nCode. I am one who feels it is critically important that every American \nhave the chance to build and accumulate wealth. That is pretty hard to \ndo, given some of this country's tax policies.\n  For example, this spring, Warren Buffett, who is the second \nwealthiest person in the United States, told me he was going to be \npaying a lower tax rate than his receptionist. That is not right. I am \nnot interested in soaking anybody. I am not interested in any kind of \nclass warfare. But I want middle-class people to be able to get ahead \nas well.\n  For the first time in decades, we have seen corporate profits go up. \nWe are glad to see that. We have seen productivity go up. We are glad \nto see that. But middle-class people are not seeing much growth in \ntheir wages. They are living paycheck to paycheck.\n  As Hank Paulson goes to the Treasury Department, I know he is \ninterested in coming up with a fresh approach to the Tax Code, an \napproach that can allow us to simplify it, get a fair shake for middle-\nclass folks and all Americans. I particularly commend our ranking \nminority member, Senator Baucus, because I think Senator Baucus, in \ntalking about global competitiveness and what it is going to take to \ncreate high-skill, high-wage jobs for Americans in the global economy, \nhas done some of the heavy lifting on this key issue by spending a lot \nof time over the last few years looking at these issues, talking to \npeople on both sides of the aisle, with business leaders and the like. \nI commend Senator Baucus because he has laid some of the key groundwork \nto discuss tax reform as a result of his focus on global \ncompetitiveness.\n  I also thank Chairman Grassley for his discussions with me and with \nthe committee. We have begun to look at corporate issues in this area. \nSenator Grassley, as he begins the effort to look at tax reform, \nparticularly because of the bipartisan way in which he has led our \ncommittee, is a person ideally suited to work with Senators\n\n[[Page S6618]]\n\non both sides of the aisle and the administration, for us to build a \nstrategy with a new Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Paulson, to get this \njob done.\n  Suffice it to say there will be some very tough issues. Look, for \nexample, at the issue of State and local jurisdictions and the \ndiffering tax treatment we have for these jurisdictions. A State that \nmay have high taxes, such as New York, looks at this differently than a \npart of the country that does not have the same dependence on revenues \nfrom that source.\n  With the leadership of Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus and a new \nSecretary of the Treasury who is going to look to bring people \ntogether, look at how we can modernize the Tax Code so we can make the \nkind of decisions that are necessary to give our citizens a better \nquality of life in a global economy. We are up to it.\n  We do not have a lot of time. The next 6 months, particularly the \ntime between now and January, is key. That is why I have been so \npleased Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus have been interested in \nlooking at these issues. As a result of their examination of these \ntopics, we can lay the groundwork so the administration next January \ncould work with Senators on both sides of the aisle, work with the \nother body and work with the Senate, and we can enact comprehensive tax \nreform.\n  There will be a host of other issues we will have to look at. \nObviously, health care, the fastest rising expense in the American \neconomy, is dramatically affected by the Tax Code. I happen to think \nthere are some good ideas on both sides of the aisle with respect to \ntax treatment of health care expenditures in our economy. We are \nspending over $150 billion through the Tax Code on American health \ncare. I don't think we are getting our money's worth. In too many \ninstances, we are subsidizing inefficiency. This is certainly going to \nbe a controversial area.\n  Democrats and Republicans, under the leadership of Chairman Grassley \nand Senator Baucus, and the new Secretary of the Treasury can dig into \nthat issue.\n  The last point I mention, in the Commission that was set up that was \nchaired by Senator Mack and Senator Breaux, there are some good ideas \nthe Congress can pick up on, working with the administration. \nCertainly, I don't agree with all the Commission has proposed, but let \nme give a couple of examples.\n\n  In legislation I have authored, the Fair Flat Tax Act, I have made it \nclear I want a Tax Code that is simpler, fairer and flatter. If you \nlook at what the President's Commission has come in with, there is some \nopportunity for common ground. For example, in my Fair Flat Tax Act, \nthere is a 1-page 1040 form, something a typical person can fill out in \nabout half an hour. The administration's version, the one that came out \nwith the advisory committee, is probably six, seven lines longer. I \nhave a 30-line, 1040 form; theirs is six or seven lines longer. Big \ndeal. For purposes of Government work, we can find common ground in a \nhurry in order to have a simpler Tax Code. That alone would be a real \ncontribution for the American people.\n  On the question of making the Tax Code flatter, there are six \nbrackets today in our Tax Code as it relates to the individual side of \nthe code. My proposal involves three brackets. It is a progressive \nstructure. Essentially, it is the same one that Ronald Reagan started \nwith when he looked at tax reform. The President's advisory commission \ncomes in with four brackets. Once again, big deal. We can find common \nground as it relates to making the Tax Code flatter.\n  There are differences of opinion, certainly, in other areas. I have \nmentioned trying to get a fair shake for middle-class folks. We all \nunderstand what Henry Ford said about capitalism. Henry Ford was an \nindustrialist. He said he wanted to do well, but for him to do well, \nhis people had to have enough money to be able to buy cars.\n  Middle-class folks are getting hammered in a way today that makes it \nhard for them to make a lot of these purchases that are essential to \nthem, which is why they wrack up so much debt. I think both political \nparties can find common ground on this tax issue.\n  For example, Henry Paulson yesterday talked about the value of low \nrates. I certainly agree with his interest there. Marginal rates are \nparticularly important. It was something Ronald Reagan recognized in \n1986. Senators on our side of the aisle, including Bill Bradley, said \nexactly the same thing. We can get the rates down. We can ensure \nfairness for middle-class folks.\n  What we are going to need is leadership. We are going to need it in a \nhurry. Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus are going to do everything \nthey can to find common ground on this issue. I am very pleased that \nHenry Paulson, who could certainly find other things to do in his life \nbesides public service, is willing to step up and take on this effort. \nHe will have to move very quickly to drive this tax reform debate. As I \npledged to him in my private meeting and said again yesterday, I am \ninterested in working with him and the administration in a bipartisan \nway. There is a lot of good faith and a lot of interest in this issue. \nIt is a key consideration in how we are going to create high-skill, \nhigh-wage jobs for Americans in the future and enhance the quality of \nlife for middle-class folks.\n  Henry Paulson is the right person at the right time. He is going to \nhave a lot to do, and he is going to have to do it in a hurry. I intend \nto work with Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus to ensure we have an \nopportunity, on a bipartisan basis, to tackle these big economic issues \nin the right way. Right at the top is tax reform.\n  I urge colleagues today to indicate their strong support for Henry \nPaulson, head of the Treasury Department.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of Henry \nM. Paulson to be Secretary of the Treasury. If confirmed by the Senate, \nhe would be the Nation's 74th Secretary of the Treasury.\n  From what I know about him from reputation, from his work on Wall \nStreet, and from what I have learned in my discussions with him, I \nbelieve Hank Paulson will bring a kind of strong leadership, unique \nexpertise, and knowledge of global financial markets and will be fully \ncapable of keeping our country competitive in a global economy.\n  Mr. Paulson is a strong choice for Treasury Secretary for many \nreasons. Most people know of his talents, the intimate knowledge he has \nof the financial markets, and his ability to handle crises. He is \nconsidered a hard worker who is dedicated to his job and who \nunderstands the importance of strong and capable management to run a \nlarge organization.\n  Today I spoke about the SWIFT program, the very important Treasury \nterrorism finance tracking measure that was regrettably blown by the \nnewspapers last week. When I talked to him, he obviously did not know \nabout it. I did not know it was going to become an item of news. But as \nhe seeks to repair our relations with banks across the world, his \nexperience in dealing with international financial matters will be a \ngreat benefit.\n  He has a string of very important challenges facing him. We have the \ndeficit, which is running out of control by reason of unsustainable \nentitlement spending. The value of the dollar is falling. How much of a \nproblem is that? How do we deal with it? There is a tax gap in the IRS \nof roughly 15 percent of the money that is owed or some $345 billion \nthat is not collected. He needs to work through the IRS to cure that. \nWe have a Tax Code that is so complicated, even professional tax \npreparers disagree on what the implications of many normal transactions \nare. He will have to fight terrorism financing. He is going to have to \nconfront the issues of dealing with rogue nations such as Iran, and \nothers, through economic sanctions and getting others in the world \ncommunity to join with him.\n  As of yesterday, as the chairman of the appropriations subcommittee \nthat handles the Treasury, IRS, and other agencies, I have found that \nthey have\n\n[[Page S6619]]\n\nwater in their basement and they have extremely mundane problems like \nthat, to the global issues that face any Treasury Secretary. I think \neven the media understands that this is a man who has experience and \nwhose is held in high respect by major world financial leaders, as well \nas American financial leaders, and he will serve us well.\n  As chairman of the Transportation, Treasury, the Judiciary, HUD, and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, and as a member of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee, I look forward to working with Mr. \nPaulson in meeting these challenges.\n  Even though he is a sophisticated Wall Street financier, I was \npleased to find out that he is basically a Midwest farm boy at heart. \nWe had a very useful and productive discussion about growing native \ngrasses such as big and little blue stem and Indian grass and how to \nburn them in the spring to make sure the crops come back without weeds \nor other non-natives. So he has a strong foot in reality, a Midwest \nfarming background, but he also has a very strong background and \nexpertise in financial matters, and he has respect on Wall Street.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the nomination of Hank Paulson. This \nis a time when we have many serious issues, and having him confirmed by \nthis body will be a great asset to us in dealing with everything from \ninternational negotiations, terrorism financing, and the other \nsignificant economic challenges the world presents today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, as we consider the nomination of Henry \nPaulson to be Secretary of the Treasury, I think it is important to \nbring a reality check to some of the claims about the current state of \nthe economy--those claims made by the administration.\n  My colleague, Senator Bennett, pointed out that yesterday we had a \nhearing in the Joint Economic Committee, and appearing as a witness was \nEdward Lazear, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. We had \nalso two outside experts who were economists testifying on the state of \nthe economy. Many of the Bush supporters are claiming that the economy \nis strong and everyone is benefiting, but I doubt that many working \nAmericans would see it as strong as they do and see it as benefiting \nthem as much as it is claimed by the administration.\n  It is true that the economy is experiencing a business cycle recovery \nafter the 2001 recession and after going through the most prolonged job \nslump since the 1930s. The President pointed out that the economy has \ndone better since 2003 than it did in 2001 and 2002, but they don't \ntalk about how this recovery has not been particularly strong by the \nstandards of previous recoveries.\n  This first chart shows the percentage change in payroll employment. \nThe curve here is the average of seven previous recession recovery \ncycles. If you look back, historically, it is a much more robust \nincrease over time than this lower line, which is the March 2001 to May \n2006 statistics, the recovery in the last several years. In fact, this \nrecovery is much less than the recovery was after the 1990 \nrecession. That recovery was called the ``jobless recovery'' because \njob generation was so slow.\n\n  So what you are seeing is that job losses continued for much longer \nin this period of time, 2001 to 2006, than had been typical. This \nrecovery has been much weaker than those in the past. At this point in \nthe recovery, from the 1990 to 1991 recession, the economy had created \n5 million jobs.\n  That is this delta right here--5 million more jobs than have been \ncreated in this recovery. So the difference between job generation at \nthe same point in March 2001 to 2006, and comparing it to the 1990s, is \nplus 5 million jobs.\n  This situation is similar with respect to business investment. It \ntook much longer for the recovery to start with respect to business \ninvestment, and the level of investment lagged behind what has been \ntypical in past recoveries. Each year of depressed investment means \nless capacity to produce goods and services in the future.\n  Defenders of the President's economic record cannot deny that \nworkers' wages have not been keeping up with inflation. Part of that is \na result of many factors but, one, looking back at the investment, it \nhas been a relatively small recovery in terms of business investment. \nHere is the average of seven previous recoveries and here is the 1991 \nrecovery business investment and here is the current recovery. It is \nnot as robust as it has been in previous recoveries.\n  As I suggested a moment ago, there is another very palpable impact of \nthis bad economic news, and that is that wages have not been keeping up \nwith inflation. This will be, no doubt, no surprise to working families \nas they work to get their paychecks each week. Some have suggested that \nthis is a result of the fact that wages are held down but benefits are \ngrowing, and that compensation is growing at historic rates. This is \nnot the case.\n  This is a chart that shows productivity, the output per hour, and \nreal compensation per hour. What you generally see is that productivity \nincreases will be closely tracking compensation increases except over \nthe last several years where productivity is going up at a significant \npace, but real compensation, wages plus benefits, is lagging far \nbehind. This is what the average American is confronting today when \nthey are looking at increased gasoline prices, soaring health care \nprices, and they are not seeing either in their paycheck or, in many \ncases, even benefit packages the same kinds of increases that are so \nnecessary to keep up with an increase in inflation. Growth in \ncompensation has lagged behind. Wages have grown more slowly than total \ncompensation, but that is not because workers are negotiating better \ndeals from their employers, it is because employers are facing higher \ncosts for health insurance and are squeezing workers' wages as a \nresult.\n  Increased health care prices, particularly in the area of small \nbusiness, is causing many businesses to forego increases they would \nlike to give to workers, in terms of wages, just to keep up with \nincreased health care costs. This doesn't mean a better health care \npackage for workers, and in some cases workers are being dropped, \nunfortunately, from health care protection because of the expense.\n  What we are seeing is that compensation is not keeping up with \nproductivity and, typically, compensation does keep up with \nproductivity. There is another issue, too, with respect to the \nsituation for many American workers, and that is the fact that pension \narrears have to be made up. Many companies now are putting money into \npensions just to make them actuarially sound, where in the past they \nmight have devoted that to wages. By and large, the situation, when it \nlooks at the working men and women, is that we are not seeing the \nrobust increases in wages or compensation that is important.\n  These points were made by one of the witnesses yesterday at the JEC \nhearing, chief economist of the Bank of America, Dr. Mickey Levy, who \ntestified that:\n\n       Wage and compensation increases have been somewhat \n     disappointing. Real wages have been suppressed by higher \n     energy costs and have not kept pace with labor productivity \n     gains. . . .Wages may be constrained by higher employer costs \n     for workers' health care, along with the heightened \n     international competition related to low cost production \n     overseas. . . .\n\n  Wage and compensation increases have indeed been disappointing, \nespecially for the majority of workers who are not getting them. Gains \nin average earnings or income do not tell the real story when they hide \ngrowing inequality. When you look at one level, you see increases, but \nwhen you look at how the increases are distributed across the working \npopulation, it is another story altogether.\n  The red bars on this chart show that workers in the middle and bottom \nhave experienced a decline in real earnings, while those at the top \nhave experienced gains. This is in sharp contrast to the experience of \nthe time from 1995 to 2000. Here in blue, in the data for gains in \nterms of earnings, broken down by the lowest 10th percentile, 25th, \nmedian, 75th, and 90th, at the upper level in the 1990s you saw \nincreases, but they were almost comparable at the very lowest level of \nincome. You saw the proverbial picket fence, where there were positive \ngains at every percentile. What we are seeing today is quite the \nreverse of that--losses in real terms of earnings at the lowest levels \nthrough\n\n[[Page S6620]]\n\nthe middle levels, and only at the upper income levels are you seeing \nreal gains in earnings.\n\n  So the distribution of the economic progress that is being made over \nthe last several years is not being shared fairly. Those at the upper \nincome levels are seeing gains but, frankly, not the same robust gains \nof the nineties. At the bottom-income and middle-income level, there is \na loss in real earnings.\n  That is not an example of an economy that is working for all \nAmericans. That is an economy that is working for the very affluent \nAmericans. The answer of the Bush administration to these economic \ntrends is basically to ignore them, try to gloss over them or redefine \nthem or explain them away. They proposed tax cuts, which will do very \nlittle to help this distribution of earnings. In fact, what it does, \nessentially, is protect more of the earnings at the upper income \nlevels. If we continue along the present course, we will be undermining \nthe economy's longrun capacity for growth and undermining future living \nstandards.\n  Another aspect here, too, that is not dwelt upon by the \nadministration is the fact that we are virtually zero in national \nsavings. Without national savings, there is not the pool of investment \ncapital necessary to provide for the new technology, new capital of the \nfuture. We are borrowing huge amounts of money overseas to fund our \ndeficit. This is investments made in our country. But in terms of \nnational savings of this country, it is close to zero. In some cases, \nit is negative.\n  These are the real problems that confront this country. These are the \nreal questions that Mr. Paulson has to address. How do we create an \neconomy that performs as well as it did in the 1990s, where earnings \ngains are shared virtually equally across the spectrum of income, where \nlow-income Americans don't see a loss of earnings but actually a gain? \nHow do we ensure that wages and compensation keep up with productivity \ngains? How do we ensure essentially and fundamentally that the working \nfamilies in this country cannot only get by but get ahead? That is the \nquestion that Mr. Paulson has to answer as Secretary of the Treasury.\n  I think it begins with looking hard at the deficit and the policies \nof the administration with respect to taxes. I don't subscribe to the \ntheory that our deficit is caused by runaway entitlement programs. We \nhave an issue with entitlement programs, but we also have an issue with \ntax programs that take away revenue and are targeted to the wealthiest \nAmericans. We have problems with expenditures that we cannot avoid with \nrespect to supporting our forces in the field. We cannot stop providing \nequipment and materiel for our forces fighting the wars today, and we \nhave to take care of them in the future. But there are significant \nissues with which we have to deal. I hope Mr. Paulson will be a strong \nvoice in this administration to look at the facts and propose realistic \nsolutions that benefit not just the few who are wealthy but the vast \nmajority of Americans.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Rhode Island. \nSenator Jack Reed is our voice on the Joint Economic Committee. It is a \ncommittee that takes a look at the overall economy and reports to our \ncaucus regularly. Senator Reed has brought us economic indicators from \ntime to time that give us at least some insight as to how we are doing \nin most general terms in America.\n  Everybody measures the economy by their own lives, their own family, \nmaybe their own town, but when it comes to the appointment of a \nSecretary of the Treasury, we take a step back and look at the overall \neconomy in America.\n  A good Secretary of the Treasury can make a big difference. When Bob \nRubin became Secretary of the Treasury under President Bill Clinton, he \nfaced enormous challenges with huge deficits as far as the eye could \nsee and an economy moving ever so slowly. He put in place those \npolicies on an economic, fiscal, and monetary basis that made a big \ndifference.\n  Our Nation went from a deficit in our budget to a surplus. We \nactually put the indebtedness behind us for the first time in decades. \nThe good news is we did it while the wealth of America was expanding \ndramatically. That period during the Clinton years saw people with \ntheir own savings accounts growing, more pension plans expanding, folks \nbuying homes and starting businesses. It was a time of great economic \nexpansion.\n  No one person deserves the credit or the blame for our economy, but \nSecretary of the Treasury Bob Rubin was the right person at the right \ntime to speak sense to the President about what needed to be done to \nmake America strong for years to come. I have the same confidence that \nHenry Paulson is going to do that as well, and we need him now more \nthan ever.\n  I come to this with some prejudice because Mr. Paulson is a son of \nIllinois. He still calls Illinois his home. He spent his adult years--\nat least recently--commuting back and forth between Illinois and New \nYork and places around the world in his capacity as an investment \nbanker.\n  We had a terrific meeting in my office a week or two ago and talked \nabout his life in Illinois, the experiences he had, about his family, \nand his commitment to our State. I readily concede I come to this \nnomination with some bias. But I think Mr. Henry Paulson is the right \nman for the job of Secretary of the Treasury at this moment in history.\n  He came up through the ranks of Goldman Sachs, starting in their \nChicago office many years ago and eventually becoming the CEO of that \nimportant investment bank. I don't think a person can rise to that high \nlevel without understanding how business works and how the economy \nworks. Since even a corner grocer knows that an organization cannot run \nup endless debt forever without paying a stiff price, I think Mr. \nPaulson understands that as well. I think his business experience may \nhelp to start balancing the books in the Washington, DC, situation, \nwhich has been far from balanced for a long time. It is not a moment \ntoo soon for someone with Mr. Paulson's business background to tackle \nthis challenge.\n  Consider these realities Mr. Paulson will face when he becomes \nSecretary of the Treasury:\n  This Bush-Cheney administration has accumulated more foreign-held \ndebt in the past 6 years they have been in office than all of the 42 \nPresidents before President George W. Bush. In other words, our \nindebtedness to foreign governments, such as Japan, China, Korea, and \nthe OPEC nations, that, in fact, bankroll the debt of America, hold \nAmerica's mortgage, has grown in dramatic terms over the last 6 years.\n  That is not the policy President Bush inherited from the Clinton \nadministration, which was generating a surplus. It is an approach he \nhas taken which, sadly, has left us deeply in debt. The Bush \nadministration came to office with a national debt of less than $6 \ntrillion--$6 trillion--and in just a 6-year period of time, it is \nalmost $9 trillion, almost a 50-percent increase in America's mortgage, \nAmerica's national debt in the short 6-year period of time.\n  During this period, all but for a few months, the President has had a \nCongress of his own political party. The Republicans have controlled \nthe House and the Senate, and the President has yet to veto the first \nspending bill in the time he has served as President. Not once has he \nsaid ``no'' to a spending bill that has come from Congress, \nparticularly from his Republican Congress, and in the meantime his tax \npolicies and spending policies have driven us into the highest level of \nnational debt in the history of the United States. Our indebtedness is \nheld by mortgagers such as China and Japan who expect in return to have \na piece of the American economy.\n  Secretary of Treasury Paulson will, I am sure, understand this, that \nas we become more indebted to these foreign nations, it is no wonder \nthey take a claim on our economy. Why did we have to debate a Dubai \nPorts deal? Because Dubai happened to hold enough American dollars to \nhave clout in our economy, and that is the reality.\n\n  As these foreign entities become more powerful in our economy, \nsucking good-paying jobs out of the United States, it is a serious \nchallenge for any new Secretary of the Treasury.\n  The President has called for more tax cuts, which means deeper \ndeficits,\n\n[[Page S6621]]\n\nmore debt. It is estimated now that the indebtedness of the United \nStates is a burden on every single man, woman, and child in America to \nthe tune of $30,000 and growing. So in addition to a home mortgage and \na student loan, we are unfortunately the victims of policies in \nWashington that increase the indebtedness of future generations.\n  This has to stop. This is a disaster in the making. We have to \nbalance the books and do it quickly. I hope Mr. Paulson has the vision \nand the strength to convey that message effectively within this \nadministration.\n  I hope he will take a very close look at our trade policies as well. \nMy colleague, Senator Schumer, will speak after I finish. He has been \none of the leaders in the Senate talking about the inequities in our \ntrade policy with China.\n  I believe globalization is as inevitable as gravity. We know we are \nin a shrinking planet. We do more business with one another than ever \nbefore. But when we enter into trade agreements with countries such as \nChina, we say we are establishing rules of conduct, fair trade. \nUnfortunately, particularly in the case of China, many countries ignore \nthose rules. They violate those rules.\n  The Secretary of the Treasury has to be a strong voice to stand up \nfor the American economy, American businesses, and American workers to \ndemand that the countries with which we trade play by the rules. I \nthink free trade is good for the future of our world, certainly good \nfor the future of America. We are a land of opportunity. We have risen \nto every challenge, but we need to be involved in a fair fight where \nboth sides play by the rules.\n  The Bush administration has not fought hard enough for these trade \nagreements and understandings. When we create a trade agreement, we \nneed to ensure that there are proper labor protections in place. We are \nabout to consider a trade agreement with Oman, a very small country in \nthe Middle East. There are good reasons for us to enter into that trade \nagreement. But when Members of the Senate suggested to the Bush \nadministration that we put a prohibition in the trade agreement with \nOman that they could not use slave labor--slave labor--to produce goods \nand services sold to the United States, the administration said: No, we \nare going to remove that, we don't think we should go that far.\n  Slave labor? We should have basic understandings of what the labor \nstandards will be. We know many countries will underbid us when it \ncomes to the cost of labor, but there ought to be fundamental \nstandards.\n  The same is true when it comes to environmental protections. U.S. \nbusinesses operate under laws which restrict them in terms of their \nconduct, whether it is a burden or some sort of a problem with our \nenvironment, whether it is water pollution or air pollution or similar \nthings. What we should insist on for the good of this planet we call \nhome is that the countries engaged in trade with the United States also \nhave respect for the environment of the world. Whether it is global \nwarming or toxic release, we are literally all in this together.\n  After we create these good trade agreements, the Secretary of the \nTreasury has to make sure there is proper enforcement so we don't just \ngive our speeches on the Senate floor and then ignore the trade \nagreement afterward.\n  I hope Mr. Paulson will fight harder than his predecessors to promote \ntrade that is aggressive and fair. I also hope he will push for a \ntougher and more proactive stance when it comes to China. I am sure my \ncolleague will speak to that further.\n  He has traveled to China more than 70 times. He understands the \nimportance of this critical relationship with this growing giant in the \nworld economy. When we spoke in my office, I asked him specifically to \ndeal with currency manipulation, intellectual property rights \ninfringement, and trade violations.\n  He also has to be very strong when it comes to China's labor records \nand their record on the environment and human rights. While he did not \nhave any specific suggestions--I didn't expect them--I believe he was \nresponsive, he understands the challenge, and I think he can rise to \nthat challenge. That is why I am supporting his nomination.\n  Finally, I hope Mr. Paulson's sensibility about the environment will \nbecome a source of real leadership in this administration. I know Mr. \nPaulson reiterated at his confirmation hearing that he is not running \nto be head of the EPA or Interior but Secretary of the Treasury. Still, \nHenry Paulson is a former chairman of the board of the Nature \nConservancy. That is a group with which I have worked in Illinois that \nhas great respect for our natural resources and has done a lot to \nreclaim them for future generations.\n  I hope he can push the Bush administration to take a forward look at \nthe issue of global warming. This is an issue which is real, and this \nadministration must start immediately working with Congress to move on \ninternational agreements that deal with global warming. Mr. Paulson's \nvoice at the Cabinet table could make a difference, and I am hoping \nthat his deeply held personal beliefs will lead him to be that voice.\n  I support the nomination of Hank Paulson to become Secretary of the \nTreasury. I think he will work as hard for farmers in the heartland as \nhe does for bankers in New York. I look forward to working with him to \nstrengthen America's economy and put the Federal Government's finances \nback in order.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I am going to take a few minutes. I am \nvery happy with the support of the Senator from Illinois for the \nnomination of Mr. Paulson, but I challenge what was just said.\n  There is no question we have deficits. There is also no question that \non 9/11, we experienced a great economic shock and we had a recession \nthat was big. The tax cuts have led to the highest revenues this \nFederal Government has ever had.\n  On the spending side, I find it somewhat curious, the Senator from \nIllinois ranks No. 6 in the most spending voted for in the Senate last \nyear. He ranks No. 8 in the cosponsorship of the most new spending \noutside the appropriations bills. You can't have it both ways. You \ncan't complain that we are in deficits and we are in debt and never \nvote to lower the spending, never vote for amendments that trim \nwasteful spending, and then complain that somebody else made you do it.\n  If we look at the voting record on appropriations bills, there are \nnot very many noes coming from that vote. The way we control spending--\nand we have proven it on our committee, the Federal management \noversight committee--we identified over $200 billion worth of waste. If \nwe want to balance the budget, let's have everybody on both sides of \nthe aisle voting to trim the waste, fraud, and abuse out of the Federal \nGovernment, rather than when we go to a conference or a meeting with \nthe President when there is excess money and demanding more spending, \nnot less.\n  The numbers are fairly revealing. Last year, Senator Durbin sponsored \n$93 billion in new spending--new spending, outside of what we did on \nappropriations. He put his name to spend $93 billion, and he put his \nname to trim $100 million. That is the problem we have. It is not \ntaxes, it is wasteful spending and the idea that the only way we can \naccomplish something is to spend more money.\n  I am for the same priorities. We need to help the people who need \nhelp in this country. But we will never be able to afford it in the \nfuture without stealing from our kids if we don't do the hard work to \nget rid of the waste now, and that means voting against appropriations \nbills, not voting for them. The President signed what the Senator from \nIllinois voted for.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to speak in enthusiastic support \nof the nomination of Henry Hank Paulson to be the 74th Treasury \nSecretary.\n  I have known Hank Paulson for 15 years. I recommend him to my \ncolleagues wholeheartedly and without reservation. He is one of those \ngreat New Yorkers who come from somewhere else--in this case, the \nheartland of America--come to our city and become part of its life and \na vital part of\n\n[[Page S6622]]\n\nthis country and actually this world's economy.\n  Mr. President, Hank is an extraordinary leader, a great financial \nthinker, a businessman, a father, and, as I said, an adopted son of New \nYork. Hank has excelled in every area of life--from the classroom to \nthe football field to the boardroom and everywhere in between.\n  One of the things I like best about Hank is he is a straight shooter. \nHe gives you direct answers to direct questions. We sure need somebody \nlike that now.\n\n  He graduated from Dartmouth in 1968 and received his MBA from \nHarvard. He worked at the Defense Department, the Nixon White House, \nand then found his true calling at Goldman Sachs where he worked for 32 \nyears. He became chairman and chief executive officer of Goldman in \n1999, and should he be confirmed, he will continue a long history, a \ngreat tradition of leaders from Goldman serving in the Government, \nincluding Bob Rubin, one of the great Treasury Secretaries, and Jon \nCorzine, our former colleague, now Governor of New Jersey, and John \nWhitehead, who served honorably and well as Deputy Secretary of State \nunder Ronald Reagan.\n  But the issue Hank really goes off the charts about, I say to my \ncolleagues--particularly my colleagues on this side of the aisle will \nbe happy to know--is the environment. Sometimes he would call me up and \nI would be sure he was talking to me about swaps or banking or some \nesoteric financial issue, and he would be talking to me about an \nenvironmental policy. I don't think he ever gets more enthusiastic than \nwhen he is talking about some rare bird that he saw on one of his bird-\nwatching jaunts. He is an avid environmentalist and lover of all things \nin nature. I hope a few of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwill not hold that against him.\n  He is also one of those unique, good people who could fill any number \nof Cabinet posts. For instance, given his environmental proclivities, \nhe would be a great Secretary of the Interior. But financial issues and \nthe health of the global economy are his passions, that is mostly where \nhe is needed, and I am glad the President has nominated him for this \npost.\n  In the world of finance and international markets, there is simply no \nequal to Hank. At this critical point in our economy's history, we need \nHank's expertise and experience to lead the way.\n  The bottom line, Mr. President--you know it because we traveled to \nChina together--we are at an amazing time economically. The world \neconomy is becoming integrated, closer and closer every year. There is \nalmost a one world labor market. Capital flows freely to every corner \nof the world. These circumstances present tremendous challenges for our \nNation, in our desire to remain the world's economic leader, and for \nthe world as we try to integrate this system. One of the great \nchallenges we face is we are converging into one economic system, but \nwe don't have one political system, and the bumps and grinds which that \ncauses are large.\n  So we need someone who understands markets. We need someone who has \ngreat experience traveling the world and knowing how the rest of the \nworld's economic system works. Hank Paulson has all of those qualities. \nI am particularly glad that he knows a whole lot about China--I think \nhe has been there over 70 times--because I believe the most important \nbilateral economic relationship in the next decade or two will be the \nAmerican-Chinese relationship. Hank has the ability to understand the \neconomies of both countries and figure out how we can work together.\n  I have been very concerned about China playing by the rules. I have \nbeen very concerned that China doesn't simply seek the advantages of \nfree trade but not the responsibilities. I have related these concerns \nto Hank Paulson.\n  On currency, Senator Graham and I have worked closely with his \npredecessor, and you, Mr. President, have been involved in those issues \nas well as we traveled to China together. And we have worked to push \nand prod China to allow its currency to float based on international \nmarket forces. We have made some progress, but the progress since July \nhas been too little, particularly in light of the fact that the Chinese \nassured us they know they have to get to a place where their currency \nfloats.\n  Hank's extensive experience in China, his personal relationships with \nboth the Government and business side--where, incidentally, there is \nquite a dichotomy. Most of the businesspeople and people even on the \neconomic side of Government understand the need for free markets. That \nis in China's interests--not just America's--that China open up its \nmarkets. But a lot of people on the Government side are afraid of that. \nThey don't like change. They don't like giving up control.\n  I think Hank Paulson is the right man at the right place at the right \ntime to tackle the issue of persuading China to open up its markets \nmore quickly. I believe that he is going to be able to show the Chinese \nthat it is not only in our interest but in their interest as well to \nallow the yuan to float freely and to open up China's vast economic \nmarkets to American financial firms.\n  On financial services liberalization, I know Hank will work closely \nwith Ambassador Schwab, who was just confirmed, to make sure that China \nlives up to its WTO commitments. This is going to be very important in \nthe next few months because on December 11 of this year, many of the \ncurrent restrictions faced by American financial firms that want to do \nbusiness in China, such as purchase Chinese companies or open up \nbranches in China, will be lifted. Hank is the perfect person to \nmonitor China's progress and, more importantly, to prod the Chinese to \ngo further than they have already promised.\n  In short, Mr. President, Henry Paulson is a thoughtful, dedicated, \nand renowned financial leader. I think this country will greatly \nbenefit from his leadership. I am not at all shy about criticizing the \nPresident's nominees when I don't think they measure up to the job. I \nhave done that in the judicial area repeatedly. But when the President \nnominates a sterling person, that person deserves praise and credit \nand, in my judgment, unanimous support in this body, and I believe that \nHank Paulson is such a person.\n  I will be proud to vote aye when his name is offered on this floor in \na few hours.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I wish to address the nomination of Henry \nPaulson to be Secretary of the Treasury. I believe there is no question \nthat Mr. Paulson is more than qualified to be Secretary of the \nTreasury, and it is to his credit that he is willing to give up the \nhelm of Goldman-Sachs to serve his country in such a significant way. I \nam pleased that we have a nominee of this caliber.\n  However, I have raised concerns stemming from Mr. Paulson's well-\nknown personal views on conservation and affiliations with groups such \nas the Nature Conservancy. Representing a State where about half of the \nland is already federally owned, and much more is otherwise federally \nrestricted as to use, private property rights a very big concern. \nSimilarly, our vast energy resources in the State of Wyoming are \nessential to our country's national energy policy, and we struggle to \nmaintain a balance between development of those resources and the \nquality of life we enjoy in Wyoming.\n  I submitted several written questions to Mr. Paulson after our \nCommittee on Finance hearing, and we have had good follow-up discussion \non these issues. He has assured me that he is a strong advocate for \npersonal property rights and has committed to working with me and the \nSenate to pursue a sensible policy.\n  I am pleased to be able to lend my support to Mr. Paulson, and I look \nforward to working with him.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe nomination of Henry M. Paulson, Jr., to be Secretary of the \nDepartment of the Treasury. Mr. President, American\n\n[[Page S6623]]\n\neconomy has changed dramatically in the past decade. International \neconomic policy now has a direct effect on our domestic economy. The \ninformation age has transformed America's economic future. This new \neconomy requires a new kind of Treasury Secretary. It requires someone \nwho is experienced and knowledgeable in both the domestic and the \ninternational marketplace. It requires someone who has demonstrated \nexemplary leadership in both government and private enterprise. Henry \nPaulson will bring these vital skills to the Department of Treasury.\n  Mr. Paulson's outstanding career in both the public and private \nsectors has clearly demonstrated his ability to serve as our Nation's \nnext Treasury Secretary. Prior to joining The Goldman Sachs Group Inc., \nMr. Paulson served the public as White House domestic Council staff \nassistant to the President from 1972 to 1973 and as staff assistant to \nthe Assistant Secretary of Defense at the Pentagon from 1970 to 1972. \nIn 1974, Henry Paulson decided to enter the private sector. He joined \nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., in Chicago. Mr. Paulson worked his way \nup through the ranks of Goldman Sachs and is currently serving as \nchairman and chief executive officer. Clearly, Henry Paulson has had a \nvery distinguished 32 year career in the private business sector.\n  Our Nation will be fortunate to have a Treasury Secretary with such \nbroad and varied expertise, and these experiences will prove vital in \nleading a progressively diverse economy. I believe Henry Paulson will \nbe an exemplary Treasury Secretary. He has already spoken of his keen \nappreciation for the role capital markets play in driving growth and \nefficiency, the globalization of finance and interdependence of major \nworld economies, and ensuring that America's industries can compete in \nthe new global economy. I am confident Henry Paulson will seek to \nstrengthen and advance the competitive edge of our economy. I am \ncertain his experience and leadership will be great assets in achieving \nthese important goals.\n  Mr. President, it is my great honor to support Henry Paulson to head \nthe Department of the Treasury.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to express my support for the \nnomination of Henry Paulson for Treasury Secretary. I believe we are \nquite fortunate to have someone of Mr. Paulson's caliber nominated to \nthis vitally important position. Mr. Paulson has quite ably served in \nGovernment before in several positions before embarking on his \nimpressive career on Wall Street, which culminated in his becoming CEO \nand chairman of Goldman Sachs. I am hard-pressed to think of many \nothers in this country who might be more qualified for this position \nthan Mr. Paulson.\n  Henry Paulson is joining the Bush administration at a very important \ntime. Our Federal Government is in a precarious position as it stares \ndown the abyss of ever-increasing entitlement obligations that threaten \nto swallow more and more Government revenue and, along with it, other \nvitally needed programs. As our Nation's baby boomers enter their \nretirement years, we will have fewer people working per retiree to \nsupport them while the cost of providing them benefits inexorably \nincreases. It is a trend that cannot continue without bankrupting the \ncountry. Despite the highly partisan environment in which we find \nourselves, it is at precisely this moment in history when our economy \nis strong and Government revenues are increasing sharply that we need \nstrong leadership both from Congress and the administration. I believe \nthat strong leadership and some bipartisan cooperation we will be able \nto successfully address these growing problems and come up with a \nlasting solution.\n  Now is also a propitious time to consider how to address the \ndifficult problems facing our tax system. We need an Internal Revenue \nCode that is simpler, that promotes savings and economic growth, and \nthat allows American businesses to compete fairly in the global \nmarketplace. The Tax Code should serve the interests of the many, not \nthe few, and one that is worthy of this great Nation.\n  Mr. Paulson is uniquely qualified to address the issues facing our \ncountry today. I view the expediency by which we have acted on his \nnomination as a confirmation both of Mr. Paulson's fitness for the job \nas well as of the importance of the position of Treasury Secretary. I \nurge my colleagues to vote to confirm him as our next Treasury \nSecretary.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of Henry \nPaulson to be the next Secretary of the Treasury. I had the pleasure of \nmeeting with Mr. Paulson, and we talked about a range of issues.\n  I was most impressed with his commitment to protecting our \nenvironment and his record as a conservationist. I believe this \nadministration needs someone committed to protecting our natural \nresources--even if he is at Treasury.\n  I found Mr. Paulson to be an engaging and thoughtful person. These \nare qualities we need in our next Secretary of the Treasury, because he \nwill have his work cut out for him. He faces an impending crisis not of \nhis making, and for which courage and persistence will be needed to \neven begin the process of righting the ship.\n  From the kitchen table to the national debt trade imbalance, our \neconomy continues to move in the wrong direction. The middle-class is \nbeing squeezed like never before. Under the policies of this \nadministration, families are forced to work harder and harder to make \nends meet.\n  In Nevada, families, farmers, and businesses are on track to pay \napproximately $3 billion for gasoline this year. That is over $1.5 \nbillion more than was spent in our State in 2001. The cost of college \ntuition in Nevada has increased 2 percent, while Federal student aid \nhas failed to keep pace.\n  But this is not just a Nevada story. It is an American story. \nNationwide, since President Bush took office, energy prices have \nincreased nearly 100 percent, health premiums have increased by 71 \npercent, college tuition has increased nearly 60 percent, and the price \nof housing has risen dramatically, all while wages have been stagnant \ndespite growing productivity.\n  Instead of focusing on the needs of middle-class families, the Bush \nadministration has ignored their problems. The President argues that \nthe economy is doing great--he thinks middle-class families are in fine \nshape. Meanwhile, he is pursuing policies that would only make matters \nworse.\n  The twin trade and budget deficits accumulated under President Bush \nhave put the United States in a precarious situation. To fund our \nrecord trade deficits--which have more than doubled under President \nBush--we have had to sell U.S. assets to foreigners. In 2005 alone, the \nUnited States sold to foreign governments and investors a portion of \nthe U.S. economy that was larger than the combined economies of Nevada, \nArizona, Ohio, Montana, Rhode Island, Wyoming, and North Dakota. Take a \nmoment to absorb that fact.\n  And, the problem is just getting worse. If current trends continue, \nin 20 years, we will have sold the entire wealth of America to foreign \ncountries and foreign investors. It turns out that when President Bush \ntalks about an ``ownership society'' he means that under his policies, \nall of our assets will eventually be owned by foreigners.\n  Our trade deficit has been driven in part by unfair practices \noverseas, like currency manipulation in China. A number of people have \nraised concerns about Mr. Paulson's extensive ties to China while \nworking for Goldman Sachs. I hope that those ties will give him the \ncredibility and the negotiating toughness to make much needed progress \nwith the Chinese Government. The Bush administration has talked a good \ngame on getting China to end its unfair currency manipulation, but it \nhas not delivered. To date, the Bush administration's policy has been \nrhetoric, not action, and on occasion, its excuses for its failures \nhave sounded like the administration was an apologist for China's \npractice of currency manipulation. Mr. Paulson has to finally get this \nproblem under control.\n  Mr. Paulson will also need to address the enormous Federal budget \ndeficits and the growing Federal debt. The Bush administration turned a \nrecord surplus generated during the Clinton administration into a \nstring of record deficits. President Bush inherited a unified budget \nsurplus of $236 billion from President Clinton, the largest\n\n[[Page S6624]]\n\nsurplus in American history. Budget surpluses were expected to continue \nfor another 10 years when President Bush took office in January 2001.\n  By 2002, however, President Bush's policies had helped return the \nunified Federal budget to a deficit of $158 billion. The budget deficit \nhas since reached historic highs. This year, the budget deficit is \nexpected to exceed $300 billion. Of course, after this President's \nfiscal nightmare, that is not even a record. President Bush owns them \nall--$412 billion in 2004, $378 billion in 2003 and $319 billion in \n2005.\n  Our fiscal problems will only grow worse in coming years as the baby \nboom generation retires.\n  In the last 5 years, the gross Federal debt has grown by almost $3 \ntrillion. And it will exceed $11.8 trillion by 2011 if we don't do \nsomething to change course. And more and more of that debt is owed to \npeople outside the United States. The United States has had to borrow \nmore money from overseas during President Bush's 5 years in office than \nwe borrowed during all previous Presidents combined. By contrast, \nduring the last 3 years of the Clinton administration, the United \nStates paid off more than $200 billion in debt to foreigners.\n  History is clear that these rising Federal budget deficits will \nultimately cause long-term interest rates to increase. These costs are \na hidden tax and will appear in the form of higher interest rates on \nhome mortgages, auto loans, credit cards, and other types of consumer \ndebt. As Mr. Paulson stated in his confirmation hearing, the longer we \nwait to deal with these fiscal challenges, the more expensive it will \nbe to solve them. At the end of the day, it is hard-working families \nand our grandchildren who will pay the price for the Republicans' \nfiscal recklessness.\n  Unfortunately, the majority's fiscal policy, like its policy in Iraq, \nis more of the same--more of the same tax breaks targeted at \nmultimillionaires, more of the same huge deficits, more of the same \nrising debt.\n  We can't just go on this way, placing greater and greater burdens on \nour children and grandchildren. I hope that the new Secretary of the \nTreasury will be aggressive in forcing the administration to confront \nthese pressing economic challenges head on, because more of the same \njust won't cut it.\n  We need a new direction.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it is my great pleasure to come to the \nChamber to express my strong support for the nomination of my good \nfriend, Hank Paulson, someone I admire tremendously, to lead the \nDepartment of Treasury. He is an outstanding choice to be the Nation's \ntop economic policy official.\n  With 32 years of experience in finance, the last 8 of which he has \nserved as president and CEO of Goldman Sachs, which, as we all know, is \none of the Nation's largest financial institutions in the world, Hank \nPaulson is eminently qualified to craft and carry out the President's \neconomic policies. Former Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin, who was also \nHank's boss at Goldman Sachs, agrees that he is ``smart, he's bright, \nhe's thoughtful, and he's intense. He's a very good choice.''\n  Hank will lead with drive, with passion, and a deep understanding of \nhow Government policies affect the capital markets throughout the world \nas well as America's economic growth. With his detailed and intimate \nknowledge of global finance and his ability to thrive under pressure, \nAmerica's economic leadership will be in very capable hands.\n  Hank Paulson is extraordinarily talented, smart, and hard working. He \nalso happens to be a man of sterling character. Known for his candor \nand his down-to-earth demeanor, Senator Schumer calls Hank a ``straight \nshooter.'' He has led a life of impeccable integrity.\n  He grew up on a farm in Illinois. His high marks led him to \nDartmouth, where he became a member of Phi Beta Kappa and a football \nstar. He was named All Ivy, All East, and earned an honorable-mention \nAll American. After earning an MBA from Harvard Business School, Hank \nwent into public service as a staff assistant to the Secretary of \nDefense. In 1974, he joined the Chicago office of Goldman Sachs, where \nover the next three decades he rose to president and CEO.\n  Hank understands the macropicture, the global picture, as well as the \nmicropicture, the more intimate, more defined microlevel. He \nunderstands the concerns of America's hard-working families and how big \ndecisions here in Washington affect individual lives in a very personal \nway and in intimate ways and affect those individual opportunities.\n  He inherits a thriving economy--as cited again and again, a 5.3-\npercent gross domestic product growth in the first quarter, \nunemployment at historic lows, 5.3 million new jobs after 33 \nconsecutive months of job gains, and home ownership at historic highs.\n  He understands that Americans are feeling those challenges in their \neveryday lives, those challenges of high gas prices, of escalating \ncosts that seem to be skyrocketing out of the average person's reach.\n  He shares the Republican Party's conviction that we need to continue \nthose progrowth, low-tax policies in order to continue to create jobs \nand to foster more innovation.\n  I am confident that under his leadership, America will continue to \ngrow, to thrive, and expand. I look forward to voting to confirm Hank \nPaulson in a few moments as Secretary of the Treasury and to working \nwith him to keep America moving forward.\n  At this time, I know of no others who desire to speak on the Paulson \nnomination, and I urge the Senate to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question \nis, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Henry M. \nPaulson, Jr., of New York, to be Secretary of the Treasury?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as our colleagues know, there will be no \nfurther votes today and no rollcall votes today. We will be in session \na bit longer as we finish the business over the course of the next \nlittle bit. When I close, I will have more to say about the schedule \nfor tomorrow and Friday as well.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the President \nbe immediately notified of the Senate's action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/28/senate-section/article/S6624-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, the major telecommunications legislation \nreported today by the Senate Commerce Committee is badly flawed. The \nbill makes a number of major changes in the country's \ntelecommunications law, but there is one provision that is nothing more \nthan a license to discriminate. Without a clear policy preserving the \nneutrality of the Internet and without tough sanctions against those \nwho would discriminate, the Internet will be forever changed for the \nworse.\n  This one provision threatens to divide the Internet into technology \nhaves and have-nots. This one provision concentrates even more power in \nthe\n\n[[Page S6625]]\n\nhands of the special interests that own the pipelines to the Internet. \nThis one provision codifies discrimination on the Internet by a handful \nof large telecommunications and cable providers. This one provision \nwill allow large, special interests to saddle consumers and small \nbusinesses alike with new and discriminatory fees over and above what \nthey already pay for Internet access. This one small provision is akin \nto hurling a giant wrecking ball at the Internet.\n  The inclusion of this provision compels me to state that I will \nobject to a unanimous consent request to the Senate proceeding with \nthis legislation until a provision that provides true Internet \nneutrality is included.\n  This bill means the American people will no longer be able to use the \nInternet free from discrimination. Sure, the time it takes you to \naccess the Web might be slower with dial-up, or you might zoom around \nthe Web at warp speed, but you get to choose the speed. Today, whatever \nspeed you chose doesn't make any difference in which sites you can \nvisit. You still get access to any site you want. This is the beauty \nand the genius of the Internet. The Net is neutral.\n  The days of unfettered, unlimited, and free access to any site on the \nWorld Wide Web, what I call Net neutrality, are being threatened. Those \nwho own the pipes, the giant cable and phone companies, want to \ndiscriminate in which sites you can access. If they get their way, not \nonly will you have to pay more for faster speeds, you will have to pay \nmore for something you get for free today: unfettered access to every \nsite on the World Wide Web. To me, that is discrimination, pure and \nsimple.\n  The Internet has thrived precisely because it is neutral. It has \nthrived because consumers, and not some giant cable or phone company, \nget to choose what they want to see and how quickly they get to see it. \nI am not going to allow a bill to go forward that is going to end \nsurfing the Web free of discrimination.\n  The large interests have made it clear that if this bill moves \nforward, they will begin to discriminate. A Verizon Communications \nexecutive has called for an ``end to Google's `free lunch.' '' A Bell \nSouth executive has said that he wants the Internet to be turned into a \n``pay-for-performance marketplace.'' What they and other cable and \nphone company executives are proposing is that instead of providing \nequal access for everyone to the same content at the same price, they \nwill set up sweetheart arrangements to play favorites. Without net \nneutrality protections, this bill is bad news for consumers and anyone \nwho today enjoys unlimited access to all of the Net's applications, \nservice and content.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that American consumers and small \nbusiness will be the losers in this fight if this bill is allowed to \nmove forward. Right now, a computer science major at the University of \nOregon is working on the next big thing for the Internet. But she will \nnever get the chance to get the next big thing out there if she cannot \npay the big fees that will be charged tomorrow for the same Internet \naccess she gets for free today.\n  Right now in Pendleton, OR, there is a small family wheat farm where \ndad is monitoring the fertilizer on their crop via a new Web service \nprogram that his son bought. If the network operators have their way, \nthis Web service will get so expensive that it will be out of reach for \nthis family farmer.\n  As a Senator who has devoted himself to keeping the Internet free \nfrom discrimination, from discriminatory taxes and regulations to \nassuring offline protections apply to online consumer activities as \nwell, I cannot stand by and allow the bill to proceed with this \nprovision. The inclusion of this provision compels me to inform my \ncolleagues that I will object to any unanimous consent request for the \nSenate to move to consider S. 2686, the Communications Consumer's \nChoice, and Broadband Deployment Act.\n  There are other provisions in this legislation, such as the one \nrelating to my proposal for the creation of kids television tiers, that \nare problematic, but none of them rises to the same level of concern as \nthe one relating to network neutrality. Therefore, I will object to any \nfurther action on this telecommunications bill until it includes a \nstrong net neutrality provision that will truly benefit consumers and \nsmall business.\n  Mr. President, Senator Grassley and I have spent over a decade \nfighting to ensure that when a Senator puts a hold on or blocks a major \npiece of legislation that there is accountability. We have required, \nunder our proposal, that holds are publicly announced. Because I feel \nso strongly about this way of approaching holds, I have come to the \nfloor tonight to announce that I intend to object to any unanimous \nconsent request for the United States Senate to move to consider S. \n2686, the telecommunications reform legislation that came from the \nSenate Commerce Committee a bit ago.\n  The reason I have come to the floor to make this announcement is that \nI believe this legislation is a license to discriminate on the \nInternet. Right now, we all know that when you use your browser, you \nget to go where you want, when you want, how you want. The Internet's \nspecial quality is that all content is treated equally. It is my fear \nthat, as a result of this legislation without a clear policy preserving \nthe neutrality of the Internet, and without tough sanctions against \nthose who would discriminate, the Internet will be changed forever \nagainst the public interest.\n  In the beginning of these remarks--and it is my intent to be brief--I \ncompliment Senator Stevens, Chairman of the Commerce Committee, and \nRanking Member Inouye, with respect to the procedure for how this \nlegislation was considered.\n  Late last winter I was allowed to come to the Senate Commerce \nCommittee as a former member of the committee and make a presentation \nwith respect to why I thought an Internet free of discrimination was so \nimportant. I introduced the first legislation, the Internet \nNondiscrimination Act, back in March. Since then I have worked closely \nwith colleagues, particularly Senator Snowe and Senator Dorgan, who \nhave done such a great job championing an Internet free of \ndiscrimination. We have all worked for many months in trying to \npreserve a free and open Internet.\n  Unfortunately, despite the valiant work of those two Senators, \nSenators Snowe and Dorgan, and with the help of others, particularly \nSenator Cantwell, who spoke eloquently about why a free-from-\ndiscrimination Internet is so important, they were not successful. So \nnow there is the prospect of major changes in the way the Internet \nworks, changes that will affect millions of businesses and millions of \nconsumers. At a minimum, I believe these changes are so important and \nmean so much to our country, it ought to be possible for the Senate to \nslow this down and take the time to consider what the implications are \nof a badly flawed piece of legislation with respect to its treatment of \nthe Internet.\n  The failure to include what is called ``Net neutrality'' legislation \nis failure to keep the principle of keeping the Net free from \ndiscrimination. In my view, we run the prospect of dividing the \nInternet into technology haves and have-nots. What will happen is even \nmore power will be concentrated in the hands of special interests that \nown the pipelines to the Net. In effect, the legislation codifies \ndiscrimination on the Net by giving a green light to a handful of large \ntelecommunications and cable providers to set up what could be a system \nthat will allow for differential treatment.\n  It means, for example, one small business may get service that won't \nbe as good as another's. That translates, in my view, if it is done by \ndeliberate design on the basis of who can pay, into discrimination.\n  The failure to include the Net neutrality legislation that Senators \nDorgan and Snowe and I and others have worked on for so long is going \nto allow the special interests to saddle the startup businesses, the \nconsumers, and the innovators with a variety of new and discriminatory \nfees over and above what they already pay for Internet access.\n  In my view, what has happened today, failing to include provisions \nthat keep the Net free of discrimination, is like throwing a huge \nwrecking ball at this extraordinary telecommunications innovation that \nwe all enjoy, known as the Net. The failure to include this provision \ncompels me to\n\n[[Page S6626]]\n\nstate this objection to going forward on this legislation because I \nbelieve the days of unfettered, unlimited access to any site on the \nWorld Wide Web is threatened by this bill as written. Those who own the \npipes, the cable companies and the phone companies, will be able to \nplay favorites with respect to the sites that Americans can access.\n  If they get their way, not only will Americans have to pay more for \nfaster speeds, they will have to pay more for how they use the Internet \nonce they choose what speed to access it by, something they get for \nfree today after they pay their basic access charge. In my view, the \nInternet has been such a great success precisely because it was free of \ndiscrimination. It thrives because the marketplace, consumers, small \nbusinesses, and others were able to choose what they wanted to see and \nhow quickly they wanted to see it. So I am not going to let a bill like \nthis go forward because it will end surfing the Web free of \ndiscrimination.\n  The large interests that have backed the legislation have written and \nhave already made clear what their designs are. This is not some kind \nof atomic secret, Mr. President. There have been lengthy articles in \nthe Wall Street Journal, for example, about pay-to-play. It outlined in \ngreat detail all of the ways in which the companies could play \nfavorites, could give a break to a business who had a bit more money, \nand send somebody else who didn't have the funds off to the second \ntier. Instead of providing equal access for everyone to the same \ncontent at the same price, what we would have are sweetheart \narrangements where certain parties would win and other parties would \nlose. This, in my view, is bad news for consumers and anyone who enjoys \nunlimited access to all of the Net's applications, services, and \ncontent.\n  Right now, there is a computer science major at the University of \nOregon in my home State who is working on the next big thing for the \nInternet and has great dreams. I am sure that at universities and in \ngarages in Oklahoma, where the Presiding Officer is from, there are \nconstituents who are also working on the next big thing. My concern is \nthat those dreamers in Oklahoma and Oregon, and the innovators and the \npeople with the cutting edge ideas, would not get the chance to get the \nnext big idea out because they would not be able to pay the big fees \nthat Internet providers will charge tomorrow for them to get priority \naccess to consumers or get stuck in the slow lane. Of course, they are \ngoing to be up against people, as they fight to show the worth of their \nidea, who can pay those big fees and have an advantage over them in the \nmarketplace.\n  What is especially troubling to me, Mr. President, is it seems that \nif you have an innovative startup in Oregon or Oklahoma or elsewhere in \nour country, you are going to be up against these new barriers. But \nguess what? Our competitors around the world don't have the same kind \nof barriers with. So what I am concerned about is that if you have a \ngood idea in our country, a promising kind of startup, and you run up \nagainst all of these hurdles--these new discriminatory hurdles placed \non the Internet--you are going to say, what the heck, I cannot compete \nin that kind of situation, so I will just take the business overseas.\n  What I want to do--and I know the Senator from Oklahoma wants to do \nit--is create high-skill, high-wage jobs in our country. We ought to \nkeep the incentives here rather than making it attractive to take \npromising ideas overseas. I have been involved in a lot of technology \nissues, and the principle that I have always thought was most important \nwas ensuring that there is no discrimination.\n  Today, I was very pleased that the Senate Finance Committee accepted \nmy amendment to make permanent the ban on discriminatory and multiple \ntaxes on electronic commerce. We have been at this since 1996. We \npassed it three times in the Senate, always by large majorities, and I \nsaid let's get at it now and make it permanent so that we give \npredictability and certainty in the marketplace. I was very pleased \nthat, with the support of Grassley and Baucus, I was able to win \npassage of that legislation that involved taxes, ensuring that there \nwas no discrimination in the tax and the electronic commerce areas. I \nwas pleased that it passed.\n  Unfortunately, what was done today in the Commerce Committee by \ngiving a green light to discriminators undoes a lot of what the Senate \nhas done over the last few years in terms of ensuring nondiscrimination \nin electronic commerce.\n  We made sensible decisions in the tax arena because we barred \ndiscrimination as it related to taxing electronic commerce. Now the \nSenate Commerce Committee comes along and says we are going to pass on \nthis Net neutrality issue; we are not going to include it, so now there \ncan be other forms of discrimination on the Net. That makes no sense to \nme, and it seems particularly ironic today, of all days, as the Senate \nhas been trying to prevent discrimination in the taxation area of \nelectronic commerce, to essentially undo that important policy by \nallowing unprecedented discrimination in the marketplace.\n  There is another area I think is worth noting as I object to the \nconsideration of S. 2686. We have heard from a number of those opposed \nto Net neutrality legislation that there has been no problem, that \nthere are no instances of discrimination. No. 1, that is factually \nincorrect because there is already a major Federal Communications \nCommission case, Madison River case, and No. 2, the big telecoms and \ncable companies have already announced their plans to discriminate. I \nhave described the plans in the Wall Street Journal which are not any \nkind of hidden effort to sneak something by people. The Wall Street \nJournal describes the plans for differential treatment.\n  I note, as we consider this issue, the consequences of \ndiscrimination. If those who want to discriminate--and my sense is, by \ntheir own admissions, they are going to start very quickly--are able to \nset in place the discriminatory routers and other equipment that would \nallow them to treat those small businesses and individuals differently, \nonce those routers and other discriminatory systems are in place, it is \ngoing to be very difficult to undo them. They will be embedded in that \nsystem of pipes and infrastructure which makes it possible for \nAmericans to enjoy the Net. I am not willing to sit by and let all of \nthose discriminatory routers and other kinds of complicated systems \nthat make up the pipes for the Net go into effect without an \nopportunity for the Senate to really consider the consequences.\n  We are talking with respect to this legislation and its absence of \nstrong Net neutrality language, about changing policy that has been the \nbedrock of the telecommunications field for many years--non-\ndiscrimination.\n  This legislation contains a variety of major changes in the country's \ntelecommunications law. I happen to support many of them. But I will \ntell the Senate tonight that a communications bill that does not embed, \nand do it clearly, that the Internet will be free of discrimination is \nlegislation that I believe is badly flawed.\n  This is a complicated subject. There are differing views on Net \nneutrality and I am the first to admit it. But I think all sides would \nagree that this is a complicated issue. It ought to be one the Senate \ntakes the time to really think through. And I will make it clear to the \nSenate that I, for one, feel so strongly about ensuring \ntelecommunications policy continues to be based on principles that bar \ndiscrimination that I am taking this action tonight for purposes of \ncarrying out that objective.\n  Let me state again, it is my intent to object to any further action \non this legislation, S. 2686, until it includes a strong Net neutrality \nprovision that will ensure there is a vibrant, healthy Internet for \ndecades to come.\n  My colleagues, Senator Snowe and Senator Dorgan, did a superb job \nthis afternoon in making the case for our point of view. I am very \nproud to have been able to work with them. The legislation they \nintroduced is very similar to mine. Unfortunately, the Snowe-Dorgan \nlegislation went down on a tie vote in the Commerce Committee today. \nHowever, this discussion needs to continue. I hope the Senate will \ninsist that the way the Internet works today, and particularly its \negalitarian nature where everybody uses their browser and gets to where \nthey want, when they want, how they want, is continued for generations \nto come.\n\n[[Page S6627]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/28/senate-section/article/S6627-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ROBERT JULIANO\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to take note of the 65th \nbirthday of Robert Juliano.\n  Robert Juliano has spent more time working on Capitol Hill than most \nMembers of Congress. He is a longtime political adviser, labor \nrepresentative, and champion of philanthropic causes.\n  He recently received the Sons of Italy in America 2006 Humanitarian \nAward for his support of charitable causes, including the National \nCoalition for Breast Cancer, the Lions Club, and the Crusade of Mercy.\n  I am proud that Bob hails from the city of Big Shoulders, the son of \nan Italian immigrant. Bob grew up on the West Side of Chicago and \nworked in that great city's hotel industry in the 1960s and 1970s \nstarting as an elevator operator. From there, he came to Washington, \nDC, to serve as legislative representative for the Hotel and Restaurant \nEmployees International Union. He served as chairman and vice chairman \nof the U.S. Government's Travel and Tourism Advisory Board in the 1980s \nand 1990s. He has worked to protect the health care benefits of retired \nminers and worked on nearly every major piece of labor legislation over \nthe last 30 years.\n  It is clear Bob Juliano never forgot his roots. And he never forgot \nthe workers who need a strong voice for their values. One of the \nreasons Bob has been so successful is his ability to bring people of \nall political persuasions together to work on the most pressing issues \nwe face. It is a skill that is in great shortage these days.\n  I wish Bob Juliano well on his 65th birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/28/senate-section/article/S6627-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                         Specialist Bobby West\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today in honor one of our \nNation's fallen, Army SPC Bobby West. He died defending this Nation so \nthat others might have the same freedoms we cherish as Americans. For \nthose who knew Specialist West, he will be remembered for the laughter \nhe brought to the lives of those around him. He will also be remembered \nfor acting on his conviction of defending and fighting for the values \nand liberties we hold so dear as Americans.\n  At 17, after graduating from Beebe High school, Bobby enlisted with \nthe Arkansas National Guard. Like so many of us, he was deeply affected \nby the terrorist attacks that took place on September 11, 2001. \nHowever, he felt that the burden to defend our country rested squarely \non his shoulders and shortly thereafter he enlisted in the Army with \nhis older brother Patrick. Specialist West served our country in \nEgypt's Sinai Peninsula before being sent to Iraq. Tragically, he was \nserving his second tour of duty in Iraq and was killed when a roadside \nbomb detonated while he was on foot patrol with his unit in Baghdad on \nMay 30. His unit was scheduled to leave Iraq in the fall.\n  I am honored to stand here today and pay tribute to a great soldier \nand more importantly a loving son, brother and friend. His loved ones \nremember how much laughter he brought to their lives with his quick wit \nand sense of humor. His fellow soldiers will remember him not only for \nthe burden he carried with him to defend this Nation and bring freedom \nto others, but also for the competitiveness he brought to everything he \ndid in life. His fellow soldiers tell the story of the fierce \ncompetitiveness he brought to a pickup basketball game while stationed \nin Egypt. Regardless of the fact that they were playing in a tin \nbuilding in 125-135 degree heat, Bobby wouldn't let his opponents leave \nuntil they could beat him. It is this sense of commitment and \ndedication that he brought to his military service. He also believed in \nwhat he was doing and loved being a soldier. It is people like Bobby \nWest who make our military the strongest in the world.\n  I am grateful for the service of Bobby West. I am also reminded of \nthe tragic human cost of war and am saddened at the death of another \nArkansas soldier. In the words of his brother, Bobby ``was born to \ndefend the greatest Nation on Earth.'' He gave his life defending the \ngreatest Nation on Earth and we owe him and all others who have made \nthat sacrifice an enormous debt of gratitude. Our prayers are with his \nfather Ricky West, his mother Linda Wiggins West, and his older brother \nPatrick West, and we all pray for the safe return of Patrick who is \nserving in Iraq with the 101st Airborne Division.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/28/senate-section/article/S6627-3", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6627-S6628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FLAG DESECRATION AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, yesterday I opposed Senate Joint Resolution \n12, which would have created a constitutional amendment allowing \nCongress to ban desecration of the flag.\n  As a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy and a former officer in \nthe Army, I am deeply offended when people burn or otherwise abuse this \nprecious national symbol.\n  I also believe, however, that the values and beliefs that the \nAmerican flag represents are more important than the cloth from which \nthis symbol was created. Prominent among these beliefs are the right to \nvoice views that are unpopular, and the right to protest. In fact, \nthese fundamental values, preserved by our Constitution, have \ndistinguished our Nation for more than 200 years. The Framers \nunderstood that democracy cannot thrive, or even survive, without \nfreedom of expression. Colin Powell has rightfully said, ``The first \namendment exists to ensure that freedom of speech and expression \napplies not just to that with which we agree or disagree, but also that \nwhich we find outrageous. I would not amend that great shield of \ndemocracy to hammer a few miscreants. The flag will be flying proudly \nlong after they have slunk away.''\n  I oppose this amendment not because I condone desecration of our \nflag, but because I celebrate the values our flag represents. Flag \nburning is despicable. However, the issue is whether we should amend \nour great charter document, the Constitution, to proscribe it.\n  In The Federalist, James Madison declared that the Constitution \nshould be amended for ``certain great and extraordinary occasions.'' \nExcept for the prohibition amendments, since the adoption of the Bill \nof Rights, we have only amended the Constitution for ``great and \nextraordinary occasions:'' abolishing slavery and giving African \nAmericans the right to vote; extending voting rights to women; and \nregulating elections and the tenure of the Presidency. Of the 27 \namendments, 17 protect individual rights and liberties. In fact, we \nhave never amended the Constitution to constrict rights that other \namendments already guarantee.\n  So are we facing a ``great and extraordinary occasion'' justifying \nthe use of a constitutional amendment? I would argue no.\n  First, an amendment permitting government restraints on free \nexpression cannot compel loyalty to or love for either our country or \nour flag. The proposed amendment would pronounce to the world that we \nvalue free speech, except when it offends, that we tolerate free \nexpression, except when it is demoralizes.\n  Second, is this a problem needing such strong medicine? Are we facing \nan epidemic of flag burnings? In fact, over the past 10 years, only 7 \nincidents of flag desecration have occurred per year on average, most \nof which have been successfully prosecuted under laws prohibiting \nvandalism, theft, disorderly conduct, and disturbance of peace. Indeed, \npassing such an amendment would probably do more to promote flag \nburning by malcontents than any other action this Congress could take.\n  Third, proponents of such an amendment declare that it would boost \nthe morale of our troops and help restore some of the American values \nso basic to the fabric of our country. But, as one veteran recently \nwrote, ``I did not believe then, nor do I believe now, that I was \ndefending just a piece of geography, but a way of life. If this \namendment becomes a part of our Constitution, this way of life will be \ndiminished.'' I cannot help but believe that a more appropriate \nexpression of support for our troops would be providing them with the \nequipment they need in the field, better benefits for their families, \nand an adequately funded medical system at home.\n  Although I oppose a constitutional amendment, I did support an \nalternative approach offered by Senator Durbin. Senator Durbin's \namendment contained two elements. First, it would\n\n[[Page S6628]]\n\nhave created a statutory prohibition against desecration of our flag. \nThis part of his amendment was drafted to follow the guidance of the \n2003 Supreme Court decision in Virginia v. Black, which upheld a \nVirginia law banning cross burning that is intended to intimidate. The \nDurbin amendment took a similar approach and prohibited desecration of \nthe flag when it is intended to incite violence. The Durbin amendment \nalso would have promoted respect for families of deceased members of \nthe Armed Forces by prohibiting demonstrations at their funerals. The \namendment was narrowly tailored to make these disrespectful \ndemonstrations punishable.\n  In sum, debating a constitutional amendment on desecration of the \nflag, although politically popular, is not how the Senate should be \nspending its few remaining legislative weeks. But this is a campaign \nyear, and the majority appears to want the Senate to spend time on \ntopics which defer and deflect us from concentrating finding solutions \nto pressing issues facing our Nation: restoring fiscal discipline, \ncreating safe and affordable housing for working families, securing our \nborders, expanding health insurance coverage to the uninsured, ensuring \nstudents have the skills and tools to compete in an ever-expanding \nglobal economy, and redeploying our troops as quickly as possible out \nof Iraq. Unfortunately, the majority has provided limited time to \ndebate most of these issues.\n  I hope that with the rapidly dwindling number of days left in this \nsession we will work to address the very real concerns that impact \nAmerican families every day. I fear, however, that this debate is only \na harbinger of what is to come and very clearly signals why we need a \nnew direction.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, 17 years ago the U.S. Supreme Court, in a \n5-to-4 decision, struck down a Texas flag protection statute. The \nSupreme Court ruled that burning an American flag was a form of \n``speech,'' and therefore protected under the first amendment of the \nConstitution.\n  I disagreed with the Court's decision then and I still do. I don't \nbelieve that the act of desecrating a flag is an act of speech. And I \nbelieve that our flag, as our national symbol, can and should be \nprotected by law.\n  In the intervening years since the Supreme Court decision, I have \nsupported Federal legislation that would make flag desecration illegal. \nYet on several occasions, I have also voted against amendments to the \nConstitution to do the same.\n  I voted that way because, while I believe that flag desecration is \ndespicable conduct that should be prohibited by law, I also believe \nthat amending our Constitution is a step that should be taken only \nrarely, and then only as a last resort.\n  In the past year I have once again reviewed in detail nearly all of \nthe legal opinions and written materials published by constitutional \nscholars and courts on all sides of this issue.\n  After that review, I have concluded that there remains a way to \nprotect our flag without having to alter the Constitution of the United \nStates. That is why I have cosponsored S. 1370, a bipartisan piece of \nlegislation introduced by Senator Bennett of Utah.\n  S. 1370 protects the flag by criminalizing flag desecration when its \nintended purpose is to incite violence. This is the same standard which \nmakes it illegal to falsely cry ``fire'' in a crowded theater. Reckless \nspeech that is likely to cause violence is not protected under the \n``fighting words'' standard, long recognized by the Supreme Court of \nthe United States. The Congressional Research Service believes that \nthis type of statute will be upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Last night, I voted for an amendment offered by Senator Durbin, which \nincorporates many of the provisions of S. 1370, the bipartisan bill of \nwhich I am a cosponsor. The Durbin amendment would also prohibit the \ndisruption of military funerals by demonstrators. This amendment would \nprotect the flag, but do so without altering the Constitution.\n  I know that supporters of a constitutional amendment will be \ndisappointed by my decision to support this statutory remedy to protect \nthe flag, rather than support an amendment to the U.S. Constitution. I \nknow they are impatient to correct a decision by the Supreme Court that \nthey and I believe was wrong.\n  I have wrestled with this issue for a long time, and I respect those \nwho passionately believe that we must amend the Constitution to protect \nthe flag.\n  More than 11,000 constitutional amendments have been proposed since \nour Constitution was ratified. However, since the ratification of the \nBill of Rights in 1791, only 17 amendments have been enacted.\n  Protecting the American flag can be accomplished without amending the \nConstitution, and that is a critically important point. I believe that \nfuture generations, and our founding fathers, would agree that it is \nworthwhile for us to find a way to protect our flag without altering \nthe Constitution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/28/senate-section/article/S6628-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On June 10, 2006, Queens, NY, three gay men were out walking when a \ngroup of eight men began shouting antigay slurs at them. The group then \nsurrounded and attacked them, striking one victim in the head with a \nbaseball bat.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/28/senate-section/article/S6628-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6628-S6629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HEALTHY FAMILIES ACT\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am proud to cosponsor the Healthy \nFamilies Act, S. 932 and S. 1085, introduced by my friend, Senator Ted \nKennedy. This legislation will provide full-time employees with up to 7 \npaid sick days a year so that they can take care of their own medical \nneeds or the medical needs of family members. Part-time employees would \nreceive a prorata amount of paid sick leave. All employers--public and \nprivate--with at least 15 employees would be covered by the Healthy \nFamilies Act.\n  Today, 86 million workers in the United States do not have paid sick \ndays. Thus, when faced with either a personal or family medical issue, \nthey are forced to choose between caring for themselves or their loved \nones and going to work to keep food on the table and a paycheck in the \nmail. This is not acceptable. People get sick every day. They should \nhave the right to get medical treatment without jeopardizing their jobs \nor harming the people around them. The Healthy Families Act would \nguarantee them that right.\n  According to Harvard University's Global Working Families Project, \n139 nations provide some sort of paid sick days; 177 of those nations \nguarantee at least a week of annual sick pay. The United States, \nhowever, has no such guarantee--the Federal Family and Medical Leave \nAct provides only unpaid sick leave for serious personal or family \nillnesses. This lack of paid sick leave puts our Nation's workforce, \nboth present and future, at risk.\n  As ranking member of the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I am extremely conscious of the regulatory burden \nthat our businesses face particularly our small businesses. I believe \nthat government should avoid weighing down small businesses with \nunnecessary regulations. However, the more I have examined this issue, \nthe more obvious it becomes that this legislation benefits both \nemployees and employers.\n  It does not take a rocket scientist to figure out that healthy \nemployees are the key to a productive and vibrant economy. Healthy \nemployees are more productive and often more efficient. But, without \npaid sick days, many employees will go to work rather than take time \noff to get regular preventative medical checkups or to recover from an \nattacking illness or to care for\n\n[[Page S6629]]\n\na sick child. Thus, they will get sick more often, and their illnesses \nwill spread. Employees who opt to come to work when sick can make their \ncondition worse or even spread their illness to coworkers. For a \nbusiness, it is far more costly to cope with a depleted staff or to \nsearch for a replacement when an employee is suffering from an extended \nillness than it is to provide just 7 sick days. Providing employees \nwith a small number of paid sick days is a simple and commonsense fix \nthat will save businesses time and money.\n  In addition, I have heard--my staff has reported--that small \nbusinesses often complain that they want to offer this benefit, but are \nunable to and need a level playing field. This legislation would offer \nthem just that.\n  Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will take a look at the \nHealthy Families Act and will join me in cosponsoring it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/28/senate-section/article/S6629-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         SERVICE MARKED BY INTEGRITY, COMPASSION AND DEDICATION\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, Ronald Reagan once said ``I know in my \nheart that man is good. That what is right will always eventually \ntriumph. And there's purpose and worth to each and every life.'' How \nappropriate that these words reflect the heart and persona of someone \nwho used to work for the Reagans in the White House and who, for the \npast 2 years, has worked faithfully and tirelessly as my executive \nassistant.\n  Mary Klappa met the challenge of the job with excitement and \nexpertise. She brought professionalism and trust to her position. We \nall depend on our executive assistant to make certain we get where we \nneed to be on time and well prepared, a duty in which she excelled.\n  Effectively managing a Senator's time is not easy. Frankly, I am glad \nI don't have to do it. It requires a careful sense of timing and \nintuition and exacting attention to detail. It also requires someone \nwho, regardless of the demands on their time, is pleasant and helpful \nto all who call or walk in, regardless of their personality or \nrequests. Mary has been all of these things and more. She carried her \nphone and Blackberry with her constantly, and I always knew I could \ncall her whenever I needed something. She worked diligently to make \nsure I met with Idahoans who came to Washington, and she coordinated my \nState scheduling as well. She has taken exceptional care of my family \nand was utterly selfless in her commitment to ensure that I conduct my \njob in the most efficient and responsible manner possible.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a true \npatriot and tireless advocate of the great State of Wyoming, U.S. \nSenator Malcolm Wallop. I am pleased to be joined by Senator Enzi and \nRepresentative Cubin in this tribute.\n  Malcolm hails from Big Horn, WY, born into a hard-working family with \na long history of public service. Malcolm continued this family \ntradition by serving in the U.S. Army as a first lieutenant, then in \nthe Wyoming State Legislature from 1969 to 1976. He followed this with \na distinguished 18-year career representing the people of the State of \nWyoming in the U.S. Senate.\n  Throughout his tenure in the Senate, Malcolm held true to his \nconvictions--maintaining a strong national defense, a Federal \nGovernment that works best when it is smaller, individual liberties and \nfreedoms are the core of our Nation, and States rights must be \nprotected from encroachment by the Federal Government. His \nunwillingness to compromise his forthright beliefs earned him the \nrespect of his Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Senator \nLevin said about Malcolm:\n\n       While we disagreed, again, probably as often as we agreed, \n     that did not stand in the way of my admiration for the \n     quality, the characteristic that he had of letting you know \n     precisely where he stood and why. And his patriotism is \n     second to none in this body.\n\n  His depth of understanding and knowledge on defense policy was widely \nrespected. In 1978, Senator Wallop became the first elected official to \npropose a space based missile defense system, a program that later \nbecame part of the Strategic Defense Initiative. Given the \nproliferation of new missiles today, it is remarkable how profound his \nideas and observations were at the time.\n  Although Senator Wallop retired from the Senate in 1994, he remains \nengaged in the debate on key issues confronting our Nation. He is \ncurrently a senior fellow with the Heritage Foundation where he writes \nand speaks on issues of foreign policy and national defense. Malcolm \nalso chairs the Frontiers of Freedom, a nonprofit organization he \nestablished upon retiring from the Senate. And he remains a strong and \nrespected voice on individual property rights, Endangered Species Act \nreform, Social Security privatization and civil liberties.\n  Malcolm's contributions to Wyoming, and the Nation as a whole, are \nremarkable. The Wyoming State Legislature recently passed a joint \nresolution establishing July 8, 2006 as Malcolm Wallop Appreciation \nDay. With your permission, I will submit the resolution for the Record.\n  He remains an intelligent, articulate individual with incredible \nforesight. We are pleased to take this moment to express our gratitude \nto Senator Wallop for his service, and extremely proud to have such a \ndistinguished and respected individual call Wyoming home.\n  Although many have tried to sum up the man, President Reagan may have \nsaid it best when he said, ``Leadership, hard work, experience, loyalty \nto Wyoming--that's what Malcolm Wallop is all about.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the aforementioned \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n A Joint Resolution of the Members of the Fifty-Eighth Legislature of \n   the State of Wyoming Honoring the Contributions of United States \n                         Senator Malcolm Wallop\n\n       A joint resolution to commemorate Senator Malcolm Wallop's \n     service and dedication to the people of Wyoming and to \n     proclaim July 8, 2006 as ``Malcolm Wallop Appreciation Day.''\n       Be it Resolved by the Fifty-Eighth Legislature of the State \n     of Wyoming:\n       Whereas, this proud son of Sheridan County was born on \n     February 27, 1933, the third generation of a Wyoming pioneer \n     family; his grandfather was a young Englishman named Oliver \n     Henry Wallop, the youngest son of the fifth Earl of \n     Portsmouth, who headed out to the great American West after \n     graduating from Oxford in 1883, buying the Canyon Ranch in \n     Big Horn in 1895, which has remained in the family for four \n     generations; and\n       Whereas, Malcolm's story ties together a family's \n     commitment to public service across two nations; his \n     grandfather was elected to the Wyoming Legislature in 1910 \n     and helped draft the state's first game and conservation \n     laws; when Oliver's elder brother died in England in 1925, he \n     returned to assume the post of Earl of Portsmouth and served \n     in the British House of Lords, but the Earl never abandoned \n     his love of America, the West and Canyon Ranch, where he \n     remained until his death in 1942; and\n       Whereas, Malcolm was educated at Big Horn School, Cate \n     School in Carpinteria, California, and attended college at \n     Yale University, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1954; \n     upon graduation from Yale, Malcolm served in the U.S. Army \n     Artillery from 1955 to 1957, as a First Lieutenant; and\n       Whereas, he returned home to Big Horn after his service to \n     his country and his extensive business career included \n     management of his Wyoming ranch holdings, establishment of a \n     feedlot, and development of oil and gas projects in Nebraska, \n     Montana and Wyoming; in addition, Malcolm has been an active \n     real estate developer and investor; and\n       Whereas, following in his grandfather's footsteps, Malcolm \n     served in the Wyoming Legislature from 1969 to 1976, serving \n     two terms in the Wyoming House of Representatives where he \n     served on the House Livestock and Agriculture Committee; the \n     House\n\n[[Page S6630]]\n\n     Game and Fish Committee; the House Travel, Recreation and \n     Wildlife Committee; and the House Corporations, Elections and \n     Political Subdivisions Committee; and one term in the Wyoming \n     Senate, where he served on the Senate Education, Health and \n     Welfare Committee; the Senate Travel, Recreation and Wildlife \n     Committee; and the Senate Transportation and Highways \n     Committee; and\n       Whereas, he went on to be elected to the United States \n     Senate on November 2, 1976, was reelected on November 2, \n     1982, and again on November 8, 1988, serving Wyoming in \n     Washington for 18 years, where the Senator distinguished \n     himself through a long and notable record of legislative \n     achievements to mark his three terms in Congress; and\n       Whereas, during his tenure, Senator Wallop served on \n     numerous committees, including Energy and Natural Resources, \n     Finance, Small Business, Armed Services, Environment and \n     Public Works, the Select Committee on Intelligence, and he \n     was the first non-lawyer in history to serve on the Judiciary \n     Committee; and\n       Whereas, on the national stage, the Senator may be best \n     remembered for his work related to federal deregulation, \n     states rights, tax reform, energy policy, free trade, \n     national defense, private property rights, and individual \n     liberties and he has earned a national and international \n     reputation related to his expertise on these issues; and\n       Whereas, Senator Wallop was a great friend to Wyoming \n     throughout his tenure in the United States Congress and his \n     legislative conservation victories include the Wyoming \n     Wilderness Act, which became law in 1984; the Senator was the \n     author of the 1984 Wallop-Breaux Sport Fishing Restoration \n     Act; the designation of the Clark's Fork as a Wild and Scenic \n     River was another piece of legislation he sponsored, as was \n     legislation to repair and upgrade the Buffalo Bill Dam in \n     Cody, as well as safety and repair work at Jackson Lake Dam, \n     Seminole Dam, and Fontenelle Dam; and\n       Whereas, Senator Wallop achieved many other victories for \n     the state including efforts to stop the congressional \n     Appropriations Committee from requiring that Wyoming share \n     100 percent of the federal administrative costs for the \n     mineral royalty management programs; he sponsored legislation \n     to provide inheritance tax relief for family businesses and \n     ranches; he sponsored the Energy Policy Act of 1992, which \n     provides for energy development and conservation programs; \n     and he successfully sought to reduce trade barriers in Japan, \n     Taiwan, the European Community, and Brazil for trona exports; \n     and\n       Whereas, considered one of the nation's most knowledgeable \n     experts on defense policy, when the history of the Cold War \n     is written, a chapter will be devoted to Senator Wallop, so \n     dedicated and determined was he in this arena; in 1978, \n     Senator Wallop was the first elected official to propose a \n     space-based missile defense system, which became part of the \n     Strategic Defense Initiative; throughout the 1980s, Senator \n     Wallop served on both the Senate Arms Control Observer group \n     and the Committee on Security and Cooperation in Europe, also \n     known as the Helsinki Commission; his extensive travel for \n     these responsibilities took him to the Soviet Union, Eastern \n     and Western Europe and the issues of arms control in SALT II, \n     INF, START I and START II were the most complex international \n     relations issues of the era; and\n       Whereas, an early supporter of volunteerism, Senator \n     Wallop's legislation establishing the Congressional Award \n     program was approved by Congress in 1979, which honors the \n     nation's youth for community service and personal \n     achievements and is the only award given in the name of \n     Congress; the Senator was also responsible for bringing the \n     Close Up program to Wyoming to give young people in Wyoming \n     the opportunity to travel to the nation's Capitol to learn \n     about the democratic process firsthand; and\n       Whereas, although a listing of the many awards and honors \n     he has received do not do full tribute to the man, his \n     countless honors include the American Conservative Union's \n     John Ashbrook Award and Ronald Reagan Award, the National \n     Energy Resources Organization's National Leadership Award, \n     the Center for Security Policy's ``Keeper of the Flame \n     Award,'' the Congressional Award's Leadership Award, the Fund \n     for American Studies' Congressional Scholarship Award, and \n     Citizens for a Sound Economy's Jefferson Award; and\n       Whereas, the Senator, who has built a reputation as a \n     tireless promoter of individual freedom and small government, \n     is the founder and chairman of Frontiers of Freedom, a non-\n     profit public policy organization he established in 1995, \n     after retiring from the Senate; and\n       Whereas, in the best testament of a man's character, his \n     staff speak proudly and fondly of their service under his \n     tutelage; a recurring theme of kindness, humility, and keen \n     intellect runs a thread through recollections of their former \n     boss and friend; one staff member noted, ``I learned more \n     about our state in the few years I worked for him than anyone \n     previously and his love for this state and the Wyoming people \n     was obvious from the first day I began working for him,'' \n     another staff member recalls that the Senator, ``had the \n     incredibly rare ability to look ahead and plan today for what \n     will be needed in the future,'' yet another notes that ``My \n     family often said that we slept better at night knowing that \n     a man like Malcolm Wallop was making decisions for us at the \n     federal level, based on strong and thoughtful values and he \n     did not let the capricious opinion of the day sway him from \n     his reasoned positions;'' and\n       Whereas, the Senator's Chief of Staff and current Chief \n     Justice of the Wyoming Supreme Court, William Hill, notes, \n     ``Malcolm is a man made of many parts--you first are struck \n     by the warmth and friendliness of his personality, he is a \n     genuine and sincere man, with no artifice about him; he is a \n     man of great honor and dignity, of great kindness and \n     decency; despite his many gifts and accomplishments, he is a \n     man of great humility; his loyalty runs deep and he is a \n     staunch friend, as a public servant, his patriotism is \n     matched only by his abiding love for Wyoming and the people \n     of our state;'' and\n       Whereas, his colleague in the United States Senate for 16 \n     years, Senator Alan Simpson, remembers him as ``a practical \n     politician, a formidable foe in debate, a friendly companion \n     with friend or foe, a highly articulate spokesman, an avid \n     reader, master of languages, a student, an author, a patriot, \n     a diplomat, a very wise and witty man, and a highly respected \n     U.S. Senator among his peers, always with the best interests \n     of his native state in mind.'' Now therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the members of the Legislature of the State of \n     Wyoming:\n       Section 1. That, on behalf of the people of the State of \n     Wyoming, we extend our deepest admiration and gratitude to \n     Senator Malcolm Wallop for his long and distinguished service \n     to our state and our Nation.\n       Section 2. That we recognize that the strength of our local \n     communities, the success of the State of Wyoming, and the \n     vitality of American society depend upon the dedication of \n     citizens like Senator Wallop, who used his considerable \n     talents to unselfishly serve others and that his \n     contributions will inspire others to continue his tradition \n     of public service.\n       Section 3. That we hereby designate July 8, 2006 as \n     ``Malcolm Wallop Appreciation Day'' marking and celebrating \n     his election to the United States Senate 30 years ago, a post \n     to which he served admirably; his integrity during his \n     service will be his lasting legacy. Be it further\n       Resolved, that this resolution be transmitted to Senator \n     Wallop on July 8, 2006, so that he may know of our deepest \n     appreciation for his passionate devotion to Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/28/senate-section/article/S6630-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6630-S6631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE DROUGHT AND WATER SITUATION IN NEW MEXICO\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I rise to share my concerns about \nthe water crisis that has ravaged the West for more than 5 years.\n  Water is our most precious and scarce resource. This year, my home \nState of New Mexico is battling a very real and devastating drought \nthat has expanded throughout most of the Western United States. The \nongoing drought continues to break records, and I believe that in years \nto come, 2006 will be looked at as the year where most basins set new \nrecord lows. The question on the minds of New Mexicans is, Will there \nbe enough water to meet the current needs?\n  Drought is a unique emergency situation because it creeps in unlike \nother abrupt weather disasters. New Mexico, like many other States in \nthe West, has had little to no precipitation, and our winter snow pack \nwas far below average. Many New Mexico towns, municipalities, and \nagricultural producers heavily rely on runoff provided by snowpack.\n  On April 18, 2006, the Texas Agriculture Experiment Station predicted \na dramatic decrease in water flows and reservoir storage throughout New \nMexico. Early predictions indicate that river water supply will be at \n54 percent due primarily to receiving half our annual snowpack and \nabove average temperatures in my State. Additionally, several of our \nreservoirs are at severely diminished capacity. Specifically, the \nElephant Butte, El Vado and Caballo reservoirs are all well below 10 \npercent of capacity. Earlier this year New Mexico's State engineer, \nJohn D'Antonio, correctly predicted that it will be difficult, if not \nimpossible, without really good snowpack to keep the Rio Grande River \nflowing through the summer.\n  The drought has exacerbated many of New Mexico's most acute problems. \nFor example, wells are running dry, ranchers are being forced to sell \ntheir livestock, farmers are being forced to watch their way of life \nblow away with the dust, and many of our cities are in various stages \nof water restriction. Because of a lack of precipitation, many New \nMexico communities are running out of water. The disruption to water \nsupplies will have disastrous implications for affected communities. \nAbsent some immediate help, it is unclear where these communities will \nget water for municipal purposes.\n  The communities of Ruidoso, Ruidoso Downs, Las Vegas, Capitan,\n\n[[Page S6631]]\n\nand Cloudcroft, NM, are already operating under stringent water \nrestrictions. I am happy to say that the fiscal year 2006 supplemental \nappropriations bill provided $9 million for drought emergency \nassistance to these and other New Mexico communities that have been \nespecially hard hit by the drought.\n  The Rio Grande River is another unfortunate example of the water \nshortages in New Mexico. Water flowing in the Rio Grande provides water \nto almost a million people living along its banks. New Mexico's largest \ncities and fastest growing towns are along the Rio Grande--the Pojoaque \nValley, Santa Fe, Rio Rancho, Albuquerque, Los Lunas, and Belen.\n  The drought and the mounting legal requirements on both the Pecos and \nRio Grande Rivers are forcing us toward a severe water crisis in New \nMexico. Indeed, every river in the intermountain west seems to be \nfacing similar problems. Drought conditions have affected nearly \neveryone in our States in some way. As I have said many times, we must \ncontinue our efforts to stretch existing water supplies and create new \nwater supplies by encouraging increased conservation efforts, a better \nunderstanding of available resources, and a more reasoned approach to \nendangered species and water quality regulations.\n  America is reaching the extent of our water supply, and we cannot \nwait to address this problem. I believe we must bring to bear every \ntool available to confront these problems in the West, and doing so \nremains one of my top priorities.\n  The fiscal impacts of drought on individuals, businesses, and \ngovernments are not insignificant. According to NOAA, there have been \n12 different drought events since 1980 that resulted in damages and \ncosts exceeding $1 billion each. For instance, in 2000, severe drought \nin the South-Central and Southeastern States caused losses to \nagriculture and related industries of over $4 billion, and the Eastern \ndrought in 1999 led to $1 billion in losses.\n  While drought affects the economic and environmental well-being of \nthe entire Nation, the United States lacks a cohesive strategy for \ndealing with serious drought emergencies. The current state of the \ndrought should prompt us to take action. Better planning on our part \ncould limit some of the damage felt by drought. I believe that passage \nof the National Integrated Drought Information System Act of 2006, S. \n2751, is a good start. Without a national drought policy in place, we \nconstantly live with the uncertainty of what next year will bring.\n  The past several days have brought some precipitation in places, but \nit alone will not be enough. These are difficult times, and all we can \nhope for is help where we can get it. I want to make the Senate aware \nof the difficulties we are experiencing in my home state because of the \nprolonged drought and the hot, dry, windy conditions, and as their \nSenator, I continue to ask for help on their behalf. As this drought \npersists, I want to ensure each New Mexican that I am committed to \ndoing everything possible to make sure they have the tools and \nresources they need to help cope during this very difficult time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/28/senate-section/article/S6631-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          TRIBUTE TO PEG SAGEN\n\n Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, I am proud to recognize the \nachievements of several individuals from Hawaii who have excelled in an \narea of great interest to me, economic education.\n  I wish to recognize the students from Iolani High School in Honolulu, \nHI, who won the 2006 National Economics Challenge in New York City. \nThey are the first team ever to win the national competition 2 years in \na row. Seniors Bryce Aisake Atkinson, Megan Chock, Dean Ushijima, and \nSumil Thapa, coached by their teacher, COL Richard Rankin, beat more \nthan 1,000 teams from 35 States to win the Economics Challenge \nchampionship in the Adam Smith Division. Hawaii's State-level \ncompetition was sponsored by the Hawaii Council on Economic Education, \nwhich has done a wonderful job in fostering economic education in \nHawaii. The national competition was sponsored by the National Council \non Economic Education and the Goldman Sachs Foundation. I am very \npleased to know that Hawaii is producing such high-quality young people \nknowledgeable about economics.\n  As the economy is intricately tied to the welfare of our Nation, \neconomic and financial literacy is vital to ensuring our country's \nfuture. I have been very active in promoting economic and financial \nliteracy in the United States. For example, I have introduced several \npieces of legislation including the Mutual Fund Transparency Act, the \nCollege Literacy in Finance and Economics Act and the enacted \nExcellence in Economic Education Act. As the economy grows increasingly \ncomplex, everyone needs to be able to make informed financial decisions \nwhich will greatly impact their financial well-being.\n  We must strive to educate all sectors of society about financial \nliteracy, especially our young people, so that they grasp essential \nconcepts such as the importance of saving, budgeting, maintaining good \ncredit histories, and applying economic principles to daily decisions. \nOur Nation's future is in our children hands.

Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure and pride \nto announce that students from Waianae High School, on the Island of \nOahu, recently won the National Television Academy's National Student \nTelevision Award in the sports category. Waianae High School's Searider \nProductions was one of only seven school-based production operations \nfrom across the United States to be honored.\n  The National Student Television Awards are sponsored by the National \nTelevision Academy, which is dedicated to the advancement of the arts \nand sciences in television. The academy is best known for recognizing \nexcellence in television programming through its coveted Emmy Awards. \nIn its purpose statement, the academy states that it is committed to \npromoting excellence in broadcasting through education and inspiring \nthe next generation of broadcast journalists.\n  I recognize the following four Waianae students who produced the \nexcellent news piece: Katie Hoppe, Priscilla Mathewson, James Kapu-\nKaaihue, and Justine Campos. Submissions for this competition were held \nto professional standards for high-quality journalism as well as \ncreativity, execution, and strong writing. The special presentation of \nsports news that these students produced, entitled ``A Paddle Through \nTime,'' far exceeded professional standards.\n  I also take a moment to recognize Searider Productions, the \nmultimedia education program of Waianae High School, which nurtured \nthese excellent students. This innovative program offers the \nopportunity for talented students to gain workplace experience while \ndeveloping their artistic and academic skills. Over the course of a few\n\n[[Page S6632]]\n\nyears, Searider Productions has produced incredible work and has \ngarnered an enormous number of accolades. From highly acclaimed public \nservice announcements to an update of an online voting Web site, the \nwork Searider Productions has performed is outstanding.\n  As a former teacher and principal, I take pride in seeing students \nfrom Hawaii receive national recognition. I know that it is because of \nschool and parental support, dedication, and commitment that these \nstudents excelled in this area. These four students have made their \nfamilies, school, and community proud.

He served as a partner in the Rexburg Livestock Auction, \nSalmon Livestock Auction, and the Bozeman Livestock Auction. According \nto the West Jefferson Lions Club, who has awarded Don its prestigious \nSpirit of Service Award this year, his long and selfless service to the \ncommunity has touched the lives of many youth and adults alike. Don \nserved on the Jefferson County districts 251 and 253 school boards for \n24 years. He also served on the board of directors for the Owsley \nCanal.\n  Over the years, he has placed particular emphasis on the children of \nJefferson County. And I am sure that with the time saved from having to \ndrive to Boise 2 or 3 months a year, he will be able to focus more on \nthe youth in his own family, including 38 grandchildren, with another \ncoming very soon, and 23 great grandchildren.\n  I congratulate Don on his dedication to his fellow Idahoans, and \nSusan and I wish him well as he leaves State-level public service. I am \ncertain his public commitment will continue in other ways at home in \neastern Idaho.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/28/senate-section/article/S6632-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING CHARLES WHITEPIPE, SR.\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to honor and \nrecognize a true hero and a great American. Charles I. Whitepipe, Sr., \nof Gregory, SD, passed into the spirit world at 7 on Monday evening. \nMr. Whitepipe, a Sicangu Lakota from the Rosebud tribe, valiantly \nserved in the Army as a codetalker in World War II. He served as a \n``Forward Observer'' on Japanese-held islands in the South Pacific, \ncommunicating by radio with a ship-based partner, using the Lakota \nlanguage to direct artillery fire from ships at sea onto the islands.\n  During World War II, about a dozen known Sioux Indians were Army \nradio operators who used their native Lakota, Nakota and Dakota \ndialects to transmit strategic messages to foil enemy surveillance in \nboth the Pacific and European theaters. There is no doubt that the \nbravery and the courage of Mr. Whitepipe and the other codetalkers \nhelped to make the United States the free and proud place it is today. \nWhile Navajos have received the most recognition, it is important to \nremember that members of at least 17 other tribes also served as \ncodetalkers in World War I and World War II.\n  The syntax and tonal qualities of the native languages were so \ncomplex that no message transmitted by any codetalker was ever decoded \nby the enemy. However, for the codetalkers who returned home there were \nno parades or special recognition, as they were sworn to secrecy, an \noath they kept and honored, but one that robbed them of the accolades \nand place in history that they rightfully deserved.\n  The accomplishments of the codetalkers were even more heroic, given \nthe cultural context in which they were operating. Subjected to \nalienation in their homeland and discouraged from speaking their native \nlanguages, they still stepped forward and developed the most \nsignificant and successful military code of their time. That spirit of \nmilitary service continues today. Native Americans make up a higher \npercentage of servicemen and servicewomen in the armed forces than any \nother ethnic group in America. They have served with honor in all of \nAmerica's wars, beginning with the Revolutionary War and on through our \ncurrent operations in Iraq.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/28/senate-section/article/S6632-3", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING MERRY TRUDEAU\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Merry \nTrudeau, a longtime employee of the Internal Revenue Service in Idaho.\n  Merry started with the IRS in 1976 in the collection division holding \nvarious positions, quickly advancing from clerical to Revenue \nrepresentative to Revenue officer. She then advanced to problem \nresolution officer, which was the predecessor to the taxpayer advocate. \nThis turned out to be Merry's true calling, and it is where my staff \nand I got to know her well.\n  All of us work with our constituents on a daily basis to help resolve \nissues with the IRS. Having a helpful, energetic, pleasant person at \nthe IRS to work with makes our job so much easier. Merry is that \nperson. She knows her job well and she consistently seeks to serve \nIdahoans well. For that I am grateful.\n  On behalf of the hundreds, if not thousands, of Idahoans Merry has \nhelped, I say thank you. Merry, we wish you the best in your next \nendeavor, knowing you will continue to serve your neighbors and \ncommunity well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/28/senate-section/article/S6632-4", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF BATH, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the 125th \nanniversary of the founding of the community of Bath, SD. After 125 \nyears, this progressive community will have a chance to reflect on its \npast and future, and I congratulate the people of Bath for all that \nthey have accomplished.\n  Bath is located in northeast South Dakota, within Brown County. The \narea that now makes up Bath Township was first settled by a trapper \nnamed Theodore A. Chose in 1878. As early as 1881, religious services \nwere held by a Presbyterian clergyman from Watertown, and the first \nbuilding, a hotel, was erected. In 1882 the Bath school district was \norganized, and by 1884, the civil township was organized along the same \nlines as the school district.\n  Today, Bath has come a long way from the days when several general \nstores and lumber yards made up the sum total of commerce. The town now \nboasts a variety of businesses, including those in both the services \nand manufacturing sectors. It also offers a variety of employment \nopportunities both within the township and in nearby Aberdeen, the \nmetro area closest to Bath.\n  Bath has grown into a credit to Brown County and to the State of \nSouth Dakota. The people of Bath celebrated their achievements June 24-\n25. I am proud to join with the community members of Bath in \ncelebrating the last 125 years and looking forward to a promising \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/28/senate-section/article/S6632-5", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/28/senate-section/article/S6632-6", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  In executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/28/senate-section/article/S6632-7", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6632-S6633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  At 2:20 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby\n\n[[Page S6633]]\n\nMs. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 5403.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize \ncapitation grants to increase the number of nursing faculty and \nstudents, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would request the Chair to inform me \nwhen I have used 6 minutes of the 10 minutes I have requested.\n  We have a lot of bipartisan battles in the Senate. I am going to try \nto bring an issue to the consideration of the Senate and to their \nattention which I believe is very bipartisan. It affects the State of \nAlaska, the State of North Dakota, the State of Illinois, and the State \nof Maine. It affects us all. What I am speaking to is the shortage of \nnurses in America.\n  We face a critical shortage of nurses. The U.S. Department of Health \nand Human Services looked at all of the licensed nurses and found that \nin the year 2000, this country was 110,000 nurses short of what was \nnecessary to provide adequate health care. By 2005, the shortage had \ndoubled to 219,000 nurses. By 2020, we will be more than 1 million \nnurses short of what is necessary to maintain quality health care in \nAmerica.\n  To avoid this shortage which the Department of Health and Human \nServices projects, we have to substantially increase the number of \nnursing graduates and those entering the workforce each year. Just to \nreplace the nurses who are retiring, we need to increase student \nenrollment by at least 40 percent. The baseline supply for nurses--as \nyou can see on this chart--in our country, for the current time and \nthrough the year 2020, is on a steady downward flow, whereas demand \ngoes up dramatically. If we had 90 percent more nursing graduates, we \nstill would not reach the projected demand in America as baby boomers \nreach the point where they need help and many others need quality \nnursing.\n  The problem is that there are not enough teachers at schools of \nnursing. That is what it comes down to. Last year, nursing schools \nacross America denied admission to 35,000 qualified students because \nthere just weren't enough teachers.\n  In my home State of Illinois, schools of nursing are denying \nqualified students admittance because of the shortage of teachers. This \nis an indication\n\n[[Page S6636]]\n\nhere. These are B.A. and graduate nursing programs in Illinois. These \nare the enrollees and these are the numbers turned away. As you can \nsee, from the year 2002 to the present time, we are up to 2000 \npotential nursing graduates who are turned away each year despite their \nqualifications because, sadly, we can't keep up with teaching them.\n  The American Association of Colleges of Nursing surveyed more than \n400 schools of nursing this last year. Two-thirds of the schools, \nrepresented by the blue part of this pie chart--69 percent reported \nvacancies on their faculty. An additional 15 percent said that they \nwere fully staffed but still needed more faculty.\n  Statistics paint a bleak picture for the availability of nursing \nfaculty now and into the future. Take a look at the age of full-time \nnursing faculty across America. Unfortunately, that reflects an older \npopulation now teaching in our nursing schools, soon to retire. The \nmedian age of a doctoral-prepared nursing faculty member in America is \n52. The average age of retirement for faculty is 62. It is expected \nthat 200 to 300 doctorally prepared faculty will be eligible for \nretirement each year from 2005 to 2012, reducing even more the faculty \navailable to train the nurses we need.\n  We think help should be on the way, and it should start in the \nSenate. Our leader on the Democratic side of the aisle is Senator \nBarbara Mikulski of Maryland. She has been the strong voice for nurses \nas long as she has served in the Senate. I am happy today to join her \nin introducing the Nurse Education Expansion and Development Act. The \nAct would provide schools of nursing with grants to hire and retain new \nfaculty, purchase educational equipment, enhance clinical laboratories \nand expand and repair infrastructure. This bill would also require the \nGovernment Accountability Office, the GAO, to report on ways to \nincrease participation in the nurse faculty profession.\n  Nurses care for our kids, our grandkids, our parents--people whom we \nlove. We know the difference they make in everyone's life and \nincreasingly we are noticing the difference when we do not have enough \nnurses, these dedicated men and women, when we need them the most. We \nmust take deliberate action now to solve this critical health care \nproblem. I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support \nthis Mikulski-Durbin legislation. I think this is an important step in \nthe direction toward quality health care for generations to come.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3588\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Nurse Education, Expansion, \n     and Development Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) While the Nurse Reinvestment Act (Public Law 107-205) \n     helped to increase applications to schools of nursing by 175 \n     percent, schools of nursing have been unable to accommodate \n     the influx of interested students because they have an \n     insufficient number of nurse educators. It is estimated \n     that--\n       (A) in the 2005-2006 school year--\n       (i) 66 percent of schools of nursing had both 1 to 16 \n     vacant faculty positions and needed additional faculty; and\n       (ii) an additional 15.7 percent of schools of nursing \n     needed additional faculty, but lacked the resources needed to \n     add more positions; and\n       (B) 41,683 eligible candidates were denied admission to \n     schools of nursing in 2005, primarily due to an insufficient \n     number of faculty members.\n       (2) A growing number of nurses with doctoral degrees are \n     choosing careers outside of education. Over the last few \n     years, there has been a 12 percent increase in doctoral \n     nursing graduates seeking employment outside the education \n     profession.\n       (3) The average age of nurse faculty at retirement is 62.5 \n     years. With the average age of doctorally-prepared professors \n     currently at 57.5 years, a wave of retirements is expected \n     within the next 10 years.\n       (4) Master's and doctoral programs in nursing are not \n     producing a large enough pool of potential nurse educators to \n     meet the projected demand for nurses over the next 10 years. \n     While graduations from master's and doctoral programs in \n     nursing rose by 10.5 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively, \n     in the 2005-2006 school year, projections still demonstrate a \n     shortage of nurse faculty. Given current trends, there will \n     be at least 2,616 unfilled faculty positions in 2012.\n       (5) According to the November 2005 Monthly Labor Review \n     from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than 1,200,000 new \n     and replacement nurses will be needed by 2014.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to improve efficiency in the Federal Government \nthrough the use of high-performance green buildings, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works,\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise \ntoday to introduce the High-Performance Green Buildings Act of 2006. \nThis bipartisan bill will go far to further expand Federal green \nbuilding initiatives and ensure our Federal buildings and schools are \nsafe, efficient and good for the environment.\n  I would like to thank all of the bill's cosponsors for working with \nme in a bipartisan manner to introduce this important legislation and \nimplore my colleagues to join us in moving this legislation forward. \nNot only will this bill improve Federal building efficiency and \nemployee health and productivity, it also demonstrates the leadership \nof the Federal Government on high-performance green buildings. This \nbill seeks to codify existing green building initiatives outlined in \nmemorandums of understanding or executive orders, and further enhances \nongoing green building programs all across the Federal Government, \nincluding the White House. I commend the past and current leadership of \nthe White House Office of the Federal Environmental Executive for all \nthey have done within the administration.\n  Preliminary studies are showing that high-performance green buildings \ngenerate huge savings in utility costs due to their efficient operating \nsystems. These studies have also demonstrated that high-performance \ngreen buildings provide a healthier work environment for the occupants, \nresulting in fewer absences due to illness. This in turn increases \nworker productivity and ensures fewer health related costs. All of \nthese savings are generated, while sustaining very little impact on \nsurrounding environments.\n  According to the Department of Energy, throughout the United States \nbuildings account for 39 percent of total energy use, 70 percent of \nelectricity consumption, 38.1 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and \n30 percent of raw materials use. The Environmental Protection Agency \nreports that building related construction and demolition debris \naccount for nearly 37 percent of the total nonindustrial waste, \ngenerating 136 million tons of waste in a single year. Building \noccupants also consume 12 percent of potable water consumption. Why not \nbuild buildings that strive to conserve our precious resources, reduce \nthe harmful pollutants that are damaging to the environment and utilize \nrecycled building materials?\n  In an era of great security concern, green buildings have reduced \nenergy requirements and may use renewable sources of energy that are \noff the electricity grid. Green buildings also use less water and some \neven collect rainwater to use throughout the building. Should there be \na terrorist act that damages or destroys our Nation's resources, these \nbuildings could assist in keeping our government up and running.\n  There is no downside to utilizing high-performance buildings. This \ninitiative is taking off in the private sector. According to the U.S. \nGreen Building Council, there are 500 certified green buildings across \nthe United States with 3,000 in the pipeline. This legislation would \nensure that the Federal Government is keeping pace with the real world \nand doing its part to protect the environment and provide a safe \nworkplace for its employees.\n  In my home State of Vermont, environmental quality and economic \nopportunity are inextricably linked and green buildings are a visible \nrepresentation of this connection. The design, construction, and \nfunctioning of green buildings will not only enhance environmental \nquality, worker productivity, and student learning, but will also \ncontribute to the enhancement of a new economy. Environmental \ntechnologies and applications represent a new value added area of \neconomic growth that is both efficient and effective.\n  The Federal Government can learn from progressive policies being \nimplemented in the private sector, State government and our Nation's \nuniversities. For example, the University of Vermont, understanding the \npositive environmental, economic, and human resources benefits, \nrecently adopted a green building policy for its campus that would \nensure that all new construction and major renovations be at the \ncertified level of the U.S. Green Building Council's, USGBC, Leadership \nin Energy and Environmental Design, LEED, green building rating system. \nThis policy is both responsible and affordable.\n  In the 108th Congress, I introduced S. 2620, the High-Performance \nGreen Buildings Act of 2004. This new bill updates that earlier version \nand includes a few new provisions. This legislation will coordinate the \nefforts within the\n\n[[Page S6638]]\n\nFederal Government to promote high-performance green buildings, provide \npublic outreach, and expand existing research.\n  The General Services Administration, GSA, is the largest civilian \nlandlord in the United States, with over 8,900 buildings in their \ncurrent inventory. This legislation creates an office within GSA to \noversee the green building efforts of agencies within the government. \nThe GSA is a natural leader to focus on our Federal buildings and \nensure that they are safe, healthy, and efficient. The GSA is working \nto provide quality work environments for Federal workers through green \ninitiatives and is currently conducting research on how best to \nincrease workplace effectiveness and occupant comfort. This bill will \nstrengthen what they have already started.\n  The bill creates a green building advisory committee to advise the \noffice within GSA. The committee will be comprised of key \nrepresentatives from each relevant agency, State, and local \ngovernments, green building associations, experts within the building \ncommunity, and environmental health experts for both adults and \nchildren. This committee will enable the Federal Government to stay up \nto date with technology and the latest advancements to ensure that \nhigh-performance green buildings operate with the maximum efficiency \nand provide a healthier environment for their occupants.\n  In addition, research efforts will be expanded to focus on buildings \nand the impact their systems have on human health and worker \nproductivity. We just don't know enough about the impact of the built \nenvironment on its occupants. Take natural daylight for instance. \nStudies are showing that a simple thing like exposure to daylight \nactually makes employees more productive and reduces absences due to \nillness. I would like to pursue this further, as well as an indoor air \nquality program for all Federal facilities. We need to not only ensure \nthe safety of working employees for existing buildings, but also during \nconstruction and renovation of facilities.\n  The High-Performance Green Buildings Act also requires that a good \nhard look be taken at the budget process we have used for years and \nexplore ways to improve the approval process for government projects. \nWe need to grow with the times and ensure that our budget process \nallows us to take full advantage of life-cycle costing. This means that \nwe allow our financial experts to factor in savings that green \nbuildings generate over time, and not just look at the upfront cost of \na building. It has been documented that high-performance green \nbuildings recover any initial upfront costs from incorporating \nefficient systems within the first few years of operation. The average \nlife of a Federal building is over 50 years. In the times of soaring \nbudget deficits, it is imperative the Federal Government pursue all \ncost-saving options.\n  High-performance green buildings are not just for Federal buildings, \nbut involve any type of building, including schools. This legislation \nfocuses on providing healthier, more efficient school facilities for \nour children. The Government Accountability Office reported years ago \nthat over 14 million children have their health affected by poor \nconditions in schools. The Healthy Schools Network is now reporting 32 \nmillion children are at high risk of getting sick from their school \nfacility. It is unacceptable to stand by and let the Nation's children \nbecome ill from preventable causes. This bill takes a modest step \nforward and provides $10 million in grants to state and local education \nagencies for technical assistance and the implementation of \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's, EPA, programs to address \nenvironmental conditions of our schools like the Tools for Schools \nProgram and the Healthy Schools Environmental Assessment Tool, Healthy \nSEAT. The bill will help schools develop plans to focus on the design, \nconstruction, and renovation of school facilities, and look at \nsystematic improvements for school siting, indoor air quality, reducing \ncontaminants, and other health issues. This legislation also encourages \nresearch to study the effects these systems are having on student \nhealth and productivity. Our children deserve to learn in an \nenvironment that is safe and conducive to learning.\n  This bill will also promote leadership within the Federal Government \nby requiring all new construction and acquisition be green, that leases \nfor Federal employees be energy efficient facilities and include green \ndesign features, and that guidelines be issued on how to best \nrenegotiate existing leases to adopt these principles. Leadership is \nalso promoted through Federal incentives for government agencies to \nbuild high-performance green buildings, as well as expanding the \nmonitoring of each Federal agency's performance in meeting green \nbuilding requirements and initiatives. It also creates a clearinghouse \nto keep individuals and entities, including the Federal Government, \ninformed on the information and services that the office would provide.\n  Finally, by supporting this legislation, we will advance our \nunderstanding of green building technologies and implications and \nsimultaneously advance our society. We have the capacity. This \nlegislation provides the Federal leadership to convert our academic \nbuildings to integral components of the curriculum rather than to just \nfacilities that house programs. As learning centers and demonstration \nfacilities, these green buildings will be an example to all of us to be \nenvironmentally responsible citizens.\n  I strongly encourage your support of the High-Performance Green \nBuildings Act of 2006 and ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nHigh-Performance Green Buildings Act of 2006 be printed in the Record, \nas well as the attached letters of support for the bill.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3591\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       (a) Federal Demonstration Project.--There is authorized to \n     be appropriated to carry out the Federal demonstration \n     project described in section 401(b)(1) $10,000,000 for the \n     period of fiscal years 2008 through 2013, to remain available \n     until expended.\n       (b) University Demonstration Projects.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out the university demonstration \n     projects described in section 401(b)(2) $10,000,000 for the \n     period of fiscal years 2008 through 2013, to remain available \n     until expended.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            The American Institute\n\n\n                                                of Architects,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 15, 2006.\n     Hon. James M. Jeffords,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Jeffords: The American Institute of Architects \n     has identified ``sustainability'' as the number one issue \n     among our 75,000 members nationwide. We are concerned about \n     the effects that America's pattern of energy use is having on \n     the world's climate. And we are particularly concerned about \n     the adverse effects that thoughtlessly designed buildings can \n     have on the natural environment.\n       We believe that it is currently possible to design and \n     operate buildings of all types in ways that conserve \n     resources and drastically reduce their environmental impact. \n     For that reason, we strongly support incentives to create \n     more sustainable architecture.\n       The High Performance Green Buildings Act of 2006, which you \n     are sponsoring, is an excellent start toward moving the \n     federal government in the direction of sustainable \n     architecture. The bill will create a specific Office of High \n     Performance Green Buildings within the General Services \n     Administration as well as an Advisory Committee of green \n     building experts to assist that office in advancing the cause \n     of sustainability within the federal government.\n       The bill will also mandate the consideration of life-cycle \n     costing in the design and procurement of federal buildings; a \n     concept long supported by the AIA. The bill will create a \n     grants program for high performance and healthy schools, as \n     well as health-based guidelines for school construction. It \n     is a matter of great concern to the AIA that our Nation's \n     school facilities are in a degraded condition and that \n     significant improvement in student health and productivity \n     could be achieved through upgrading the structures that now \n     house our next generations.\n       The AIA is particularly supportive of the provisions of the \n     bill that call for revisions to the Federal Acquisition \n     Regulations to incorporate green design criteria into Federal \n     contracting for construction or renovation of Federal \n     buildings.\n       The AIA commends you for your leadership in taking on these \n     complex issues that are closely intertwined with the Nation's \n     environmental, energy and educational future. The AIA \n     supports your efforts, supports your bill and would like to \n     work with you to get it passed into law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Christine W. McEntee,\n     Executive Vice President/CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Healthy Schools Network, Inc.,\n\n                                                    June 23, 2006.\n     Support for High-Performance Green Buildings Act of 2006.\n\n     Hon. James Jeffords,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Jeffords: Children do better with a little \n     fresh air and sunshine, indoors and out. The call for \n     healthier schools is a ``back to basics'' drive, recalling \n     neighborhood schools with high ceilings and tall windows that \n     captured natural light and ventilation and with durable \n     floors and walls that were easy to maintain.\n       Healthy Schools Network, Inc. is a national environmental \n     health not for profit representing parent, environment, \n     health, and education groups and individuals who are \n     dedicated to ensuring that every child and school employee \n     has an environmentally healthy school. Our reports, \n     informational services, and advocacy have shaped new \n     policies, laws, regulations, and funds for school facilities \n     in New York and Federally, and fostered local and state \n     coalitions Nationwide. We were honored to receive a US EPA \n     Children's Health Protection Award in 2005 for our Healthy \n     Schools/Healthy Kids Clearinghouse that has helped parents, \n     schools, and nonprofits in every state.\n       We support the High-Performance Green Buildings Act of 2006 \n     and the creation of an Office of High-Performance Green \n     Buildings. We strongly support the Act's Title II Healthy \n     High Performance Schools provisions to improve our nation's \n     school facilities and our children's health and learning.\n       Title II authorizes U.S. EPA, advised by Education and \n     Health and Human Services, to make grants to the states to \n     develop school environmental quality plans, including state \n     standards for school design that incorporate energy \n     efficiency, indoor air quality, and low-emission interior \n     finishes and products, as well as resource conservation. This \n     one step alone will allow each state to adapt design \n     protocols for use by local schools, as well as to consider \n     how best to ``mix and match'' public and private resources \n     for implementation. In addition, the creation of systematic \n     state plans could identify ongoing school environmental \n     problems and propose locally appropriate and system-wide \n     improvements for siting, indoor air quality, lead \n     contamination and pest problems, ``green'' purchasing, and \n     outline plans for using schools as emergency centers.\n       The Act also authorizes U.S. EPA to develop Federal \n     guidelines for the siting of schools, taking into account the \n     special vulnerability of children to hazardous substances, \n     modes of transportation, and the potential use of schools as \n     emergency shelters. U.S. EPA and the Agency for Toxic \n     Substances and Disease Registry have collected data on \n     schools sited near or adjacent to hazardous facilities.\n       In addition, Title II authorizes US EPA, advised by \n     Education and Health and Human Services, to issue guidelines \n     for use by states in developing and implementing an \n     environmental health program for schools. This program would \n     provide research on children's health and school facilities \n     and provide technical assistance on siting, design, \n     management, and operation of schools; collaborate with the \n     Federally sponsored pediatric environmental health specialty \n     units to assist with any onsite environmental investigations; \n     and assist states and the public in understanding and \n     improving the environmental health of children.\n       This Nation has a long way to go to ensure that our \n     children have healthy learning places. In 1996, the US GAO \n     estimated that the poor condition of schools daily eroded the \n     health of 14 million children. US EPA estimates that half of \n     the nation's 120,000 schools have compromised indoor \n     environmental quality. Indoor air pollution is a top-five \n     human health hazard; asthma is the leading cause of \n     absenteeism and the leading occupational disease among \n     teachers. In 2004, the US Department of Education Office of \n     the Under Secretary published its Congressionally mandated \n     National Priority Study A Summary of Scientific Findings on \n     Adverse Effects of Indoor Environments on Students' Health, \n     Academic Peiformance and Attendance (http://www.iehinc.com/\nPDF/effects%20on%20students.pdf), finding that the evidence \n     suggested that poor environments adversely influences student \n     health, performance, and attendance. In the national report \n     Lessons Learned (2006), which presents state by state data \n     analyses and stories of sick or injured children, our office \n     and our two dozen organizational collaborators estimated the \n     number of children at high risk at 32 million of the 54 \n     million enrolled. (See http://www.healthyschools.org/guides \n     materials.html)\n       The need for healthier schools is now. At a time when our \n     nation is demanding a better performance from every child and \n     from every school, we need to ensure that every child has an \n     environmentally healthy school. Healthier school facilities, \n     designed, built, and cleaned and maintained as healthy high \n     performance facilities--often at no additional local cost--\n     are known to positively affect children's performance and \n     attendance and teacher productivity. They are also associated \n     with lower suspension rates. Designing more energy efficient \n     facilities or replacing old heating and ventilating systems \n     with up to date efficient systems or systems using renewable \n     energy resources could save schools and their taxpayers \n     billions of dollars annually.\n       We commend you for your leadership on these important \n     issues and look forward to working with you and the sponsors \n     towards the timely enactment and funding for this important \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Claire L. Barnett,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n[[Page S6643]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                          Environmental and Energy\n\n\n                                              Study Institute,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 27, 2006.\n     Hon. James M. Jeffords,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Jeffords: The Environmental and Energy Study \n     Institute (EESI) strongly supports the High-Performance Green \n     Buildings Act of 2006 you are introducing to advance the \n     development of green building facilities for both federal \n     agencies and schools. This legislation will:\n       --increase U.S. competitiveness in the increasingly global \n     green building market\n       --accelerate expansion of the green building market within \n     the United States through widespread Federal procurement, \n     expanded research, and establishment of a green building \n     information clearinghouse\n       --improve student and worker health and productivity \n     through better indoor air quality\n       --increase U.S. energy savings\n       --support the growth of domestic recycled and biobased \n     product markets that can help reduce the country's reliance \n     on imported oil and\n       --reduce the environmental impacts of the country's built \n     environment.\n       The General Services Administration (GSA) owns and operates \n     more than 500,000 buildings with over 3 billion square feet, \n     making it the largest landlord in the United States. With \n     this amount of owned space, the GSA has the influence to \n     ensure that Federal buildings across the country are shining \n     examples of smart building design. Through incentives laid \n     out in this legislation, the Federal Government can lead the \n     country by example in incorporating green building designs \n     that save buildings money in operational costs. That is good \n     government!\n       Furthermore, green buildings have improved indoor air \n     quality; this too saves the Federal Government money due to \n     reduced sickness and absenteeism among its workforce. The \n     American Lung Association estimates that indoor air pollution \n     costs businesses more than $100 billion a year due to death, \n     sick days, direct medical costs, loss of productivity, and \n     damage to materials and equipment. The Environmental \n     Protection Agency projects that 3,500 to 6,500 premature \n     deaths per year are the result of the effects of indoor air \n     pollutants.\n       Due to the heightened susceptibility of children to \n     airborne pollutants because of their less developed immune \n     systems, EESI applauds your bill's provisions to provide \n     schools grant assistance as well as technical assistance in \n     developing green building design. In fact, 20 percent of the \n     U.S. population, nearly 55 million people, are in U.S. \n     elementary and secondary schools, 110,000 of which were \n     reported to have unsatisfactory indoor air quality in the \n     1990s. Without grants like those outlined in your bill, most \n     school districts would not be able to fund green building \n     projects. EESI's previous work on this topic has found that \n     schools need Federal studies. They need a clearinghouse to \n     provide information, and they need grants to implement these \n     projects and realize their far-reaching benefits.\n       EESI strongly supports the use of recycled and biobased \n     products as components of the bill's green building design. \n     Fabricated from renewable domestic crops, biobased products \n     do not ``offgas'' or emit airborne toxins like their \n     petroleum-based counterparts which can aggravate respiratory \n     systems and negatively affect health. Biobased products, \n     along with improvements in ventilation, enhance indoor air \n     quality and improve occupant health. They are also \n     biodegradable and therefore not harmful to the environment. \n     Furthermore, biobased products can be produced domestically; \n     providing evermore economic opportunities to every state's \n     agricultural sector.\n       Even as U.S. Federal agencies and schools face tightening \n     budgets, many green building measures can be incorporated \n     with minimal up-front costs while yielding enormous savings \n     during a building's lifetime. Your bill's provision to \n     establish an Office of High Performance Green Buildings would \n     elevate attention to this issue and would play an essential \n     role as provider/distributor of solid information so that \n     agencies can pursue ``greening'' of buildings more easily, \n     efficiently and economically.\n       Demonstration projects can engage undergraduate and \n     graduate students--the leaders of tomorrow--who will learn \n     first-hand about these innovations and take the experience \n     with them in their careers. These projects also will \n     incorporate smart siting and planning so that commuters can \n     access them through many modes of transportation including \n     mass transit, biking and walking. By incorporating these \n     concerns, these projects not only address the energy consumed \n     by the buildings themselves but the energy consumed in our \n     transportation sector.\n       U.S. buildings consume about 40 percent of the country's \n     annual primary energy use. Because the Federal Government is \n     the country's largest energy consumer, your bill truly helps \n     the Federal Government lead by example.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Carol Werner,\n     Executive Director, Environmental and Energy Study Institute.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Schumer, \n        Mr. Harkin, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 3593 A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide \nadditional support to students; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my colleagues \nin introducing the Student Debt Relief Act to lower college expenses \nfor millions of families and help ensure that cost is not a barrier to \na college education.\n  Earlier today, my colleagues and I released a report on ``The College \nCost Crunch,'' which contains detailed information showing that \nstudents and their families in every State are struggling with \nskyrocketing college costs and rising student loan debt.\n  The report makes clear that the American dream is at risk unless \ncollege becomes more affordable. Parents and students know how \nimportant a college education is in our rapidly changing world, and \nthey're willing to make immense sacrifices in order to afford it. But \nthat sacrifice is getting harder and harder as college costs go up and \nas student debt increases as well.\n  It is unacceptable in this era when higher education in the United \nStates is becoming more important, that it is also becoming more and \nmore expensive. As the report shows, the cost of attending a public 4-\nyear college has increased 32 percent since 2000, while median family \nincomes have increased by only 6 percent over the same time period.\n  Today, the cost of attendance is over $12,000 at public colleges and \nover $26,000 at private colleges, and federal student aid has not kept \npace with these rising costs. The maximum Pell grant covered 51 percent \nof the cost of college in 1986, but it covered only 35 percent of the \ncost last year.\n  As a result, families and students are borrowing more than ever from \nthe federal government and from private banks to finance higher \neducation. Sixty-two percent of undergraduates at 4-year colleges are \nborrowing to finance their educations. The average student graduates \nwith over $19,000 in student loan debt.\n  We need to solve this debt crisis now before it spirals even farther \nout of control.\n  Ensuring access to college is key to our opportunity, our economy, \nand to our values as a nation.\n  It affects opportunity, because each year 400,000 qualified students \ndo not go to a 4-year college, because they cannot afford to do so.\n  It affects our economy, because we need to equip all of our citizens \nwith a college education to compete effectively in the global economy.\n  It affects our values, because high college costs and high student \ndebt are discouraging young Americans from taking lower paying public \nservice jobs, from buying homes, and even from getting married and \nstarting a family.\n  On July 1, to make matters even worse, students and families face one \nof the biggest student loan interest rate hikes in the history of the \nprogram--almost 2 percentage points in a single year.\n  Our bill deals with these issues in several ways.\n  First, it provides mandatory funding for an immediate increase in the \nmaximum Pell grant from $4,050 to $5,100, with additional increases \neach year.\n  The bill also reforms the current student loan programs and uses the \nsavings to pay for additional increases in need-based aid. This \nproposal--known as the Student Aid Reward Act, or the STAR Act--\ngenerates $13 billion over 10 years for new Pell grants--at zero cost \nto the government and taxpayers--by encouraging schools to use the more \nefficient Direct Loan Program instead of the guaranteed loan program.\n  The bill cuts student loan interest rates in half--to 3.4 percent for \nstudents and 4.25 percent for parents. This change will save average \nborrowers nearly $4,000 in interest payments over the life of their \nloans.\n  The bill gives borrowers the option to help keep loan payments \nmanageable by tying the payments to income level and capping the \npayments at 15 percent of a borrower's income. This provision will \nenable young people to pursue their passions in public service careers \nsuch as teaching and social work, without worrying about making ends \nmeet as they repay their debt.\n  The bill also extends and expands a popular college tuition tax \ndeduction,\n\n[[Page S6644]]\n\nwhich Republicans allowed to expire at the end of last year. The IRS \nestimates that nearly 4.7 million students and families took advantage \nof the deduction in 2004, which allowed them to deduct up to $4,000 in \ntuition expenses from their taxes.\n  In Massachusetts, these changes would help thousands of students. If \nthe Pell grant is increased to $5,100, Massachusetts would receive $63 \nmillion in new Pell grant aid. 4,700 additional students would receive \ngrants, and the average grant would increase by more than $620--from \n$2,329 to $2,950. If student loan interest rates are cut in half, \nstudents in Massachusetts would save $3,470 over the life of their \nloans.\n  With more options to make loan payments contingent on income, new \nteachers in Massachusetts, who earn $34,000 a year, would have a \nreduction of 22 percent in their monthly loan payments, and after 10 \nyears, their loans would be forgiven.\n  Congress needs to act now to make education a priority and do more to \nhelp struggling students and families.\n  But the administration and the Republican Congress have other \npriorities. Earlier this year, they perpetrated the biggest raid on \nstudent aid in the history of the program--stripping $12 billion from \nthe program to offset tax giveaways for the wealthiest Americans.\n  If we returned tax rates for the wealthiest Americans to their levels \nwhen President Bush took office, we could pay for this entire proposal, \nand pay for other priorities for struggling middle class families as \nwell.\n  Some of these proposals pay for themselves by cutting wasteful bank \nsubsidies from the student loan programs and directing those funds to \nhelp students afford college. Report after report has shown that the \nDirect Loan Program saves taxpayer money. It is time for the Republican \nCongress to stand up to their friends in the lending industry and do \nwhat's right for students and families and the Nation.\n  We also need new investments in education if we are serious about \nreviving the American dream of a college education.\n  When Congress passed the G.I. bill after World War II, the Nation \nreaped a benefit of $7 for every $1 invested in sending our returning \ntroops to college.\n  We need that kind of investment again to assure prosperity for our \nfamilies and our Nation in the years ahead. The Student Debt Relief Act \nis a good step in the right direction, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that our report and the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3593\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 3594. A bill to help protect the public against the threat of \nattacks targeting nuclear power plants; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Secure \nNuclear Facilities Act of 2006, which addresses an unacceptable gap in \nour Nation's homeland security. My bill would hold commercial nuclear \npowerplants to the same high security standards to which government \nnuclear facilities are subject.\n  There are currently 104 nuclear powerplants licensed to operate in \nthe United States, including two plants, with two reactors each, in my \nhome state of California.\n  These plants are potential targets for terrorists, and we are not \ndoing enough to ensure they are protected. The 9/11 Commission report, \nissued on July 22, 2004, stated that nuclear powerplants were among the \ntargets considered in the original plan for the September 11, 2001, \nattacks.\n  An attack on a nuclear plant would be disastrous. The meltdown of a \nnuclear powerplant's nuclear reactor core, release of the spent nuclear \nfuel located at the site, removal from the site of radioactive \nmaterials, or other violation of the plant's security would greatly \nendanger public health and safety. Unfortunately, there are reports of \nnuclear plant operators' failure to effectively address vital security \nissues, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's failure to hold them \nsufficiently accountable.\n  To make matters worse, commercial nuclear plant operators are not \ncurrently required to defend their plants against theft and diversion \nof nuclear material. Nonweapon nuclear facilities operated by the \ngovernment, on the other hand, are required to defend against not only \ndirect attacks, but also theft and diversion of nuclear material. This \ndouble standard makes no sense.\n  Commercial nuclear plants contain materials that terrorists might \nattempt to steal, just like government nuclear facilities. The Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission, NRC, concedes that terrorists might use these \nhighly radioactive materials in a radiological bomb or, with the right \nequipment, reprocess it into weapons-grade material. But according to \nthe NRC, it is not reasonable to expect a private facility to cope with \nthis threat, because private facilities do not have the same resources \nas government facilities.\n  The NRC's argument is deeply flawed. If nuclear plant owners and \noperators cannot address the full spectrum of terrorist threats they \nface, then they should not be in business. There is too much at stake \nin terms of the dangers posed by these threats for us to allow \ncontinued low security standards for commercial nuclear plants.\n  My bill would require commercial nuclear plants to defend against the \nsame potential threats as government nuclear facilities, including \nthreat and diversion of nuclear materials. The bill would also \nstrengthen State and local responders' ability to aid nuclear plants in \ncase of an attack by terrorists. It offers grants to State and local \nresponders to facilitate evacuations and medical treatment, as well as \ninteroperable communications among first responders and plant \noperators.\n  The Secure Nuclear Facilities Act of 2006 would make our country \nsafer by ensuring better security at commercial nuclear plants. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this important bill.\n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Carper):\n  S. 3595. A bill to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to \nestablish the United States Emergency Management Authority, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3595\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I thank Chairman Collins who has been \ngood enough to allow me to speak for a few moments first because I have \nan engagement I am supposed to be at around noon.\n  I am pleased to join with Chairman Collins today to both introduce \nand speak in favor of this legislation to reinvent and rebuild FEMA \ninto an agency capable of responding efficiently and effectively to a \ncatastrophe the size and scope of Hurricane Katrina, but also to the \nnatural disasters that in the normal course of events have affected and \nwill affect the American people.\n  The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee spent 7 \nmonths last year and into this year investigating the failed Government \nresponse to Hurricane Katrina. Our report recounts a double tragedy of \nepic proportions, a tragedy caused, in the first instance, by nature, \nand then a tragedy compounded by human folly and the failure of \nleadership, including the failure of preparation.\n  We found that government at all levels--from the Federal Government \nto the local government, from the White House to FEMA to the Governor's \noffice in Louisiana to the mayor's office in New Orleans--were \nunprepared, even though the hurricane and its effect on the New Orleans \nlevee system had long been predicted. Likewise, all levels of \ngovernment were unequipped to deal with the human suffering that \nfollowed the storm's landfall and galvanized the attention that \nultimately produced the enormous embarrassment and anger of the \nAmerican people as we watched our fellow Americans suffering in New \nOrleans and throughout the gulf coast without the support and help they \nhave a right to expect from their government at all levels in a time of \ndisaster.\n  These failings were caused by negligence, lack of resources, lack of \ncapability, and a lack of leadership. Though we can legislate \nrequirements for those in positions of leadership--and we do in the \nlegislation we are introducing--we cannot legislate leadership. That is \na personal quality. But we can legislate bold changes at the Federal \nlevel that are critical for our Nation to develop the capacity \nnecessary to protect our people in times of disaster, whether natural \nor terrorist.\n  So in the aftermath of our report, we made a number of \nrecommendations about what we believed on a bipartisan basis was needed \nto improve our preparations, response, and recovery the next time \ndisaster strikes, as it surely will.\n  One of our recommendations--perhaps the key recommendation--is to \nrebuild FEMA into a more powerful, better managed, better integrated, \nbetter supported organization. Our recommendation was to give the \nreinvented FEMA, probably for the first time in its history, the \nauthority and muscle to respond to natural disasters and to \ncatastrophes--which is what Katrina was--in the way the American people \nhave a right to expect their Government to respond--with speed, with \nefficiency, and with effect.\n  Today we introduce legislation that will do that. We call this new \norganization the U.S. Emergency Management Authority, U.S.-EMA. But no \nmatter what we call it, this organization, we have concluded, must be \nin the Department of Homeland Security; in fact, must be at the core of \nthat Department, just as FEMA was originally intended to do when we \nproposed the new Department in 2002 based on the recommendations of the \nHart-Rudman Commission which said that the new Department must be \ncentered around FEMA.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is the first step in this \nprocess. Chairman Collins and I expect soon to introduce a broader bill \nthat will encompass all of our report's key recommendations. But we \nbegin today by reaffirming how important it is to keep this critical \nnational emergency management function in the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and how critical it is to strengthen it and rejoin the \nfunctions of disaster response with disaster preparedness.\n  Our investigation of Hurricane Katrina made it clear to us that \npreparedness and response are two sides of the same coin. In the years \nbefore Katrina, FEMA, the agency charged with coordinating our Nation's \nresponse to terrorist attacks or natural disasters, too often was out \nof the loop when critical decisions about how to prepare--such as how \nto spend billions of dollars in grants--were made. Exercises were \ndesigned and held without serious input by FEMA. FEMA's ability to \nrespond was crippled because it was not central to preparedness, and \nthus did not have the close relationships needed with state and local \nofficials on the front lines. The preparers and the responders need to \nbe working hand in hand with State and local officials, other Federal \nagencies, and the private and non-profit sectors if both functions are \nto work as well as we expect them to.\n  Our legislation first and foremost will ensure that our preparedness \nefforts are closely linked, inseparable from the capabilities we need \nto respond.\n  Our investigation also made clear that part of FEMA's problem during \nHurricane Katrina was that it was an agency weakened by years of budget \nand staff cuts. At the time the \nhurricane made landfall, FEMA had been operating with a 15-percent \nvacancy rate for over a year. And it had a senior political management \nlargely without emergency management experience.\n  We address these problems by giving the new authority a special \nstatus within the Department of Homeland Security--the same special \nstatus the Coast Guard and Secret Service now have. With this status, \nchanges to the agency's functions and assets can only be made through \nstatute. Furthermore, we would require that the Administrator and other \nkey officials have the necessary experience and qualifications to get \nthe job done. U.S.-EMA will not be plagued by unqualified appointees \nlike FEMA has been.\n  The chairman and I also believe FEMA is too Washington-oriented and \ntoo disconnected from the real work of preparing for disasters where \nthey actually occur, so we envision a rebuilt agency with robust \nregional offices to focus on preparedness and response coordination \nwith local and State agencies. Each regional office would house a \npermanent ``strike team'' that would include representatives from other \nFederal agencies involved in emergency response to ensure the feds are \nfamiliar with regional threats and with state and local emergency \npersonnel.\n\n  I know some of my colleagues believe FEMA should be removed from DHS \nand given the full independent status it once had. But Senator Collins \nand I know this is not the solution. Removing the agency from the \nDepartment will only create additional problems. It would be like \nremoving the Army from the Department of Defense.\n  The U.S.-EMA, the Government's chief response agency, must have \naccess to the vast resources of the Department of Homeland Security and \nit needs to work seamlessly with the other agencies that have critical \nroles to play during catastrophes. The Coast Guard, which performed so \nadmirably during Katrina, might need to be activated. The Department's \ncommunications capabilities, law enforcement, intelligence offices, and \ninfrastructure protection will all be needed in response to a \ncatastrophe. In other words, the Federal response must be integrated \nand that will occur if all agencies have a history of working together \nwithin the same Department, if the officials know one another, and if \nthey ultimately serve the same Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  Furthermore, taking FEMA out of DHS would create more and duplicative \nbureaucracy. DHS would have to develop its own response capabilities. \nFEMA would have to develop its own preparedness capabilities. And both \nwould need to have tools for obtaining situational awareness. We do not \nhave the resources to waste on that kind of duplication.\n  Returning FEMA to an independent agency is not a guarantee that it \nwill be competent. Even when it was independent, FEMA never did develop \nthe capabilities needed to respond to a catastrophe like Katrina. In \nfact, its response to Hurricane Andrew in 1992--a much smaller storm, \nkilling about 50 people compared to Katrina's 1,500--was a disaster in \nitself, leading the Government Accounting Office to conclude that it \nhad ``serious doubts about whether FEMA is capable of responding to \ncatastrophic disasters.'' The agency did improve subsequent to \nHurricane\n\n[[Page S6723]]\n\nAndrew but never had the ability to respond to a storm such as Katrina.\n  The desperate conditions of gulf coast communities in the week after \nKatrina's landfall shocked the country. There are many other American \ncommunities that are similarly vulnerable--whether to a natural \ndisaster or to terrorist attack. The next catastrophe is coming. We \nknow that. We also know there are significant flaws in the Nation's \nreadiness. We can't afford another response like the one to Katrina.\n  Our proposal is not about fiddling with bureaucratic flow charts or \nre-branding, or rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. It is about \nplugging the gash in the hull and building a better deck. It is about \nsaving people's lives by bringing together the skills, resources, \nmissions, and authority for effective preparedness and response to \ncatastrophes when local and State agencies are overwhelmed by a terror \nattack or a natural disaster.\n  I ask my colleagues for their support of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield to Chairman Collins for the rest of the \nintroduction of this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Lieberman, in introducing a bill that addresses an \nurgent challenge facing our Nation: the need to ensure a strong and \neffective capability to deal with natural and manmade disasters, \nwhether they are hurricanes and ice storms or terrorist attacks and \npandemic diseases.\n  The U.S. Emergency Management Authority Act is intended to remedy \nmany of the glaring deficiencies that we all saw in the preparation and \nresponse to Hurricane Katrina. The U.S.-EMA bill reflects the evidence \nthat the Senate Homeland Security Committee examined during the course \nof an exhaustive and bipartisan 7-month investigation. The committee \nconvened 22 hearings, heard testimony from 85 witnesses, conducted more \nthan 325 formal interviews, and examined more than 838,000 pages of \ndocuments.\n  The result is a 737-page report that contains 88 recommendations for \nimproving our emergency management system at all levels of government.\n  Our legislation is an important first step toward implementing the \ncommittee's major recommendations for reforming FEMA. We will, as my \ncolleague, Senator Lieberman, indicated, be introducing subsequent \nlegislation to implement other recommendations.\n  The four key features of the bill that we introduce today will, \nfirst, give the new authority statutory protection against actions that \ncould diminish its capabilities and effectiveness, such as departmental \nreorganizations; second, ensure that the administrator of U.S.-EMA has \ndirect access to the President; third, reunite preparedness functions \nwith response capabilities while expanding U.S.-EMA's authority over \nother key functions; and fourth, strengthen the authority's regional \nfocus with Federal strike teams for faster, more coordinated and \neffective responses.\n  Senator Lieberman and I strongly believe that the best way to achieve \nthe goal of improving the Federal Government's ability to protect \nAmerican citizens from disaster, to mitigate the impacts, and to \npromote recovery is to strengthen and expand the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency, which we have proposed to rename the U.S. Emergency \nManagement Authority. As we saw so starkly and so tragically \ndemonstrated last year, FEMA simply must be made far more effective.\n  We believe FEMA needs special status within the Department of \nHomeland Security. Our bill would extend to the reconstituted FEMA the \nsame kinds of statutory protections against departmental \nreorganizations and raids on resources that currently shield the Coast \nGuard and the Secret Service. I acknowledge the critical role played by \nthe Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Lott, in helping us draft this \nportion of the bill.\n  FEMA would also require more regional focus and closer coordination \nwith local State entities, as well as with our nongovernmental \npartners. They are the first line of response in a disaster. Our \nlegislation bolsters the role of FEMA's regional centers by authorizing \nthe creation of multiagency strike teams to ensure rapid and effective \ncooperation with first responders and public officials in disaster \nareas. These strike teams would comprise representatives from all of \nthe Federal agencies that play a role in responding to the disasters. \nThey would train and exercise with their State and local counterparts.\n  I was struck by the fact that during our investigation, we learned \nthat FEMA sent officials from region I--New England--down to help out \nin New Orleans. Often they were the lead officials. These were trained \nand dedicated people, but just think how much more effective they could \nhave been if they had been stationed in the region and working \nregularly with the public officials in that region and with the first \nresponders.\n  We believe FEMA needs top-level access and visibility. The \nadministrator of the new U.S. Emergency Management Authority would be \ndesignated by our bill as the principal adviser to the President on \nmatters of emergency management and would have direct access to the \nPresident. This would establish the administrator in a capacity that is \nanalogous to that of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In \naddition, the administrator would be authorized to communicate any \nrecommendations, any needs and requirements directly to Congress.\n  Our intention to keep the strengthened FEMA as part of DHS has \nstirred more debate than perhaps any other of our recommendations \nemerging from the Katrina investigation. Some Members of this Chamber, \nas well as proponents of a bill introduced in the House, insist that \nFEMA must be extracted from the Department of Homeland Security and \nrestored to independent status. We share the view that the actions of \nboth FEMA and DHS officials before and during the Katrina disaster \nrevealed troubling and, at times, shocking lapses in awareness, \nagility, and judgment. But we also believe that both logic and \npractical realities point to reform, not amputation, as the best \napproach to improved protection for our citizens.\n  Please recall that it was only 5 years ago--before the 9/11 terror \nattacks--that the distinguished panel chaired by two of our former \ncolleagues, Senator Hart and Senator Rudman, recommended that America \nestablish a single agency to plan, coordinate, and integrate homeland \nsecurity operations. The Commission correctly deduced that FEMA was the \n``necessary core'' of that new department, and Congress agreed. The \nlogic of that decision stands intact. The Department of Homeland \nSecurity's mission extends to all types of hazards and to preparation \nand mitigation as well as to response. DHS needs FEMA's capabilities \nand would have to re-create many of them at great cost and with great \nduplication of effort if FEMA were to be removed from the Department.\n  Even if that re-creation could somehow be done economically--and the \nevidence is that it would cost billions of dollars--the result would be \nnew problems for State and local officials who direct first responders. \nBifurcated, competing preparedness systems would force State and local \nofficials to engage one system to prepare for natural disasters and \nanother to prepare for terrorist attacks. That does not make sense. \nMany of the response capabilities are exactly the same whether the \ncatastrophe is caused by a natural disaster such as a hurricane or \nwhether it is the result of a terrorist attack. We know planning and \nresponse capabilities are already far too weak in many States. DHS's \nrecent survey of the States proves that. We should not make the problem \nworse.\n  For those who argue that FEMA simply cannot thrive, cannot be \nsuccessful within DHS, an obvious and telling question arises: How, \nthen, did the U.S. Coast Guard, also a unit within DHS, emerge as the \nuniversally acclaimed hero of the Katrina response? Everyone believes \nthe Coast Guard was the stellar performer, yet the Coast Guard is part \nof the Department of Homeland Security. So clearly FEMA's problem does \nnot lie in its placement within DHS. Unlike FEMA, however, the Coast \nGuard has congressionally mandated protections, and our legislation \nwould extend that exact same protection to FEMA's successor agency.\n  The temptation to think that the answer is simply to remove FEMA is\n\n[[Page S6724]]\n\nstrong, but it is wrong. Just as not all motion is forward, not every \nchange is progress. Emergency management expert Professor Donald Kettl \nof the University of Pennsylvania put it well when he told our \ncommittee:\n\n       It is tempting to send a strong signal by pulling FEMA out \n     of DHS. But that would only undermine its ability to \n     accomplish its mission. Breaking these pieces apart--\n     separating response to terrorism from response to natural \n     disasters, separating preparedness from response, separating \n     FEMA from DHS--would inevitably bring problems.\n\n  I would suggest these are just a few of the serious implications that \nsevering FEMA from DHS would cause.\n  First, coordination and reaction time would suffer. David Paulison, \nthe new Director of FEMA, says that he closely coordinates with the \nCoast Guard, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Border Patrol, and \nthe Secret Service through weekly meetings. In times of disaster, he \ncan simply make a request to these fellow DHS units; he doesn't have to \ngo through a bureaucratic, formal process. They are all parts of the \nsame department.\n  Second, training and preparedness would suffer. ADM Thad Allen of the \nCoast Guard testified before the committee that having FEMA within DHS \nhas allowed much closer working ties and a 350-percent increase in \njoint training exercises.\n  Third, DHS's mission capability would suffer. The Homeland Security \nAct specifies that part of DHS's mission was to act as the focal point \nfor natural and manmade emergencies and for emergency planning. As the \nComptroller General has said:\n\n       Removing FEMA from DHS might impact the ability of the \n     department and its remaining components and FEMA itself in \n     fully addressing the close links between preparedness, \n     prevention, response, and recovery from all hazards.\n\n  Fourth, State and local governments would suffer. If preparedness \nfunctions for natural disasters and terrorist attacks were divided, \nState and local governments would have to deal with two primary points \nof contact, two sets of regulations, two sources of funding, and two \nsets of officials. It greatly complicates their tasks.\n  Fifth, I strongly believe that FEMA would suffer. Removed from DHS, \nFEMA would lose many of the working relationships I have already \ndescribed as well as the direct access to the information-gathering and \nanalysis capabilities of other DHS agencies. This would degrade FEMA's \nability to plan and train for both natural and manmade disasters and to \nmake efficient use of grant-making authority.\n  To me, it is clear that a strengthened--a much strengthened--FEMA \nstill belongs in DHS, that the necessary reforms can be carried out \nwhile it remains in DHS, and that severing FEMA from DHS would create a \nhost of new problems, resulting in considerable extra expense and \nduplication, without securing any significant benefits. It is worth \nnoting that America's largest group of first responders has come to the \nsame conclusion. The president of the 274,000-member International \nAssociation of Firefighters has written us to say:\n\n       Removing FEMA would hinder--rather than help--efforts to \n     reform our Nation's emergency response system. Having both a \n     DHS and an independent FEMA would create confusion among \n     local response personnel and lead to an unproductive \n     duplication of efforts and turf battles.\n\n  Having summarized what I see as compelling arguments for \nstrengthening and protecting FEMA as a component of DHS, let me outline \nsome of the key provisions of our U.S.-EMA bill.\n  First, the bill establishes a strong position for the Administrator \nof the U.S. Emergency Management Authority. Once nominated by the \nPresident and confirmed by the Senate, the Administrator will have the \nstanding of a Deputy Secretary, and will operate on a reporting and \nchain of command model like that of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff. Day to day, the Administrator will report to the DHS Secretary, \nbut the bill explicitly provides a direct line of communication between \nthe President and the Administrator during a catastrophe. In addition, \nthe Administrator may make whatever recommendations to Congress that he \nor she deems appropriate.\n  The bill provides for directors, nominated by the President and \nconfirmed by the Senate, to provide the Administrator with highly \nqualified professionals in Preparedness and Mitigation, Response, and \nRecovery. Apart from bolstering the organization, authorizing these \nposts would send a clear signal to the Nation's Governors and mayors \nthat they will have people of stature with whom to work and confer.\n  Besides providing the Administrator of U.S.-EMA with an advisory link \nto the President, the bill specifically tasks the Administrator with \nproviding the federal leadership necessary to prepare for and respond \nto a disaster, whether man-made or natural. It gives the Administrator \nresponsibility for administering preparedness grant programs, and for \nmonitoring and evaluating the readiness of each of the emergency \nsupport functions under the national response plan. These are critical \nsteps for ensuring close cooperation and oversight of preparedness at \nall levels of government.\n  The bill specifies that U.S.-EMA is a distinct entity and protects it \nfrom reorganization without explicit Congressional approval. This gives \nU.S.-EMA security identical to that of the Coast Guard.\n  Another critical element of the bill authorizes a strong regional \nstructure for U.S.-EMA and creates regionally based federal strike \nteams for rapid response. This will ensure that U.S.-EMA officials are \nfamiliar with the people, the vulnerabilities, and the resources of the \nregions they protect, and will not be introducing themselves to \nstrangers on unfamiliar ground when disaster strikes.\n  Further recognizing the importance of mult-level government \ncoordination, the bill creates a national advisory council on emergency \npreparedness and response--made up of State and local officials and \nemergency management professionals from public, private and NGO \nsectors--to advise the Administrator of U.S.-EMA.\n  Our bill provides a statutory basis for chief medical officer to \nadvise the DHS Secretary on medical and public-health issues. Other \nsections promote public and community preparedness; evaluate the \neffectiveness of equipment for first responders; reauthorize and expand \nthe emergency management assistance compact; and create an office of \nterrorism prevention at DHS.\n  Mr. President, the U.S. Emergency Management Authority Act is not a \nsymbolic gesture, or a quick fix for our problems. It is a thoroughly \nresearched, carefully drafted collection of reforms that will lay the \nfoundation for years of hard work.\n  The result, we firmly believe, will be a significantly more effective \nnational system of preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery \nagainst natural disasters and terror attacks. Building on the insights \nof the Hart-Rudman Commission and on the important advances embodied in \nthe Homeland Security Act, the U.S.-EMA bill will greatly improve the \nprotections that American citizens need, and deserve.\n  Mr. President, my statement has outlined the reforms we are making to \nthis new agency. They are considerable. They are going to make a real \ndifference, and I hope we can pass legislation before the end of this \nyear to greatly strengthen and improve FEMA and our emergency response \nsystem and preparedness on all levels of government.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/28/senate-section/article/S6724-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6724-S6725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 107--CONGRATULATING DONALD ANDREW HALL FOR \nHIS SELECTION BY THE LIBRARIAN OF CONGRESS AS THE 14TH POET LAUREATE OF \nTHE UNITED STATES AND FOR HIS GREAT ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN PROSE AND ESSAYS \n FOCUSING ON NEW ENGLAND RURAL LIVING, BASEBALL, AND HOW WORK CONVEYS \n                        MEANING TO ORDINARY LIFE\n\n  Mr. GREGG (for himself and Mr. Sununu) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n       Whereas Donald Hall attended the prestigious Bread Loaf \n     Writers' Conference at age of 16 on account of his prose and \n     short story writing;\n       Whereas Donald Hall served as literary editor of Isis, the \n     Oxford Poetry Society's journal, and won Oxford University's \n     prestigious Newdigate Prize for ``Exile'';\n       Whereas Donald Hall served as the poetry editor of The \n     Paris Review;\n       Whereas Donald Hall has held Stanford's Creative Writing \n     Fellowship, a position in\n\n[[Page S6725]]\n\n     Harvard's Society of Fellows, and a faculty position at \n     Harvard for 18 years;\n       Whereas Donald Hall held the position of New Hampshire Poet \n     Laureate from 1984 to 1989;\n       Whereas Donald Hall has published 15 books of poetry, \n     including ``The One Bad'' (1988), ``The Happy Man'' (1986), \n     and ``Exiles and Marriages'' (1955);\n       Whereas Donald Hall has also written 20 books of prose, \n     children's books, and plays;\n       Whereas Donald Hall's most recent work is ``White Apples \n     and the Taste of Stone: Selected Poems 1946-2006'';\n       Whereas Donald Hall has received numerous awards including \n     2 Guggenheim Fellowships, the Poetry Society of America's \n     Robert Frost Silver Medal, a Lifetime Achievement Award from \n     the New Hampshire Writers and Publisher Project, the Ruth \n     Lilly Prize for Poetry, the National Book Critics Circle \n     Award, the Los Angeles Times Book Prize, the Lenore Marshall \n     Poetry Prize, and the Academy's Lamont Poetry Selection;\n       Whereas Donald Hall has been nominated for a Pulitzer \n     Prize;\n       Whereas Donald Hall has won a Caldecott Medal for his \n     children's book, ``The Ox-Cart Man'';\n       Whereas Donald Hall is a member of the Academy of Arts and \n     Letters; and\n       Whereas recurring themes in Donald Hall's writings include \n     New England rural life, baseball, and ordinary life: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress congratulates Donald Andrew Hall \n     for his selection by the Librarian of Congress as the 14th \n     Poet Laureate of the United States and for his great \n     accomplishments in prose and essays focusing on New England \n     rural living, baseball, and how work conveys meaning to \n     ordinary life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/28/senate-section/article/S6725-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n               committee on energy and natural resources\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.
