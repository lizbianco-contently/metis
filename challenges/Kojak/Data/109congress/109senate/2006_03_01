The vote on passage of \nthat bill is scheduled for 10 a.m. this morning. Immediately following \nthat vote we will recess in order for the Senate to proceed to the \nHouse of Representatives for the joint meeting. The purpose of that 11 \na.m. joint meeting is to hear an address by the Prime Minister of \nItaly. We will return to business following that address at 12 noon to \ncontinue work on the PATRIOT Act. We will have a cloture vote on the \nunderlying conference report to accompany the PATRIOT Act legislation.\n  There are two additional procedural votes that may be requested from \nthe other side of the aisle. We should not need those. I hope we do not \nhave to proceed with those votes so we can expeditiously proceed to the \ncloture vote. If all of these votes are necessary, we could have three \nconsecutive votes around noon today.\n  Once cloture is invoked, we wish to work out a time for the adoption \nof the PATRIOT Act conference report with no further delay.\n  In addition to the PATRIOT Act, we are working on a process to \nconsider the LIHEAP bill introduced by the senior Senator from Maine. \nYesterday I filed a cloture motion on the motion to proceed to that \nbill. I hope that will not be necessary, but I will continue to consult \nwith Senators about a process that allows the Senate to vote on the \nunderlying LIHEAP issue. In the meantime, this cloture vote would occur \ntomorrow unless some other agreement is worked out.\n  Again, I remind our colleagues to be prompt for this morning's vote \nso we can recess on time and proceed to the joint meeting.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/01/senate-section/article/S1555-6", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I hope it is not necessary to have cloture \non the LIHEAP matter. It has been cleared on our side and I understand \nthe distinguished Senator from Tennessee is doing everything he can to \nhave it cleared on his side. If the cloture vote is necessary, we will \nmove forward as rapidly as possible. It is something we need to do. \nBoth Senator Frist and I have committed to move this bill as quickly as \nwe can. I hope that can be done.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, could I ask, through the Chair to the \nDemocratic leader, to express an opinion first, and that is we \nabsolutely have to proceed with this pensions legislation. I know my \ndistinguished colleague has come to the floor and said certain things \nabout why we are not proceeding to conference, but it does come down to \nthe fact that in November we passed this bill and the House passed it \nabout a month later. At that point in time I said the conferees would \nbe seven and five. As the Democratic leader knows, that is, after \nconsultation--with consultation to the Democratic leader--the \nprerogative of the majority leader. I have been consistent with that.\n  We have waited a couple of months for a response and the Democratic \nleader has given us a response, but the response is that it is \nunacceptable, we need more people--because of things going on within \ntheir caucus.\n  I think it is time to stop--both. Everybody stop playing games and \nlet's get to conference. It is an important issue. We had this April 15 \ndeadline. We finished work on the floor now 3 months ago, and yet we \nhad this bickering about the number of conferees. I know it is tough. \nWe have been in conversation about what those numbers should be. It is \ngoing to be 7 to 5. And it is tough. The tax reconciliation bill we \njust did was 2 to 1. It is always tough, telling our fellow Senators \nthat, no, you can't be on this conference report because we want a \nreasonable number of people.\n  I would make another plea that we proceed, that the other side of the \naisle\n\n[[Page S1556]]\n\nappoint their five. We are ready to appoint our seven. We could go to \nconference this afternoon. We could address the issue. It is alleged \neither that there are other sort of motivations on our side or that we \nare not interested in this pension bill. It is gamesmanship and \npartisanship and it is wrong. It is time to get to the bill itself. We \ncare about it. It is important to the American people. We have done the \nwork on the Senate floor. We have the number of conferees. My seven are \nready to go and I make another plea to the Democratic leader to step up \nand do what the American people expect, appoint conferees and go to \nconference.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have some remarks I was going to make on \nthe pension conference and I will do that. But in response to my \nfriend, the majority leader, partisanship is in the eyes of the \nbeholder. We believe this conference is so important. It involves the \njurisdiction of two committees, Finance and HELP. This is a Senate \nconference. It is not a Republican conference or Democratic conference, \nit is the Senate. The Senate is going to be represented in conference. \nI suggest to my friend, the majority leader--he came to the floor last \nweek and suggested, rather than 8 to 6, which I suggested, that it \nwould be 9 to 6.\n  We could resolve this very quickly. I would be happy to work with \nnine Republicans and seven Democrats--the two-vote majority we have \nagreed with. That is fine. The Senate has 55 Republicans and 45 \nDemocrats. But I don't think it is unfair, and I don't think it has any \npartisanship involved. We have worked very hard from the very beginning \non this bill to not have a partisan bill. I worked very hard, \npersonally, as did Senator Kennedy and Senator Baucus, to do what we \ncould to eliminate extraneous amendments and we did that. It was not \neasy, but we did it. That bill got out of here very quickly. It passed; \n97 Senators voted for this legislation.\n  Maybe it solves the problems to go 9 to 7 rather than 8 to 6. I am \nwilling to be reasonable in this. I think I have been. But I do not \nthink it is being unreasonable; I do not think it is being partisan. If \nI suggest, with two major committees on a very complex piece of \nlegislation, that we have six Democrats representing the Senate in the \nconference, I don't think that is asking too much.\n  I have had calls from my friends downtown, people who represent \ninterested parties. I have told my friends we are ready to go to \nconference--yesterday. All we want is to have a fair makeup of the \nconferees.\n  I ask the distinguished majority leader to reconsider. This 7 to 5--\nthere is nothing set in stone that that is the way it should be. We \nhave had conferences where we have had 27 to 23 conferees representing \nthe Senate in a conference. So I don't think it is asking too much to \nhave 14 Senators, involving two of the most important committees in the \nSenate, to go to conference with the House.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it is apparent where we are. What I do not \nwant to see happen is that this escalates into comments from the other \nside accusing us of not caring about this bill. We have led on this \nbill. We finished it in November. The House finished it in December. \nRight after that I said the ratio will be 7 to 5. It is an internal \nproblem within their caucus that we have to address and that is what \nleadership is all about--in terms of picking five people and picking \nseven people and then proceeding to conference.\n  It is almost as petty that it plays into this pattern of obstruction. \nIt is what is going on. I went through my whole opening there--we have \nbeen on this PATRIOT Act now for weeks and weeks with procedural move \nafter procedural move after procedural move on a bill we know is going \nto pass overwhelmingly.\n  When you see what happens there, and then you see this postponement \nand obstruction on a pensions bill we care passionately about, that the \nAmerican people care about, that hundreds of thousands of people's \nfutures depend on, that is disturbing. We have to step above it. That \nis what the American people expect us to be doing.\n  I am concerned. The Senate Democrats are refusing to go to conference \nwith 7 to 5. They have had 2 months to address this within their \ncaucus. I proposed if you can't appoint five and you can't convince \nfive people to represent you, then we will go to six and then we are \ngoing to go to nine. That will be a counterproposal. If that is \nunacceptable, go back to 7 to 5.\n  By precedent, it is the majority leader who can set the numbers, and \nthe numbers do vary all over the place. We set it at 7 to 5 from day \none and it is 7 to 5 again today. I understand there may be a \nlegitimate dispute on the other side of the aisle. You have too many \npeople who want to be on this conference and decide who gets to serve. \nBut I am beginning to think--I think it is becoming apparent to outside \npeople who are interested in this bill--that this is fitting into a \npattern of more postponement, more delay, more obstruction. What I \nthink is unfair and wrong is to try to turn that and say it is because \nwe don't care about pension legislation.\n  Anyway, we could go on and on forever. We will talk more about the \ndetails of this. Let's get on with it. The American people deserve \nmore. This is petty politics and it is time to rise above it.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I said a few minutes ago, partisanship is \nin the eye of the beholder. Obstruction is in the eye of the beholder. \nI think if this were a jury out there, they would say: I heard Senator \nReid say he is willing to go to conference in a minute or two. What he \nwants is to have the conference have six Democrats and eight \nRepublicans. Is there anything obstructionist about that? The \ndistinguished majority leader talks about problems with the Senate \nDemocrats. There is no problem with the Senate Democrats. We want to go \nto conference. But it appears to me maybe this is all a ploy not to \nhave a bill.\n  It is not unreasonable, when you have the Finance Committee and the \nHELP Committee, to say there should be three from Finance and three \nfrom the HELP Committee. Then, to show how unreasonable this is, the \nmajority leader says: Well, I will have nine and you have six.\n  I would say to a jury, if we were talking to a jury: Who is more \nreasonable? But it all boils down to the fact that another day has gone \nby and the Senate has been unable to appoint conferees to the pension \nreform bill. We have millions of Americans worried about their \npensions. This legislation will help and we need to get it moving.\n  Once again, let me be very clear. We want to go to conference. We can \nname conferees right now and send the bill to the House so they can \nname their conferees.\n  We are not interested in delaying the bill. We support it and want it \nto go to conference. Delaying the conference on pension reform has real \nconsequences.\n  Each day that there is a delay in naming conferees is another day \nthat employers don't know what rules they will need to follow in \nfunding their pension plans.\n  This uncertainty could lead some employers to decide to discontinue \ntheir pension plans. We have seen several companies make that decision \nrecently. A delay in moving forward with this bill could only \nexacerbate this trend.\n  I am coming to the conclusion that maybe the majority does not want \nthis pension reform bill.\n  Each day we delay is another day of uncertainty for those employers \nwho offer so-called ``cash balance'' pension plans.\n  Conflicting legal decisions on the applicability of age \ndiscrimination rules on these plans have forced some sponsors to drop \ntheir pension plans. The Senate's inability to move forward with this \nlegislation also delays improvements for workers whose employer \nconverts to a cash balance plan.\n  Each day that we delay is another day that employees will be left in \nthe dark.\n  Each day we delay is another day that employees will be prevented \nfrom diversifying away from employer stock in their 401(k) plans.\n  This change is an outgrowth of the situation surrounding the collapse \nof Enron where, as we speak, ex-Enron officials are in criminal courts. \nThat change is an outgrowth of their situation, where employees were \nprevented from selling company stock which they held in their \nretirement plans. Each\n\n[[Page S1557]]\n\nday that we delay is another day that workers would not get transparent \nfinancial information on their pension plans. Each day we delay is \nanother day that benefit protections for divorced and surviving spouses \naren't made.\n  Each day that we delay is another day that many of our Nation's \nairline employees must wait to see if Congress will provide their \nindustry the relief that will allow them to keep their pensions.\n  The only thing preventing us from appointing conferees is an \nagreement on the size of the Senate's delegation. The majority leader \ninsisted on limiting the delegation to 12 Members, 7 Republicans and 5 \nDemocrats.\n  We agree with the two-vote margin. We don't like it, but we agree.\n  We believe that limiting the number of Democrats to five \nunnecessarily shortchanges not only Democrats but the entire Senate of \nthe expertise that will prove successful in reaching agreement with the \nHouse of Representatives on a bill that can attract a strong majority \nof support in the Senate.\n  I repeat. This is not a Senate Republican conference, it is a Senate \nconference.\n  We are not contesting the Republicans' desire to have a two-vote \nadvantage when we get to conference, but we believe it is important to \nhave each committee adequately represented.\n  The majority leader has offered to expand the delegation by one but \nonly if he gets two additional Republican conferees. He said: I will \ngive you one Democrat, but I want two. That is the 9-to-6 ridiculous \nproposal that has been made. It doesn't have to be 7 to 5. It can be 8 \nto 6, it can be 9 to 7. I have no problem in selecting people to go on \nthe conference. I certainly don't think it should affect the majority \nleader. If he doesn't like 8 to 6, let him put another Senator on. Have \nit 9 to 7.\n  All we are asking is that a sufficient number of conference, \nconferees are appointed to the conference. Having 14 conferees in the \nratio of 8 to 6 gives the Senate the best opportunity to bring back a \nbill from conference that will garner support from the Senate.\n  Let the Record be very clear. Democrats have worked closely with our \nRepublican colleagues every step of the way on this legislation. The \nresult has been a very strong bipartisan bill.\n  I hope that the majority leader will consider his opposition to our \nrequest so we can move forward with this conference.\n  Together, we can improve our Nation's pension system and make America \na better place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/01/senate-section/article/S1557-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe passage vote, the Senate vote on the motion to proceed to the \nmotion to reconsider the vote by which cloture was not invoked on the \nconference report to accompany H.R. 3199; I further ask consent that if \nthe motion to proceed is agreed to, the Senate vote immediately on the \nmotion to reconsider and, if agreed to, then the Senate vote on the \nmotion to invoke cloture on the conference report.\n\n[[Page S1558]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I have been to the floor several times \nin the past few days to try to convince my colleagues that we should \nnot be reauthorizing the PATRIOT Act without addressing the legitimate \nconcerns of law-abiding Americans across the country. I am under no \nillusions that I will have more success making that argument now than I \nhad yesterday, or the week before the recess. And I know that some of \nmy colleagues may be wishing I would sit down and stop badgering them \nabout this. But the stakes are too high to sit idly by while the Senate \nprepares to disappoint the millions of Americans who have been hoping, \nasking, advocating for years that we fix the PATRIOT Act.\n  Some may see the vote we are about to have as relatively trivial. \nThey are mistaken. While the bill we are voting on makes only minor \nand, to quote the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, cosmetic changes to \nthe PATRIOT Act, its significance is far greater. This bill is, to \nagain quote Senator Specter, the ``cover'' that will allow colleagues \nto support the PATRIOT Act conference report that was blocked in \nDecember. A vote for the bill introduced by my friend from New \nHampshire is effectively a vote to perform cosmetic surgery on that \nugly conference report. Anyone who opposed that conference report \nshould oppose S. 2271 because cosmetic changes simply don't cut it when \nwe are talking about protecting the rights and freedoms of Americans \nfrom unnecessarily intrusive Government powers.\n  So I ask my colleagues to reconsider their position. The White House, \nalong with its allies, has tried to make life uncomfortable for some of \nthem. It has suggested they are soft on terrorism, that they don't \nunderstand the pressing threat facing this country, that they are stuck \nin a pre-9/11 mindset. These cynical and baseless attacks come from a \nplaybook that the American people are by now very familiar with. Those \nattacks should be rejected, not accommodated. We can fight terrorism \naggressively without compromising our most fundamental freedoms against \nGovernment intrusion. The Government grabbed powers it should not have \nwhen it passed the original PATRIOT Act and we should not be ratifying \nthat power grab today. The PATRIOT Act reauthorization conference \nreport is flawed. It needs to be fixed. S. 2271 pretends to fix it but \nI don't think anyone is fooled, least of all our constituents. They are \nwatching and they will want to know how a bill that is so trivial on \nits face protects their civil liberties. It doesn't. It should be \nrejected. And the Senate should get down to the serious business of \nlegislating real fixes to the PATRIOT Act. I urge my colleagues to \noppose the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, earlier this month, I joined with a \nmajority of Senators in voting to proceed to consideration of S. 2271. \nI said then that the bill made modest improvements over both the \noriginal PATRIOT Act and the reauthorization proposal produced by the \nHouse-Senate conference. I said, too, that the bill included one set of \nchanges that I strongly opposed, and that I hoped there would be an \nopportunity to make further improvements to the bill, the conference \nreport, and the PATRIOT Act.\n  Regrettably, no sooner had the Senate voted to proceed to S. 2271 \nthan the majority leader filled the amendment ``tree'' with sham \namendments, locking out real amendments that sought to improve the law \nfurther. An amendment that I filed but was denied the opportunity to \noffer would have corrected one of the most egregious ``police state'' \nprovisions regarding gag orders. Senator Feingold also filed but could \nnot offer amendments aimed at bringing the conference report more in \nline with the bipartisan reauthorization bill that every Member of the \nSenate approved last year. In light of the abuse perpetrated by the \nRepublican leadership, I felt compelled yesterday to oppose cloture on \nthe bill and the stifling of meaningful debate.\n  Today's vote is a different and more difficult matter. Because the \nRepublican leadership obstructed efforts to improve the bill, the \n``police state'' provisions regarding gag orders remain uncorrected. \nThis is a big step backward, in my view, from both the conference \nreport and existing law.\n  At the same time, the bill takes two steps forward. It modifies a \nprovision I objected to in the conference report that would have \nrequired American citizens to tell the FBI before they exercise their \nright as Americans to seek the advice of counsel. Chairman Specter and \nI worked together to correct this provision; Senator Sununu was able to \nimprove it further in this bill and I commend his efforts.\n  Another significant change provided by the Sununu bill builds upon \nanother objection I had and an idea I shared with him to ensure that \nlibraries engaged in their customary and traditional activities are not \nsubject to national security letters. This is a matter I first raised \nand feel very strongly about. I commend Senator Sununu for the progress \nhe was able to make in this regard.\n  The bill is intended to clarify that libraries as they traditionally \nand currently function are not electronic service providers, and may \nnot be served with NSLs for business records simply because they \nprovide Internet access to their patrons. Under this clarification, a \nlibrary may be served with an NSL only if it functions as a true \ninternet service provider, as by providing services to persons located \noutside the premises of the library. I expect that this will occur \nrarely or never and that in most if not all cases, the Government will \nneed a court order to seize library records for foreign intelligence \npurposes.\n  The language I proposed to Senator Sununu in this regard was less \nambiguous than that to which the Bush-Cheney administration would \nagree. Still, my intent, Senator Sununu's intent and the intent of \nCongress in this regard should be clear. It is to strengthen the \nmeaning and ensure proper implementation of this provision that I will \nsupport this bill. As a supporter I trust my intent will inform those \ncharged with implementing the bill and reviewing its proper \nimplementation.\n  I will continue to work to improve the PATRIOT Act. I will work to \nprovide better oversight of the use of national security letters and to \nremove the un-American restraints on meaningful judicial review. I will \nseek to monitor how sensitive personal information from medical files, \ngun stores and libraries are obtained, used, and retained. Today, I \nwill join Senators Specter, Sununu, Craig, and others in introducing a \nbill to improve the PATRIOT Act and reauthorization legislation in \nseveral important respects. While we have made some progress, much is \nleft to be done.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I rise today to comment on S. 2271, which I \nanticipate that the Senate will overwhelmingly approve today. I support \nthe USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act Conference Report, \nwith the three amendments negotiated contained in S. 2271. It is long \npast time to reauthorize the USA PATRIOT Act, which has been critical \nto our efforts to protect Americans. I support the compromise that has \nallowed this up-or-down vote because I think that the agreement \nmaintains the tools necessary to fight terrorism while further \nstrengthening safeguards to protect Americans' civil liberties just as \nthe conference report itself does.\n  The conference report clarifies that the recipient of a section 215 \nFISA business records order or a National Security Letter, NSL, may \ndisclose receipt to an attorney to seek legal advice or assistance and \nalso to those necessary to comply with the request. During House-Senate \nnegotiations, provisions were added allowing the government to request \nthat the recipient tell the government to whom the recipient had \ndisclosed the order or NSL. This provision makes sense because there \nwill be times when the Government will need to know everyone who has \nbeen told about a section 215 order or NSL. For example, if there is a \nleak of the existence of the request, or the recipient's name, that \nleak may need to be investigated. And we know from the criminal \nconviction of Lynne Stewart that, unfortunately, sometimes it is the \nattorneys who are breaking the law.\n\n[[Page S1559]]\n\n  Some Senators expressed concern that these provisions required all \nrecipients to identify their attorney in all instances. This was a \nmisreading of the language, which would have allowed the government to \nrequest the names of individuals to whom subsequent disclosure was made \nbut did not set out a blanket requirement.\n  Other Senators were concerned that this provision could chill a \nrecipient's right to counsel. It is clear under the law that the \nconstitutional right to counsel would not be implicated or offended by \nthe conference report provision. But in a spirit of compromise, the \nAdministration agreed to modify the provisions such that they could not \nbe used to request the identity of an attorney to whom receipt was \ndisclosed. I support this amendment primarily because there is no way \nthat the agreed-upon language would preclude the use of a grand jury \nsubpoena or other investigative tool in the event of a subsequent leak \ninvestigation. So the government will still have tools available to \ninvestigate leaks as the need arises--even if the offending party is \nthe recipient's attorney.\n  The conference report also makes it clear that the recipient of a \nsection 215 FISA business records order can go to court and challenge \nthe order. Some Senators raised concerns that under the conference \nreport a recipient would have explicit rights to consult an attorney \nabout the order and to challenge the order to produce business records, \nbut would not have an explicit right to challenge the nondisclosure \norder that accompanies such a production order. I think it is likely \nthat a court would entertain a constitutional challenge to the \nnondisclosure requirement, and nothing we say in a statute is going to \nchange that one way or another. Moreover, it is important to remember \nthat these are court orders--they are reviewed and approved by judges \nbefore they are served.\n  But notwithstanding my confidence that the conference report was \nfully consistent with Americans' civil liberties, the administration \nagreed to a compromise that explicitly authorizes judicial review of a \nsection 215 nondisclosure order. I think the agreement is a good \ncompromise--it explicitly allows challenges, but does so without \nrisking national security. Pursuant to the agreed-upon language, a \nchallenge could be brought any time after the first year after the \njudge issued the section 215 order; the challenge could only be brought \nin the FISA Court; and the standard of review would be the same as the \nstandard the conference report provides for review of nondisclosure \norders accompanying NSLs. The delay is perfectly appropriate and \nnecessary to preserve valuable personnel resources--these orders are \napproved by judges before issuance, so it makes little sense to allow \nrecipients to challenge the non-disclosure requirement only a week or \neven a day after the court issues them.\n  Taking the standard of review from the NSL provisions also makes \nsense. Not only did that standard pass both the House and Senate, but \nit affords the appropriate level of deference to the Executive branch's \njudgments on national security and diplomatic relations.\n  This standard provides that the FISA Court judge may set aside or \nmodify the nondisclosure order if the judge finds that there is no \nreason to believe that disclosure may endanger the national security of \nthe United States, interfere with a criminal or counterterrorism \ninvestigation, interfere with diplomatic relations, or endanger the \nlife or physical safety of any person. If, upon the filing of a \nchallenge to the nondisclosure order, the Attorney General, the Deputy \nAttorney General, an Assistant Attorney General, or the FBI Director \ncertifies that disclosure may endanger the national security of the \nUnited States or interfere with diplomatic relations, the certification \nis conclusive unless made in bad faith.\n  Courts have long recognized that national security and diplomatic \nrelations fall within the heartland of the executive branch's \nresponsibility and expertise, and this standard simply recognizes that \nexpertise. By requiring that the certification be made by a Senate-\nconfirmed official before granting it bad-faith review, the conferees \nadded political accountability--and I note that neither the House \nversion nor the Senate version had this additional safeguard.\n  Finally, some Senators also expressed concern about the applicability \nof national security letters to libraries. This concern has always \nseemed to me to be based on a misunderstanding of the NSL statutes. \nThere are several NSL authorities, but each authority only allows the \ngovernment to request a narrow category of records from a narrow set of \ninstitutions. The statue that is generally in the news allows the FBI \nto request things like customer subscription records from ``wire and \nelectronic communication service providers.'' And we have already made \nclear in statute what institutions qualify as ``wire and electronic \ncommunication service providers.'' The way I read the statute, and the \nway that experts read the statute, the FBI cannot use an NSL to learn \nwhat books you and I are checking out from the library.\n  But the compromise makes it crystal clear that the FBI may serve an \nNSL on a library only if that library is acting as a ``wire or \nelectronic communication service provider.'' Just to be clear: we are \nnot changing the set of entities that can be subject to NSLs; we are \nmerely clarifying that libraries can be subject to NSLs only if they \nperform the functions that make an entity subject to NSLs. I can \nsupport this language because it does not create a safe haven for \nterrorists in libraries. If it did, I could not support the language.\n  It is well past time to pass this report, which passed the House with \nstrong bipartisan support. A majority of Americans supports \nreauthorizing the USA PATRIOT Act, as does a strong bipartisan majority \nof Senators. I support this compromise.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Chair.\n  When it comes to the conference report on the USA PATRIOT Act, the \ndie has now been cast. The Senate has voted to reconsider the vote \nagainst cloture from last December and now has voted to limit debate on \nthe PATRIOT Act reauthorization bill. The rules of the Senate have \nchanged since the days of Jimmy Stewart and ``Mr. Smith Goes to \nWashington.'' One Senator, no matter how strongly he or she feels, \ncannot singlehandedly stop a bill when 60 or more of his or her \ncolleagues are dead set on passing it. So obviously at this point, \nfinal passage of the reauthorization bill is now assured. I am \ndisappointed in this result, obviously, but I believe this fight has \nbeen worth making and my dedication to changing the PATRIOT Act is as \nstrong now as it has ever been.\n  We have made some progress since October 2001. The public understands \nthe issues better and many of my colleagues do, too. Support for \nchanges to the PATRIOT Act has grown over the years to the point where \nwe actually had no objection in the Senate last year passing a pretty \ngood bill--this was in July of 2005--a bill that made significant \nimprovements to the PATRIOT Act. Then near the end of the year, 46 \nSenators actually voted to reject a conference report that took several \nsteps backward from that bill. Even a few days ago, I was heartened \nwhen the Senator from Pennsylvania, the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, the foremost proponent of the conference report, actually \nannounced he would essentially take the four amendments I had hoped to \noffer, the amendments I was denied the right to offer in the Senate, \nand combine them into a bill he will now seek to move through the \nJudiciary Committee and enact into law. His bill will have several \ncosponsors, including me. So even some of the Senators who fought for \nthis reauthorization bill, of course, realize it falls short and will \njoin the fight to try to fix the PATRIOT Act. That is somewhat \nencouraging, and I thank them for their honesty. I thank them for \nrecognizing that the rights and freedoms of the American people are \nworth fighting for in the Senate, just as we ask so many of our young \npeople to fight for them overseas.\n  The rules of the Senate provide that debate on this measure is now \nlimited after the vote on cloture we took. But debate is not yet \nclosed. I believe there is still more that needs to be said. In \nparticular, in the time I have remaining, I want to give voice to the \nmillions of Americans who have expressed concern about the PATRIOT Act \nand have asked repeatedly for it to be changed. There has been an \nextraordinary outpouring of public sentiment against this law, and that \nsentiment deserves to be heard on the floor of the Senate. So in a few \nminutes I am going to read some of the resolutions that have been \npassed and editorials that have been written and letters that have been \nsent. In these final hours before the PATRIOT Act is reauthorized, I \nwant my colleagues to hear the voices of the citizens of this country. \nThese voices cannot be stifled by votes taken here. They may have been \nultimately defeated by procedural maneuvers in this body over the past \nfew weeks, but their concerns for the liberties and freedoms are real, \nand they are not going away. We ignore them at our peril.\n  Before I turn to those voices, I want to start with the basic \nprinciple. Our Nation's strength comes not only from our mighty and our \nunmatched military might but from our constitutional system and our \nreverence for the rule of law. That is what has kept us free for over \n2\\1/4\\ quarter centuries in our history as a nation. Millions of \npatriotic Americans love this country and support our military men and \nwomen in their difficult missions abroad but worry about the fate of \nour Constitution here at home. Our constitutional freedoms, our \nAmerican values are what make our country worth fighting for as we \nstrive to defeat the terrorists who threaten us. The Constitution and \nthe Bill of Rights are documents we often talk about and less often \nactually pick up and reread. In light of their central importance to \nthe debate about the PATRIOT Act, I thought it would be worth reading \nthem today.\n  The United States Constitution:\n\n       We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more \n     perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic \n     Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the \n     general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to \n     ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish the \n     Constitution for the United States of America.\n\n                               Article I\n\n       Section 1. All legislative Powers herein granted shall be \n     vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall \n     consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.\n       Section 2. The House of Representatives shall be composed \n     of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the \n     several States, and the Electors in each State shall have \n     Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous \n     Branch of the State Legislature.\n       No Person shall be a Representative who shall not have \n     attained to the Age of twenty five Years, and been seven \n     Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when \n     elected, be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be \n     chosen.\n       Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among \n     the several States which may be included within this Union, \n     according to their respective Numbers, which shall be \n     determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, \n     including those bound to Service for a Term of Years.\n\n  Of course, this provision has been amended by the 14th amendment so I \nwill skip that part.\n\n       The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years \n     after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States, \n     and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner \n     as they shall by Law direct. The Number of Representatives \n     shall not exceed one for every thirty Thousand, but each \n     State shall have at Least one Representative; and until \n     such enumeration shall be made, the State of New Hampshire \n     shall be entitled to chuse three, Massachusetts eight, \n     Rhode Island and Providence Plantations one, Connecticut \n     five, New York six, New Jersey four, Pennsylvania eight, \n     Delaware one, Maryland six, Virginia ten, North Carolina \n     five, South Carolina five, and George three.\n       As per act of November 15, 1941, the apportionment, based \n     on the Sixteenth Census (1940), the Seventeenth Census \n     (1950), and the Eighteenth Census (1960), distribute the 435 \n     seats in the House among the States according to the method \n     of equal proportions. (See Senate Manual section 974).\n       When vacancies happen in the Representation from any State, \n     the Executive Authority thereof shall issue Writs of Election \n     to fill such Vacancies.\n       The House of Representative shall chuse their Speaker and \n     other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.\n       Section 3. The Senate of the United States shall be \n     composed of two Senators from each State, chosen by the \n     Legislature thereof, for six Years; and each Senators shall \n     have one Vote.\n       Immediately after they shall be assembled in Consequence of \n     the First Election, they shall be divided as equally as may \n     be into three Classes. The Seats of the Senators of the first \n     Class shall be vacated at the Expiration of the Second Year, \n     of the second Class at the Expiration of the fourth Year, and \n     of the third Class at the Expiration of the sixth Year; so \n     that one-third Class at the Expiration of the sixth Year; and \n     if Vacancies happen by Resignation, or otherwise, during the \n     Recess of the Legislature of any State, the Executive thereof \n     may make temporary Appointments until the next Meeting of the \n     Legislature, which shall then fill such Vacancies.\n\n[[Page S1563]]\n\n       No Person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to \n     the Age of thirty Years, and been nine Years a Citizen of the \n     United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an \n     Inhabitant of that State for which he shall be chosen.\n       The Vice President of the United States shall be President \n     of the Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally \n     divided.\n       The Senate shall chuse their other Officers, and also a \n     President pro tempore, in the absence of the Vice President, \n     or when he shall exercise the Office of President of the \n     United States.\n       The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all \n     Impeachments.

More than any other provision I am reading, this is the one \nthat is at the heart of the debate about this USA PATRIOT Act and its \nprovisions, and it is this provision that is particularly violated by \nthe imminent reauthorization of this law:\n\n       The right of the people to be secure in their persons, \n     houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches \n     and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall \n     issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or \n     affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be \n     searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\n\n                             Amendment [V]\n\n       No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or other \n     wise infamous crime, unless on a presentment, or indictment \n     of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval \n     forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of \n     War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the \n     same offenses to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; \n     nor shall be compelled in, any criminal case to be a witness \n     against himself, nor deprived of life, liberty, or property, \n     without due process of law; nor shall private property be \n     taken for public use, without just compensation.\n\n                             Amendment [VI]\n\n       In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the \n     right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of \n     the State and district wherein the crime shall have been \n     committed, which district shall have been previously \n     ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and \n     cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses \n     against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining \n     witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel \n     for his defence.\n\n                            Amendment [VII]\n\n       In suits at common law, where the value in controversy \n     shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall \n     be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be other-\n     wise reexamined in any Court of the United States, than \n     according to the rules of the common law.\n\n                            Amendment [VIII]\n\n       Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines \n     imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\n\n                             Amendment [IX]\n\n       The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, \n     shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained \n     by the people.\n\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 34 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be \npermitted to speak for no longer than about 20 minutes as if in morning \nbusiness and that the time be charged postcloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Talent are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. TALENT. I thank my friend from Wisconsin for letting me have the \nfloor to do this. I am happy to yield back the floor and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Senator from \nNevada has been yielded 2 hours. I already have 1 hour.\n  I ask 2 hours 50 minutes of that time be yielded to the Senator from \nWisconsin, Mr. Feingold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I don't think I need consent, do I?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not need consent.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from Vermont, under the parliamentary \nsituation, is entitled to time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is entitled to 2 hours 54 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will speak for a while. It is my intent \nto then yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Wisconsin.\n  The Senate is going to soon vote to reauthorize the USA PATRIOT Act. \nI am one of the authors of the original 2001 PATRIOT Act. I voted to \nreauthorize an improved version of the act back in July of 2005.\n  Obviously, I am concerned, as all Americans are, with our security. I \nam concerned, as is the distinguished Presiding Officer and the \ndistinguished Senator from Wisconsin, as one who goes to work every \nday, along with thousands of others, in a building that was targeted \nfor destruction by al-Qaida. So I am glad we are making progress. \nHowever, I have to admit to being disappointed at the missed \nopportunity to get it right.\n  The PATRIOT Act provides important and valuable tools for the \nprotection of Americans from terrorism. These matters should be \ngoverned by law, not by whim.\n  Legislative action should be the clear and unambiguous legal footing \nfor any Government powers. Former Congressman Armey, Dick Armey, the \nRepublican leader of the House, and I insisted that sunset provisions \nbe included in the 2001 act. Because we did that, we ended up with \nreconsideration and some refinement of the powers authorized in that \nmeasure.\n  Now the challenge of Congress is to provide the effective oversight \nneeded\n\n[[Page S1566]]\n\nin the days ahead and to ensure that there is court review of the \nactions that affect the rights of Americans.\n  The bill contains several sunshine provisions that I proposed. I did \nthat to ensure we would have oversight and to ensure some measure of \npublic accountability for how our Government uses its powers.\n  For the first time ever, the Justice Department is going to be \nrequired to report publicly on its use of two secret surveillance tools \nthat have come under fire from civil libertarians but also from the \nbusiness community. These are the FISA business record authority and \nthe so-called national security letters, or NSLs. The Justice \nDepartment has been declassifying this information sporadically, when \npolitically convenient. It could offer no plausible justification for \nkeeping the information classified, especially when comparable data \nregarding more sensitive surveillance techniques such as wiretapping \nand physical searches is routinely disclosed.\n  The conference between the two bodies accepted my proposal that these \npowers be subject to detailed, comprehensive, and unclassified audits \nby the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General. \nSpecifically, the OIG will audit the effectiveness and use, including \nany improper or illegal use, of the FISA business record and NSL \nauthorities during the last several years and going forward.\n  In performing these audits, the OIG will examine the categories of \nrecords obtained, the importance of the information required, the \nmanner in which it is retained and disseminated, and whether the \ninformation is used for data mining purposes. The NSL audit will be \nfollowed by a report on the feasibility of applying minimization \nprocedures in the context of NSLs to ensure the protection of the \nconstitutional rights of United States persons.\n  I have tried to describe it accurately. I realize that sounds like a \nbureaucratic computer wrote it. I want to be very specific because this \nadministration sometimes does not pay attention to specific items. What \nwe do not want is any agency of our Government feeling they can simply \ngo and use these demands for records to go on a fishing expedition or \nfind somebody they do not like and say: Let's just grab all their \nrecords. Let's go through all their records. Let's follow up on these \nrecords and see if there is something else we want--and just do that on \nand on with somebody who has no recourse, no ability to speak out. \nTheir businesses might be ruined, their lives might be ruined, and it \nturns out: Whoops, sorry, we made a mistake. We are going on to \nsomebody else. We saw after 9/11 when that happened. We saw businesses \nruined, ranging from restaurants to other kinds of businesses, where: \nWhoops, sorry, we got the wrong person. Too bad you had no real ability \nto question what we were doing.\n\n  I proposed another sunshine provision. I am glad the conference \naccepted it. It comes from a bill I introduced in the last Congress \nwith Senators Specter and Grassley. It requires the FISA Court to \npublish its procedures and share their rules in an unclassified report. \nAlso, it requires annual reporting of the use of so-called sneak-and-\npeek search warrants and FISA's emergency surveillance authorities.\n  Again, we give very special powers to our Government, recognizing the \nfact that, as long as the distinguished Presiding Officer lives, as \nlong as I live, we will face these kinds of threats. But we want to \nmake sure the powers we give do not become powers just unto themselves \nwhere none of us know where the check or the balance is.\n  The bill includes a scaled-back version of a data-mining provision \nthat was added by a floor amendment in the House.\n  Most of us use e-mails. We often send medical information on \nourselves, our children, our families. Maybe if you are in a business \nyou send information you want held so you can have a competitive \nadvantage over your competitor. A lot of that can be picked up in data-\nmining operations.\n  As contained in the current bill, the provision calls for a one-time \nreport on pattern-based data mining by the Department of Justice. What \nis that expression, pattern-based data mining? They develop models \nbased on expected behavior or profiles of criminal or terrorist \nactivity, then they mine databases of personal information to try to \nidentify those patterns.\n  It is sort of the Kevin Bacon ``six degrees of separation,'' except \nwe assume they are not going after Kevin Bacon. It does raise concerns \nabout profiling and individual privacy. There is a concern that if you \nhappen to be in a restaurant somebody frequented, you are now going to \nbe under surveillance.\n  Now, in addition to the sunshine provisions, I proposed we retain the \nsunset mechanism that worked so well in the original PATRIOT Act. \nSometimes both sunshine and sunset work well together. As I said, \nRepublican House Majority Leader Dick Armey and I insisted, in 2001, on \na 4-year sunset for certain PATRIOT Act powers. If we had not done \nthat, we would not even be having this debate today. We would not have \neven looked at what happened, especially with a Congress reluctant to \ndo oversight, a Congress unwilling to question anything this \nadministration does.\n  They were forced, actually, to ask questions about what is happening \nunder the PATRIOT Act because a conservative Member of the House--Dick \nArmey--and a liberal Senator--myself--put in the sunset provisions so \nwe would be forced to look at it no matter who was President, no matter \nwho controlled the House, no matter who controlled the Senate. And \nthank goodness we did because if we had not done that, I guarantee you, \nthis Congress never would have asked a question of anybody. If we had \nnot had that, the Bush administration would have stonewalled our \nrequest for information, just as they have on so many other things.\n  The sunsets are the reasons we have been going through a review and \nrenewal process over the last few months. And the improvements were \nhard won. The Bush administration pursued its usual strategy of \ndemanding sweeping Executive powers, resisting checks and balances. \nThey were long on partisan rhetoric and awfully short on bipartisan \ndialog. As usual, the Republican majorities in the House and the Senate \ndid their utmost to follow the White House's directives to prevent any \nsudden breakout of bipartisanship. But a ray of bipartisanship slipped \nthrough the cracks, and the bill is the better for it.\n  It contains 4-year sunsets, not 7- or 10-year sunsets like the \nadministration wanted. The bill no longer contains a provision that \nwould have made it a crime merely to disclose the receipt of a national \nsecurity letter. Somebody hands you a national security letter and \ndemands documents and it's a crime if you tell anybody about it. ``Wait \na minute, you just closed down my business. I can't comply with this.'' \n``Tough. You can't tell anybody. You can't tell your wife. You can't \ntell the people who work for you.'' This is America. We finally did \naway with that, even though the administration strongly wanted that \nkind of control.\n  They even wanted Americans, if they were served with a national \nsecurity letter and dared to seek legal advice, they had to go humbly \nto the FBI first and tell them they were actually going to get a \nlawyer--in America--to find out why they were being subpoenaed. Now, I \nknow they like control in this administration. That went too far. So we \nno longer require American citizens to tell the FBI before they \nexercise their right as Americans to seek the advice of counsel. \nSunlight is the best disinfectant. When the sunlight came in on this \nbill, some of these things fell.\n  Chairman Specter and I worked together on these improvements, and our \nefforts have produced a better bill for the protection of all \nAmericans. In this regard, I also compliment the Senate Democratic \nconferees, whose efforts were extraordinary. Whether they vote for or \nagainst the final product, Senators Rockefeller, Levin, and Kennedy all \ndeserve the thanks of the Senate and the American people for their hard \nwork and steadfastness.\n\n  Late changes were achieved by Republican Senators who had joined us \nin resisting the conference report in December.\n  When terrorists strike, they do not ask whether you are Democrats or \nRepublicans or Independents. If they want to strike Americans, they \nstrike Americans. They do not ask what your politics are. And all \nAmericans--Democrats, Republicans, Independents--want to stop \nterrorists. All Americans\n\n[[Page S1567]]\n\noppose what they have done. So, therefore, it was regrettable that this \nadministration--with a President who was elected on a solemn campaign \npledge to be a uniter and not a divider--refused to engage both \nDemocrats and Republicans on ways to improve the bill. They spoke to \nonly one party, as though only one party cared about America being \nsafe. The White House Counsel spoke to only Republican Senators. So \nthey, in turn, negotiated to achieve what they view as improvements and \nwhat they could. It is, of course, less than what we would have liked, \nbut I appreciate the fact they did what they could insofar as they were \ndealing with an administration that did not want to treat the safety of \nAmericans in a bipartisan way.\n  But, therefore, the bill still falls short in several critical \nregards.\n  Let's talk about section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, the business records \nprovision that has been so important to the libraries. Under section \n215, the Government can obtain a secret order that compels access to \nsensitive records of American citizens. It also imposes a permanent gag \non the recipient. In other words, I grabbed your records. Don't you \ndare tell anyone. This is America. This is America. We have had \nPresidents condemn other countries--and rightly so--for doing this sort \nof thing to their citizens, and we want to do it to our own?\n  Before passage of the PATRIOT Act, there were two significant \nlimitations on the FBI's power to seize business records. First, it \ncould be used only for a few discrete categories of travel records, \nsuch as records held by hotels, motels, vehicle rental facilities. \nSecond, the legal standard for obtaining the order was demanding. The \nGovernment had to present specific and articulable facts giving reason \nto believe that the subject of the investigation was a foreign power or \nan agent of a foreign power.\n  Passed in the weeks following 9/11, the PATRIOT Act did away with \nthese limitations. It both expanded what the FBI may obtain with a \nSection 215 order and it lowered the standard for obtaining it. Under \ncurrent law, the Government need only assert that something--anything--\nis sought for an authorized investigation to protect against terrorism \nor espionage, and the judge will order its production. What counts as \nan authorized investigation is within the discretion of the Executive \nbranch.\n  Now, the Senate--and I compliment those Republicans and Democrats on \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee who got together on the reauthorization \nbill that we passed last July--the Senate reestablished a significant \ncheck on this power. Under the Senate bill, relevance to an authorized \ninvestigation is not enough. The Government must also show some \nconnection between the records sought and a suspected terrorist or spy. \nThis is a fundamental protection that would not hamstring the \nGovernment, but would do much to prevent overreaching in Government \nsurveillance. I fought for it in the Senate. Chairman Specter and every \nRepublican Senator voted for it. Then the Bush administration found out \nabout that. It ordered the Republican Members of Congress to strip it \nout in conference, and these independent bodies--this check and \nbalance--said: Aye, aye, sir, and stripped it out.\n  The current bill also falls short on its treatment of national \nsecurity letters. These are, in effect, a form of secret administrative \nsubpoena. Again, my God, they love doing things in secret. They love \ndoing things in secret, and they tell us afterwards: Trust us. I seem \nto have read something recently in the press about an agreement to have \nanother country run the operations of our ports. They said, after \nfailing to consult Congress, trust us. We secretly looked at Dubai. We \nsecretly looked at this, and we understand that money for the hijackers \nwent through that country, but we have secretly looked at it and it is \na good idea. Don't ask us any questions.\n  Well, now they have this form of secret administrative subpoena. They \nare issued by FBI agents without the approval of a judge or a grand \njury or a prosecutor. They allow agents to obtain certain types of \nsensitive information about innocent Americans simply by certifying its \nrelevance to a terrorism or espionage investigation. If the FBI agent \ndoes not like your looks, they can just come in with this secret \nsubpoena and seize your records. Your business can be shut down on the \nwhim of one agent--no judge, no grand jury, no prosecutor, no check and \nbalance. And oh, by the way, we will do it secretly. Like section 215 \norders, NSLs come with a permanent gag. Recipients are prohibited from \ntelling anyone anything about it.\n  The bill does not allow meaningful judicial review of this gag order. \nIt requires the court to accept as conclusive the Government's \nassertion that a gag order should not be lifted, unless the court \ndetermines the Government is acting in bad faith. This raises serious \nFirst Amendment and due process concerns. Fixing this provision was one \nof my top priorities in the conference and during my subsequent \ndiscussions with Senator Specter. The Bush administration's refusal to \nagree to this change was a significant factor in my consistent \nopposition to the conference report in December. And there is strong \nopposition to this provision from both Democrats and Republicans from \nthe right to the left. But the administration refused to correct it. \nThey also refused, as an alternative, to sunset the national security \nletter authority.\n  I continued to seek remediation of this provision in January and \nFebruary through discussions with Senator Sununu and Senator Specter, \nbut they were unable to achieve that result. This creates, in my view, \na sham judicial proceeding within the complete control of the \nGovernment that smacks too much of a police state. It is wrong. It \nneeds to be fixed.\n  I wish Americans would think: What are we giving up with the idea we \nmight be a little more secure? Wouldn't it be a lot better to fix the \nmistakes that were made by the administration that allowed 9/11 to \nhappen in the first place, to go back and find out where those mistakes \nwere made and fix them? Wouldn't it be better to finally, years later, \nstart actually being able to translate all the information we have \npicked up--something we did not do before 9/11 and today we still do \nnot do it anywhere near enough?\n  Wouldn't it have been better to have done that than to say to \nAmericans, most of whom would be law-abiding: We are going to give you \nthis letter--which just one person decides on--and we will seize your \nrecords. You can't talk to anybody about it, and there's really nothing \nyou can do about that. You have no real judicial way of overturning the \ngag order.\n  If we heard of other countries doing this, we would be critical and \nrightly so. If the Chinese did this, we would criticize them and \nrightly so. If the old Soviet Union did this, we would have criticized \nthem and rightly so. Please, do not let our country go down that road. \nWe are too good a people. We are too honest a people.\n  The bill's treatment of the PATRIOT Act's so-called sneak-and-peek \nprovisions is another area of concern. Section 213 of the PATRIOT Act \nauthorized the Government to carry out secret searches in ordinary \ncriminal investigations. Armed with a Section 213 search warrant, FBI \nagents may enter and search a home or office and not tell anyone about \nit until weeks or months later.\n  It is interesting to recall that four years ago, the House Judiciary \nCommittee took one look at the Bush administration's original proposal \nfor sneak and peak authority and dropped it entirely from its version \nof the legislation. As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I \nwas able to make some improvements in the administration's proposal, \nbut problems remained. In particular, Section 213 says that notice may \nbe delayed only for ``a reasonable period.'' The Bush administration \nhas abused that flexible standard and used it to justify delays in \nnotice of a year or more. Pre-PATRIOT Act case law stated that the \nappropriate period of delay was no more than seven days.\n  The Senate voted to replace the ``reasonable period'' standard, which \nthe Bush administration has been abusing, with a basic 7-day rule, \nwhile permitting the Government to obtain additional 90-day extensions \nof the delay from the court. The current bill sets a 30-day rule for \nthe initial delay, more than three times what the Senate, and\n\n[[Page S1568]]\n\npre-PATRIOT Act courts, deemed appropriate. The shorter period would \nbetter protect Fourth Amendment rights without in any way impeding \nlegitimate government investigations. The availability of additional \n90-day extensions means that a shorter initial time frame should not be \na hardship on the Government. But our improvement has been rejected in \nfavor of too much Government power.\n  The current bill is also loaded with extraneous provisions that have \nnothing to do with the expiring PATRIOT Act authorities or even with \nterrorism. The bill modifies habeas corpus law--the great writ--a \nhighly controversial provision that is wholly improper to consider in \nthis context. I doubt it would ever pass, if it were put to a straight \nup-or-down vote. But slip it in the bill and say: It is for national \nsecurity. Give up your rights, Americans. It is for national security.\n  Many times people in this Chamber talk about Benjamin Franklin, and \nwe think back to that time. Here is a man involved in the revolution \nagainst King George. Had he failed, he would have been hanged. Most of \nthose around him would have been hanged. But when he has now become the \nGovernment and his friends have become the Government, replacing King \nGeorge, he wanted to make sure to protect the people from the \nGovernment. As he said, those who would give up essential liberties for \ntemporary security deserve neither liberty or security.\n  Habeas corpus, the one thing that every one of us can count on, the \ngreat writ, the thing that sets us apart from virtually every other \ncountry and the thing that protects us so much, was changed because a \nsmall number of Republican conferees wanted to change it. They did not \nwant to bring it on the floor of the Senate or the House and vote on it \nup or down. It has nothing do to do with terrorism or even the more \ngeneral tools of Federal law enforcement. It was almost a whim, let's \ntake away these rights.\n  These changes were not included in the PATRIOT Act reauthorization \nbill of either the House or the Senate, but mysteriously, here it is, \nslipped in.\n  I recall that part in ``A Man for All Seasons'' where Sir Thomas \nMore's protege William Roper is basically saying, the end justifies the \nmeans, and Sir Thomas More spoke of the law as something there to \nprotect us. He said, and I am paraphrasing: All of England is planted \nthick with laws. And his protege said, in effect, he would cut down all \nthose laws, if need be, to get at the devil. And Thomas More said: And \nwhat will protect you then, with all the laws cut down? Yes, I'd give \nthe devil benefit of the law, for my own safety's sake.\n  I wonder if we are not doing that, especially with the sneaky way \nthis was done. That is the only way I can describe it, sneaky. The \nadministration said: Kick the Democratic conferees out. And the \nindependent bodies, the House and the Senate, said: Aye-aye, sir. It \nviolates our rules, but, yes, sir, if you want that for the White \nHouse. And then they slipped it in. Neither body's Judiciary Committee \napproved it. Incidentally, the U.S. Judicial Conference, at that time \nheaded by Chief Justice Rehnquist, made up of some of the most \nconservative judges in the country, strongly opposed doing this.\n  Another extraneous provision of the bill will revive a small group of \npending death penalty prosecutions for aircraft hijacking murders \ncommitted in the 1970s and 1980s. It is designed to overrule the \ndistrict court decision in United States v. Safarini, which struck the \ndeath penalty for a 1986 hijacking offense on the grounds that the \nFederal Death Penalty Procedures Act of 1994 could not be retroactively \napplied to a pre-1994 crime, absent clear congressional intent to do \nso.\n  To my knowledge, Congress has never enacted death penalty legislation \nintended to allow the execution of a tiny number of known offenders for \ncrimes they are alleged to have committed from one to three decades \npreviously. Whether the Government can ultimately persuade the courts \nthat this does not violate the letter of the ex post facto and bill of \nattainder clauses of the Constitution, it certainly violates their \nspirit. It is telling that the Department of Justice, in its testimony \nbefore the House Judiciary Committee, strongly recommended adding in a \nseverability clause, in case this provision was ultimately held invalid \nby a court of law. I share the Department's skepticism regarding the \nconstitutionality of this wrongheaded provision, and deeply regret its \ninclusion in the conference report.\n\n  To sum up, the bill presents a complex mixture of valuable provisions \nwhich I support and would vote for if they were individually here, \nsignificant improvements on the one hand but so many serious flaws and \nmissed opportunities on the other. I think the final product would have \nbeen better if Members of Congress, Republicans and Democrats, both \nbodies had been allowed to work as Members of Congress, as \nrepresentatives of the people instead of as puppets of the most \nsecretive administration of the six administrations with which I have \nserved. The Bush administration insisted on locking Democrats out of \nthe negotiations. They did that, first, in connection with the \nconference and, again, after the Senate would not proceed to pass the \nconference report last December. When I and others tried to have \nconversations with the White House to improve the bill, our efforts \nwere dismissed. Basically, they took the attitude, as long as they can \nget the votes they needed on the Republican side of the aisle, there is \nno purpose in any bipartisan effort. What a mistake.\n  This is a bill that has both virtues and vices. I respect those who \nconclude that on balance the bill's virtues outweigh its vices. And if \nthey conclude that, then vote for it. But I believe we can and should \ndo better. I believe America can do better. I will continue to work to \nimprove the PATRIOT Act. I will work to provide better oversight of the \nuse of national security letters. I will work to remove what is a \ngross, un-American restraint on meaningful judicial review, the sort of \nthing that Presidents of both parties have strongly condemned when done \nby other countries. I hate to see our country do it.\n  I will seek to monitor how sensitive personal information that they \nare now allowed to seize from medical files, gun stores, and libraries \nis obtained and used. Today, I will join Senators Specter, Sununu, \nCraig, and others in introducing a bill to improve the PATRIOT Act and \nreauthorization legislation in several important respects. While we \nhave made some progress, much is left to be done.\n  Let me be very clear about this. There are good parts of this bill, \nbut there are also serious bad parts. The serious bad parts are worse \nif you have an administration that does not believe in checks and \nbalances and prefers to do everything in secret. We now see the \nadministration seeking to twist the Authorization for Use of Military \nForce against al-Qaida into a justification for its secret, illegal \nwiretapping of Americans' emails and telephone calls. We see the \nadministration claiming that it need not fulfill its constitutional \nresponsibility to faithfully execute the laws and that it can pick and \nchoose among the laws it will recognize. And we see an administration \nthat continues to attack anyone that gets in their way and insists on \nthe rule of law.\n  Confronted with the administration's claims of unchecked power, I do \nnot believe that the restraints we have been able to include in this \nreauthorization of the PATRIOT Act are sufficient. I will continue to \nwork to provide the tools that we need to protect the American people. \nI trust that Vermonters will understand that while I have repeatedly \nvoted to extend and reauthorize the PATRIOT Act, this measure, this \ntime, falls short of what they deserve. So I won't support it in its \ncurrent form. I will continue to work to provide the oversight of \nchecks needed on the use of Government power and seek to improve this \nreauthorization legislation. I know the Senate will adopt it, but it is \na pale shadow of what it could be. It is not the best that the greatest \ndemocracy on Earth deserves. I will fight for the best, but I will not \nvote for second best.\n  How much time do I have remaining, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 2 hours 24 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair, my good friend.\n  I yield all but 15 minutes of that time to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Wisconsin.\n\n[[Page S1569]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for \nyielding the time and also for his excellent remarks and his comments \non this issue.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, we pass a lot of laws in this body, but \nmost of them don't get any public attention. Not so with the PATRIOT \nAct. Few pieces of legislation have the kind of public understanding \nand recognition the PATRIOT Act does. The PATRIOT Act has become a \nrallying cry for those concerned about Government overreaching, \ngrabbing for more power than it needs, using a time of crisis to \njustify changes in the law it otherwise could not hope to see made.\n  People all over the country want us to take a step back, to \nreconsider, to fix the PATRIOT Act. Perhaps the strongest evidence of \nthis is that in the past 4 years, more than 400 State and local \ngovernments have passed resolutions opposing or objecting to various \naspects of the PATRIOT Act. Eight of those government bodies are State \nlegislatures that have already passed resolutions opposing the PATRIOT \nAct.\n  In April 2003, Hawaii was the first State to adopt a statewide \nresolution. The next month, in May 2003, Alaska and Vermont passed \nresolutions. Over the course of 2004 and 2005, we saw three more \nresolutions in Colorado, Montana, and Maine. Finally, Idaho passed a \nresolution specifically to support the SAFE Act's amendments to the \nPATRIOT Act, and recently, on February 16, California passed a \nresolution on the PATRIOT Act.\n  I will read these resolutions. There are eight such resolutions, \nAlaska being the first.\n  A resolution:\n\n       Relating to the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bill of Rights, the \n     Constitution of the State of Alaska, and the civil liberties, \n     peace, and security of the citizens of our country.\n       Be it resolved by the Legislature of the State of Alaska:\n       WHEREAS the State of Alaska recognizes the Constitution of \n     the United States as our charter of liberty, and that the \n     Bill of Rights enshrines the fundamental and inalienable \n     rights of Americans, including the freedoms of religion, \n     speech, assembly, and privacy; and\n       WHEREAS each of Alaska's duly elected public servants has \n     sworn to defend and uphold the United States Constitution and \n     the Constitution of the State of Alaska; and\n       WHEREAS the State of Alaska denounces and condemns all acts \n     of terrorism, wherever occurring;

and\n       WHEREAS certain provisions of the ``Uniting and \n     Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required \n     to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001'', also known \n     as the USA PATRIOT Act, allow the federal government more \n     liberally to detain and investigate citizens and engage in \n     surveillance activities that may violate or offend the rights \n     and liberties guaranteed by our state and federal \n     constitutions;\n       BE IT RESOLVED that the Alaska State Legislature supports \n     the government of the United States of America in its \n     campaign against terrorism, and affirms its commitment that \n     the campaign not be waged at the expense of essential rights \n     and liberties of citizens in this country contained in the \n     United States Constitution and the Bill of Rights; and be it\n       FURTHER RESOLVED that it is the policy of the State of \n     Alaska to oppose any portion of the USA PATRIOT Act that \n     would violate the rights and liberties guaranteed equally \n     under the state and federal constitutions; and be it\n       FURTHER RESOLVED that, in accordance with Alaska state \n     policy, an agency or instrumentality of the State of Alaska, \n     in the absence of reasonable suspicion of criminal activity \n     under Alaska State law, may not\n       (1) initiate, participate in, or assist or cooperate with \n     an inquiry, investigation, surveillance, or detention;\n       (2) record, file, or share intelligence information \n     concerning a person or organization, including library \n     lending and research records, book and video store sales and \n     rental records, medical records, financial records, student \n     records, and other personal data, even if--\n\n  Even if--\n\n     authorized under the USA PATRIOT Act;\n       (3) retain such intelligence information; the state \n     Attorney General shall review the intelligence information \n     currently held by the state for its legality and \n     appropriateness under the United States and Alaska \n     Constitutions and permanently dispose of it if there is no \n     reasonable suspicion of criminal activity;

law enforcement agencies \n     may not use race, religion, ethnicity, or national origin as \n     factors in selecting individuals to subject to investigatory \n     activities except when seeking to apprehend a suspect whose \n     race, religion, ethnicity, or national origin is part of the \n     description of the suspect; and be it\n       FURTHER RESOLVED that the Alaska State Legislature implores \n     the United States Congress to correct provisions in the USA \n     PATRIOT Act and other measures that infringe on civil \n     liberties, and opposes any pending and future federal \n     legislation to the extent it infringes on Americans' civil \n     rights and liberties.\n       Copies of this resolution shall be sent to the Honorable \n     George W. Bush, President of the United States; the Honorable \n     John Ashcroft, Attorney General of the United States; the \n     Honorable Frank Murkowski, Governor of Alaska; and to the \n     Honorable Ted Stevens, and the Honorable Lisa Murkowski, U.S. \n     Senators, and the Honorable Don Young, U.S. Representative, \n     members of the Alaska delegation in Congress.\n\n  That is the Alaska resolution.\n  California Senate Joint Resolution No. 10--Relative to the USA \nPATRIOT Act. Approved by the California Senate, introduced by Senator \nFigueroa.\n\n       WHEREAS, The State of California recognizes the \n     Constitution of the United States of America as our charter \n     of liberty, and that the Bill of Rights enshrines the \n     fundamental and inalienable rights of Americans, including \n     freedoms of religion, speech, and privacy;

and\n       WHEREAS, The State of California denounces and condemns all \n     acts of terrorism, wherever occurring; and\n       WHEREAS, Any new security measures of Federal, State, and \n     local governments should be carefully designed and employed \n     to enhance public safety without infringing on the civil \n     liberties and rights of innocent persons in the State of \n     California and the Nation; and\n       WHEREAS, Certain provisions of the Uniting and \n     Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required \n     to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act, also known as the \n     USA PATRIOT Act, allow the government greater authority to \n     detain and investigate persons and to engage in surveillance \n     activities that may violate or offend the rights and \n     liberties guaranteed by our Federal and State Constitutions, \n     including rights of due process, the right to privacy, the \n     right to counsel, protection against unreasonable searches \n     and seizures, and basic First Amendment freedoms;

We \n     urge the congressional delegation representing the State of \n     Idaho in the Congress of the United States to support \n     legislation introduced by Senator Larry Craig, known as the \n     SAFE Act.\n\n  Mr. President, the Maine Resolution, Joint Resolution Memorializing \nthe President of the United States and the Congress of the United \nStates to Ensure the Protection of Civil Liberties and the Security of \nthe United States Approved by the Maine State Legislature.\n\n       We, your Memorialists, the Members of the One Hundred and \n     Twenty-first legislature of the State of Maine now assembled \n     in the Second Special Session, most respectfully present the \n     petition of the President of the United States and the United \n     States Congress, as follows.\n       WHEREAS, the State of Maine recognizes that the \n     Constitution of the United States is our charter of liberty \n     and that the Bill of Rights enshrines the fundamental and \n     inalienable rights of Americans, including the freedoms of \n     religion, speech, assembly, and privacy; and\n       WHEREAS, each of Maine's duly elected public servants have \n     sworn to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United \n     States and the Constitution of Maine; and\n       WHEREAS, the State of Maine denounces and condemns all acts \n     of terrorism, wherever occurring; and\n       WHEREAS, attacks against Americans such as those that \n     occurred on September 11, 2001 have necessitated the crafting \n     of effective laws to protect the public from terrorist \n     attacks; and\n       WHEREAS, any new security measures of Federal, State, and \n     local governments should be carefully designed and employed \n     to enhance public safety, without infringing on the civil \n     liberties and the rights of any citizens in the State of \n     Maine and the Nation; and\n       WHEREAS, matters relating to immigration are primarily \n     Federal in nature; and\n       WHEREAS, certain provisions of the ``Uniting and \n     Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools to \n     Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001,'' commonly \n     referred to as the USA PATRIOT Act, allow the Federal \n     Government more liberally to detain and investigate citizens \n     and engage in surveillance activities that may violate or \n     offend the rights and liberties guaranteed by our State and \n     Federal Constitutions; now therefore,\n       Be It Resolved: That we, Your Memorialists, on behalf of \n     the people we represent, take this opportunity to inform the \n     President of the United States and the United States Congress \n     that the Maine State Legislature supports the government of \n     the United States of America in its campaign against \n     terrorism and affirms its commitment that the campaign not be \n     waged at the expense of essential civil rights and liberties \n     of citizens of this country contained in the Constitution of \n     the United States and the Bill of Rights; and be it further\n       Resolved: That the Maine State Legislature urges that the \n     Federal Government to continue to exercise its jurisdiction \n     over immigration matters and encourages the Federal \n     Government to work cooperatively with the States to provide \n     assistance and training to protect our country; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved: That laws passed by the United States Congress to \n     specifically combat the threat of international terrorism \n     should not be used in conducting domestic law enforcement; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved: That the Maine State legislature implores the \n     United States Congress to review the provisions in the USA \n     PATRIOT Act and other measures that may infringe on civil \n     liberties and ensure any pending and future Federal \n     liberties.\n       AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED: That the Legislature calls upon \n     our United States Representatives and Senators to monitor the \n     implementation of the USA PATRIOT Act and related federal \n     actions and, if necessary, repeal those sections of the USA \n     PATRIOT Act and related federal measures that may infringe \n     upon fundamental rights and liberties as recognized in the \n     United States Constitution and its amendments; and be it \n     further resolved that official copies of this resolution, \n     duly authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted \n     to the Honorable George W.

encouraging various actions in support of \n     fighting terrorism and protecting civil rights and civil \n     liberties; requesting the Attorney General of Montana to \n     compile and disseminate relevant information regarding \n     actions taken by the Federal Government under the USA PATRIOT \n     Act;

and\n       WHEREAS, terrorist attacks against Americans, such as those \n     that occurred on September 11, 2001, have necessitated the \n     crafting of effective laws to protect citizens of the United \n     States and others from terrorist attacks; and\n       WHEREAS, any new security measures of federal, state, and \n     local governments should be carefully designed and employed \n     to enhance public safety without infringing on the civil \n     liberties and rights of innocent citizens of Montana and the \n     United States; and\n       WHEREAS, certain provisions of the ``Uniting and \n     Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required \n     to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001'', also known \n     as the USA PATRIOT Act, allow the federal government to more \n     liberally detain and investigate citizens and to engage in \n     surveillance activities that may violate or offend the rights \n     and liberties guaranteed by our state and federal \n     constitutions.\n       Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives of the State of Montana:\n       That the 59th Montana Legislature supports the government \n     of the United States in its campaign against terrorism and \n     affirms the commitment of the United States that the campaign \n     not be waged at the expense of essential civil rights and \n     liberties of citizens of this country that are protected in \n     the United States Constitution and the Bill of Rights.\n       BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that it is the policy of the \n     citizens of Montana to oppose any portion of the USA PATRIOT \n     Act that violates the rights and liberties guaranteed under \n     the Montana Constitution or the United States Constitution, \n     including the Bill of Rights.\n       BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that in accordance with Montana \n     state policy, in the absence of reasonable suspicion of \n     criminal activity under Montana law, the 59th Montana \n     Legislature exhorts agents and instrumentalities of this \n     state to not:\n       (1) initiate or participate in or assist or cooperate with \n     an inquiry, investigation, surveillance, or detention under \n     the USA PATRIOT Act if the action violates constitutionally \n     guaranteed civil rights or civil liberties;\n       (2) record, file, or share intelligence information \n     concerning a person or organization, including library \n     lending and research records, book and video store sales and \n     rental records, medical records, financial records, student \n     records, and other personal data, even if authorized under \n     the USA PATRIOT Act, if the action violates constitutionally \n     guaranteed civil rights or civil liberties; or\n       (3) retain any of the intelligence information described in \n     subsections (1) and (2) of this clause if the information \n     violates constitutionally guaranteed civil rights or civil \n     liberties.\n       BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Attorney General of \n     Montana is encouraged to review intelligence information \n     currently held by the state, assess the legality and \n     appropriateness of holding the information under the United \n     States Constitution and Montana Constitution, and permanently \n     dispose of all such information to which there is not \n     attached a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.\n\n[[Page S1572]]\n\n       BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the 59th Montana Legislature \n     admonishes every agency and instrumentality of the state to \n     not:\n       (1) use state resources or institutions for the enforcement \n     of federal immigration matters that are the responsibility of \n     the federal government;\n       (2) collect or maintain information about the political, \n     religious, or social views, associations, or activities of \n     any individual, group, association, organization, \n     corporation, business, or partnership unless the information \n     directly relates to an investigation of criminal activities \n     and there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the subject \n     of the information was, is, or may be involved in criminal \n     conduct; or\n       (3) engage in racial profiling.\n       BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that state and local law \n     enforcement agencies should not use race, religion, \n     ethnicity, or national origin as factors in selecting \n     individuals to subject to investigatory activities, except \n     when seeking to apprehend a specific suspect whose race, \n     religion, ethnicity, or national origin is part of the \n     description of the suspect.\n       BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the 59th Montana Legislature \n     requests:\n       (1) public schools and institutions of higher learning \n     within Montana to provide notice to each individual whose \n     education records have been obtained by law enforcement \n     agents pursuant to section 507 of the USA PATRIOT Act;

Federal legislation that the Montana \n     Congressional Delegation is encouraged to oppose includes but \n     is not limited to the Domestic Security Enhancement Act of \n     2003, also known as Patriot Act II.\n       BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Secretary of State send a \n     copy of this resolution to President George W. Bush, the \n     Attorney General of the United States, Governor Brian \n     Schweitzer, Senator Max Baucus, Senator Conrad Burns, and \n     Representative Dennis Rehberg.\n\n  Mr. President, now we turn to Vermont.\n\n       Joint resolution strongly urging the President to revise \n     executive orders and policies, and for Congress to amend \n     provisions of the U.S.A. Patriot Act, which seriously erode \n     fundamental civil liberties.\n  Approved by: Vermont State Senate.\n\n       WHEREAS, on September 11, 2001, for the first time since \n     the War of 1812, the continental United States was subjected \n     to an attack from abroad when terrorists commandeered four \n     commercial airliners and destroyed the World Trade Center in \n     New York City and caused significant damage to the Pentagon, \n     and\n       WHEREAS, in response to these tragic and devastating \n     events, which cost nearly 3,000 innocent American lives, \n     Congress adopted the U.S.A. Patriot Act (Public Law 107-56) \n     which is intended to enable the federal government to act \n     more authoritatively in preventing future attacks, and\n       WHEREAS, while the prevention of future terrorist attacks \n     is a critical national priority, it is equally important to \n     preserve the fundamental civil liberties and personal \n     freedoms which were enshrined in the Bill of Rights over 200 \n     years ago, and which have been preserved through a constant \n     vigilance and outcry against periodic threats to their \n     existence, and\n       WHEREAS, while sunset review dates were attached to certain \n     provisions, the final bill remains, perhaps, the most severe \n     legislative attack on civil liberties since the passage of \n     the Alien and Sedition Acts in the 1790s, and\n       WHEREAS, under the auspices of both the U.S.A. Patriot Act \n     and related executive orders, persons from the Middle East \n     and South Asia have been unjustly targeted for interrogation \n     and possible deportation, and\n       WHEREAS, the ability of the Central Intelligence Agency to \n     engage in domestic spying activities, with tragic \n     repercussions, fortunately halted in the 1970s, but is now \n     being revived pursuant to sections 223 and 901 of the Act, \n     and\n       WHEREAS, section 213 greatly lowers the threshold required \n     for a court to issue a search warrant, and\n       WHEREAS, section 216 nearly eliminates judicial supervision \n     of telephone and internet surveillance, and\n       WHEREAS, section 411 gives the U.S. Attorney General \n     extraordinarily broad authority to designate domestic groups \n     as ``terrorist organizations,'' and\n       WHEREAS, both sections 411 and 412 subject noncitizens to \n     indefinite detention or deportation even if they have not \n     committed a crime, and\n       WHEREAS, several sections of the bill, including 215, 218, \n     358, and 508, permit law enforcement authorities to have \n     broad access to sensitive mental health, library, business, \n     financial, and educational records despite the existence of \n     previously adopted state and federal laws which were intended \n     to strengthen the protection of these types of records, and\n       WHEREAS, there has been an especially strong outcry in \n     Vermont against the ability of federal authorities, under \n     section 215 of the Act, to obtain judicially-issued warrants \n     for library or bookstore patron records based on minimal \n     information, and the accompanying prohibition on librarians \n     and bookstore personnel from revealing any information \n     regarding the request, and\n       WHEREAS, this provision runs directly counter to the intent \n     of the Vermont General Assembly to protect the privacy of a \n     library patron's records as codified in Title 3 \n     Sec. 317(c)(19) of the Vermont Statutes Annotated, and the \n     code of ethics of the American Library Association, and \n     Whereas, both the Fletcher Free Library Commission and the \n     Vermont Library Association have expressed their strongest \n     possible concerns that the U.S.A. Patriot Act undermines \n     constitutionally-guaranteed rights and the privacy of library \n     patrons, and\n       WHEREAS, Congressman Bernard Sanders has announced his \n     intention to sponsor legislation to exempt libraries and \n     booksellers from the disclosure requirements of the U.S.A. \n     Patriot Act, and\n       WHEREAS, a number of municipal legislative bodies, \n     including the Burlington City Council, have expressed their \n     deep concerns relative to the U.S.A. Patriot Act's historic \n     degradation of civil liberties, and\n       WHEREAS, the law gravely threatens the civic values, \n     personal freedoms, and rights that constitute the foundation \n     of our national existence, now therefore be it Resolved by \n     the Senate and House of Representatives: That the General \n     Assembly strongly urges the President and members of the \n     executive branch to review and revise executive orders and \n     policies which have been adopted since September 11, 2001, \n     and be it further\n       RESOLVED: That the General Assembly strongly urges the \n     United States Congress to\n\n[[Page S1573]]\n\n     revise the U.S.A. Patriot Act in order to restore and protect \n     our nation's fundamental civil liberties, and, in particular, \n     to enact Representative Sanders' proposal to exempt libraries \n     and bookstores from the provisions of the Act, and be it \n     further\n       RESOLVED: That the General Assembly requests that the \n     office of the Vermont Attorney General offer legal support to \n     any public library which is subject to a federal suit or \n     administrative enforcement action for refusing to comply with \n     the provisions of the Act related to library patrons' \n     records, and be it further\n       RESOLVED: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a \n     copy of this resolution to the President of the United \n     States, to each member of the Vermont Congressional \n     Delegation, and to Keith M. Fiels, Executive Director of the \n     American Library Association, in Chicago.\n\n  There you have it. Those are the eight State government resolutions, \nbut more than 400 total resolutions and ordinances have been passed, \nthe rest by local, city, and county governments. In fact, on December \n13, just 3 days before the first cloture vote on the conference report, \nthe town of Coupeville, WA, became the 400th community or State to pass \na resolution to reflect its citizens' concerns about the impact of the \nPATRIOT Act on constitutional rights. And since then four additional \ncommunities have passed resolutions, not to mention the California \nState resolution I just read.\n  Let me read a few of these county and city resolutions.

Freedom of speech, religion, assembly and privacy,\n       2. The right to counsel and due process in judicial \n     proceedings, and\n       3. Protection from unreasonable searches, seizures and \n     detention; and\n       WHEREAS, the members of the Common Council believe that \n     there is no inherent conflict between national security and \n     the preservation of liberty--Americans can be both safe and \n     free; and\n       WHEREAS, Federal, state and local governments should \n     protect the public from terrorist attacks, such as those that \n     occurred on September 11, 2001, but should do so in a \n     rational and deliberative fashion in order to ensure that \n     security measures enhance the public safety without impairing \n     constitutional rights or infringing on civil liberties; and\n       WHEREAS, the City of Milwaukee is grateful for the supreme \n     sacrifice of military veterans and law enforcement officers \n     who have died in protecting this country's cherished rights \n     and liberties; and\n       WHEREAS, the U.S. Congress passed the USA PATRIOT Act on \n     October 26, 2001 with little debate, following the attacks on \n     the United States on September 11, 2001; and\n       WHEREAS, sections of the USA PATRIOT Act and several \n     Executive Orders, now threaten fundamental rights and \n     liberties, which are guaranteed by the Constitution of the \n     State of Wisconsin and the United States Constitution and its \n     Bill of Rights; the sections of the Act which threaten these \n     human rights and liberties include:\n       Section 213 which permits law enforcement to perform \n     searches with no one present and to delay notification of the \n     search of a citizen's home.\n       Section 215 which permits the FBI Director to seek records \n     from bookstores and libraries including books of patrons \n     based on minimal evidence of wrongdoing and prohibits \n     librarians and bookstore employees from disclosing the fact \n     that they have been ordered to produce such documents.\n       Section 218 which dilutes the ``probable cause'' \n     requirement before conducting secret searches or surveillance \n     to obtain evidence of a crime.\n       Section 215, 218, 358, and 508 which permit law enforcement \n     authorities to have broad access to sensitive mental health, \n     library, business, financial and educational records despite \n     the existence of previously adopted state and federal laws \n     which were intended to strengthen the protection of these \n     types of records; and\n       WHEREAS, the City of Milwaukee has a commitment to uphold \n     the human rights of all persons in Milwaukee and the free \n     exercise and enjoyment of any and all rights and privileges \n     secured by our constitutions and laws of the United States, \n     the State of Wisconsin and the Charter of the City of \n     Milwaukee; now, therefore, be it\n       RESOLVED, by the Common Council of the City of Milwaukee, \n     that the Common Council expresses its support of protection \n     of citizens' human rights and civil liberties and opposition \n     to those provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act that threaten \n     those rights and liberties; and, be it\n       FURTHER RESOLVED, That the Common Council recognizes the \n     crucial distinctions between:\n       Legal and peaceful demonstrations and protests, which are \n     protected by the U.S. and Wisconsin constitutions and laws.\n       Acts of protest involving civil disobedience of minor law \n     infractions such as disorderly conduct.\n       Acts of terrorism, which would involve serious threats or \n     violence, such as kidnapping or serious bodily injury to a \n     civilian population; and, be it\n       FURTHER RESOLVED, That the Common Council affirms its \n     commitment to uphold civil rights and civil liberties and \n     therefore expresses its opposition to:\n       ( a) investigation of individuals or groups of individuals \n     based on their participation in activities protected by the \n     First Amendment, such as political advocacy or the practice \n     of religion, without reasonable suspicion of criminal \n     activity, and\n       (b) racial, religious or ethnic profiling; and, be it\n       FURTHER RESOLVED, That the Common Council calls upon \n     Wisconsin's federal legislators to monitor the implementation \n     of the USA PATRIOT Act and related federal actions and to \n     actively work for the repeal of those sections of the USA \n     PATRIOT Act that unduly infringe upon fundamental rights and \n     liberties as recognized in the U.S. Constitution; and, be \n     it\n       FURTHER RESOLVED, That the Common Council urges Wisconsin's \n     federal legislators to support and co-sponsor the Security \n     and Freedom Ensured Act of 2003 (SAFE Act) and urges \n     Congressman F. James Sensenbrenner, chair of the House \n     Judiciary Committee, to schedule hearings on the SAFE Act; \n     and, be it\n       FURTHER RESOLVED, That the City of Milwaukee opposes any \n     unfunded federal mandates instructing local police to attempt \n     to enforce the complex civil immigration laws of the U.S. to \n     the detriment of their primary law enforcement duties, as \n     articulated by the Boston Police Commissioner: ``turning all \n     police officers into immigration agents . . . will discourage \n     immigrants from coming forward to report crimes and \n     suspicious activity, making our streets less safe as a \n     result''; and, be it\n       FURTHER RESOLVED, That the City of Milwaukee remains \n     committed to the protection of civil rights and civil \n     liberties for all people and will uphold the constitutionally \n     protected rights of all people to peacefully express their \n     political views without governmental interference and that \n     officers of the Milwaukee Police Department be trained \n     consistent with the above principles; and, be it\n       FURTHER RESOLVED, That the Common Council opposes requests \n     by federal authorities that, if granted, would cause agencies \n     of\n\n[[Page S1575]]\n\n     the City of Milwaukee to exercise powers or cooperate in the \n     exercise of powers in violation of any city ordinance or the \n     laws or Constitution of the State of the United States; and, \n     be it\n       FURTHER RESOLVED, That in order to assess the effect of \n     antiterrorism initiatives on the residents of the City of \n     Milwaukee, the Common Council calls upon federal officials to \n     make periodic reports, consistent with the Freedom of \n     Information Act; and, be it\n       FURTHER RESOLVED, That the City of Milwaukee joins 43 \n     million Americans, 250 communities in 37 states across the \n     nation and the National League of Cities as of February 24, \n     2004 in expressing concern that existing elements of the USA \n     PATRIOT Act threaten civil rights and liberties guaranteed \n     under the U.S. Constitution.\n\n  Mr. President, I shared with my colleagues the resolutions of all \neight States in this country, all the way from Alaska to Maine, that \nexpress deep concerns about provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act. This was \nour opportunity to respond to the voices of those legislatures and the \npeople of those States, to their heartfelt concerns about the \ndegradation of their civil liberties. Many of these are not liberal \nStates. Many of these are some of the reddest of the red States, to put \nit into common parlance, and they are some of the strongest States when \nit comes to the question of whether someone's library records or \nbusiness records should be obtainable on no showing whatever--\nwhatever--that someone is connected either to terrorism or any kind of \nwrongdoing at all. That is American common sense, whether you are \nstanding in Maine, Wisconsin, or Alaska.\n  I only shared 4 of the 400 resolutions from city councils and county \ngovernments that essentially say the same thing. But I did share four \nfrom all over my State of Wisconsin where I believe the sentiment is \nstrong that there simply is no reason why we cannot get the balance \nright, why we can't always err on the side of more government power, \nwhere the feeling is that somehow we are capable in this Congress and \nin this Government and in this country of getting the terrorists and \nstopping the terrorists, but also protecting the fundamental rights on \nwhich this country is founded.\n  It is not just my words. I happen to have been the only person to \nvote against the original USA PATRIOT Act in this Senate. But what I \nhave begun to share is the fact that hundreds and hundreds of \ngovernmental units across this country have passed resolutions by the \nelected representatives in those communities or in those States, \nsaying, wait, there are problems with the USA PATRIOT Act and they must \nbe fixed.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding rule XXII, the vote on adoption of the conference \nreport to accompany H.R. 3199, the PATRIOT Act, occur at 3 p.m. \ntomorrow, with no further intervening action or debate. I further ask \nthat the time until 2:30 be equally divided, with 1 hour of the time \ncontrolled by the minority to be under the control of Senator Feingold \nand that the time between 2:30 and 3 p.m. be equally divided between \nthe majority leader and the Democratic leader or their designees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I want the record to be \nspread with my appreciation to Senator Feingold for working with us. \nBecause of his agreeing to give up part of the time, it is going to \nmake it more convenient for Members who have other things they would \nlike to be doing, including another matter to vote on as soon as we \nfinish this. So I want the record to indicate that I speak for many \nSenators in expressing appreciation to Senator Feingold for working \nwith us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, yesterday I opposed cloture on S. 2271, the \nUSA PATRIOT Act Additional Reauthorizing Amendments Act of 2006. \nAlthough I support Senator Sununu's bill, I voted against ending debate \non it because Members of the Senate should have the right to offer \namendments to this legislation, which implicates some very weighty \nconstitutional and civil liberty issues. Today, I voted in support of \nS. 2271 on its merits because I believe it improves the PATRIOT Act \nconference report. I will continue to work with Senators Feingold, \nSpecter, and others to make more improvements such as those included in \nthe bipartisan Senate PATRIOT Act reauthorization bill, which passed \nunanimously last July.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/01/senate-section/article/S1575-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           GOLDEN GAVEL AWARD\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I wish to take a brief moment to \nacknowledge an important feat of one of our Members. At approximately 5 \no'clock today, the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, \nreached his 100th hour of presiding. Senator Coburn will be the second \nSenator in the 109th Congress to receive the Golden Gavel Award.\n  Most Members will agree that the best way to learn about Senate \nprocedure is to preside over the Senate Chamber. Senator Coburn has \ndone so with distinction. He has done so with honor and with a firm but \nfair gavel. In addition to his regular presiding time, Senator Coburn \nhas volunteered to preside and fill in on those late nights and \nweekends when we are in dire need of help in the Chair. We all thank \nhim for that.\n  The Senate owes a debt of gratitude to the Senator from Oklahoma. We \nthank him for his service and congratulate him on this outstanding \nachievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/01/senate-section/article/S1575-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1575-S1576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, each year roughly 24,000 children in the \nUnited States are born with an autism spectrum disorder. Over my short \nlifetime in medicine, the last 30 years, it has been remarkable to see \nthe increase in autism spectrum disorder, a disorder which we don't \nunderstand today. We have made progress, but we don't understand it. \nThe symptoms are tragic in many ways. They can be severe, or they have \nthe spectrum from mild to severe. Autistic infants display abnormal \nreactions to various sensory stimuli, whether it is light or touch or \nsmells, where touches can be experienced as being very painful, smells \ncan be experienced as being very unpleasant. Loud noises and bright \nlights may cause reactions that involve a range of emotions, including \nweeping.\n  As the child grows older, they sometimes avoid cuddling or touching \neven close family members--again, this is a broad spectrum--many times \npreferring to stay alone, to play by themselves. By adolescence, these \nsymptoms can become unbearably acute. You can imagine the impact this \nhas on parents who become bewildered. Some lose hope. It is more common \nthan childhood cancer today.\n  A lot of people don't realize that the incidence and prevalence of \nthis has increased to the point that it surpasses childhood cancer. It \ncan tear apart families--even the strongest families. The reason I \nbring it to the floor today is, I spent a good part of today talking to \nvarious people whose families have been affected. My own family has \nbeen affected by it. And as a physician, a doctor, as somebody who has \ndevoted the majority of his adult life not to politics but to healing, \nI do believe that that combination of physician and legislator gives me \ncertain responsibilities but also certain opportunities to push the \nfrontiers of health, especially when we don't know the cause, the \netiology.\n  That is why 6 years ago I sponsored the Children's Health Act of \n2000. That was the first bill that looked at a whole spectrum of \nchildhood diseases, one of which was autism. The legislation directed \nthe National Institutes of Health to expand, to intensify, and to \ncoordinate research into autism--this very complex, very poorly \nunderstood disorder. Progress has been made, but now the time has come \nto reauthorize that legislation.\n  Under the Children's Health Act, the NIH established the interagency \ncoordinating committee to coordinate all autism-related activities at \nthe Health\n\n[[Page S1576]]\n\nand Human Services Agency. The committee represents a broad range of \ninterests, including parents, doctors, and researchers engaged with \nthis disease. The NIH also created eight Centers of Excellence in \nautism research across the country to conduct basic clinical research \ninto the cause, diagnosis, early detection, prevention, control, and \ntreatment of autism. These eight centers have shown and demonstrated \ntrue success.\n  In 2001, NIH spent about $56 million on autism-related research. \nThree years later, that number went up to $100 million. What is \nespecially remarkable is what the private sector, through philanthropy \nand organizations, has done in complementing and supplementing those \nfunds. Unfortunately, we still don't know what causes autism, but we \nknow that we must find a cure. It is time for us to reauthorize the \nautism provisions in the Children's Health Act. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to do that. Children are our Nation's most \nprecious resource. We must continue to push for a sustained investment \nand commitment to curing this heartbreaking disorder.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/01/senate-section/article/S1576-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, as I am sure all of my colleagues are \naware, President Bush arrives today in India, where he will meet with \nPrime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh. As the President observed on \nFebruary 22, ``We have an ambitious agenda with India. Our agenda is \nalso practical. It builds on a relationship that has never been better. \nIndia is a global leader, as well as a good friend, and I look forward \nto working with Prime Minister Singh to address other difficult \nproblems such as HIV/AIDS, pandemic flu, and the challenge posed by \nIran's nuclear ambitions. My trip will remind everybody about the \nstrengthening of an important strategic partnership. We'll work \ntogether in practical ways to promote a hopeful future for citizens in \nboth our nations.''\n  One of the most important items of business between the United States \nand India is the agreement for these two great democracies to cooperate \non civil nuclear energy, which President Bush and Prime Minister Singh \nannounced this past July. I have previously spoken in support of this \ninitiative. I am hopeful that we will soon reach an agreement on the \ndetails of the plan and look forward to the Senate's consideration of \nthe legislation that will implement the agreement.\n  The civil nuclear agreement with India is important for a number of \nreasons, ranging from improving global nonproliferation efforts to \nlessening India's demand on fossil fuels. I would like to emphasize \nthat India and the United States have common interests in preventing \nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and related materials. \nIndeed, India has repeatedly made the hard decision to stand with the \nUnited States in seeking a peaceful solution to Iran's nuclear weapons \nambitions.\n  However, it would be a mistake to confine the significance of the \nPresident's mission to India to nuclear issues. India is not only the \nworld's largest democracy but a rapidly growing consumer market for \nAmerican goods and services. Unlike some other developing economies, \nIndia's growth is not confined to heavy industry geared for the export \nmarket. Because India's economic dynamo is being driven from the bottom \nup, satisfying the needs of a rising middle class points to a balanced, \nhealthy commercial relationship with the United States.\n  President Bush's visit to India is an opportunity to advance our \npartnership across the full range of issues: expanded cooperation on \neconomic growth and development; mutual commercial opportunities, \ncombating international terrorism; and a full field of cooperation on \nspace, agriculture, energy and the environment, and high technology. I \nwish him the greatest success in all of these areas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/01/senate-section/article/S1576-3", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DAY IN AMERICAN HISTORY\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to reflect on a momentous day \nin American history. On this day in 1780, Pennsylvania became the first \nState in our Nation to abolish slavery. The Gradual Abolition Act was \nan important first step in our Nation's history toward greater equality \nfor all Americans.\n  Last month, 226 years later, we celebrated Black History Month. And, \nwe have much to celebrate since 1780. The accomplishments of African-\nAmericans and their tremendous sacrifices have strengthened our great \nNation and we recognize their enormous contributions to our diverse \nculture.\n  In 1870, the 15th amendment to the Constitution granted African-\nAmerican men the right to vote by declaring that the ``right of \ncitizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged \nby the United States or by any state on account of race, color, or \nprevious condition of servitude.''\n  It would be almost a century, however, for the true spirit of the \n15th amendment to be fully realized. Through the use of literacy tests, \npoll taxes, and other means, African-Americans were effectively \ndisenfranchised in many parts of the Nation. Significant numbers of \nBlack Americans across the country were not registered to vote until \nthe Voting Rights of Act of 1965 was enacted.\n  Organizations such as the National Association for the Advancement of \nColored People, NAACP, have continued the effort to gain true equality \nfor African-Americans. In my home State of Oregon, the Portland chapter \nof the NAACP was founded in 1914.

Mr. President, it is sometimes argued that ``prosecution \nis prevention'' when it comes to gun violence. While I agree that our \ngun laws should be strictly enforced, prosecuting criminals is only \npart of the solution to our Nation's problems with guns. True \nprevention involves reducing the likelihood of death or injury before \nan incident occurs. In addition, it is important to recognize that \nprosecution has little or nothing to do with the thousands of \naccidental shootings and gun suicides that occur each year. \nUnfortunately, we have still not done enough to prevent dangerous guns \nfrom falling into the hands of potential criminals, children, and \nothers who may intentionally or unintentionally use them to harm \nthemselves or others.\n  Physicians for Social Responsibility, or PSR, is a leading public \npolicy organization made up of more than 24,000 medical and public \nhealth professionals which has been active in the fight to solve the \nproblem of gun violence in our Nation. PSR is one of many groups who \nview gun violence as a ``preventable public health epidemic.'' As it \nstates on its Web site:\n\n       Public health practice focuses resources on prevention, \n     rather than a traditional criminal justice, ``after the \n     fact'' method of reacting to violence through arrest, \n     conviction and incarceration of violent offenders. Just as \n     public health policy recognizes that immunizing a patient \n     against the measles is far superior to treating a patient \n     already infected, the same logic can be applied to guns.\n\n  If we are serious about preventing gun violence, we must first reduce \nthe ability of criminals to acquire dangerous firearms. One way of \ndoing this is by requiring background checks on all firearms sold in \nthe United States, instead of only those that are sold by licensed \ndealers as is prescribed under current Federal law. According to the \nCoalition to Stop Gun Violence, ``two out of every five guns acquired \nin the United States, including guns bought at gun shows, through \nclassified ads, and between individuals, change hands without a \nbackground check.'' The Coalition to Stop Gun Violence also estimates \nthat ``extending criminal background checks to all gun transactions\n\n[[Page S1577]]\n\nin the United States could prevent nearly 120,000 additional illegal \ngun sales every year.''\n  Prevention of unintentional shooting and suicide by children requires \nthat proactive steps be taken to reduce access to dangerous firearms. A \nstudy published last year in the Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation found that the risk of unintentional shooting or suicide by \nminors using a gun can be reduced by 61 percent when ammunition in the \nhome is locked up. Simply storing ammunition separately from the gun \nreduces such occurrences by more than 50 percent.\n  Prosecution of gun violence perpetrators alone is not an effective \nmeans of preventing injury or death caused by guns, although opponents \nof commonsense gun safety legislation argue that it is. Unfortunately, \nour gun safety laws do not include many proactive measures that would \nreduce the likelihood that a gun is used to kill or injure. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in working to address this problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/01/senate-section/article/S1577-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING COACH EDWARD THOMAS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am proud to say that I have recently \ndiscovered, almost literally in my own backyard, an Iowan who has \nreceived an honor of national significance. Mr. Edward Thomas, the head \nfootball coach at Aplington-Parkersburg High School, is the recipient \nof the 2005 NFL High School Coach of the Year award. He was honored \nwith tickets to Super Bowl XL as well as monetary awards for himself \nand his football program.\n  Coach Thomas has been coaching for 34 years, 31 of those at \nAplington-Parkersburg. His overall record at Aplington-Parkersburg is \n249 wins and 58 losses. He has guided his teams to the State playoffs \n15 times, winning 2 State titles and has won 15 conference or district \nchampionships during that time. In his 34 years of coaching, he has won \nsuch awards as the National Federation High School Football Coach of \nthe Year in 2004, Northeast Iowa Coach of the Year 5 times and was \ninducted into the Iowa High School Football Coaches' Association Hall \nof Fame in 1990. With an enrollment of almost 300 at Aplington-\nParkersburg, Coach Thomas has produced 4 active NFL players--Detroit \nLions defensive end Jared DeVries, Jacksonville Jaguars guard Brad \nMeester, Kansas City Chiefs center Casey Wiegmann and Green Bay Packers \ndefensive end Aaron Kampman.\n  Coach Thomas also teaches life lessons and Christian principles while \nemphasizing the adversity and teamwork of football as a reflection of \nlife in the real world. As Aaron Kampman put it, ``He strives to make \nmen better through the game of football.'' Kampman also stated, ``You \nget goosebumps playing for the guy, the essence of playing under the \nlights on Friday night he brought that to the forefront.''\n  While the Aplington-Parkersburg Falcons are rivals to my hometown \nteam, the Dike-New Hartford Wolverines, I am very proud that an Iowan \nhas been honored in this way. I offer my sincere congratulations to \nCoach Thomas on this most prestigious honor and wish him continued \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/01/senate-section/article/S1577-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                            KIMMIE MEISSNER\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Kimmie \nMeissner, a great Olympian and the pride of Bel Air, MD. We in Maryland \nare so proud of Kimmie. Sixth at the Olympics at the age of 16 is a \nmonumental achievement.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I was glued to the television set to \nwatch our U.S. athletes in Torino. I was so impressed with Kimmie's \nperformance, I only wish I could have been there to lead the applause \nfor our hometown girl. She may have come in sixth in Torino, but she \ncame in first in the hearts of the people of my great State.\n  But Kimmie's accomplishments didn't begin in Torino. She began her \nfigure skating career 10 years ago at the age of 6. At the age of 6. \nShe has been a true student athlete for almost her entire life, \nbalancing her school work with her training. Kimmie goes to Fallston \nHigh School in Harford County every day, and when school is over she \ndrives to Delaware to train for her second shift as a competitive \nfigure skater.\n  Kimmie shows maturity far beyond her years, both on and off the ice. \nShe supports the Leukemia Society and the Johns Hopkins Hospital \nChildren's Center, taking time out of her life to visit with sick young \npeople.\n  On the ice, Kimmie couldn't have a better attitude. She says her \nmotto is, ``enjoy what you do; do what you enjoy.'' I can think of few \nyoung people who have such a thoughtful approach to life. At 16 years \nold, she has the brightest future of anyone of our Olympic skaters, and \nI can't wait for the Vancouver Olympics in 2010.\n  March is Women's History Month and the time when we celebrate the \nachievements and struggles of women in America. Frequently, we point to \nthose who have come before us and who have paved the way for current \nadvances. But it is only right and proper that in this 2006 Women's \nHistory Month, we salute young women like Kimmie and the honor she \nbrought the United States with her talent, skill, and sportsmanship.\n  Thank you, Kimmie, for making us so proud. Thank you for representing \nall that is good and true about America's young people. And though I \ncannot tell a salchow from an axel, let alone a loop from a lutz, even \nI could recognize your grit, grace, and promise of an even more \nglittering future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/01/senate-section/article/S1577-3", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO REGINA RUSH-KITTLE\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a dedicated \npublic servant and a groundbreaker in her field, Lieutenant Regina \nRush-Kittle. On March 3, Lieutenant Rush-Kittle will receive the \nOfficer of the Year award from the Connecticut Association of Women \nPolice.\n  Regina Rush-Kittle's long and distinguished law enforcement career \nbegan in 1983. After graduating from the University of Connecticut with \na degree in political science, Lieutenant Rush-Kittle served as a \ncorrectional officer at a high security correctional institution for 2 \nyears. She then joined the Middletown Police Department, becoming the \nfirst African-American female police officer on the force. She served \nas a patrol officer for 2 years prior to being accepted into the \nConnecticut State Police Academy.\n  Regina Rush-Kittle has been a trailblazer for African-American women \nin Connecticut law enforcement. After serving as the first African-\nAmerican woman on the Middletown police force, she went on to become \nthe first African-American woman to attain the rank of sergeant in the \nConnecticut State Police Department. Most recently, after scoring \nnumber one on both the lieutenants exam and master sergeants exam, \nRegina Rush-Kittle was promoted to lieutenant, the first African-\nAmerican female to attain that rank in the department's 100-year \nhistory. Her current assignment as commander of the Bethany barracks \nmakes her the first African-American woman in State history to command \na barracks.\n  Lieutenant Rush-Kittle's tireless commitment to her community, her \nState, and her country extends beyond her achievements in Connecticut \nlaw enforcement. She is a long-serving Marine and Army Reservist. In \n2003, she was deployed to Kuwait for a year, serving with the 804th \nMedical Brigade out of Fort Devens, MA. Upon her return in February \n2004, she attained the rank of sergeant major, taking on \nresponsibilities far beyond the normal obligations to serve 1 weekend \nper month and 2 weeks in the summer. Despite being eligible for \nretirement from the Reserves, Lieutenant Rush-Kittle continues to \nserve.\n  Regina Rush-Kittle is an outstanding citizen who goes above and \nbeyond to protect her fellow citizens, her State, and her country. I \ncommend her for her continued dedication, and congratulate her, her \nhusband William, and her two children Jorrell and Gianna on this \nwonderful occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/01/senate-section/article/S1577-4", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1577-S1578]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:33 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 449.

A bill to authorize the Federal Emergency Management Agency \nto provide relief to the victims of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane \nRita by placing manufactured homes in flood plains, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, this week marks the 6-month anniversary of \nwhen Hurricane Katrina ravaged the gulf coast, destroying lives and \ndreams along the way. Thousands upon thousands of homes were also \nruined, and today they remain simply a heap of debris.\n  I saw this devastation firsthand a few weeks ago when, as a member of \nthe Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, we traveled \nto Gulfport and New Orleans for field hearings to see what resources \nare necessary to help the region recover from the largest natural \ndisaster in our history.\n  In fact, this photograph was taken by one of the press people who was \non that trip. So we saw this scene firsthand. Alison Vekshin of \nStephens Media took this photo.\n  I remind my colleagues that Hurricane Katrina completely destroyed \n205,330 homes in Louisiana. It completely destroyed 68,729 homes in \nMississippi. And 363 homes were completely destroyed in Alabama. For \nmany of these families who lost everything, a place to live would offer \nopportunity for them to go back to work and begin rebuilding their \nlives.\n  I was told by local and State leaders that housing is the catalyst to \nget businesses open, to get people back to work, to pump money back \ninto the local economy, and to restore the infrastructure that once \nexisted.\n  Many people along the gulf coast who lost their houses have also lost \nhope. In Arkansas, we have a place called Hope where 10,777 \nmanufactured homes sit on an airfield.\n  These homes--ordered by FEMA and paid for by FEMA--now sit in a FEMA-\nleased site, only to be restricted from use in the gulf region because \nof a FEMA-imposed rule that prevents them from being located in a \nfloodplain.\n  FEMA is now accepting bids to gravel the area where the homes are \nsitting on dirt, costing taxpayers another $4 to $7 million. In \naddition, FEMA is buying a specially designed jack for each corner of \neach home to prevent sagging and further damage.\n  These manufactured homes epitomize FEMA's ineptitude in planning, \ncommunication, and response. Taxpayers have now spent an estimated $475 \nmillion for these homes to sit gridlocked in bureaucracy, even as \nevacuees are evicted from hotel rooms and thousands of others struggle \nto find affordable housing.\n  Congressman Mike Ross of Arkansas asked FEMA to waive the floodplain \nrestriction that stands in the way between the homeless and a home. But \nFEMA refused, citing that manufactured homes are ``sitting ducks'' for \nthe next natural disaster. These homes, I have to remind my colleagues, \nwere built to high wind zone 3 specifications, so while they may not \nwithstand the next hurricane--although they may--they will not tumble \nover during a storm.\n  Now, we are telling FEMA to let hope travel to where it is needed \nmost, from\n\n[[Page S1581]]\n\nArkansas to Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama.\n  My legislation, the Hope Housing Act of 2006, allows manufactured \nhomes bought for Katrina and Rita victims to be located in floodplains, \nprotects FEMA from responsibility if the homes are subsequently \nflooded, and directs FEMA to publicize this change so people will know \nthey are available.\n  This is a one-time change that I believe is necessary in the face of \nwhat I hope will be a one-time disaster. We have people without homes \nand homes without people. Let's allow the homes to go where they are \nneeded so the people in New Orleans and the gulf coast can return to \ntheir communities and help rebuild them. The alternative seems to be to \nlet them sit and deteriorate in Hope, Arkansas.\n  Mr. President, 6 months is too long to allow this nonsense to \ncontinue. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense solution \nthat allows hurricane victims a little hope and opportunity for their \nfuture.\n  The bottom line is that basically FEMA ordered these homes, paid for \nthese homes, and now they are storing these homes, but their own \nregulation will not allow them to use them where they are most needed. \nSo what our legislation does is allow FEMA to put these homes down \nwhere they are needed to try to get the economic cycle in New Orleans \nand the gulf coast area going again because right now the cycle is \nbroken. They do not have people down there to work the jobs. They do \nnot have people down there to be consumers. And the reason they do not \nhave people is because they do not have a place to live.\n  So I urge my colleagues to consider helping in this effort. The Hope \nHousing Act of 2006 is a very commonsense solution for this very \ncritical need.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 2345.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nand modify the tax credit for holders of qualified zone academy bonds; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today, I am reintroducing, with Senator \nRockefeller, a bill to make some small but important changes to the \nQualified Zone Academy Bond, QZAB, program.\n  The QZAB program helps qualifying schools renovate and update school \nbuildings. Schools issue special bonds to finance the cost of \nrenovation. Purchasers of the bonds receive a Federal tax credit in \nlieu of interest on the bond, thus helping to reduce the cost to the \nschool. Most States are now using this program to modernize their \nschool facilities. The QZAB program expired in 2005, but the Tax \nReconciliation bill that will soon be considered by a conference \ncommittee extends the program.\n  We are proposing to make modest changes in the QZAB program to make \nit even more useful to schools across the country. Our bill would \nexpand the pool of bond purchasers to include all taxpayers, both \nindividuals and other entities. Currently, only financial institutions \ncan buy QZABs, which precludes pension funds and mutual funds from \npurchasing QZABs.\n  Our bill would also allow QZABs to be ``stripped'' so the purchaser \ncould then sell separately the principal portion of the bond and the \ntax credit. This will encourage the development of a secondary market \nfor the bonds and reduce the discount costs making more of the proceeds \navailable for school-related expenses. It will also open the market to \nnonprofit entities such as public employee pension funds.\n  The bill revises the allocation formula to the States to better align \nwith Title I, the program for disadvantaged students. Current law \nrequires that allocations be made on the basis of a State's population \nliving below poverty. This change simplifies and updates by tying \nfunding to the formula used to distribute Title I funding for \ndisadvantaged students.\n  Unused bonding authority would be reallocated to other States. A few \nStates have not used their allocations, and their bonding authority has \nlapsed. However, the demand in many States now far exceeds their \nallocation. Allowing funds to be reallocated would maximize the \npotential of the QZAB program.\n  Finally, our bill would allow QZABs to be used for new construction \nand to purchase land for school buildings. We believe QZABs have been \nproven to be a cost-effective method for financing school renovation. \nWith this additional flexibility, States can effectively reduce their \nconstruction backlogs.\n  School districts across the country have praised the QZAB program for \nhelping them to address serious problems in their buildings. This is a \ngood program. We can make it even better by enacting these small \nreforms. I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this important \nmeasure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA (for himself and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 2348. A bill to amend the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to require a \nlicensee to notify the Atomic Energy Commission, and the State and \ncounty in which a facility is located, whenever there is an unplanned \nrelease of fission products in excess of allowable limits; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, less than 2 months ago, it was announced by \nExelon Nuclear that an environmental monitoring program discovered \nhigher than normal concentrations of tritium in the groundwater near \nthe Nuclear Generating Station in Braidwood, IL.\n  Indications are that this tritium plume is the result of an \naccidental radioactive wastewater release that occurred approximately 6 \nto 8 years ago, and now the tritiated water has migrated underground \ninto several drinking wells of nearby residents.\n  While most of the issues associated with this situation are still \nunder investigation, one issue is clear. Community residents, \nparticularly the State and local officials responsible for the safety \nand health of their constituents, did not receive full or immediate \nnotification of this contamination--either from Exelon, or the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission, NRC, the Federal agency with oversight over \nnuclear plant operations.\n  I was surprised to learn, that while Federal law requires State and \nlocal officials to be notified immediately upon a ``declared \nemergency,'' Federal law does not require State and local officials to \nbe notified of any other accidental, unplanned, or unintentional \nradioactive substance releases that may occur if those releases do not \nimmediately rise to a public health or safety threat. And while those \nincidents must be documented with the NRC and made available to the \npublic, accessing that information is contingent upon the public and \nState and local officials actually knowing that these incidents ever \noccurred.\n  When radioactive substances are released into the environment outside \nof normal operating procedures, notifying State and local officials \nshould not be a courtesy; it should be the law.\n\n[[Page S1582]]\n\n  That's why today I am introducing the Nuclear Release Notice Act of \n2006, a bill designed to expand the public's right to know when \nradioactive substances are released from a reactor. Specifically, the \nbill is designed to accomplish the following: (1) to ensure that the \nlicensees notify State and local officials at the same time the NRC is \nnotified regarding unplanned incidents that occur at local nuclear \npower plants; (2) to add State and local reporting requirements not \njust on incidents regarding fissionable material releases, but on all \nunplanned radioactive substance releases that are outside of normal \noperating limits; (3) to add State and local reporting requirements \nwhen releases exceed not just NRC limits for normal operation, but also \nwhen they exceed other Federal limits and standards for groundwater and \nother types of contamination; (4) to ensure than any repeat unplanned \nreleases of radioactive substances--even if within allowable limits--\nthat occur more than twice within 2 years are reported to State, local \nand NRC officials--so that we all know when poor maintenance, \nmalfunctions of poor design are going unfixed; and (5) to provide that \nviolations of this provision could result in the revocation of the \noperating license of the licensee.\n  As energy demand throughout the Nation increases in the coming \ndecades, we will be challenged in how best to meet these consumption \ndemands without sacrificing the environment. That means using all of \nour energy resources fully and wisely, including wind, solar, and other \nimportant renewable power-generating resources.\n  Moreover, as Congress considers policies to address air quality and \nthe deleterious effects of carbon emission's on the global ecosystem, \nit is reasonable--and realistic--for nuclear power to remain on the \ntable for consideration. Illinois has 11 nuclear power plants--the most \nof any State in the country--and nuclear power provides more than half \nof Illinois' electricity needs.\n  The people of Illinois--and all residents who live near nuclear power \nplants--have a right to know when actions are taken that might affect \ntheir safety and well-being. This bill furthers this commonsense goal, \nand I urge my colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Dayton):\n  S. 2351. A bill to provide additional funding for mental health care \nfor veterans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \ntoday to double the funding for veterans mental health care over the \nnext 5 years.\n  Our brave veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan have faced \nunspeakable horrors. They have seen people killed and wounded, \nexperienced the stress of urban warfare, and endured other traumatic \nevents. These experiences undoubtedly take their toll. However, it can \ntake months or even years for these events to impact a person's mental \nhealth.\n  The need for this legislation is clear. Just today, the Washington \nPost reported that more than one in three soldiers and Marines who have \nserved in Iraq later sought help for mental health problems. And we \nalready know that the Veterans' Administration treated almost 19,000 \nIraq and Afghanistan veterans for post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, \nbetween 2002 and 2005. These numbers will continue to increase.\n  This legislation will help ensure that the VA has the resources \nnecessary to treat veterans with mental illness. First, it authorizes \nthe VA to spend at least $3.6 billion in 2007--up from $2.8 billion in \n2006--and increases funding to $5.6 billion by 2011. Second, it \nrequires an annual report about progress in implementing milestones \nfrom the VA Mental Health Strategic Plan.\n  This bill is supported by AMVETS and Disabled American Veterans.\n  It is imperative that we make a long-term commitment to provide \nmental health services to our veterans, who have sacrificed so much for \nus. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/01/senate-section/article/S1582-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1582-S1583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      SENATE RESOLUTION 386--HONORING THE PRE-NEGRO LEAGUES AND NEGRO \n        LEAGUES BASEBALL PLAYERS AND EXECUTIVES ELECTED TO THE NATIONAL \n        BASEBALL HALL OF FAME CLASS OF 2006\n  Mr. TALENT (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Frist, and Mr. Sununu) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 386\n\n       Whereas African Americans began to play baseball in the \n     late 1800s on military teams, college teams, and company \n     teams, and eventually found their way onto professional teams \n     with White players;\n       Whereas the racism and ``Jim Crow'' laws that forced \n     African American players from their integrated teams by 1900 \n     compelled those dedicated players to form their own \n     ``barnstorming'' teams that traveled throughout the United \n     States and offered to play any team willing to challenge \n     them;\n       Whereas, in 1920, the Negro National League was created \n     under the guidance of Andrew ``Rube'' Foster, a former \n     player, manager, and owner of the Chicago American Giants, at \n     a meeting held at the Paseo YMCA in Kansas City, Missouri;\n       Whereas soon after the Negro National League was formed, \n     rival leagues were assembled in eastern and southern States, \n     bringing the thrills and innovative play of African American \n     ballplayers to major urban centers and rural countrysides \n     throughout the United States, Canada, and Latin America;\n       Whereas, from the 1920s to the 1960s, over 30 communities \n     located throughout the United States were home to teams in 1 \n     of the 6 Negro Leagues;\n       Whereas the Negro Leagues maintained a high level of \n     professional skill and became centerpieces for economic \n     development in their communities;\n       Whereas, in 1945, the Brooklyn Dodgers of Major League \n     Baseball recruited Jackie Robinson from the Kansas City \n     Monarchs, making Robinson the first African American in the \n     modern era to play on a Major League Baseball roster;\n       Whereas the integration of Major League Baseball, which \n     soon followed the signing of Jackie Robinson, prompted the \n     decline of the Negro Leagues because the Major Leagues began \n     to recruit and sign the best African American ballplayers;\n       Whereas it has been recognized by numerous baseball \n     authorities that many of the greatest players ever to play \n     the game of baseball played in the Negro Leagues, rather than \n     Major League Baseball;\n       Whereas, on February 27, 2006, the National Baseball Hall \n     of Fame announced that Ray Brown, Willard Brown, Andy Cooper, \n     Frank Grant, Pete Hill, Biz Mackey, Effa Manley, Joe Mendez, \n     Alex Pompez, Cum Posey, Louis Santop, Mule Suttles, Ben \n     Taylor, Cristobal Torriente, Sol White, J.L.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 386, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 386) honoring the Pre-Negro Leagues \n     and Negro Leagues baseball players and executives elected to \n     the National Baseball Hall of Fame Class of 2006.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to talk \nabout a historic event that occurred on Monday. The National Baseball \nHall of Fame in Cooperstown elected 17 pre-Negro Leagues and Negro \nLeagues baseball players and executives to the National Baseball Hall \nof Fame Class of 2006.\n  Many of baseball's most noted stars of the past century got their \nbeginnings in the Negro Leagues. Greats such as Hank Aaron, Ernie \nBanks, Roy Campanella, Larry Doby, Willie Mays, Satchel Paige, and, of \ncourse, Jackie Robinson brought their fast-paced and highly competitive \nbrand of Negro Leagues baseball eventually to the Major Leagues. In \nfact, there are a lot of people who think that much of the fast-paced \nstyle of baseball today is owing to the influence of the Negro League's \nbrand of baseball.\n  Before these greats of the game were given the opportunity to \nshowcase their skills at the Major League level, many African-American \nballplayers with equal skill were never allowed to share the same field \nas their White counterparts. Instead, such players played from the \n1920s to the 1960s in over 30 communities located throughout the United \nStates on teams in one of six Negro Baseball Leagues, including Kansas \nCity and St. Louis in my home State of Missouri.\n  The history of this is interesting. In the late 1800s and early \n1900s, African Americans began to play on military baseball teams, \ncollege teams, company teams. The teams were integrated in those days. \nMany African Americans eventually found their way onto professional \nteams with White players. But racism and Jim Crow laws drove the \nAfrican-American players from their integrated teams in the early \n1900s, forcing them to form their own ``barnstorming'' teams which \nwould travel around the country playing anyone willing to challenge \nthem.\n  But then, in 1920, the Negro National League, which was the first of \nthe Negro Baseball Leagues, was formed under the guidance of Andrew \n``Rube'' Foster--a former player, manager, and owner of the Chicago \nAmerican Giants--and was formed at a meeting held at the Paseo YMCA in \nKansas City, MO. Soon after the Negro National League was formed, rival \nleagues formed in Eastern and Southern States and brought the thrills \nand the innovative play of the Negro Leagues to major urban centers and \nrural countrysides throughout the United States, Canada, and Latin \nAmerica.\n  For more than 40 years, the Negro Leagues maintained a high level of \nprofessional skill and became centerpieces for economic development in \ntheir communities. The Negro Leagues constituted the third biggest \nBlack owned and run business in the country in those days. They brought \njobs and economic activity to many of the cities around the United \nStates. They played in front of crowds of 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000, \nand 50,000 people. And those crowds were integrated. White and Black \nfans came to watch the Negro Leagues, and they sat together.\n  In 1945, Major League Baseball's Brooklyn Dodgers recruited Jackie \nRobinson from the Kansas City Monarchs, which, of course, made Jackie \nthe first African American in the modern era to play on a Major League \nroster. That historic event led to the integration of the Major Leagues \nand ironically prompted the decline of the Negro Leagues because, of \ncourse, Major League teams began to recruit and sign the best African-\nAmerican ballplayers.\n  On Monday of this week, the National Baseball Hall of Fame took a \nfirst step in righting a historic wrong when it recognized the \ndistinguished careers of 17 pre-Negro League ballplayers and \nexecutives, people who were never given the opportunity to compete in \nMajor League Baseball with their White counterparts. Oh, they often \nplayed them, and very often, in barnstorming games or exhibition-type \nmatches, the Negro League players and teams would play the best players \nof the Major Leagues, and those must have been great baseball games to \nsee.\n  But the Hall of Fame elected those 17 players and executives to the \nNational Baseball Hall of Fame Class of 2006. The players elected on \nMonday were Ray Brown, Willard Brown, Andy Cooper, Frank Grant, Pete \nHill, Biz Mackey, Effa Manley--the first woman\n\n[[Page S1587]]\n\nelected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, and more on that in just a \nminute--Joe Mandez, Alex Popez Cum Posey, Louis Santop, Mule Suttles, \nBen Taylor, Cristobal Torriente, Sol White, J.L. Wilkinson, and Jud \nWilkinson. These legends, not just of the Negro Leagues but of our \nnational pastime, will now join the less than 1 percent of all \nprofessional baseball players who have been honored with induction into \nthe National Baseball Hall of Fame, and they will be inducted on July \n30, 2006.\n  One of the more historic moments of Monday's selection was the \nselection of Effa Manley, who was the co-owner of the Newark Eagles. \nShe became the first woman ever elected to the Hall of Fame. In \naddition to her efforts in baseball, she played an active role in the \ncivil rights movement and promoted such causes as Anti-Lynching Day at \nRuppert Stadium, which was the home of the Newark Eagles.\n  Among those elected, several have ties to my home State of Missouri, \nand it will surprise no one in the Senate that I decided to feature \nthem in my remarks.\n  Willard Brown was an outfielder with the Kansas City Monarchs who \noften led the Negro American League in home runs and batting average. \nHe was considered by many to be the Negro American League's version of \nthe great Josh Gibson.\n  Andy Cooper was a pitcher with the Detroit Stars and Kansas City \nMonarchs who had a knack for changing the speed of his pitches. He is \namong the top ten leaders in career wins, strikeouts, shutouts, and \nwinning percentage in Negro Leagues history. Later in his career he \nbecame the manager of the Kansas City Monarchs, leading them to three \npennants.\n  Jose Mendez was a right handed pitcher for the Cuban Stars, All \nNations, and Kansas City Monarchs who had a career winning percentage \njust under .700 in the Negro National League. He managed the Kansas \nCity Monarchs to successive pennants from 1923-1925.\n  Mule Suttles was a first baseman and outfielder for the St. Louis \nStars, Chicago American Giants, Birmingham Black Barons and the Newark \nEagles. He was one of the most powerful home run hitters in the Negro \nLeagues, ranking third all-time among Negro Leaguers in home runs and \nRBIs.\n  Cristobal Torriente was a five-tool outfielder with a lifetime \nbatting average over .330 primarily with the Cuban Stars and Chicago \nAmerican Giants. For those who don't know what a five-tool outfielder \nis it means he could hit for average, hit for power, run with speed, \nfield with above average skill and display enough arm strength to throw \nout the fastest players at home plate. He is one of the all-time \noffensive leaders in Negro Leagues history, ranking in the top 20 all-\ntime in home runs, RBIs and total bases. The record books would have \nbeen different had these players been allowed to play in Major League \nbaseball.\n  J.L. Wilkinson was the owner of the Kansas City Monarchs, the All \nNations club and one of the first professional women's teams in the \nUnited States. He was a pioneer of night baseball, various ballpark \npromotions, and was the Negro National League's only white owner when \nit was chartered in 1920. His Kansas City Monarchs were the longest \nrunning franchise in Negro National League history and they won an \nunprecedented 17 pennants, and two World Series.\n  I congratulate all 17 players and executives elected this week, as \nwell as their families and friends. This is an honor long overdue and \nis sure to lead to a great celebration this summer in Cooperstown. It \nwill be a dramatic moment when these figures are inducted in the Hall \nof Fame. However, it saddens me that this summer's historic induction \nceremony did not take place during the lifetime of these baseball \ngreats. I can only wish that they were still alive today to witness \nbaseball's long overdue recognition of their contributions on and off \nthe field.\n  There is another aspect of this selection process which is \ndisappointing and bittersweet for many of us because one of the legends \nof Negro Leagues did not receive the necessary votes to be elected to \nthe Hall of Fame. That legend is John Jordan ``Buck'' O'Neil. Buck's \nillustrious baseball career spans seven decades and has made him a \nforemost authority of the game and one of its greatest ambassadors. \nBuck is in his 90s now, and still active, still a leader in baseball \nand a leader in remembering the Negro Leagues and establishing the \nNegro League's Baseball museum.\n  I would like to tell you a little about Buck O'Neil the man and Buck \nO'Neil the player. I had intended to introduce this Resolution earlier \nthis week, but was so disappointed by the exclusion of Buck from those \nselected that I began to have second thoughts about the process for \nselecting this class of inductees. I had a conversation with Buck \nyesterday and he told me that going forward with this Resolution was \nimportant not only to recognize this historic event--I mean important \nin a practical way to the Negro League's baseball museum and the \nremberance of the Negro Leagues, and to recognize the achievement of \nthese 17 players and executives--but because it was the right thing to \ndo. Buck O'Neil has always been about doing the right thing. No matter \nwhat door has been slammed in his face he always picks himself up and \ndoes what is right and what is most important to him. In this case what \nis most important to him is his true love for the Negro Leagues, the \nNegro Leagues players and the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, which he \nhelped to found and which he has been so active in promoting in Kansas \nCity.\n  In yesterday's Kansas City Star, columnist Joe Posnanski had this to \nsay about the injustice that occurred to Buck O'Neil on Monday:\n\n       All his life, Buck O'Neil has had doors slammed in his \n     face. He played baseball when the major leagues did not allow \n     black players. He was a gifted manager at a time when major \n     league owners would not even think of having an African \n     American lead their teams. For more than 30 years, he told \n     stories about Negro Leagues players and nobody wanted to \n     listen. Now, after everything, he was being told that the \n     life he had spent in baseball was not worthy of the Hall of \n     Fame. It was enough to make those around him cry. But Buck \n     laughed. ``I'm still Buck,'' he said. ``Look at me. I've \n     lived a good life. I'm still living a good life. Nothing has \n     changed for me.''\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a copy of Mr. Posnanski's article \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. TALENT. I thought I would take a few moments of the Senate's time \nto talk a little bit about Buck's record. I think the Senate would \nagree with me it would have fully justified his induction.\n  Buck O'Neil the player was a first baseman and Manager for the Kansas \nCity Monarchs from 1937 through 1955. Buck's achievements as a player \ninclude leading his team to a Negro American league title and a date \nwith the Homestead Grays in the 1942 Negro World Series. In the series \nBuck hit .353 and led the Monarchs to a four game sweep of the \npowerhouse Homestead Grays. Buck sport a career batting average of \n.288, including four .300-plus seasons. He won batting titles in 1940 \nand 1946, hitting .345 and .353 respectively. He was named to the East-\nWest All-Star Classic in 1942, 1943 and 1949 and barnstormed with the \nSatchel Paige All-Stars during the 1930s and 1940s playing countless \ngames against the likes of the Bob Feller All-Stars. I would have given \na lot to have seen one of those games.\n  In 1948, Buck succeeded Frank Duncan, as manager of the Monarchs, and \ncontinued to manage them until 1955. As the manager of the Monarchs, he \nsent more Negro league veterans to the Majors than any other manager in \nbaseball history including Ernie Banks, Elston Howard, Connie Johnson, \nSatchel Paige and Sweet Lou Johnson. He lead the Monarchs to league \ntitles in 1948, 1950, 1951 and 1953 and managed the West squad in the \nEast-West All-Star game in 1950, 1952, 1954 and 1955. By the way, the \nWest won all four of these contests.\n  In 1956, Buck was hired by the Chicago Cubs as a scout. Six years \nlater he became the first African American to coach in the Major \nLeagues with the Cubs. As a scout he discovered such superstars as Lou \nBrock, one of my all-time favorite Cardinals, and Joe Carter. Lou \ncalled him on Monday by the way, expecting Buck would have been \ninducted, while everybody was waiting to see the results of the vote. \nIn 1988, after more than 30 years with the Cubs, he returned home to \nKansas City to scout for the Kansas City Royals.\n\n[[Page S1588]]\n\n  Today Buck serves as chairman of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum he \nhelped found in 1990. The work of Buck O'Neil and the Negro Leagues \nBaseball Museum led the Hall of Fame to hold this special election of \nNegro Leagues and Pre-Negro Leagues players.\n  In fact, his work after he had retired from the game as a coach may \nbe even more significant to the history of baseball than his exploits \nas a player and a manager. Nobody has done more to build that museum \nand to call the rest of us to remember the significance of the Negro \nbaseball league.\n  It was significant on so many different levels: A triumph of the \nhuman spirit, tremendous sportsmanship, tremendously high quality of \nplay, vitally important to the Black community of the time, and it led \ndirectly to the integration of the Major Leagues, which was the first \nin a series of mjor civil rights landmarks in the modern era that has \nled to the progress we have achieved today.\n  I believe there is no one who meets the criteria for induction into \nthe National Baseball Hall of Fame more than Buck. The combination of \nhis statistics on the field as a player, his years as a scout \ndiscovering some of the best players of their generation, his years as \na manager and coach, including breaking the color barrier as the first \nAfrican-American coach in the Major Leagues, and his years of tireless \nadvocacy on behalf of the Negro Leagues and its players equals a resume \nbuilt for election to Cooperstown. I hope that the Baseball Hall of \nFame will take appropriate action to correct this oversight.\n  Finally, I would like to congratulate everyone at the Negro Leagues \nBaseball Museum in Kansas City, who worked so very hard for so many \nyears to make this special election a reality. Their tireless advocacy \non behalf of these baseball legends is another reason why the Senate \nshould pass legislation that would give a national designation to the \nNegro Leagues Baseball Museum, the only public museum in the Nation \nthat exists for the exclusive purpose of interpreting the experiences \nof the players in the Negro Leagues.\n  I highly recommend a visit to the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum for \nanybody who is in Kansas City. Whether you are a baseball fan or not, \nyou will be moved by what you see there. You will be encouraged and \ninspired in every way by seeing how those players confronted the \ninjustices of their times, and with great spirit and energy and joy \neven overcame those obstacles.\n  In closing, I want to thank my friend and colleague from Illinois, \nSenator Durbin, for his assistance and his support of both the \nresolution which we introduced today in honor of those athletes who \nwere elected on Monday and also S. Con. Res. 60, which is the national \ndesignation resolution. I hope the Senate will swiftly pass our \nresolution to honor these future Hall of Famers--I guess they are Hall \nof Famers designees now--for their contributions on the field and for \ntheir courage, sacrifice and triumph in the face of segregation.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n            Injustice, and then a gutless committee clams up\n\n                           (By Joe Posnanski)\n\n       The living voice of the Negro Leagues did not even blink \n     when the door was slammed in his face one more time. Buck \n     O'Neil just nodded and smiled a little when he was told that \n     he did not get enough votes to be elected into the Baseball \n     Hall of Fame.\n       ``All right,'' he said. ``That's the way the cookie \n     crumbles.''\n       That's the way baseball crumbles. Monday, an 11-member \n     committee of academics and authors (a 12th member, author \n     Robert Peterson, died two weeks ago) gathered in a room in \n     Tampa and voted 17 deceased Negro Leagues players and \n     executives into the Hall of Fame. Seventeen. To give you an \n     idea of how overwhelming that number is . . . only 18 Negro \n     Leaguers are actually in the National Baseball Hall of Fame. \n     It took 30 years of work--most of that Buck O'Neil's hard \n     work--to get those 18 players inducted.\n       But even while doubling the Negro Leagues' Hall of Fame \n     population, the committee could not muster the necessary nine \n     votes for Buck O'Neil, who is 94 and has done more in his \n     life for Negro Leagues baseball than anyone else. One \n     committee member said O'Neil likely fell one vote short. The \n     balloting was secret.\n       When the voting was finished, no one had the guts to \n     explain why Buck O'Neil was kept out. He was an All-Star \n     player in the Negro Leagues. He was a successful manager for \n     the Kansas City Monarchs. He sent more Negro Leagues players \n     to the major leagues than anyone. He was the first black \n     coach in the major leagues. For the past 50 years, he has \n     been--as author Jules Tygiel calls him in Shades of Glory, \n     the Negro Leagues book commissioned by the Hall of Fame--\n     ``the primary spokesperson for the legacy of the Negro \n     Leagues.''\n       In fact, two sources said months ago that the Hall of Fame \n     would have a special Negro Leagues vote with the intention of \n     getting Buck O'Neil in. One hall official said, ``I don't \n     think the Hall of Fame is complete without him.''\n       Thus, for the first time ever, the hall handed over the \n     voting to a panel of baseball historians and scholars with no \n     affiliation to the major leagues or the hall. This was an \n     extraordinary move for the Hall of Fame. They usually protect \n     the hall the way tigers protect their cubs. There was not one \n     former player on the committee and not one person who \n     actually observed the Negro Leagues. The committee was given \n     no boundaries--they were told to vote for as many people as \n     they saw fit.\n       They certainly voted free. By dumping 17 persons into the \n     Hall of Fame, they matched the number of persons inducted \n     into the hall the past seven years. But when it came to why \n     Buck was left out, no one was talking.\n       ``I don't think the individuals are going to be willing to \n     discuss their individual votes,'' said Fay Vincent, who \n     served as a nonvoting chairman of the committee. ``We agreed \n     we would not do that.''\n       In other words, they decided to hide. After this travesty, \n     you could not blame them. On Monday, when it appeared that \n     O'Neil was short the votes he needed, Vincent apparently made \n     a frantic plea to the committee to consider O'Neil's lifetime \n     achievements and not just his playing days. According to the \n     committee member, he sounded almost desperate.\n       His words held no sway with this committee. They left him \n     out without a word of explanation. They did, however, vote in \n     Andy Cooper, who was (see if this sounds familiar) a fine \n     player and manager for the Kansas City Monarchs. He died in \n     1941. The book Shades of Glory is 422 pages long, including \n     acknowledgements. Cooper is mentioned exactly zero times.\n       The committee also voted in Effa Manley, the first woman \n     inductee into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Her credentials? She \n     co-owned the Newark Eagles with her husband, Abe, for 14 \n     seasons. The team won one championship. Also, she was \n     outspoken. Also, her biographer, Jim Overmyer, was on the \n     committee.\n       And so on. The injustice of Monday's vote left a trail of \n     disbelief and anger throughout the baseball community, but \n     especially in Kansas City. It had no visible effect on Buck \n     O'Neil, though. He began his Monday morning with a 5:30 a.m. \n     call from a radio show. He came to the Negro Leagues Baseball \n     Museum at 10 a.m. and by then he had received more than a \n     dozen congratulatory calls.\n       Everyone seemed sure he was going to get voted in.\n       Buck himself was not so sure. ``I've been on committees \n     like this,'' he said. ``I know that anything can happen.'' \n     Still, he spent much of Monday morning calling friends in his \n     hometown of Sarasota, Fla., telling them that he would visit \n     if the vote went his way. A camera crew filmed his every \n     move. A half-dozen reporters followed him around.\n       O'Neil had been told he would hear something by 11 a.m., \n     but the phone would not ring. Rumors swirled that things were \n     not going well in Tampa, but no one wanted to believe it. \n     While Buck O'Neil waited, Hall of Fame player Lou Brock--whom \n     O'Neil had scouted and signed--called and said he was \n     excited. Soon it was 11:30 and then noon, and the call from \n     the hall had not come.\n       ``You know something?'' Buck said all of a sudden. ``I \n     could play. I was no Josh Gibson. But I could play.'' It was \n     his only sign of cracking. One of the few criticisms of \n     O'Neil's Hall of Fame case leading into the vote had been \n     that, while he was a good player, he was not a Hall of Fame-\n     caliber player. The criticism did not take in account his \n     countless other contributions to baseball, but you could see \n     that Buck was hurting a little.\n       At 12:30, there was no word, and a pall had fallen over the \n     museum. Buck seemed to sense that the vote was going against \n     him. He said, ``I'll be fine either way.''\n       At 12:34, Bob Kendrick, the marketing director of the Negro \n     Leagues Museum, asked everyone to leave the room, and he \n     said, ``Buck, we didn't get enough votes.''\n       All his life, Buck O'Neil has had doors slammed in his \n     face. He played baseball at a time when the major leagues did \n     not allow black players. He was a gifted manager at a time \n     when major league owners would not even think of having an \n     African-American lead their teams. For more than 30 years, he \n     told stories about Negro Leagues players and nobody wanted to \n     listen.\n       Now, after everything, he was being told that the life he \n     had spent in baseball was not worthy of the Hall of Fame. It \n     was enough to make those around him cry. But Buck laughed. \n     ``I'm still Buck,'' he said. ``Look at me. I've lived a good \n     life. I'm still living a good life. Nothing has changed for \n     me.''\n       A few minutes later, when he was told that 17 persons had \n     made it, he shouted: ``Wonderful.''\n       That's Buck O'Neil. Who else would respond that way to such \n     a shameful vote? No one. I don't know what the July day will \n     be like when 17 persons long dead--10 of the 17 have been \n     gone for more than 50 years--get\n\n[[Page S1589]]\n\n     inducted into the Hall of Fame. It's hard to believe it will \n     be much of a celebration. Who will speak for the dead?\n       ``I don't know,'' Buck O'Neil said. ``I wonder if they'll \n     ask me to speak.''\n       Would he really speak at the Hall of Fame after he wasn't \n     voted in?\n       ``Of course,'' Buck said. ``If they asked me.''\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 386) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 386\n\n       Whereas African Americans began to play baseball in the \n     late 1800s on military teams, college teams, and company \n     teams, and eventually found their way onto professional teams \n     with White players;\n       Whereas the racism and ``Jim Crow'' laws that forced \n     African American players from their integrated teams by 1900 \n     compelled those dedicated players to form their own \n     ``barnstorming'' teams that traveled throughout the United \n     States and offered to play any team willing to challenge \n     them;\n       Whereas, in 1920, the Negro National League was created \n     under the guidance of Andrew ``Rube'' Foster, a former \n     player, manager, and owner of the Chicago American Giants, at \n     a meeting held at the Paseo YMCA in Kansas City, Missouri;\n       Whereas soon after the Negro National League was formed, \n     rival leagues were assembled in eastern and southern States, \n     bringing the thrills and innovative play of African American \n     ballplayers to major urban centers and rural countrysides \n     throughout the United States, Canada, and Latin America;\n       Whereas, from the 1920s to the 1960s, over 30 communities \n     located throughout the United States were home to teams in 1 \n     of the 6 Negro Leagues;\n       Whereas the Negro Leagues maintained a high level of \n     professional skill and became centerpieces for economic \n     development in their communities;\n       Whereas, in 1945, the Brooklyn Dodgers of Major League \n     Baseball recruited Jackie Robinson from the Kansas City \n     Monarchs, making Robinson the first African American in the \n     modern era to play on a Major League Baseball roster;\n       Whereas the integration of Major League Baseball, which \n     soon followed the signing of Jackie Robinson, prompted the \n     decline of the Negro Leagues because the Major Leagues began \n     to recruit and sign the best African American ballplayers;\n       Whereas it has been recognized by numerous baseball \n     authorities that many of the greatest players ever to play \n     the game of baseball played in the Negro Leagues, rather than \n     Major League Baseball;\n       Whereas, on February 27, 2006, the National Baseball Hall \n     of Fame announced that Ray Brown, Willard Brown, Andy Cooper, \n     Frank Grant, Pete Hill, Biz Mackey, Effa Manley, Joe Mendez, \n     Alex Pompez, Cum Posey, Louis Santop, Mule Suttles, Ben \n     Taylor, Cristobal Torriente, Sol White, J.L. Wilkinson, and \n     Jud Wilson had been elected to the National Baseball Hall of \n     Fame Class of 2006;\n       Whereas less than 1 percent of all professional baseball \n     players have been honored with induction into the National \n     Baseball Hall of Fame;\n       Whereas we congratulate Ray Brown, an ace starter for the \n     Homestead Grays who--\n       (1) ranks among the top Negro Leagues pitchers in total \n     wins and winning percentage; and\n       (2) pitched a perfect game in 1945 as well as a one-hitter \n     in the 1944 Negro World Series;\n       Whereas we congratulate Willard Brown, an outfielder with \n     the Kansas City Monarchs who--\n       (1) lead the Negro American League in home runs and batting \n     average during numerous seasons; and\n       (2) was considered by many to be the Negro American League \n     version of Josh Gibson;\n       Whereas we congratulate Andy Cooper, a pitcher with the \n     Detroit Stars and Kansas City Monarchs who--\n       (1) had a knack for changing the speed of his pitches;\n       (2) was the all-time leader in every Detroit Stars pitching \n     category;\n       (3) was among the top 10 leaders in career wins, \n     strikeouts, shutouts, and winning percentage in Negro Leagues \n     history; and\n       (4) later in his career became the manager of the Kansas \n     City Monarchs and lead them to 3 pennants;\n       Whereas we congratulate Frank Grant, a second baseman with \n     tremendous range and a strong arm who--\n       (1) hit over .300 in 4 seasons with White minor league \n     teams until the color lines forced him out of the league in \n     1886;\n       (2) played for top-rated African American teams until 1903; \n     and\n       (3) who displayed a unique blend of speed and power in the \n     International League that allowed him to turn 1 out of every \n     4 base hits into extra bases;\n       Whereas we congratulate Pete Hill, a premier outfielder \n     who--\n       (1) played brilliantly for the Cuban X-Giants, Philadelphia \n     Giants, Chicago Leland Giants, and the Chicago American \n     Giants before the formation of the Negro Leagues;\n       (2) during his 1911 season as an American Giant, hit safely \n     in 115 out of 116 games; and\n       (3) was rated the fourth best outfielder in the renowned \n     1952 Pittsburgh Courier player-voted poll of the best players \n     of the Negro Leagues;\n       Whereas we congratulate Biz Mackey, a strong-armed catcher \n     who--\n       (1) ended his career with a lifetime batting average well \n     over .300;\n       (2) ranked among the top Negro Leaguers in lifetime total \n     bases, RBIs, and slugging percentage; and\n       (3) later managed the Baltimore Elite Giants and the Newark \n     Eagles who, under his skill and leadership, won the Negro \n     World Series in 1946;\n       Whereas we congratulate Effa Manley, the co-owner of the \n     Newark Eagles, who--\n       (1) has become the first women elected to the National \n     Baseball Hall of Fame; and\n       (2) in addition to her efforts in baseball, played an \n     active role in the Civil Rights Movement by promoting such \n     causes as Anti-Lynching Day at Ruppert Stadium, which is the \n     home of the Eagles;\n       Whereas we congratulate Jose Mendez, a right-handed pitcher \n     who--\n       (1) earned a winning percentage of just under .700 during \n     his memorable career as a member of the Cuban Stars, All \n     Nations, and Kansas City Monarchs; and\n       (2) managed the Kansas City Monarchs to successive pennants \n     from 1923-1925, during which time he compiled a 20-4 pitching \n     record with 7 saves;\n       Whereas we congratulate Alex Pompez, a successful team \n     owner who--\n       (1) owned the Cuban Stars of the Eastern Colored League and \n     then the New York Cubans of the Negro National League; and\n       (2) signed the first Puerto Rican, Dominican, Venezuelan, \n     and Panamanian players of the circuit;\n       Whereas we congratulate ``Cum'' Posey, owner of the \n     Homestead Grays, who--\n       (1) won the Negro National League pennant 8 times between \n     1937 and 1945; and\n       (2) assembled teams that were home to 11 of the 18 Negro \n     Leaguers currently in the Hall of Fame;\n       Whereas we congratulate Louis Santop, a power-hitting \n     catcher who--\n       (1) played for several of the greatest African American \n     teams of the pre-Negro Leagues era, including the \n     Philadelphia Giants, New York Lincoln Giants, and the \n     Brooklyn Giants;\n       (2) hit over .320 while slugging tape-measure homeruns \n     during his tremendous career in the Negro Leagues; and\n       (3) was rated by Rollo Wilson as the first string catcher \n     on his all-time Black baseball team;\n       Whereas we congratulate Mule Suttles, a hard-hitting first \n     baseman and outfielder who--\n       (1) played spectacularly for the St. Louis Stars, Chicago \n     American Giants, Birmingham Black Barons, Newark Eagles, and \n     other Negro League teams; and\n       (2) was 1 of the most powerful home run hitters in the \n     Negro Leagues, ranking third all-time among Negro Leaguers in \n     home runs and RBI;\n       Whereas we congratulate Ben Taylor, a pitcher who--\n       (1) transitioned into a top-ranked first baseman and clean-\n     up hitter for the Indianapolis ABC's at the start of his \n     career;\n       (2) served as an extremely successful player-manager from \n     1923-1929; and\n       (3) exclusively managed the Washington Potomacs, the \n     Baltimore Black Sox, and the Atlantic City Bacharach Giants \n     until 1940;\n       Whereas we congratulate Cristobal Torriente, a 5-tool \n     outfielder who--\n       (1) played most of his games for the Cuban Stars and \n     Chicago American Giants;\n       (2) earned an incredible lifetime batting average of over \n     .330; and\n       (3) is 1 of the all-time offensive leaders in Negro Leagues \n     history, ranking in the top 20 all-time in home runs, RBIs, \n     and total bases;\n       Whereas we congratulate Sol White, a tremendously gifted \n     baseball player who--\n       (1) played all infield positions during his 25-year \n     baseball career;\n       (2) was a member of the best African American independent \n     teams of the pre-Negro Leagues era, including the \n     Philadelphia Giants, which he helped found in 1902 as playing \n     manager;\n       (3) hit .359 in the White minor leagues during 5 seasons \n     before the color line was established;

Wilkinson, an creative and \n     innovative team owner who--\n       (1) owned the Kansas City Monarchs, the All Nations club, \n     and 1 of the first professional women's teams in the United \n     States;\n       (2) was a pioneer of night baseball and various ballpark \n     promotions;\n       (3) was the only White owner of the Negro National League \n     when it was chartered in 1920; and\n       (4) ran the longest running franchise in Negro National \n     League history during which his teams won an unprecedented 17 \n     pennants and 2 World Series;\n       Whereas we congratulate Jud Wilson, an intense first and \n     third baseman who--\n       (1) ranks among the top 10 all-time in home runs, RBIs, \n     hits, total bases, slugging average, and batting average in \n     the Negro Leagues;\n       (2) holds a lifetime batting average over .340;\n\n[[Page S1590]]\n\n       (3) earned from fans the nickname Boojum, after the sound \n     that his line drives made when slamming off the fences; and\n       (4) played on pennant-winning teams as a member of the \n     Baltimore Black Sox, Philadelphia Stars, and Homestead Grays;\n       Whereas those baseball legends will be inducted into the \n     National Baseball Hall of Fame on July 30, 2006, in \n     Cooperstown, New York, joining former Negro Leagues players \n     Ernie Banks, Hank Aaron, Jackie Robinson, Larry Doby, Monte \n     Irvin, Roy Campanella, ``Satchel'' Paige, Willie Mays, Bill \n     Foster, ``Buck'' Leonard, ``Bullet'' Rogan, ``Cool Papa'' \n     Bell, Hilton Smith, ``Smokey'' Joe Williams, Josh Gibson, \n     ``Judy'' Johnson, Leon Day, Martin Dihigo, Oscar Charleston, \n     ``Pop'' Lloyd, Ray Dandridge, ``Rube'' Foster, ``Turkey'' \n     Stearnes, and Willie Wells, as members of the National \n     Baseball Hall of Fame; and\n       Whereas we congratulate the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum \n     in Kansas City, Missouri, the only public museum in the \n     Nation that exists for the exclusive purpose of interpreting \n     the experiences of the players in the Negro Leagues, founded \n     in 1990 by Negro Leagues legend Buck O'Neil, Horace Peterson, \n     former Kansas City Monarchs outfielder Al ``Slick'' Surratt, \n     and other former Negro Leagues players, for the tireless \n     efforts of the museum to preserve the evidence of honor, \n     courage, sacrifice, and triumph in the face of segregation of \n     those African Americans who played in the Negro Leagues \n     through its comprehensive collection of historical materials, \n     important artifacts, and oral histories of the participants \n     in the Negro Leagues and the impact that segregation had in \n     the lives of the players and their fans: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates Ray Brown, Willard Brown, Andy Cooper, \n     Frank Grant, Pete Hill, Biz Mackey, Effa Manley, Joe Mendez, \n     Alex Pompez, Cum Posey, Louis Santop, Mule Suttles, Ben \n     Taylor, Cristobal Torriente, Sol White, J.L.

I thank the leaders for the ability to achieve that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, pursuant to the unanimous consent request, \nI wish to speak to a resolution which was just passed, but prior to \nthat time, I would like to commend my colleague from the State of \nWisconsin for his dogged determination to have the Senate actually \nconsider an amendment--a substantive amendment--to the PATRIOT Act. He \nhas been more than cooperative in suggesting he would limit the time of \nthat debate to 15 minutes, but he has been stopped every time he has \ncome to the floor and made that request by the majority.\n  I may disagree with the Senator from Wisconsin, but I am going to \nstand here and fight for as long as I can that he have this \nopportunity. Why is the Senate afraid of debate? Why is the Senate \nafraid of deliberation? What is so frightening about having two \nSenators present a point of view and then have the Senate vote? It \nalmost sounds like the reason the Senate was created, but the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin has been waiting, trying his best to get 15 minutes, day \nafter day, as the majority refuses to give it to him.\n  As I have said repeatedly, I think there is merit to this PATRIOT \nAct, as amended with Senator Sununu's efforts and the efforts of many, \nincluding myself, but I am going to defend the right of the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin to come to the floor any time he wants, as a Senator \nrepresenting his State and as a coequal Member of this Chamber, and \noffer an amendment. The majority should not be so frightened of debate, \nnot so frightened of a vote that they would deny the Senator this \nopportunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/01/senate-section/article/S1590-4", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1590-S1592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nHONORING THE LEGENDARY STARS OF THE NEGRO LEAGUES AND PRE-NEGRO LEAGUES \n                                BASEBALL\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in the last few moments, we adopted a \nresolution which is historic in nature. It relates to the Negro Leagues \nand pre-Negro Leagues baseball in America. Anyone who loves baseball as \nI do and followed the great documentary prepared by Ken Burns on the \nhistory of baseball must have been struck by how much the history of \nbaseball is associated with the resolution of the issue of race in \nAmerica.\n  For too long, baseball, similar to much of America, was segregated. \nNow that it has become an integrated sport, we have seen some \ntremendous athletes--Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, White \nAmericans, those from other countries--coming together to make it a \nmore exciting sport than it has ever been.\n  I think we realize now what was lost for so many decades, while those \nwho labored in Black baseball, the Negro Leagues, were relegated to \nsecond-class status despite the fact their talents were as good or \nsometimes better than those who played on all White baseball teams.\n  Jerry Izenberg, a sports writer for the Newark Star Ledger, wrote of \nthe stars of Negro Leagues Baseball:\n\n       They took America's game and weaved a kind of magic with it \n     that most of America never bothered to see--not for lack of \n     talent and surely not because of the way they played it--with \n     a fire in the belly and joy in the skills that motivated \n     them.\n       America loved baseball, but segregation turned America \n     blind. The psyche of the White men who owned Major League \n     Baseball and most of those who played the game couldn't get \n     past the matter of skin color.\n\n  One of the greatest players ever, the legendary Satchel Paige, spent \nmost of his career in the Negro Leagues. In his Hall of Fame induction \nspeech in 1971 he said:\n\n       Oh, we had men by the hundreds who could have made the big \n     leagues, by the hundreds, not by the fours, twos or threes.\n\n  `` . . . Ain't no maybe so about it,'' Satchel Paige said.\n\n[[Page S1591]]\n\n  I did have the honor to meet him one day. He was in Springfield \nwatching a baseball game. I still remember it. He was seated next to \nMinnie Minoso, whom I will refer to a little later in these remarks.\n  Most of those players never got that chance. But now, 17 more players \nand 5 executives from the Negro Leagues and pre-Negro Leagues baseball \nare getting some long overdue recognition.\n  This week, a special commission appointed by Major League Baseball \nacted to heal another of segregation's scars by voting to induct the 17 \ninto the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n  I am pleased to join baseball fans around the world in congratulating \nthese new Hall of Famers:\n  Negro Leagues baseball players Ray Brown, Willard Brown, Andy Cooper, \nBiz Mackey, Mule Suttles, Cristobal Torriente, and Jud Wilson;\n  Pre-Negro Leagues players Frank Grant, Pete Hill, Jose Mendez, Louis \nSantop, and Ben Taylor;\n  Negro Leagues club owners Alex Pompez, Cum Posey, and J.L. Wilkinson;\n  And pre-Negro Leagues team owner and baseball writer Sol White.\n  Also among the new Hall of Famers is Effa Manley, co-owner with her \nhusband of the Newark Eagles and the first woman to join the Hall of \nFame. Effa Manly was White, but she married a Black man and chose to \npass herself off as Black. She was active in the civil rights movement \nand promoted Anti-Lynching Day at Eagles games in the 1940s.\n  Similar to many, I am surprised--I am really disappointed--that two \nnames were not on the list I just read. Of the 39 Negro Leagues and \npre-Negro Leagues stars considered for inclusion in the Hall of Fame \nthis week, only two are still living: Mini Minoso and Buck O'Neil. I \ncan't explain why neither one was selected.\n  No matter how the committee voted, Minnie Minoso and Buck O'Neil will \nalways be Hall of Famers to baseball fans in Chicago and around the \nworld. Let me tell you about them.\n  Saturnino Orestes Armas ``Minnie'' Minoso is one of the most popular \nplayers in Chicago White Sox history--a seven-time All-Star and three-\ntime Golden Glove winner.\n  He was nicknamed ``the Cuban comet,'' the first Black Latino in the \nmajor leagues starting in 1949 with the Cleveland Indians. Two years \nlater, he became the first White Sox to break the color line.\n  He hit a home run in his first at-bat with the White Sox and went on \nto be named American League Rookie of the Year in 1951, leading the \nleague in stolen bases and triples. Over his career, he led the league \nin being hit by pitches 10 different times--an indication, I am afraid, \nof how difficult it was to break the racial lines.\n  In the words of Orlando Cepeda, who once played for the St. Louis \nBaseball Cardinals:\n\n       Minnie Minoso is to Latin ballplayers what Jackie Robinson \n     is to Black ballplayers.\n\n  He paved the way for generations of Latin superstars, from Roberto \nClemente to Juan Marichal to Sammy Sosa.\n  In 1983, the White Sox retired Minnie Minoso's No. 9 uniform, and in \n2004, he was honored with a life-sized sculpture at U.S. Cellular \nField, home of the world champion Chicago White Sox. At the unveiling \nceremony, he said:\n\n       If God takes me tomorrow, I'm happy because my statue is \n     here. How many people in the Hall of Fame have statues in the \n     ball parks?\n\n  John ``Buck'' O'Neil should be a familiar name to those who remember \nthe Ken Burns documentary. Buck O'Neil was the Black baseball player \nthey went to time and time again to talk about life in the Negro \nLeagues. He was the unofficial ambassador for Negro Leagues baseball in \nthe Ken Burns documentaries.\n  He was a standout first baseman and successful manager for the Kansas \nCity Monarchs from 1937 to 1955. Years later, as a scout for the \nChicago Cubs, Buck O'Neil signed future Hall of Famers Ernie Banks and \nLou Brock to their first major league contracts.\n  Think about that. Buck O'Neil from the Negro Leagues signed Ernie \nBanks, Mr. Cub, to the Chicago Cubs. My message to the Tribune \npublishing company, which owns the Chicago Cubs, is: Can you think of a \nbetter batter to throw out a pitch for a game in Wrigley Field than \nBuck O'Neil, the only surviving baseball player from the Negro Leagues, \nand his man that he scouted for that team, Ernie Banks? It just doesn't \nget any better.\n\n  With the Cubs, Buck O'Neil also became the first African-American \ncoach in the Major Leagues. At age 94, he is the driving force in \npreserving Negro League history--94 years old. He is the cofounder and \nchairman of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City, which he \nand a handful of other Negro Leaguers started in a $200-a-month room in \n1990.\n  Buck O'Neil has probably done more than anyone to see that the \nstories of great Black ball players before Jackie Robinson are not \nforgotten. Without his tireless efforts, it is unlikely a special \ncommittee would have ever started to right the wrong of segregated \nbaseball. So it strikes many of us as ironic that Buck wasn't chosen to \nenter Cooperstown. He greeted the news with typical Buck O'Neil grace \nand optimism when he said:\n\n       Before I wouldn't even have had a chance but this time I \n     had that chance. . . . I was on the ballot, man.\n\n  Isn't that a great quote, from a man 94 years of age, who could have \nbeen given that moment in history to be the only surviving member of \nthe Negro Leagues to actually physically be there as he was admitted to \nthe Cooperstown Hall of Fame?\n  He added something. He said:\n\n       You think about this. Here I am, the grandson of a slave. \n     And here the whole world was excited about whether I was \n     going in the Hall of Fame or not. We've come a long, long \n     ways. Before, we never even thought about anything like that. \n     America, you've really grown, and you're still growing.\n\n  The story of Black baseball is amazing. During its golden years, \nNegro Leagues Baseball was the Nation's third-largest Black-owned \nbusiness.\n  The leagues included such storied franchises as the Chicago American \nGiants, the Kansas City Monarchs, the Homestead Grays, the Atlanta \nBlack Crackers, the Newark Eagles, and the New York Black Yankees.\n  Among its stars were the legendary Satchel Paige, Josh Gibson, called \n``the black Babe Ruth'', William ``Buck'' Leonard, the ``black Lou \nGehrig,'' the acrobatic William ``Judy'' Johnson, and James ``Cool \nPapa'' Bell. Cool Papa Bell was so fast, it was said that he could turn \noff the light and be in bed before the room got dark. Even Jesse Owens \ndeclined to race against him.\n  The roots of black baseball stretch back to 1867. That year--2 years \nafter the Civil War ended--the National Baseball Players Association \nwas created. The new league banned any team that included even one \nBlack player.\n  In 1887, the first Black baseball team, the Cuban Giants, was formed \nto give talented black players in New York a chance to play ball. Their \nsuccess inspired other Black teams to form.\n  Many of the teams were hugely popular. One Sunday in 1911, the \nChicago Cubs drew 6,000 paying fans, the White Sox had 9,000 fans, \nwhile the black team, the Chicago American Giants, drew 11,000 fans.\n  In 1920, the owner of the Chicago American Giants, Rube Foster, and \nother team owners met in Kansas City to form the Negro National League.\n  Foster hoped that the victor in the Negro championship would one day \nplay the major league winner and that the color line in baseball would \neventually be erased entirely.\n  That dream was crushed in 1919, with the appointment of Major League \nBaseball's first commissioner, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, who forbade \nWhite ball clubs from playing against Black clubs, even in exhibition \ngames.\n  Negro Leagues players were paid little. They suffered long bus rides, \nexhausting schedules, and second-and third-rate motels. Other times, \nthey relied or Black churches and fans' homes for a place to sleep. \nThey played year round. When it got cold in the states, they headed \nsouth to play in Cuba or the Dominican Republic.\n  The color line was nearly broken in 1943 when Chicago Cubs owner Bill \nVeeck planned to buy the Philadelphia Phillies and hire Satchel Paige, \nJosh Gibson and other Negro League stars, but Landis learned of the \nplan first and sold the team to someone else.\n  The following year, Landis died. The new commissioner, former \nKentucky Governor Happy Chandler, famously declared: ``I'm for the Four \nFreedoms.\n\n[[Page S1592]]\n\nIf a Black . . . can make it on Okinawa and Guadalcanal . . . he can \nmake it in baseball.'' But the Major League owners disagreed and voted \nagainst integration 15-to-1.\n  In 1945, Brooklyn Dodgers owner Branche Rickey signed a shortstop \nfrom the Kansas City Monarchs to play for the Dodgers' farm club. As a \nlieutenant in the Army, Jack Roosevelt Robinson risked a court-martial \nby refusing to sit in the back of a military bus. In 1947, he was \ncalled up to play for the Dodgers. Baseball's color line was finally \nerased.\n  Soon after, the Negro Leagues began to falter financially as they \nlost more and more of their best players to the majors. The league \nfolded in 1960.\n  Before the vote this week, only 18 of the Negro League's more than \n2,600 players had been voted into the Hall of Fame.\n  Among those pushing for recognition of other deserving Negro Leaguers \nwas former Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent. Vincent's interest in \nNegro Leagues ball was heightened after he met Alfred ``Slick'' \nSurratt, a Negro Leaguer who served in World War II and was wounded at \nthe Battle of Guadalcanal, and then barred from playing Major League \nbaseball when he returned home.\n  In 1991, at the urging of former St. Louis Cardinals catcher and \nbaseball broadcaster Joe Garagiola, Vincent arranged a trip to \nCooperstown for 75 Negro League players. At a formal dinner, he \napologized to the players for the way baseball had snubbed them. He \nlater told a reporter from USA Today: ``I really thought I was \nrepeating an old line, but it turned out that it was the first time \nthat someone--from Major League Baseball--had done that.'' When he \nhanded out a commemorative medallion of the event, he said, ``about a \nthird of [the players] were crying.''\n  In 2000, Major League Baseball commissioned a $250,000 study of \nAfrican- American players from 1860 to 1960. The result is the most \nthorough statistical record of the Negro Leagues ever compiled. It \nincludes statistics culled from Black-owned newspapers as well as stats \nfrom games that matched barnstorming White players--including Babe Ruth \nand Dizzy Dean--against Negro Leaguers.\n  The league then appointed a special commission of 12 historians and \nscholars to sift through the record and select players who should be \nconsidered for the Hall of Fame. The first list included 39 names. From \nthose 39 players, the committee this week selected the 17 new Hall of \nFamers.\n  It wasn't just on the field that Negro Leagues Baseball differed from \nWhite baseball. At Major League games Black and White fans were \nseparated by chicken-wire fences--``one of the powerful symbols of \nracism,'' in Buck O'Neil's words. But during Negro League games, Blacks \nand Whites sat side by side.\n  In July, when the Hall of Fame's class of 2006 is formally inducted, \nmore of the legends of Black baseball will finally take their rightful \nplace at Cooperstown, to be honored side by side with the rest of the \nbest who ever played America's game. As Buck O'Neil said, ``America is \ngrowing.''\n  We congratulate the families of all of the new Hall of Famers, and we \nremain hopeful that Buck O'Neil and Minnie Minoso will soon join them \nin Cooperstown.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/01/senate-section/article/S1592-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
