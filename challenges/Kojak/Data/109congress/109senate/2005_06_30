Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 1307, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1307) to implement the Dominican Republic-\n     Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there are 16 \nhours for debate equally divided. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                                schedule\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this morning we will resume consideration \nof the pending CAFTA legislation. Last night we began debate under the \n20-hour time limitation. We now have 16 hours remaining and we do not \nexpect to use the entire debate time allocated. Chairman Grassley has \nindicated that he would not require all of the 8 hours remaining under \nhis control. Thus, I hope we would be able to yield back some time, \nwhich would allow us to vote on this bill at a reasonable time today.\n  As mentioned yesterday on a number of occasions, we have two \nadditional appropriations measures to complete this week, one of which \nis the Legislative Branch appropriations bill. It is ready for floor \nconsideration. That bill will require only a short debate and could be \nfinished without a rollcall vote.\n  Also, we expect to consider and complete the Energy and Water \nappropriations bill. It is possible we could finish both of those late \ntonight. It depends on how much debate time is used on the CAFTA bill \nand also how much time Energy and Water will require.\n  We have a number of other items to be completed before our recess, \nincluding the highway extension, as well as some nominations. It will \ntake a lot of cooperation and a lot of hard work to be able to complete \nall of this. Again, there is a possibility we could finish late tonight \nbut, if not, we are going to complete all this business, including the \ntwo appropriations bills, by Friday, and we could have votes into \nFriday as well.\n  We have our jobs and our tasks laid out for us. We need to stay here \nuntil we complete them before we leave for our recess.\n\n\n                 Central American Free Trade Agreement\n\n  Mr. President, I want to comment on the CAFTA legislation which we \nturned to last night, the Central American Free Trade Agreement. We \nwill vote on final passage of that agreement later today. CAFTA is a \ngood bill. It is a fair bill and an evenhanded bill that Members from \nboth sides of the aisle should be able to support in that this \nlegislation expands the market for America's goods and thereby grows \njobs here at home.\n  The agreement which President Bush signed in May of 2004 promises to \neliminate trade barriers between the United States, Costa Rica, El \nSalvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic. \nBy doing so, it will level the playing field and by leveling the \nplaying field will stimulate economic growth which, in turn, will \nstimulate job creation. America's market is already open. Nearly 80 \npercent of exports from the CAFTA region to the United States come into \nAmerica duty free. Those barriers are already down.\n\n[[Page S7648]]\n\n  Under CAFTA, the six CAFTA countries would reciprocate and \nimmediately allow 80 percent of our exports to enter their countries \nduty free, lowering that barrier. As a result, CAFTA will create our \nsecond largest export market in Latin America, behind only Mexico. From \nWashington State apples all the way across the country to Florida \noranges, America's producers will thrive.\n  This represents a tremendous opportunity both for sellers and buyers \nand for all the people who make transactions happen--again, economic \ngrowth, creation of jobs.\n  If I look back--and become a little bit provincial--to my home State \nof Tennessee, we are the third largest agricultural exporter to the \nCAFTA countries. Last year Tennessee businesses sold $271 million worth \nof goods and services to the CAFTA region. Tennessee farmers and \nfactory workers rely on exports for their jobs and their livelihoods. \nOne plant, the Levi Straus plant in Powell, TN, for example, exported \n$34.8 million in apparel last year to these countries. The Memphis-\nbased company, Drexel Chemical, has been exporting to Guatemala for the \nlast 30 years, since the early 1970s. Its chairman tells the Memphis \nCommercial Appeal newspaper that CAFTA would have a tremendous impact \non her business.\n  She has good cause to be optimistic. Since America signed NAFTA, the \nNorth American Free Trade Agreement, in 1993, Tennessee's combined \nexports to Canada and Mexico have grown a whopping 190 percent.\n  Free trade grows America's businesses and puts more money in the \npockets of America's families. It is estimated that NAFTA and the \nUruguay Round generate $1,300 to $2,000 a year for the average American \nfamily of four.\n  CAFTA will open the doors to 44 million new consumers of American \ngoods. More sales to Central America means more jobs right here at \nhome. Strengthening our mutual economic interest also will strengthen \nour national security. Twenty years ago, only two of the CAFTA nations, \nCosta Rica and the United States, were established democracies. Today, \nall seven can be counted among the free nations of the world.\n  Unfortunately, however, the forces of totalitarianism and oppression \nstill hover on the edges of these young democracies. Fidel Castro still \noppresses the Cuban people and denies them precious human freedoms. \nHugo Chavez moves Venezuela closer and closer to Castro every day. \nThese regimes tend to work to spread their brutal methods and \ntotalitarian philosophies, trying to infect the rest of Latin America \nand we simply cannot let them succeed.\n  The free nations of Latin America need our support. They deserve our \nsupport. That support can be reflected through CAFTA. By linking their \neconomies with democratic capitalism, CAFTA will help gird these \nnations against the threats at their door. It will strengthen their \ndemocracies and provide a model for freedom, a model for freedom \nseekers--indeed, freedom seekers around the world.\n  The Washington Post agrees that:\n\n       CAFTA and similar alliances provide hard evidence of \n     America's lasting commit to strengthening alliances, fighting \n     global poverty, and creating the building blocks of \n     democracy.\n\n  In 1823, James Monroe warned that continued European efforts to \ncolonize the New World would endanger American peace and safety. He \nunderstood that advancing liberty throughout the world required that we \nbegin in our own backyard.\n  Since then, the United States has worked to protect the freedom and \nindependence of our hemisphere. I urge my colleagues to support growth \nand prosperity. The United States has always stood for freedom and \nliberty around the world. Under CAFTA we will help keep the Americas \nmoving forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order the time on the \nDemocratic side shall be divided with 5 hours under the control of the \nSenator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, and 3 hours under the control of \nthe Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Does the other side \nof the aisle control any time?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It was previously announced that there is \n16 hours for debate equally divided. The majority side is under the \ncontrol of Senator Grassley.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. How much time does he have?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. He has 7 hours 54 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask the time be equally divided between both sides.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last night we started debate on the \nCentral American Free Trade Agreement. Last night, in addition to the \neconomic factors involved in the approving of this bill, I spoke about \nthe national security importance of this Central American Free Trade \nAgreement. I also talked--as, obviously, we do on most trade \nlegislation--about the benefits of the agreement to the U.S. economy in \ngeneral. This morning, I will focus on the benefits of this agreement \nfor U.S. agriculture.\n  As a Senator from Iowa and as a person who lives on and has an \ninterest in a family farm my son operates, I have major interest in the \nU.S. agricultural policies that benefit American farmers. Moreover, as \nchairman of the Finance Committee, I pay particularly close attention \nto trade issues as they affect agriculture.\n  I consulted frequently with the U.S. Trade Representative during \nnegotiations on this agreement, the Central American Free Trade \nAgreement. I do that because that is the responsibility my committee \nhas under trade promotion authority, which is a process by which \nCongress delegates the process of our carrying out our constitutional \nresponsibility of control over international trade to the President to \nnegotiate because it is quite impractical for 535 Members of Congress \nto negotiate with foreign countries.\n  U.S. negotiators went to great lengths to see that the Central \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement would be a good agreement for American \nfarmers. Their efforts were successful. The negotiations resulted in an \nagreement that is particularly strong for U.S. agriculture and the \nagribusiness community that affects so many nonfarm jobs throughout the \nUnited States.\n  I am fully convinced that implementation of this Central American \nFree Trade Agreement by the United States is in the best interests of \nU.S. agricultural producers. That is why I go to great lengths urging \nmy colleagues to support it.\n  U.S. farmers and ranchers are well aware of the fact that the \ninternational playing field for agricultural exports is presently far \nfrom level. Average tariffs of other countries on imports of U.S. \nagricultural products in the case of most commodities is significantly \nhigher than those imposed by the United States. That worldwide average \nwould be 60-some percent of tariffs of U.S. agricultural products going \ninto another country, whereas those same countries throughout the world \nbringing products into the United States face an average of only an 11-\npercent tariff.\n  It is common sense to negotiate other countries' tariffs against our \nagricultural products down some or a lot and hopefully down to a point \nwhere we are in a win-win situation for American agriculture and the \nnonfarm jobs involved in the processing and handling of agricultural \nproducts. That is our long-term goal. In fact, that is the goal we have \nright now in the Doha round World Trade Organization negotiations going \non this year. That is for the entire 150 countries that are members of \nthe World Trade Organization. We hope that Doha round is a major \nbreakthrough for the reduction of high worldwide tariffs against \nagricultural products.\n  Now, as this unequal situation I just described has clearly \ndemonstrated, and specifically in this trade relationship we have \nbetween the United\n\n[[Page S7649]]\n\nStates and these five countries of Central America, over 99 percent of \nagricultural products from Central American countries coming to the \nUnited States currently come in here not with an 11-percent average \ntariff I talked about worldwide, they come in with hardly any duty--\nexcept for an occasional product--and are duty free right now. That is \nunfair to American farmers.\n\n  When we send products down there, the average bound tariff of these \nfive Central American countries is over 44 percent. The current trading \nrelationship between the United States and the CAFTA countries is not \nonly an unlevel playing field but also a one-way street. CAFTA farm \nproducts do not pay tolls to enter the U.S. market today. Yet U.S. \nagricultural products are charged hefty tolls to enter the markets of \nthese five countries. This is all going to be changed by the Central \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement. A downhill one-way street will become a \nlevel two-lane road.\n  Under the agreement, the CAFTA countries will eliminate tariffs on \nvirtually all products. U.S. tariffs will remain largely unchanged. \nAfter all, the vast majority of agricultural products of the CAFTA \ncountries already enters the United States duty free. For example, the \ntreatment under the agreement of the four major U.S. commodities--pork, \nbeef, corn, and soybeans--demonstrates how the Central American Free \nTrade Agreement will remove disadvantages faced by U.S. agricultural \nproducers. These commodities are of importance not only to my State of \nIowa but to most agricultural States in our country.\n  The Central American Free Trade Agreement countries currently apply \ntariffs of up to 47 percent on imports of U.S. pork. Their bound rates \nreach as high as 60 percent. Under the agreement, these tariffs of the \nCentral American countries will be reduced to zero.\n  With beef, they apply tariffs of up to 30 percent on imports of U.S. \nbeef. Their bound rates reach as high as 79 percent. Under CAFTA, these \ntariffs of the Central American countries will be reduced for our U.S. \nfarmers to zero.\n  The CAFTA countries currently apply tariffs of up to 45 percent on \nimports of U.S. corn. Their bound rates reach as high as 75 percent. \nUnder the agreement, tariffs of CAFTA countries on corn, the \npredominant product we export, will be reduced to zero, with the \nexception of the Dominican Republic, in which case duty-free access \nwill be locked in.\n  Soybeans is another example. CAFTA countries currently apply tariffs \nup to 5 percent on imports of our soybeans and up to 20 percent on U.S. \nsoybean oil. Their bound rates reach as high as 91 percent for \nsoybeans, 60 percent for bean meal, and 232 percent for the soybean \noil. Under the agreement, tariffs of the CAFTA countries on U.S. \nsoybeans, bean meal, and soybean oil will be reduced to zero.\n  The leveling of the playing field with regard to CAFTA countries will \nresult in real gains for U.S. agriculture. According to the Farm Bureau \nFederation, CAFTA would increase U.S. agricultural exports to those \ncountries by $1.5 billion at the end of the full implementation. CAFTA \nwill result in dollars in the pockets of U.S. farmers and ranchers.\n  Recognizing that CAFTA will profit their members, numerous \nagriculture and food organizations have expressed their support for \nthis agreement. I have a letter from 73 such groups that back the \nagreement. These organizations represent diverse commodities produced \nin the area regions including among the 73 the Farm Bureau Federation, \nSoybean Association, Chicken Council, Corn Growers, Milk Producers, \nPork Producers, Potato Council, Turkey Federation, Rice Federation.\n  Moreover, six former U.S. Secretaries of Agriculture, both Republican \nand Democrat, have announced their support for the Central American \nFree Trade Agreement. Let me read those: Ann Veneman, Republican; Dan \nGlickman, a Democrat; Mike Espy, Democrat; Clayton Yeutter, Republican; \nJohn Block, Republican; Bob Bergland, Democrat. They all noted in a \nrecent letter to Congress that they back CAFTA ``because the benefits \nare very significant and the costs are minimal.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Letter From Former Secretaries of Agriculture to Members of the U.S. \n              House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate\n\n       Dear Member of Congress: As former secretaries of \n     agriculture, we understand the importance of negotiating \n     trade deals that minimize the costs and maximize the benefits \n     to U.S. farmers, ranchers, and food and agriculture \n     organizations. We support the Free Trade Agreement with \n     Central America and the Dominican Republic (CAFTA-DR) because \n     the benefits are very significant and the costs are minimal. \n     We urge you to pass CAFTA-DR quickly and without amendment.\n       A vote for CAFTA-DR is a vote for fairness and for \n     reciprocal market access. Under CAFTA-DR all of our food and \n     farm products will receive duty free treatment when the \n     agreement is fully implemented.\n       A vote against CAFTA-DR is a vote for one-way trade. \n     Virtually all of what we import from the six CAFTA countries \n     now enters the U.S. duty free as a result of the Generalized \n     System of Preferences (GSP) and the Caribbean Basin \n     Initiative (CBI). Yet, our food and agricultural exports to \n     these six nations are restricted significantly because of \n     high tariffs. As a result of the current one-way trade deal, \n     we are running an agricultural trade deficit with these six \n     countries.\n       In addition, a formal trade agreement with the United \n     States will help ensure the economic stability and growth \n     that the region needs to avoid a return to the civil wars, \n     insurgencies, and dictatorships of the recent past. As \n     economic freedom and democracy take deeper root, incomes will \n     increase and demand for our food and agriculture products \n     will expand.\n       Failure to approve CAFTA-DR will have a devastating effect \n     on U.S. efforts to negotiate trade agreements on behalf of \n     U.S. agriculture. The World Trade Organization Doha \n     Development Round would be dealt a serious blow. Other \n     countries would be less willing to negotiate with the United \n     States knowing that CAFTA-DR, a trade agreement so clearly \n     beneficial to U.S. interests, could be rejected by the U.S. \n     Congress.\n       The future of American agriculture continues to lay in \n     expanding opportunities for our exports in the global \n     marketplace, where 96 percent of the world's population \n     lives. We must not forego these opportunities, especially \n     when the benefits to our nation are so unmistakable.\n     Ann M. Veneman.\n     Dan Glickman.\n     Mike Espy.\n     Clayton Yeutter.\n     John Block.\n     Bob Bergland.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Most sectors of U.S. agriculture support the CAFTA. I \nrealize one--sugar--is a commodity we did not have their support. I \nrespect the sugar industry. They are very important. Outside of that \ngroup, we have agriculture represented behind this group.\n  An economic study by the American Farm Bureau Federation confirms \nthat CAFTA will not harm the U.S. sugar program or other agricultural \ncommodities.\n  While CAFTA is important in itself for U.S. agriculture, the \nimplementation of this agreement would boost U.S. efforts to liberalize \nagricultural trade around the world. The implementation of CAFTA would \ngive further momentum toward the completion of agricultural \nnegotiations in the Doha Round of the World Trade Organization, \nnegotiations in which the United States is seeking to cut tariffs, \nharmonize levels of domestic support, and eliminate export subsidies.\n  Mr. President, CAFTA is a straightforward win for the bulk of U.S. \nagricultural producers. A current one-way trading relationship will \nend. The CAFTA countries will dismantle their tariffs to U.S. \nagricultural products while the United States will provide little \nadditional access for CAFTA commodities. This will result in increased \nsales for U.S. agricultural exporters, sales of up to $1.5 billion a \nyear by the end of the agreement's full implementation. Not \nsurprisingly, CAFTA is widely supported in the U.S. agricultural \ncommunity.\n  The CAFTA is good agricultural policy and good trade policy. I urge \nmy colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator whatever time he needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of S. 1307, the \nCAFTA Implementation Act, because it advances America's economic and \nsecurity interests. As someone who spent over 20 years in business \nbefore entering public service, I continue to be amazed by those in \nWashington who support outdated policies that make it\n\n[[Page S7650]]\n\nharder and harder for American businesses to compete. Excessive \ntaxation, regulation and litigation are driving American employers out \nof their minds and American jobs overseas. Yet too many politicians \ncontinue to support higher taxes, junk lawsuits, and trade barriers \nthat effectively put signs on our beaches that say: Go do business \nsomewhere else.\n  If we are going to have the best jobs in the world, we must make \nAmerica the best place in the world to do business. This starts by \nreforming our complicated Tax Code, reducing mindless Government \nregulations, and eliminating frivolous lawsuits that, together, add \nmountains of needless costs on our businesses. Creating a pro-business \nenvironment in the United States also means we must open international \nmarkets to American exports so our workers can compete on a level \nplaying field. CAFTA, for example, would expand the market for U.S. \ngoods with 44 million consumers in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, \nHonduras, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic.\n  Nearly 80 percent of goods from the six CAFTA countries currently \nenter the United States duty-free. Yet American exports are taxed \nvirtually across the board when they enter CAFTA markets.\n  On U.S. motor vehicles and parts, CAFTA countries levy an average \ntariff of 11 percent, while the U.S. rate is zero. On vegetables, \nfruits, and nuts, the CAFTA region's average is 16.7 percent, again \ncompared with zero in the United States. On grains, it is 10.6 percent \nto zero; and on meat products, it is 14.7 percent, while the U.S. rate \nis just 3 percent. CAFTA would eliminate these disparities.\n  The agreement would level the playing field by eliminating 80 percent \nof the tariffs on American exports immediately, with the remaining \ntariffs phased out over 10 years. This would help exporters in my home \nState of South Carolina like BMW, Caterpillar and General Electric, as \nwell as farmers and ranchers raising soybeans, peaches, pork, and \npoultry. The American Farm Bureau Federation estimates CAFTA could \nexpand U.S. farm exports by $1.5 billion a year. Manufacturers would \nalso benefit, especially in sectors like information technology \nproducts, agricultural and construction equipment, paper products, \npharmaceuticals, and medical and scientific equipment.\n  According to a recent economic impact study conducted by the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, in the first year alone CAFTA would increase \noutput in South Carolina by $167 million and create over 900 new jobs. \nIn 9 years, the study shows a potential increase in output across all \nindustries of $701 million and the creation of over 6,000 jobs. The \nSouth Carolina State Ports Authority has told me CAFTA will contribute \nto greater economic development in South Carolina by stimulating \ncommerce and the shipment of freight through the Port of Charleston. In \n2004, Central America represented $359 million of the total value of \nthe Port's business. In fact, Charleston's exports to Central America \nhave grown faster than the average export growth. Most exporters agree: \nCAFTA is a great deal for South Carolina business.\n\n  Yet there is a small group in the textile industry whose opposition \nposes a threat to this step forward. They say CAFTA will allow China to \nexploit a ``loophole'' in the agreement. But they fail to recognize \nthat without CAFTA there will be no loop at all--just one giant hole \nthat China will use to destroy our industry. The truth is that a vote \nagainst CAFTA is a vote for China. Garment factories in Central America \npurchase large amounts of American fabric and yarn. In fact, the region \nis the second-largest world market for U.S. textile fabrics and yarns. \nUnder CAFTA, these garments made in the region will be duty-free and \nquota-free only if they use U.S. fabric and yarn. In fact, more than 90 \npercent of all apparel made in the region will be sewn from fabric and \nyarn made in the United States, thereby supporting U.S. textile exports \nand U.S. textile jobs. This is especially important for South Carolina \nworkers. In 2004, South Carolina's exports of fabric mill products to \nthe CAFTA region were valued at $180 million, more than half of the \nState's total exports to the region.\n  If we going to continue to have these exports and not lose the \nbusiness to Asia, we must pass CAFTA. The American Apparel and Footwear \nAssociation made this point in a recent letter to President Bush where \nit said, if CAFTA ``is not enacted soon, U.S. apparel and footwear \ncompanies will place more of their business outside this hemisphere.'' \nAnd the National Council of Textile Organizations recently endorsed \nCAFTA, saying, Central America ``is a very important part of the \ndomestic industry's supply chain and we need (CAFTA) to ensure that the \nU.S. textile industry can remain competitive against China.''\n  The elimination of quotas on Chinese textiles has eroded the \npartnership the U.S. has with the Central American region. Our existing \npartnership is also weakened by burdensome documentation requirements \nand by the fact that it will expire soon. All of these factors reduce \nthe incentive to make cloth\ning in the region using U.S. inputs. CAFTA, however, will solidify and \nstabilize this partnership by making the current program broader, \neasier to use, more flexible, permanent, and reciprocal. The agreement \nwill create new sales opportunities for U.S. textile and apparel \nproducts by providing permanent incentives for the use of U.S. yarns \nand fabrics in textile articles made in the region. And it will also \ngive us new advantages over our competitors by promoting duty-free \naccess for U.S. textile and apparel exports to local markets in the \nregion.\n  I also thank the President and his administration for their efforts \nto make the agreement even stronger. Specifically, I have worked \nclosely with U.S. Trade Ambassador Rob Portman to strengthen provisions \ndealing with textile pocketing. On May 9 of this year, Ambassador \nPortman wrote me about his desire to use the agreement's amendment \nmechanism to include pocketing in the rule of origin. He wrote:\n\n       I assure you that USTR will utilize this mechanism, working \n     closely with our textile industry, to seek an amendment to \n     the CAFTA so that pocketing would have to originate in one of \n     the signatory Parties.\n\nThis is very important to textile manufacturers in South Carolina who \nmake pockets and want to have a strong partnership with the CAFTA \nregion.\n  It is time to stop saying ``no'' to every trade agreement, regardless \nof the benefits. We must stop acting like we are operating in the \nbusiness environment of 50 years ago. We must stand up and fight for a \nbetter deal today. We can't build a wall around our country and expect \nto remain competitive. And we can't keep sticking our heads in the \nsand. Instead, we must fight back with new agreements that knock down \nbarriers and create new markets. We must fight back and win because \nthat is what Americans do. We have the best workers in the world and we \ncan compete with anyone in the world.\n  CAFTA also provides a unique opportunity to promote democracy, \nsecurity, and prosperity in a part of the world that was once \ncharacterized by oppression and military dictatorship. This agreement \nis critical to the economic and political stability of these young \ndemocracies, and it is a signal of our Nation's commitment to democracy \nand prosperity in this hemisphere. As we continue to fight the war on \nterrorism, America has a vested interest in making sure these countries \ndo not turn their backs on freedom.\n  I had the opportunity to personally meet with the Presidents from the \nCAFTA countries earlier this year, and many of them are taking \nsignificant political risks to promote economic freedom. We need to \nstand with them. We must stand with them and pass this agreement. The \nbenefits of CAFTA are clear. The agreement will strengthen our economic \nties with our democratic neighbors, it will promote opportunity and \nprosperity in the United States and the region, and it will strengthen \nour security at home by promoting democracy and prosperity in our \nhemisphere. This agreement is a forward strategy for freedom, and I \nencourage my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, again, I thank you for this time this morning. I do \nstand to speak on behalf of CAFTA, and I appreciate the Senator on the \nother side of the aisle yielding this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I use.\n\n[[Page S7651]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if ever there was a triumph of hope over \nexperience, it is bringing this bill to the floor of this Senate: a new \ntrade agreement with the background of failed trade agreement after \nfailed trade agreement, lost jobs after lost jobs, higher deficits \nevery year, believing this new chapter of the same failed book of trade \nstrategy will produce a different result. It is unbelievable to me.\n  But before I begin, let me ask a question. There is a substantial \nlack of opportunity to ask questions on the floor because very few will \nattend this debate. But I was wondering whether in this trade agreement \nthere is anything that has to do with exotic dancers or strip clubs. I \nwonder if anyone could respond to that.\n  Let me tell you the reason I ask the question----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator should be aware that Senators are \nnot permitted to ask other Senators questions unless they have been \nyielded time on the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me say to the Presiding Officer, it is a fair point. \nI have not directed questions to other Members of the Senate. I ask a \nrhetorical question, and perhaps the Presiding Officer, in his capacity \nas a Senator from New Hampshire, would respond. But I ask the question, \nis there anything in this trade agreement that deals with exotic \ndancers or strip clubs? And if any of my colleagues would like to come \nto the floor to respond to that today, I would be glad to hear it.\n  Let me tell you why I ask the question. We debated something called \nNAFTA on the floor of the Senate some years ago. It did not turn out \nvery well--huge trade deficits, American jobs rushing off to Mexico. It \ndid not turn out well at all. But now I discovered, going to the \ncomputer last night, using a Google search, that NAFTA had something in \nit about ``special skills.'' Let me read this to you. This is from my \nGoogle search last evening on the computer: ``Claiming a shortage of \nhomegrown talent, strip clubs in Canada have used NAFTA to find new \nrecruits in Mexico.''\n  I thought, well, that is interesting. NAFTA had something that allows \nstrip clubs in Canada to search for dancers from Mexico? Well, I found \nout what that was with a little further Google search: Employment \nauthorizations based on NAFTA agreements were available for \nprofessionals, company transferees, traders, investors, and people with \nspecial knowledge: exotic dancers, et cetera--apparently, under this \n``special skills'' category. Quite remarkable, isn't it?\n  Did anybody know that existed in NAFTA before it was voted on? Does \nanybody want to claim credit, I ask rhetorically? Does anybody want to \nclaim credit for a provision in NAFTA that allows Canadian strip clubs \nto recruit exotic dancers from Mexico? Oh, probably not. Probably no \none wants to claim credit for that today. But, apparently, that \nopportunity existed in NAFTA. It sure did.\n  Is there anything in this trade agreement we ought to know about? Is \nthere anything in this trade agreement that will probably persuade me \nto come to the floor of the Senate 5 years from now, 2 years from now, \nand say: Did you know about this? We probably will not learn that \ntoday, either. Let me tell you what we should learn today. Here, as \nshown on this chart, are our trade deficits. These are our trade \ndeficits--year after year after year. I have always wondered what \n``reeducation'' means as a term--``reeducation.'' It is quite clear to \nme there is no reeducation anywhere near this 50 or 60 square miles of \nground because we are about, today, in the Senate to pass another trade \nagreement which is exactly the same kind of trade agreement that has \ncaused a massive trade deficit year after year after year, a gathering \ntrade debt that is dangerous to this country.\n\n  On these red lines on this chart there are no names. But I can give \nyou some names. And I will today. These are the people who lost their \njobs, the people who came home one night after work and said: ``Honey, \nI have been fired. I worked at my plant for 19 years. I was a good \nworker. I loved my job. But I got fired today. Do you know why? Oh, \nthey are going to still make the products I made, but they are going to \nmake them in China. They shipped my job to China because they found \nsomebody who can do it for 30 cents an hour.''\n  Every one of these lines has tens of thousands--hundreds of \nthousands--of names of American workers who have lost their jobs.\n  And so in the first 4 months of this year, our trade debt is up \nanother 20 percent. Last year it was a record. It is up another 20, 22 \npercent. We are headed in exactly the wrong direction.\n  What is the response of this Congress? What is the response of the \nPresident? Well, let's do some more of what we have been doing. This is \nthe law of holes: Create a hole and just keep digging, according to \nthese people.\n  Let me make a couple of other opening observations. This bill should \nnot be on the floor of the Senate. It does not comport with the \nConstitution of the United States. I think everyone in this Chamber \nknows that. This is a tariff bill. My colleague from Iowa described in \ngreat detail the tariff provisions in the bill. This is a tariff bill. \nA tariff bill, by the U.S. Constitution, cannot originate here. It \ncannot. It must originate in the House of Representatives.\n  This bill is improperly on the floor of the Senate and I may today \nmake a constitutional point of order. Every Senator knows it is not \nhere in accordance with the Constitution, and yet we all put on our \ndark suits and come to the Chamber and vent for hours, acting as if \nnothing has changed, nothing is wrong, we have not read the \nConstitution. Tariff bills must originate in the House, not in the \nSenate.\n  So we will pass this today, I am told. I am told the votes exist to \npass this failed trade agreement. And then what will happen is the \nHouse will take it up, take up their version of it, and at some point \nit will be sent over here to be exchanged for the version we have \nalready completed in the Senate. The problem is, I would say to the \nleaders, then there will be another 20 hours under fast track, 20 hours \nof debate to which we are entitled. Perhaps this will not work out so \nwell after all.\n\n  I find it interesting. I must say to the majority leader, I apologize \nfor being irritated last night, but that irritation hasn't abated this \nmorning. I knew what was going to happen with CAFTA. It was negotiated \nover a year ago. It was signed over a year ago and has never been \nbrought to this Chamber. Why? Because they don't know if they have the \nvotes in the House. So over a year it languished. I knew at some point \nthey were going to try to fold it up into a tight, little package and \nsort of stick it through the keyhole before some kind of congressional \nrecess. Sure enough, that is exactly what they have done. Lord knows, \nyou don't want to have a long debate on the floor of the Senate about \ntrade strategy.\n  Having, for example, a debate of 3, 4, 5 days on one of the most \nsignificant problems we face is not something the majority party wants, \nnot something the President wants. Do an agreement. Sign it up. Wait \nfor a year. Buy off the votes with roads, bridges and dams and perhaps \nsome refrigerators. I don't mean ``buy up'' votes; I mean persuade \npeople by saying we will support your project--that was not a sensitive \nthing to say--persuade people who would have voted against you to \ndecide they will vote for you, if you can get 3 or 4 miles of road \nsomewhere near the hometown. You get enough votes, and then, a year \nlater, fit this into this little crevice before the July recess. Then \nall the dust settles over the Fourth of July recess, and we come back \nand act as if there are no trade issues.\n  So here we are. Some of my colleagues will speak about an issue that \nI care a lot about as well--sugar. This is the first step in the \ndirection of deciding to take the sugar program apart and to devastate, \nparticularly in our region of the country, the beet growers--beet \ngrowers in the Red River Valley of North Dakota--because they can't \ncompete with this kind of dump-price sugar that comes from these \nregions. This agreement, in itself, will not ruin the sugar industry, \nbut it is going to hurt it. It is the first step in a direction, a \nstrategy, that will ruin the industry in which a lot of beet growers \nout there, working on the farm, who got up this morning hoping they \ncould continue to make a living,\n\n[[Page S7652]]\n\nare going to be mighty concerned about where this heads. The next \nagreement that will come after this is the Free Trade Area of the \nAmericas with Brazil and others. It is an ominous direction and is a \ndisservice to the one farm program that does work in this country.\n  I would like to read a couple things. Most of you probably know Puff \nDaddy. Actually, Sean Combs is his name. He changed his name to P. \nDiddy. I never understood why somebody named Puff Daddy would change \ntheir name to P. Diddy. He is an artist, a musician. He also makes \nclothing, or at least he has someone make clothing with his name in the \nlabel.\n  So I held a hearing one day. We had workers, from Honduras, working \nin a plant in Honduras. Their job was to sew the sleeves on the shirts \nthat were the Sean John label rather than Puff Daddy or P. Diddy. It \nseems to me--I am not in the shirt business--that Puff Daddy or P. \nDiddy might have been a better label, but they chose Sean John. So they \ncontracted out for shirts to be produced in a plant in Honduras.\n  I have been there. I have watched. I have been to Honduras. I have \nwatched people make cigars and various things. We had three employees \nof the plant in Honduras that makes these shirts come and testify. I \ninvited Sean Combs to come and testify. He chose not to. Let me \ndescribe what was said at this hearing. It is directly related to \nsigning up to a trade agreement with these kind of economies and the \nallegation that will be made by my colleagues that there are no labor \nstandards that are enforceable or are enforced in these countries.\n  Let me read this. This was from Lydda Eli Gonzalez. In her report to \nus, she talks about her job. She says:\n\n       I get up at 5 a.m.--\n\nShe is a young woman--\n\n     to go to work at 6:45. I take two buses. When I get to the \n     factory, I have a tortilla with beans. I buy the cheapest \n     lunch I can, just a small piece of chicken, rice, beans and \n     water.\n\n  And she describes the cost of that. And then she describes her day at \nthe factory:\n\n       My job is attaching sleeves to the shirt. There are \n     different styles of Sean Jean shirts, but for long-sleeved \n     shirts, a production line of 20 workers has to sew 190 dozens \n     shirts a day--that's 2,280 shirts. Management demands we \n     reach this goal, but it is impossible.\n\n  And she goes on:\n\n       They call us filthy names--you can't answer--like \n     ``bitch,'' ``Maldito,'' ``donkey.'' You can't answer the \n     supervisors or they will fire you. It is very hot in the \n     factory. You are sweating all day. There is a lot of dust in \n     the air. I breathe it in. You go into the factory with black \n     hair. You come out with hair that is white or red or whatever \n     the color of the shirts we are working on. It is forbidden to \n     talk. You have to ask permission to use the bathroom. We have \n     to get a pass from the supervisor and give it to the guard in \n     front of the bathroom who also searches us before we go in. \n     You can go once in the morning and once in the afternoon. \n     Also they watch the time, and if you are gone more than three \n     or four minutes, they call you on the loudspeaker. Another \n     thing, the bathrooms are very dirty. There is almost never \n     any toilet paper or soap. They don't permit us to get up to \n     get water. If the worker next to you goes, you try to take \n     some advantage and see if they can bring just a bit of water \n     to you. You have to focus, work as fast as you can, to \n     complete the production goals, always under pressure.\n\n  She talks about being fired. She was one of 20 workers who were \nfired. All the new employees are required to take a pregnancy test. If \nit comes out positive, they are fired. ``Older workers suffer \nharassment and discrimination because the management prefers workers \nbetween 17 and 25 years old. When a woman gets to be 30, she can't work \nin these factories. And if she can get to work and if she is working, \noften she is harassed and sent to worse positions to try to make her \nquit.''\n  She says:\n\n       They search us physically when we enter the plant. If one \n     of us has candy, gum or lipstick, they take it away because \n     they think it could stain the clothing. They search them in \n     the bathroom.\n\n  The point is this, this young woman, with 20 others, decided they \nreally needed to try to organize to see if they could improve their \nlot. And 15 of them began to organize, and they were fired. You can't \norganize. Workers can't get together to try to organize to negotiate \nwith management. They are fired--out of luck, out of a job.\n  These countries say to us: We have labor standards. Sure they do. \nThey have labor standards on the books, totally unenforced. This is \nwhat we are signing up to.\n  This was Sean Combs. You remember the stories about Kathy Gifford and \nothers. Sean Combs, I believe, to his credit, said he did not know this \ncontracted labor was occurring, and I believe that he quickly took \naction to deal with that and moved this kind of production away from \nthat plant.\n  But let me ask the question: Does anybody think this is the \ncompetition for American workers that we ought to sign up for? \nShouldn't we be doing trade agreements with countries that have labor \nstandards? Shouldn't we decide, on behalf of American workers, that we \ncare first and foremost about American workers and, second, we also \ncare about the workers in the country with whom we are going to do a \ntrade agreement? What does it say about us, about our value system, to \nsuggest it doesn't matter?\n  This is about money. This isn't about workers. It is about companies \nbeing able to access cheap labor, working under any labor conditions, \nin order to boost and fatten profits.\n  I am well aware that there are those who take a look at those of us \nwho don't support these trade agreements and they say: You are just a \nbunch of xenophobic isolationist stooges. You don't understand it. You \nprobably don't have the capacity to understand it. We are describing a \nnew world order. It is a global economy. Don't you get it?\n  I wonder when things changed in this country to decide that we should \nnot stand up for our economic interests. When did that happen? When did \nit happen that it was OK to decide those who stood up for America's \neconomic interests--that is, for the demand that when we have a trade \nagreement, there would be fair labor standards, fair standards with \nrespect to the environment, that we want to keep jobs in America--when \ndid it become fashionable to say: You're a protectionist. You don't get \nit. You are sort of an economic nationalist. You are one of these \nAmerica-first types. Shame on you.\n  It seems to me the first goal of every trade agreement should be to \nrecognize, from our standpoint, that we are interested in standing up \nfor our economic interests, for our jobs. But that is not the case.\n  I would like anybody to explain to me these dramatic and deepening \ntrade deficits--which Warren Buffett, not necessarily a shrinking \nviolet, says is heading us toward becoming sharecroppers, and that is \nexactly the case--I would like anybody to explain to me how, with this \nbackground, the decision is made that we ought to do more of it. We are \ntold over and over and over again what we are doing with this next \ntrade agreement is we are opening foreign markets for American \nproducts. That is absolutely nonsense. Give us a break. We have been \nthrough this.\n  Later today, I will talk specifically about China because we did a \nbilateral on China. We have had a lot of trade relationships with \nChina. The fact is, what we are doing with these trade agreements is \nnot opening foreign markets, to any great degree, to American goods. I \nwould love to take my time--and I have 5 hours allotted to me--to go \nthrough a debate. Others probably have different views. They believe it \nis fine, for example, for the country of Korea to ship us 680,000 cars \na year on boats that land on the shores of the United States so \nAmerican consumers can buy Korean cars. And then we only get 3,800 cars \nfrom the United States into Korea. That is fine, some people might \nthink. I would love to debate that. Perhaps we have somebody who wants \nto stand up later today during my time and have a real discussion about \nthat. I would be happy to do that. I don't need three people. I would \njust like one person to say: ``Boy, I like the way this is going. This \nsure looks good for America. And I sure like what is going to happen \nwith China and bilateral automobile trade, and I sure like what \nhappened in the bilateral with China by which we are allowed to charge \na tariff that is one-tenth the tariff charged by the Chinese in \nbilateral automobile trade or I sure like the notion of what happened \npost-NAFTA.''\n  Let me do this for a moment. I think it is important for people to \nunderstand. We passed NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. \nWhen we did, we had a very slight trade surplus with Mexico and a \nmodest deficit\n\n[[Page S7653]]\n\nwith Canada. We very quickly turned a slight trade surplus with Mexico \ninto a very large deficit, and we turned a modest deficit with Canada \ninto a very large deficit.\n  The promises for NAFTA were grand promises about massive new numbers \nof American jobs and so on. None of that was accurate. There were those \nwho stood on this floor and said, with respect to NAFTA: What that \nmeans is, we are going to get the product of unskilled labor coming in \nfrom Mexico. That is what that means. And so what are the three biggest \nimports from Mexico now? Automobiles, automobile parts, and \nelectronics--all the product of high-skilled labor. They were all \nwrong. No one, of course, will stand on the floor and say: I admit \nthat. But they have all been wrong. All we have seen is an exodus of \nAmerican jobs. This chart is a certification to the U.S. Government of \ncompanies laying off U.S. workers due to NAFTA. We know that because \nthey are required to certify to the Department of Labor in order for \ntheir workers to be available for trade adjustment assistance. Trade \nadjustment assistance is a melodic, soft-tone that says: When you fire \nyour workers because of a trade agreement, you are able to get the \nFederal Government to pay your workers a little something. It is like \nextra unemployment.\n  So we know these companies have said: Because of NAFTA, we are laying \noff workers. We want them to be eligible for trade adjustment \nassistance.\n  Let's go down the list a bit. Fruit of the Loom. I can see the title \non the book: ``When America Lost its Shorts.'' I remember the day that \nFruit of the Loom announced that it was going to move its production \nout of this country. It was headline news, going to get rid of all the \nworkers. Doesn't mean they are not going to make shirts and shorts any \nmore. They are going to make them elsewhere, Mexico and China.\n  Levis, 15,676 workers making Levis. There is not much more all-\nAmerican than Levis.\n  What a great American brand, Levi. Everybody likes them. I wear \nLevis. Levis are gone. There is not one pair made in the United \nStates--not one. And, furthermore, the company that made Levis has \ncertified to the Federal Government that due to NAFTA, 15,676 employees \nshould be eligible for trade adjustment assistance. I will say that in \nEnglish. It means that because we passed the NAFTA trade agreement, \nthis company decided to get rid of 15,676 workers, and they want, under \ntrade adjustment assistance, to be eligible to get extra money from the \nFederal Government.\n  Is there anybody in the Senate who knows the name of a worker that \nmade Levis and lost their job? I am guessing not. I am guessing that \nalmost every one of these 15,676 people were like every other worker in \nthis country--proud to get up in the morning, put on some clothes, go \nto work, and feel as though they had a sense of self worth to provide \nfor their family and to do a job. Some probably worked 25, 30 years for \nthat company and did the best they could. And they had to come home and \nsay to their spouse: ``Honey, I have lost my job. It doesn't mean they \nare not going to make Levis anymore. They are just going to make them \nin Mexico or China or Indonesia or Sri Lanka or Bangladesh--you name \nit. They say I make too much money.''\n  I have told this story repeatedly, and I will do it again even if it \nbores people. Huffy bicycles is the classic one. It is the easiest to \nunderstand. I believe Huffy has about 20 percent of the American \nmarketplace. You buy them at Wal-Mart, Sears, and K-Mart. Huffy \nbicycles used to be made in Ohio in this country by workers who, by one \naccount, made $11 an hour plus benefits. Huffy wrote to me and said it \nwas more than that. So whatever it is--it could have been $15 or $18 an \nhour plus benefits--they made a good bicycle. They had a decal of the \nAmerican flag on the front of them. They fired the workers who made \nHuffy bicycles. Those workers are gone. In fact, the last job they \nperformed was to take the American flag decal from the bicycle and \nreplace it with a decal of the globe. All Huffys are now made in China \nby people who work for 30 cents an hour, 7 days a week, 12 to 14 hours \na day. The folks in Ohio are told they cannot compete with that. I can \nunderstand why. Should you be expected to compete with people who make \n30 cents an hour?\n  So American workers lose their jobs. Do you think some people from \nHuffy Bicycle, who were proud to make them for many years, and came \nhome to tell their families: ``I lost my job because they found \nsomebody in another part of the world--halfway around the world--who \nwill work 7 days a week, 12 hours a day, and they can pay them 30 cents \nan hour--and they can hire kids, by the way.'' Does anybody in this \nChamber know the names of these people who worked for Levi's or Huffy \nBicycle or Fig Newton Cookies? Does anybody know the names of the \npeople who worked for the company called Radio Flyer, which makes \nlittle red wagons? They are gone from America.\n  I can stand here for an hour and talk about those kinds of issues. On \nthis chart are the 100 largest companies certifying to the Department \nof Labor jobs lost due to these trade agreements. Let me tell you \nsomething else. You cannot get these numbers anymore. They are not \navailable. Do you know why? The Department of Labor won't make them \navailable. This chart says ``The Labor Department withheld trade \nreports.'' Let me quote from this article: ``The Labor Department has \nkept secret for more than a year, studies that supported Democratic \nopponents of the Bush administration's new Central American trade \ndeal.''\n  There was a report paid for by public funds that documented the \nworking conditions in CAFTA and the Central American countries of the \ntype I just described, and, of course, that document was covered up, \nkept secret. The official Government document from the Department of \nLabor that would have provided numbers of how many jobs were lost, as a \nresult of certifications by companies that were going to get rid of \ntheir workers--this information doesn't exist anymore either.\n  I have called the Secretary of Labor and said: You are collecting \nthis data and you are choosing now not to make it public. Why? She \nsays: I will look into it.\n  I placed a second call yesterday, but I have not heard back. In fact, \nyou cannot get this information anymore. If there is bad news, cover it \nup, I guess. Don't let bad news out.\n  Madam President, let me just read for a moment from something written \nby someone I deeply admire. I like Warren Buffet a lot. I don't know \nhim well, but I consider him a friend. I have met him a good number of \ntimes. He is the second richest man in our country, or probably in the \nworld. He is remarkably successful. He doesn't walk the talk or sound \nlike somebody with billions and billions of dollars. He is just a \nwonderful, remarkable guy with a great spirit. He wrote a piece to the \nshareholders of his company, Berkshire-Hathaway, that was very \ninteresting to me. I called Warren about his speech. He said this about \nthe trade deficit, the current account deficit:\n\n       Large and persistent current account deficits produce an \n     entirely different result. As time passes and as claims \n     against us grow, we own less and less of what we produce.\n\n  He means that we have a trade deficit of almost $2 billion every day, \n7 days a week, and it means foreign governments or foreigners have \nassets in the form of American dollars, American stock, and are buying \nAmerican real estate. That is why you saw that China wants to buy a big \noil company. They have the money to do it.\n  With respect to the trade deficit we have with China or the trade \nsurplus they have with us, he says:\n\n       Should we continue to run current account deficits \n     comparable to those now prevailing, the net ownership of the \n     United States by other countries and their citizens a decade \n     from now will amount to roughly $11 trillion. And if foreign \n     investors were to earn only 5 percent on that net holding, we \n     would need to send a net of one-half billion dollars in \n     goods and services abroad every year just to service the \n     U.S. investments then held by foreigners.\n       A country that is now aspiring to be an ownership society \n     will not find happiness in a sharecropper society. Yet, that \n     is precisely where our trade policies, supported by Democrats \n     and Republicans alike, are taking us.\n\n  Perhaps there are some in this Chamber who think this is not the \ncase, that these trade policies are just wonderful, that this red ink \nis just another innocent color, that these trade agreements have really \nworked well for America. That is probably because nobody in this \nChamber has ever lost their job to\n\n[[Page S7654]]\n\na bad trade agreement. No journalist has either, for that matter.\n  We have an interesting situation in this country. We have now, for \nabout the last 30 years, seen a dramatic change in the economies of our \ncountry and others. It is described as a global economy. It has \ngalloped forward in a very aggressive way, but the rules have not kept \npace. So the largest international corporations--many of them \nAmerican--have defined the new economy in their own image. They want to \nproduce where it is cheap and sell into our marketplace. They want to \nbe able to produce, for example, in China and Indonesia and Bangladesh \nand Sri Lanka and be able to sell that product to Des Moines, IA; \nFargo, ND; Denver; Chicago; or Los Angeles. That is quite a strategy \nabout fattening profits: Produce where it is cheap, where you can hire \nkids, where you can build a factory and not worry about having a safe \nworkplace, where you can dump chemicals into the air and water, and \nespecially where you can decide if your workers want to form a union, \nyou can fire them just like that. If you produce there, you can produce \nfor pennies, take that product and sell it into the established \nmarketplace in the United States, and you can fatten your profits. \nPretty good deal--if you are one of the companies who wants to do it.\n  But the rules for this globalized economy have not kept pace at all. \nThere have been virtually no rules. Everyone in this Chamber knows that \nwe have signed up to trade agreements with countries that say to \ncompanies: You can fire your workers if they try to unionize. Now, that \nis not a comparative advantage--going back to Ricardo. Ricardo \ndescribed the doctrine of comparative advantage, which says it is \neasier to raise sheep and produce wool in England and easier to grow \ngrapes and produce wine in Portugal; so each should do what is in its \nown best interest and what it does best and then trade. So you raise \nsheep, you share the sheep, get the wool in England, grow the grapes \nand stomp the grapes and produce wine in Portugal, and the English \ntrade their wool to Portugal, and the Portuguese send wine to the \nEnglish. That is the doctrine of comparative advantage--doing what is \nmost beneficial and efficient for each. There is no doctrine of \ncomparative advantage when you have a country deciding they are going \nto have 30-cent labor because we will fire people who try to unionize \nbecause we will not enforce restrictions with respect to the \nrequirement that you have safe workplaces. We will have cheap labor \nbecause we will let you hire 12-year-old kids, work them 12 hours a \nday, and pay 12 cents an hour, and we will turn the other way. That is \na political advantage. That is a decision by a government to continue \nto repress its workers.\n  Our trade agreements, historically, rather than lifting others up, \nwhich we ought to do in trade agreements, have had the effect of \npushing American workers down. That can work for a while, but it cannot \nwork for a long while because, ultimately, the question is going to be \nthis: Who is going to buy those products made with 30-cent labor in \nChina? Will it be the people who lost their jobs in the United States? \nWill it perhaps be one of these hundreds of thousands of people, each \njust a number, but each represented by a family? Will they buy those \nproducts when they are out of a job? You may say unemployment is not so \nhigh here and many of these people have been rehired. Yes, many have--\nat lower wages. That is the way this global economy has been working.\n  In my judgment, this does not work for our country. It is just not \nworking. My colleague from Iowa made the point--a fair point--should we \nnot want to lower tariffs in other countries? Absolutely. Can I remind \nmy colleagues, and others, that we are so ham-handed and fundamentally \nincompetent in negotiating trade agreements, using beef as an example--\nlet's go back for a moment prior to the discovery of a Canadian cow \nthat had mad cow disease in the United States. Prior to that time, we \nwere 15 years away from a beef agreement we made with Japan in the late \n1980s. Fifteen years later, after a beef agreement with Japan, a \ncountry with whom we have had a very large deficit always--and still \ndo--there was a 50-percent tariff on every pound of American beef going \ninto Japan. What a miserable failure that is. It happens to us in \nvirtually every circumstance.\n  I will mention one additional thing. Our trade negotiators do such a \nterrible job on behalf of this country. I assume they do it on behalf \nof whoever sends them out with instructions. Let me ask, if during the \ndiscussion today--and we will be here for some hours--I would like one \nSenator--if we can find somebody who knows the answer to this--to tell \nme, in the bilateral trade agreement with China, a country with whom we \nhave a giant trade deficit, an alarming and dangerous trade deficit, \nhow it is justified that China shall impose a 25-percent tariff on any \nU.S. automobiles we sell in China, and we will impose a 2.5-percent \ntariff on Chinese automobiles sold in the United States?\n  How is it that we have a bilateral agreement that imposes a tariff 10 \ntimes higher on U.S. cars that we sell in China than Chinese cars sold \nin the United States? I want one person--I have asked this question for \nyears--I want one person to tell me how that happened because the \nChinese are now gearing up an automobile export industry. In fact, \nGeneral Motors has gone to court to sue the Chinese because they say \nthe Chinese have stolen the entire production line blueprints for a car \ncalled the QQ. General Motors said they stole the production line \nblueprints of a General Motors car. This company is called Chery, C-H-\nE-R-Y, which is interesting; it is one letter away from Chevy, C-H-E-V-\nY. This Chinese company called Chery is producing a QQ car that General \nMotors says is the stolen production line blueprints of a car they \nhave. They are doing that, and all the press says they are gearing up \nfor a substantial Chinese automobile export market.\n  Guess what. When they do that, they will find a very friendly tariff \nin our country that is one-tenth the tariff that now exists in China by \nvirtue of acceptance of a trade agreement we have with China. It is \nunbelievable to me, the incompetence of having that sort of thing \nhappen.\n  I will not go on at length. We do not make any automobiles in North \nDakota, so I am not representing the automobile manufacturers. I am \njust telling my colleagues that it does not matter whether it is \nautomobiles or textiles or farm products.\n  My colleague from Iowa cares a lot, I am sure, about agricultural \nproducts. We work together on a lot of agricultural issues. I know he \ncares a lot about family farmers. Interestingly enough, when we did the \nbilateral agreement with China, we had a provision in that agreement \nabout the number of million metric tons of wheat that China would be \nexpected to allow in duty free. Right after that was done, of course, \nthe Chinese Agriculture Minister went down to the southern part of \nChina and said to the South Asia Post: ``That doesn't mean anything; \nthat doesn't mean we are actually going to import that wheat from \nAmerica. That is just something in writing.'' Indeed, they have not. \nWhen will we understand that promises not kept are not promises at all?\n  I suppose you can make a case to hook up in a trade agreement with \nalmost any region in the world. Somebody said to me: How on Earth can \nyou suggest these small countries would threaten our country? I am not \nsuggesting that. I am just saying when you are doing something wrong, \nstop doing it, change it, and do it right. That is not rocket science.\n  This trade agreement, with its pathetic provisions dealing with labor \nand its pathetic provisions protecting the environment, is exactly the \nsame as all the other trade agreements. You can say the environmental \nprovisions do not matter. Don't they really? We inhabit this Earth. \nThere are 6 billion of us. We have 6 billion neighbors on this little \nplanet called Earth. We circle the Sun. Somehow we end up here in the \nUnited States--just in this place--and there is no place like it on the \nface of the Earth. We are living in a fishbowl. We can clean up our \npart of the fishbowl, but if somebody on the other side is pumping in \nsludge, we are all breathing it. So environmental standards and labor \nstandards matter a lot.\n  This trade agreement is exactly like the others. It hooks up the \ncountries--and I already read the description--\n\n[[Page S7655]]\n\nthat do not enforce their standards at all. Second, it decides we will \nhave another loophole by which you can transship goods through these \ncountries into the United States.\n  One of my colleagues said to me: So what, it is coming in anyway from \nChina. So what? The fact is, if anybody in this Chamber were one of \nthese statistics--and there are about 200,000 of them on this sheet--if \nanyone in this Chamber were one of these statistics, nobody would say \n``so what.''\n  ``So what'' is we are losing jobs in this country. There is no social \nprogram we work on in this Chamber that is as important as a good job \nthat pays well and allows people to take care of their families. There \nis no social program as good as that. I am telling you, in case after \ncase, we are seeing good jobs leaving our country because others will \ndo them for less under conditions we would never accept in this \ncountry.\n  I have said many times that we had people die in the streets of this \ncountry fighting to organize as workers. People were literally killed \nin the streets of America for that purpose. We had people who went to \nthe streets for America demanding the opportunity to work in a safe \nworkplace. We have been through this for a century, describing the \nconditions of production in this country that were fair. And in a \nmoment, some companies can pole-vault over all those impediments and \nsay: I don't like them, never liked them; they represent regulations, \nthey represent things we don't support, and we are going to move our \njobs to China; and by the way, when we get there, we don't have to \nworry about unions, we can fire them if they try to unionize, and if we \ndon't fire them, the Chinese Government will take care of them.\n  What is happening is wrong. I am not saying we should build walls \naround our country. I am not saying we should retreat from the global \neconomy. I am saying we ought to recognize there has to be a set of \nfair rules to represent this country's economic interest. If we do not \nhave that set of fair rules, then we cannot possibly succeed.\n  Some say the Americans can compete anywhere, we can win anywhere. We \ncan compete if the rules are fair. But post-Second World War, in the \nlast 50 years, some very shrewd economic competitors have developed in \nthis world.\n  These trade deficits I have shown describe a circumstance in which we \ncannot compete with one arm tied behind our back. We cannot compete if \nit is unfair. We cannot ask American families to decide if $10- or $15-\nan-hour wages is something of which they should be ashamed because it \nis so much more than would be paid to workers hired in Bangladesh or \nChina. We cannot do that to American workers without in the longer term \ndramatically changing the standard of living in this country.\n\n  Others will say: You are talking about manufacturing. You should \nunderstand that we are going to create new jobs; we are creating new \njobs. Take a look at what is happening with software engineers, with \nwhite-collar jobs. Pick up the New York Times from last week on IBM and \nthen go to India and go to China and find out what kind of jobs are \ncoming in addition to factory jobs. It is not just factory workers. It \nis white-collar jobs. It is engineers.\n  Every young person in this country who is in earshot of this debate \nshould understand their future is going to be affected by what we are \ndoing. Their opportunity for good jobs will be affected by what we are \ndoing.\n  I, obviously, have additional comments and additional time in which \nto do it later today. We have colleagues who have been waiting. I \napologize for taking as much time as I did. This is a very important \nissue. I regret very much that we are doing it this way, just sticking \nit in a little keyhole crack between now and when we get out of here \nfor the July Fourth week. I knew this was going to happen. One year \nago, this bill got done. We did not hear about it for a year. I knew \none day we would find it stuck in a little keyhole, hoping we would not \nhave a real debate about trade on the floor of the Senate.\n  I guess now we are on autopilot. They are going to finish this maybe \nlate tonight, and they have accomplished their purpose, but they have \ndone America no service. It is no service to America to avoid facing \nstraight in the eye a serious problem facing this country.\n  Once again, to all those listening who call this protectionism, you \nare just wrong. This is not about protecting in the sense of being a \nprotectionist and wanting to build walls around our country. It is \nabout standing up for American interests. It is about trade agreements \nthat should be mutually beneficial, not one-way trade agreements, and \nit is about finally suggesting that we be hardheaded and make trade \nagreements economic policies, not softheaded foreign policy down at the \nState Department.\n  I could talk later about, for example, it is recommended we take \naction against China on this and that for trade, but the State \nDepartment says: You can't do that; that is all foreign policy. So our \ncountry walks around half hunched over worried about lost jobs and not \nwilling to talk about it. And what do we do? We negotiate another trade \nagreement of the same type. Is anybody thinking? Let's hope through \nthis debate perhaps we can begin to think through some of these issues \nand turn a corner.\n  Let me also say it was probably impolitic of me at the start of this \ndiscussion to ask about exotic dancers in strip clubs. I will ask again \njust because it probably is impolitic if there is anything in this \ntrade agreement about exotic dancers in strip clubs. The reason I ask \nis because in the NAFTA agreement that passed the Congress, according \nto what I have found doing a Google search, Canadian strip clubs have \nused NAFTA to find dancers from Mexico under the extended visas and \nemployment applications in NAFTA--exotic dancers were part of the \nprovision dealing with special skills. I am just guessing that there is \nno one in the Chamber of the Senate who voted on NAFTA who would have \nguessed it would have application to exotic dancers having special \nskills. Maybe I am wrong.\n  I ask the question: Is there anything in this trade agreement that we \nshould know about that perhaps I will come to the floor of the Senate \nand talk about several years from now, such as this?\n  The point I am making is, most people do not understand what is in \nthese trade agreements. They do not understand the circumstances and \nthe consequences of the trade agreements. All we hear is just more \ntired-sounding platitudes about reducing tariffs.\n  By the way, when we passed NAFTA, as my colleagues know, NAFTA \nreevaluated the peso, meaning it obliterated everything under NAFTA \nwith respect to tariffs almost immediately.\n  I will cover additional material at a later point today. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Who yields time? The Senator \nfrom Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam president, I yield such time as the Senator from \nColorado may use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I thank the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee for yielding. I compliment him on his tremendous leadership \nin the Finance Committee, particularly on the issue of trade.\n  I rise today in strong support of the U.S. Central America and \nDominican Republic Free Trade Agreement, known as CAFTA, and our \nadministration's current trade policies.\n  We sometimes forget what history has taught us. If we look back to \nthe early part of the 20th century, the early 1900s, our country was \nstruggling economically. One of the reasons, it was decided after a \nwhile, is because we were too restrictive on our trade policies. We had \nhigh tariffs on a lot of different products coming into this country. \nAll of a sudden, the economists began to wake up: If we liberalize our \ntrade policies, we begin to open trade to the entire world, and we \nbenefit. Lo and behold, we found our country began to do better \neconomically.\n  We forget what history taught us. We do not want to go back to some \nof the old tried-and-failed solutions some of my colleagues on the \nother side are talking about. They do not work. It destroys your \neconomy.\n  If we look with other countries to liberalize our trade agreements, \nwe raise the entire tide. Sure, other countries benefit, but we benefit \neven more. We will see that as we move forward with this debate.\n\n[[Page S7656]]\n\n  NAFTA has not hurt this country, it has helped it. It has created \nmore jobs, not less. So many figures we will hear presented here are \nfocused on one particular group, it is one side of the ledger. Nobody \ntalks about what has happened on the other side of the ledger when we \ncreated more jobs, particularly on the service side of our economy.\n  Another point I would make is look at the poor countries in the world \ntoday. They have more trade restrictions than those more modern \ncountries that are doing well economically. Doesn't that tell us \nsomething? Doesn't that tell us that if we can get them to relax their \ntariffs, they can begin to benefit with us and what is happening in the \ngrowth of our economies? Not only do we help them, but we help \nourselves. So it is a mutual win-win agreement on these international \ntrade agreements.\n  We can look at all these trade agreements and see how they have \nhelped us economically. They have helped our friends and trading \nallies. They have helped us to export the idea of democracy and what \nfree markets are all about. It is what makes a difference between our \nsuccess and many other countries that do not have a democracy, that do \nnot talk about how important it is to have free markets.\n  I rise today in strong support of this trade agreement. Prior to the \nBush administration, momentum of trade liberalization had clearly \nslowed. Thankfully, Congress reapproved executive authority for trade \nagreements, and with the leadership of President Bush, the \nadministration has made international trade a high priority for the \nhealth and well-being of the American economy. That is good.\n  We have acted to strengthen the President's ability to eliminate \ntrade barriers with other countries. The first steps have been taken \ntoward a new era of trade liberalization.\n  At the end of 2002, the Bush administration completed free-trade \nnegotiations with Chile and Singapore which were first begun by the \nClinton administration in 2000. This is not a partisan issue, it is a \nbipartisan issue. These free-trade agreements with Chile and Singapore \nentered into force on January 1, 2004.\n  In 2004, the agreements with Australia and Morocco were signed and \napproved by Congress, and this Australian trade agreement recently came \ninto force this January.\n  These agreements make a strong statement about the commitment of the \nUnited States to international trade, and CAFTA continues the trend of \nreaching bilateral trade agreements in our own hemisphere and abroad.\n  The countries entering into CAFTA are among the developing countries \nthat already enjoy duty-free access to U.S. markets for the majority of \ntheir exports. That is their goods coming into our country. While these \ndeveloping countries have high tariff and nontariff barriers on U.S. \nexports and impose restrictions on U.S. businesses, the agreement will \nliberalize trade in goods, services, government procurement, \nintellectual property investment, and address important labor and \nenvironmental issues. We are going to let them join with us in our \neconomic prosperity. That is not going to hurt the United States. It is \ngoing to benefit our economy.\n\n  Trade between the United States and CAFTA countries totaled over $33 \nbillion alone last year. The United States exported almost $16 billion \nin goods to five Central American countries and the Dominican Republic \nin 2004--more than all exports to Russia, India, and Saudi Arabia \ncombined.\n  This agreement will create the second largest U.S. export market in \nLatin America--$16 billion--behind only Mexico, and the 14th largest \nU.S. export market in the world. The market access and trade discipline \nprovided by CAFTA offer an opportunity to expand U.S. exports to a \nregion that is already seeing high export growth rates. In fact, from \n2000 through 2004 export shipments to CAFTA designations grew by almost \n16 percent compared to 5 percent for U.S. overall exports.\n  CAFTA also helps to move the current trading relationship from one-\nway preferences to a more reciprocal partnership. Currently, about 80 \npercent of the region's exports enter the United States duty free, \nwhile U.S. goods exported to CAFTA countries face significant tariffs. \nHowever, with this agreement in place CAFTA will boost opportunities \nfor exporters throughout the country, providing new market access for \nthese producers.\n  Specific to my home State's interests, the State of Colorado, CAFTA \nimmediately eliminates tariffs on 80 percent of U.S. exports and \neliminates all tariffs within 10 years, including up to 15 percent \ntariffs on Colorado's exports of machinery, manufactured products, and \ntransportation equipment. The information technology producers will \nalso gain with the elimination of distribution barriers and elimination \nof information technology tariffs, as well as the opening of key \ninformation technology services, including telecommunications, and will \nalso protect intellectual property rights.\n  For Colorado's farmers and ranchers CAFTA will eliminate tariffs on \n50 percent of U.S. exports immediately and most remaining duties within \n15 years, benefiting beef and pork producers with the immediate \nelimination of tariffs over 15 years; dairy products with duty-free \ntariff rate quotas that will expand from over 10,000 tons in year 1 and \nout of quota tariffs eliminated over 20 years; and finally corn, wheat, \nand grain products with the immediate binding at zero of tariffs on \nwheat, barley, oats, and rye as well as for corn in Costa Rica and \nsorghum in the Dominican Republic and Guatemala. All remaining tariffs \non feedgrains will be eliminated over 15 years.\n  Clearly, this agreement greatly benefits my State of Colorado and the \nNation as a whole. I am pleased to stand behind the agreement reached \nby former U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick and our current \nUSTR, Rob Portman.\n  On noneconomic impact, I have already said that even if we were to \nset aside all the economic benefits for continuing liberalization of \ninternational trade like CAFTA, there are still many other reasons, \nmost notably humanitarian reasons. History has shown it is the isolated \nclosed societies that are the most brutal and repressed. International \ncontact brought about by increased trade with businessmen, foreign \ngoods exchanges, corporate presence, and marketing serves to increase \naccess to a higher standard of living and a better quality of life.\n  International trade also requires important reforms of the domestic, \nlegal, and business environment that are key to encouraging business \ndevelopment and investment. Such reforms include providing greater \ntransparency for Government to strengthen the rule of law and improving \nprotection and enforcement of intellectual property rights. We must \nalways remember that America's No. 1 export is democracy, and \noverreaction to our trade deficit, increasing tariffs, or other false \nbarriers to trade will damage not only our bottom line but also our \nnational security interests. We cannot allow that to happen.\n  Madam President, we have heard a lot of doomsday predictions from \nopponents of this fair trade agreement that CAFTA will lead to all \nkinds of job loss both here and in Central America. A lot of these \npeople said the same thing about NAFTA. Remember the great sucking \nsound of jobs that were supposed to go to Mexico? Well, it just did not \nhappen.\n  Let's take a look at this chart. This is the chart on U.S. jobs from \n1993 to 2004. Remember that we adopted NAFTA in 1993, I guess 1994. \nWhat this chart shows is the number of jobs in the United States from \n1993 out to 2004, that if the trade critics were right, you would \nexpect to see a fall in the number of jobs in the United States. \nFollowing the passage of NAFTA, look at it. It just did not happen. The \nblue line is manufacturing jobs--basically, a straight line, a little \nbit of reduction on the end. And look at what has happened, though, to \nnonmanufacturing jobs. This is the purple line or the light pink line, \nwhat is happening in the growth. We simply have not lost any jobs since \nthe start of NAFTA. In fact, the United States had almost 17 million \nmanufacturing jobs in 1994. That number rose to 17.26 million by 2000. \nNow it is falling only after the recession hit us in the year 2000. \nThat was about the time we had 9/11. In fact, after NAFTA passed, the \nU.S. unemployment rate dropped.\n\n  Take a look at the U.S. unemployment rate from 1993 to 1994. In 1993, \nthe\n\n[[Page S7657]]\n\nU.S. unemployment rate was about 6.9 percent as reflected here, and in \n1994, the year NAFTA passed--right in here reflected by this chart--it \nfell to 6.1 percent, and then it continued to fall reaching only 4 \npercent in 2000. Then at its peak postrecession point, the unemployment \nrate was 5.5, still lower than it was in 1994, I might add. So NAFTA \nclearly did not cause massive unemployment in the United States as \npredicted by trade critics.\n  Well, then the critics will say that maybe they were wrong with the \nnumbers. Maybe there was no massive loss of jobs, but NAFTA caused us \nto substitute good-paying jobs for bad-paying jobs. Again, the facts \nshow that they were wrong. Let's take a look at real hourly wages from \n1983 to 2004. What we see happening here is a drop in real hourly wages \nuntil we get down to 1994 when we then adopted NAFTA.\n  Lo and behold, look what happens to wages, both the real average \nmanufacturing wages, which is reflected by this top line, and then what \nhas happened with the real hourly wages in the private sector. Look at \nthe climb that we have seen in real hourly wages. Real hourly wages \nhave risen since NAFTA for all workers. In fact, wages that were in \ndecline in the decade prior to NAFTA have increased steadily since the \nNAFTA agreement was reached.\n  We also heard that NAFTA would result in the flood of cheap imports \nfrom Mexico. Again, the critics were simply wrong. I point to this next \nchart which reflects U.S. imports from Mexico prior to NAFTA, and under \nNAFTA, as a share of total U.S. imports. U.S. imports from Mexico have \nheld fairly steady at 7 percent, as we can look across here, as a \npercent of total U.S. imports, not much higher than they were in the 5 \nyears prior to NAFTA.\n  We also heard that U.S. companies would start investing all their \nmoney in Mexico because U.S. workers can't compete with Mexico's wage \nrates. Again, the doom and gloom crowd was simply wrong. Look at the \nchart. What we see, talking about U.S. direct investments, is that U.S. \ninvestments didn't migrate to low-wage countries as predicted. In fact, \nafter NAFTA went into effect, U.S. investment in Europe increased by \n48.5 percent of total U.S. investment abroad to 53.8 percent in 2003.\n  Here is what happened with the investment in Mexico. If we look at \nthe larger peaks that we have over here, this reflects what has \nhappened with Europe. These are modern countries that we are dealing \nwith, and we have the poorer countries down here. We did not see our \ninvestments being soaked up by low-wage countries. We still continue to \nmaintain our trade with modern countries. So our challenge is to get \npoorer countries up into our modern sphere.\n  In contrast, U.S. direct investment in Mexico accounted for 2.8 \npercent in 1994 and just 3.4 percent 10 years later. Put another way, \nEurope's share of investment increased by 5.3 percentage points, and \nMexico's by .6 percentage points.\n  We also heard that Mexico was just too poor to buy our product so we \nshould not trade with them. Wrong again. Mexican consumers increased \ntheir purchases of U.S. consumer goods since NAFTA went into effect. In \nfact, U.S. exports of consumer goods are 66 percent higher in 2004 than \nthey were in 1993.\n  U.S. exports of home entertainment equipment grew from $984 million \nto $1.293 billion. Exports of household goods have grown from $1.4 \nbillion to $2.1 billion. And U.S. agriculture has benefitted. Since the \nimplementation of the agreement, U.S. agricultural exports to Mexico \nhave nearly doubled. Mexico now imports nearly $6.5 billion of U.S. \nagricultural products, making them our third largest market.\n  It is important for all of us to realize that we can take some of \nthese figures, if we just talk about certain individual commodities or \ncertain individual industries, and we can talk about just that \nparticular--we can single out industries that for one reason or another \nhave problems. The overall figures shown on these charts indicate what \nis happening with trade and what is happening with the economy as a \nresult of liberalizing our trade and opening it up. I don't think \nanybody can deny that we have not benefitted. And I don't think that \nanybody can deny those countries that have traded with us have not \nbenefitted. So we all benefit from this rising tide. That is why I feel \nso strongly that we need to move forward. I think the doomsday \nscenarios predicted by the critics did not happen. They were wrong \nabout the North American Free Trade Agreement then and they are wrong \nabout the Central American Free Trade Agreement now.\n  Madam President, we need to move forward. I applaud the leadership \nfor moving this issue forward quickly. I particularly applaud the \nchairman of the Finance Committee for his superb leadership on this \nparticular issue. I know it is difficult and demanding, but it is \nimportant, important to the welfare of everyone in America, not just a \nfew. It is important to the welfare of our trading partners, not just a \nfew. This is an overall policy where many people benefit, and we should \nnot forget that the whole economy of the United States will be better \nbecause we have liberalized our trade. What we saw in the early 1900s \nis a lesson we should not forget because we had high tariffs and trade \nrestrictions that did not work. Now we are in a different era. We don't \nwant to forget the lessons history taught us.\n  Madam President, I want to yield the floor and thank the leadership \nand particularly Chairman Grassley on this issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have two editorials printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         [From the (Denver) Rocky Mountain News, May 14, 2005]\n\n                          CAFTA Still Critical\n\n       Six Latin American presidents made an unprecedented joint \n     trek to the Capitol this week in a last-ditch effort to drum \n     up support for the Central American Free Trade Agreement. But \n     the protectionist mood sweeping much of the nation appears to \n     have infected all too many of Washington's political elites.\n       At risk is America's global economic leadership, which some \n     lawmakers seem all too willing to trade away for support from \n     Big Labor, environmental groups and especially the sugar \n     lobby. Because it is having trouble mustering the votes for \n     passage, the White House has in recent days taken to \n     reminding Congress that CAFTA is also necessary to help \n     secure democracy and development in a region wracked by civil \n     war, drugs, human trafficking and economic stagnation over \n     the past two decades.\n       Interestingly enough, this same argument--that CAFTA is \n     good for our own national security--is being made by a conga \n     line of diplomats from both political parties, including \n     former Secretary of State Warren Christopher, former defense \n     secretaries William Cohen and William Perry, Bill Clinton's \n     special envoy to the Americas, Thomas McLarty, and Jimmy \n     Carter's trade representative Robert Strauss, to name but a \n     few.\n       CAFTA would end duties on 80 percent of the $15 billion in \n     U.S. exports to the 44 million consumers of Costa Rica, \n     Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and the \n     Dominican Republic in the Caribbean. Currently, those \n     countries levy average tariffs ranging from 10 percent to 20 \n     percent on a host of U.S. goods such as motor vehicles, grain \n     and meat, while the U.S. rate is zero. The U.S. Chamber of \n     Commerce predicts U.S. sales to the region could expand by \n     more than $3 billion in the first year once CAFTA tariff \n     limits take effect. The American Farm Bureau estimates \n     agriculture exports--about $1.6 billion in 2003--would grow \n     $1.5 billion a year. Winners would include Colorado's feed, \n     potato, grain, pork and cattle industries.\n       If CAFTA fails, it will be in part because the powerful \n     U.S. sugar lobby has plied Capitol Hill with a fictional \n     doomsday scenario in which the trade pact destroys the \n     domestic industry. The truth is American sugar import quotas \n     would rise by a scant 1 percent of the total U.S. market in \n     the first year, and ascend over the next 15 years to a \n     whopping 1.7 percent. What's really at stake for the sugar \n     industry is prices that are two to three times the world \n     market.\n       Democrats are leading the assault on CAFTA, claiming the \n     pact's requirement that the countries enforce their own labor \n     and environmental standards is too weak. But this objection \n     ignores the fact that wherever U.S. companies plant \n     themselves in the world, labor and environmental standards \n     invariably rise over time. Voting CAFTA down would surely \n     deal a blow to Central America's reform-minded political \n     leaders. But defeat would also mean the loss of new markets \n     for U.S. workers and farmers, a failure that could cripple \n     America's ability to forge more far-reaching trade \n     liberalization in the coming years.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Denver Post, Mar. 26, 2005]\n\n                        CAFTA Worth Our Support\n\n       In two weeks, Congress starts debating a treaty that will \n     shape America's future role in our hemisphere. Since \n     lawmakers previously gave President Bush ``fast track'' \n     authority to negotiate the pact, lawmakers\n\n[[Page S7658]]\n\n     can't change any provisions in the Dominican Republic-Central \n     American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA)--they can only vote yes \n     or no. We think that vote should be yes.\n       CAFTA is modeled on free trade deals Congress OK'd a decade \n     ago with Mexico and Canada, in 2000 with Jordan and in 2004 \n     with Morocco. CAFTA would eliminate trade barriers on most \n     goods and services and encourage commerce among the United \n     States, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Honduras, El \n     Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua.\n       The issue splits Colorado's congressional delegation. \n     Leaning in favor of it are Republican Reps. Bob Beauprez of \n     metro suburbs and Marilyn Musgrave of the Eastern Plains. \n     Leaning against it are Democratic Reps. Mark Udall of Boulder \n     and John Salazar of the Western Slope. Undecided are \n     Democrats Sen. Ken Salazar and Rep. Diana DeGette of Denver, \n     and Republican Reps. Joel Hefley of Colorado Springs and Tom \n     Tancredo of the metro suburbs. Sen. Wayne Allard, a \n     Republican, declined comment.\n       Colorado's sugar beet farmers oppose CAFTA because they say \n     it will let cheap, subsidized sugar flood U.S. markets. While \n     concerns may be understandable, Congress shouldn't let one \n     industry decide U.S. hemispheric policy.\n       The real arguments in favor of CAFTA involve global issues \n     and the future of our hemisphere's small democracies. Central \n     America will never rival U.S. economic clout--but China is \n     trying. CAFTA could help the Western Hemisphere better \n     position itself to compete with China's burgeoning \n     industries, Central American leaders say.\n       As a tool that can help rebuild Central America's \n     struggling economies, CAFTA also has a political dimension. \n     Although Costa Rica has been a stable democracy for more than \n     a half century, its neighbors endured dictatorships, civil \n     wars and insurgencies through the 1990s.\n       Central America's democracies are still fragile, and its \n     governments need to show their impoverished people there's a \n     hope for a brighter future. CAFTA is one tool to nurture that \n     hope.\n       U.S. foreign policy interests would be well-served by \n     helping to build prosperity and freedom among all the nations \n     in our hemisphere.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I yield 20 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, and ask it be taken off the time allocated to the \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, because we have a number of Senators on \nthe floor--I am happy to defer to my senior colleagues, but if we could \nestablish a kind of queue? I know Senator Leahy has a statement. I am \ninterested in speaking on CAFTA. I ask the distinguished Senator from \nMontana, could we see if we could get an order among the Senators who \nare on the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I modify the request: 20 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts taken from the time of the Senator from North Dakota; \nwhen he has finished, 5 minutes to the Senator from Vermont, that time \nto be taken off the time allocated to the Senator from Iowa. Then, \nfollowing that, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Oregon, that \ntime to be taken off the time allocated to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I wish my friend from Colorado were on \nthe floor. I listened very carefully to his description of the state of \nour economy from 1993 on. As we remember, President Clinton was elected \nin 1992. I think modern economists would say we had the longest period \nof economic growth and price stability in this century--certainly in \nthis century, and for at least 100 years during that period of time. \nThat is what is reflected in these numbers.\n  To tie those into questions about lost manufacturing jobs in terms of \nNAFTA, it is better to look at the various analyses, the business \nanalyses that have been done. The EPI studies show that more than \n900,000 manufacturing jobs have actually been lost due to NAFTA.\n  I am proud of the record of President Clinton. I was proud to vote in \nsupport of his economic policies, to put that into play. As a matter of \nfact, it did not have a single vote here by a Republican in the Senate. \nIt does reflect in the strong economic indicators that the Senator from \nColorado showed, but relating that to what were the manufacturing jobs \nthat were lost, in terms of NAFTA, I did not hear explained very \nclosely.\n  I support free trade. I have long voted for trade agreements that \ntruly leveled the playing field for our country and for our workers.\n  Will the Chair let me know when I have 3 minutes left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Free trade removes unfair barriers to American goods and \nworld markets and creates a fair playing field for competition between \nAmerican workers and workers abroad. Free and fair trade creates jobs \nand strengthens our economy. But this Central American agreement is not \nfree trade. I urge the Senate to reject this unfair agreement.\n  Especially at this time when American workers are deeply concerned \nabout their jobs being outsourced overseas, the Bush administration is \nwrong to negotiate an agreement that refuses to protect them. I am \ncoming back to that in a moment. It allows participating countries to \nuse labor practices that fail to meet international standards. It means \nthat American workers, the best in the world, will be forced to compete \nwith countries whose workers are abused and exploited. That is not fair \ntrade.\n  I am for progress and economic development in Central America, dating \nback to President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress. But this agreement \ndoes nothing to improve labor rights for the workers in the CAFTA \nnations. All it asks is that they enforce their existing laws. It does \nnothing to create a community of nations that respects the basic rights \nand dignity of workers.\n  Most CAFTA nations give their workers no real rights such as an 8-\nhour day, overtime pay, or protection against discrimination. Laws in \nsome CAFTA nations are even hostile to organized labor. Workers in El \nSalvador, Nicaragua, and Honduras can be fired for joining a union or \neven intending to organize a union. In Nicaragua, strikes are \nprohibited without government permission. Even where laws do exist, \nviolations often cannot lead to fines or sanctions.\n  Those working conditions are not just what I have to say. There is an \nexcellent study that was commissioned by the Department of Labor to \nreview the working conditions among these countries that would be \naffected by this agreement. When the results came in, what did the \nadministration do? They tried to hide the report. They went out and \npulled all the paper that the study had been written on. What the study \nshowed very clearly--and I will read the excerpts. The Government-paid \nstudy concludes:\n\n       Countries proposed for free trade status have poor working \n     environments and fail to protect workers' rights. The \n     department instructed its contractors to remove the reports \n     from its web, ordered it to retrieve paper copies before \n     they could be made public, banned the release of the new \n     information from the reports, and even told the contractor \n     it could not discuss the studies with outsiders. The \n     working countries are so bad in those countries that the \n     administration's own independent report stated so. Do we \n     have anything in this particular agreement that will do \n     anything about it? Absolutely not.\n\n  Have we at other times tried to do something about the conditions in \nthese other countries? We certainly have. The agreement which stands \nout is the Jordanian agreement. In the Jordanian agreement they have \nvery clear understanding about what the Jordanians were going to do to \ntry to realize the international labor standards. No. 1, they were \ngoing to eliminate slave trade; No. 2, they were going to make advances \nmoving ahead on child labor; No. 3, they were going to permit the \norganizing of various labor organizations with real enforcement going \nin there, and penalties and sanctions if there were a violation. In \nother words, under the labor provisions in the Jordanian agreement that \nwas passed by this body, we were moving forward, upward, to meet the \ninternational labor conditions. That is what ought to be in this \nagreement.\n  But is it in this agreement? Absolutely not. Were there any \nprovisions in this agreement that, as a result of this agreement, \nAmerican workers would get some kind of compensation for loss of their \njobs as we have done at other times? Absolutely not. That proposal was \ndefeated in the Finance Committee.\n  In other words, we are leaving American workers out there, high and \ndry,\n\n[[Page S7659]]\n\nand are asked to go ahead and pass this without any serious effort to \nprovide at least some protection for workers in those countries where \nthere are going to be profits that will certainly not trickle down to \nthe workers in that country and where real American workers will pay \nwith the loss of their jobs because of this agreement.\n  CAFTA does not just ignore international standards for Central \nAmerican workers; it also fails to include the aid for American workers \nlikely to be displaced. When the Senate Finance Committee debated this \nagreement, it recommended that CAFTA include aid for displaced American \nworkers, but the White House ignored the bipartisan recommendation. The \nPresident effectively abused his power and presented Congress and the \nAmerican people with a take-it-or-leave-it plan. We know it can be \nbetter and we should reject this defective agreement, send it to the \nWhite House and go back to the drawing board.\n  Although CAFTA is the administration's top trade priority, it \nactually does very little to reduce the Nation's growing overall trade \ndeficit. Trade in the region accounts for less than 1.5 percent of \ntotal U.S. trade. It will barely lead to any improvement in GDP, an \nincrease of only one-tenth of 1 percent. Instead of a policy to reduce \nour trade imbalance with China and deal with its currency manipulations \nand WTO violations, the administration has spent more than a year on \nthis trade agreement that will do embarrassingly little to improve jobs \nand the economy. It is out of touch with sensible trade priorities for \nthis country and ignores the needs of American families.\n  I want to take a few moments to show the pressure American families \nare under and why they are wondering why we are considering this \nlegislation that provides no protection even for the workers in those \ncountries and why it will accelerate additional pressures on American \nworkers. Look what is happening in this country. More than 37 million \nAmericans, 28 percent of the workforce, work more than 40 hours a week. \nNearly 1 in 5 workers work more than 50 hours a week. More than 7.4 \nmillion Americans are working at 2 or more jobs, and 300,000 have 2 \nfull-time jobs. Americans' work hours have increased more than in any \nother industrialized nation. American workers are working longer, are \ndoing better, are increasing their productivity. Is there any \nrecognition and respect for this extraordinary achievement? I certainly \ndo not see it.\n  What do we have here? Workers are not benefiting from their work. \nThis chart shows there is an increase in productivity from 2001 to \n2004. Productivity is growing 43 times faster than wages.\n  Generally, in our country, when we have seen the expansion in \nproductivity, we have also seen a growth in American workers' wages. \nThat is the way it has been since we have been an industrial nation, \nwith the exception of the present, current time. Currently, workers \nhave been increasing their productivity--they are working longer, they \nare working harder, and they are increasing their productivity--but \neffectively their wages are stagnant.\n  What kind of life do these American workers face? They face an \nincrease in their health insurance. Their wages are stagnant, their \nhealth insurance costs increase 59 percent; college tuition for their \nchildren is up 35 percent; housing is up 36 percent; and gas 38 \npercent. We just passed an energy bill. You would have thought in an \nenergy bill we would try to do something about the cost of gas that \nworking families and middle-income families are paying every single \nday. Right? Wrong. Wrong. We did nothing. We did nothing about the \nincreased cost of gas.\n  We took care of the major companies that are producing it, but \neffectively we have done nothing that has helped the workers in that \nparticular program.\n  Look at what has happened. This President is the first President \nsince Herbert Hoover to lose private sector jobs. These are the \nfigures: 2001, 111,622,000 were working in the private sector. Now we \nare 111,598,000 in May of 2005. We have seen the reduction of jobs that \nare available in the private sector. There has been some growth, but it \nhas all been in the public sector, not the private sector.\n  I saw the earlier presentation of the Senator from Colorado. He \ntalked about the recoveries we have had. We have seen in this recovery \nof this administration, it is the lowest one we have had in recent \nyears. What we find now is, as a result, we have 7.6 million Americans \nwho are out of work; 1.6 million more unemployed than in 2001. These \nare the numbers of Americans who are out of work. The ones who are \nworking are working longer and working harder.\n  This is a quote from Kevin Hassed, director of Economic Policy \nStudies, the American Enterprise Institute, which is a conservative \ninstitute:\n\n       Usually at this point in a recovery job creation is \n     skyrocketing, but so far that hasn't happened: It's not a \n     partisan issue, it's a fact. The labor market is worse than \n     in a typical recovery.\n\n  These are the economic conditions. Now we have of those 7.6 million \nAmericans, they are trying to compete for job openings. There are 3.6 \nmillion job openings in this country. These are hard-working Americans, \ntrying to compete for a limited number of jobs.\n  Another very important point to know about the condition of American \nworkers is the number of those who are long-term unemployed. We have \nseen that grow from 680,000 in 2001 to this in May of 2005, up 1.5 \nmillion. These are the workers who have been unemployed for 26 weeks or \nlonger. This is an indication of the stagnation of our economy. Here we \nhave seen 2.8 million manufacturing jobs lost over the period since \n2001. There it is, 2.8 million jobs lost, manufacturing jobs lost. They \nhave been lost in virtually every one of the States; 47 States have \nlost manufacturing jobs. Now we are being asked to pass another piece \nof legislation that is going to accelerate that? That is what this \nlegislation will do.\n\n  We know what is happening to the American workforce. They are working \nlonger, harder. They have a greater increase in productivity. Their \nwages are flat. The things they pay for are going through the roof. And \nwe know those workers are going to lose their jobs. What jobs are out \nthere for them? This is the growth in the next decade, low-paying \noccupations. Seven of the ten fastest growing occupations pay $27,000 a \nyear: Retail, food prep, cashiers, janitors, waiters, customer reps, \nand nursing reps.\n  We should be in the Senate debating and arguing how we can ensure our \nworkforce is employed in the country that has the greatest economy, \ncertainly the greatest national security, and the greatest military. We \nwant to keep it that way. The way to keep strong is with a \nmanufacturing base. The way to do that is invest, invest, invest; \ninvest in those workers to make sure they have good training, upgrade \ntheir training, invest in innovative and creative ways to expand our \nability to manufacture and expand.\n  Are we debating those issues? No, we are trying to pass legislation \nthat is going to put workers that do have jobs at greater risk. That is \nwhat this does.\n  It is against this background I mention the latest UNICEF study from \n2004 revealed Costa Rica has 127,000 children working in their plants. \nGuatemala, virtually the same. Those countries are virtually the same. \nWill this legislation get those children out of those plants and \nfactories? No. Absolutely, no.\n  The interesting aspect, there is one limited program sponsored by the \nLabor Department that permits the Labor Department to inspect plants \nand factories across the country regarding employment of child labor. \nWhat did this administration do? It cut the guts out of it, 80 percent \nof the appropriation. They cut the guts out of it. Does this add up or \nmake sense; an 80-percent reduction in appropriations of the program \nthat provides the inspection for child labor in these countries? The \nchildren are going to be in those sweat houses. Our workers will be \nlosing jobs. The American workers are going to be losing jobs. There is \nvirtually no penalty. Actually, yes, there is a penalty that could be \nimposed against the country but not against the specific industry. The \nindustries really do not care. Those countries will be negotiating \nthose penalties.\n  It does not have to be this way. We ought to be able to have a \nprogram that is going to be fair to American workers, uplift the \nworking conditions of those countries around the world,\n\n[[Page S7660]]\n\nand also be something that all members of this Senate would be proud to \nsupport. That is not this legislation. It is heavily flawed. As a \nresult, there will be not only enormous numbers of people in that \nregion that are going to be exploited, but we will pay for it with the \nprice of American workers.\n  I yield back my remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The Senator from Vermont, under a \nprevious order, is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Leahy are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nOregon is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have decided to support CAFTA. Because I \nknow I will have a lot of welts on my back for it, I want to take a few \nminutes to describe how I arrived at my decision.\n  A special concern to me is that if CAFTA is rejected, China will have \nyet another opportunity to grow its economy and strengthen its economic \nbase at America's expense. Why Americans would want to do that defies \nlogic.\n  China is already an economic juggernaut. But as of now, they are not \ngoing to get duty-free exports to Central America. Only the United \nStates has that prospect, and only with CAFTA-DR. If America walks away \nfrom this agreement, does anyone really think the Chinese will sit on \nthe sidelines? As the kids say, ``hello!''\n  The Chinese would love the opportunity to get an economic toehold in \nour backyard. I, for one, don't think we ought to give them that \nopportunity. Personally, I believe we ought to be more vigilant in \nterms of watchdogging trade with China than we have been. That is why \nlast week I pushed the Bush administration to immediately move to do a \nreview of the proposed purchase of Unocal by China's state-run oil \ncompany under the Exon-Floria law, to examine the national security and \neconomic implications of a deal that is essentially unprecedented.\n  If you are a free trader--and I am willing to be called that--you \nought to protect your interests. That is why I favor, for example, \ndoing a vigorous review of that proposed purchase of Unocal, and I also \npropose standing up for our interests in Central America rather than \nwalking away from the region and handing the Chinese yet another golden \neconomic opportunity to strengthen their economic base. In my view, it \nwill be an opportunity we have given up, and gratuitously so.\n  My view is that with respect to international trade, we ought to make \nthings and grow things in the United States of America and then sell \nthem around the world. Particularly, I want to sell more value-added \nproducts made in the United States of America. There is an opportunity \nin Central America to sell those value-added products made in the \nUnited States such as health care equipment, energy production and \nconservation goods, computer chips, communications gear--a whole host \nof products. The reason I say that is that the Presidents of various \ncountries in Central America have written me indicating they are \nprepared to now make those purchases. They are interested in U.S. \nsuppliers.\n  Some have asked, how is someone in Central America going to have the \nmoney to purchase these health care products and chips, computers, and \ncommunications gear? The reality is, the first purchases will be made \nby governments in Central America. The governments have indicated to me \nthey are the ones that want to spend on our value-added \nproducts: computers and chips and energy-production devices.\n\n  For example, Honduras is starting a ``Telephony for All'' program. \nThey intend to increase dramatically the number of telephones, wireless \ndevices, and the various technologies that will allow them to be part \nof the information age. We ought to make sure those products are made \nin our country and sold there. We will have an opportunity to do more \nof that under this agreement, which will allow us to send American \nexports into Central America duty free.\n  Now, I would be the first to say this is not the agreement I would \nhave written. For example, I feel very strongly about using the Jordan \nFree Trade Agreement as the model for labor and environmental \nstandards. I think it is a major mistake that was not done. I also \nthink our inability to get a strong trade adjustment package into this \nlegislation is something the Senate will greatly regret.\n  I see my good friend from Montana on the floor, Senator Baucus. He \nhas championed Trade Adjustment Assistance, along with myself and \nSenator Rockefeller and Senator Coleman. We got 54 votes in the Senate \nnot long ago for our bipartisan legislation to try to assist workers \nwho are adversely affected by trade.\n  It seems incomprehensible that we cannot modernize this program. It \nis decades old. It ought to be extended to service workers. There is \nbipartisan support for it in the Senate. It would be yet another \nmessage to the workers of this country, who are out on the shop floors, \nthat we are concerned first and foremost for their well-being.\n  So I am going to continue to come back and prosecute this cause with \nthe Senator from Montana. The chairman of our committee, Senator \nGrassley, knows full well how strongly Senator Coleman and I feel about \nit, because it is unacceptable to me there is not a trampoline for \nworkers who are adversely affected by trade to get other family-wage \njobs. We ought to have that opportunity for them to bounce back when \nthey are adversely affected by trade. We have it in other areas. The \nfailure to extend it to service workers, who could be affected by this \nand other trade agreements, I think is a major mistake.\n  There are other changes I would have wanted, particularly in the \npharmaceutical area. I think this legislation is not well conceived in \nthat it clearly favors brand names over generic ingredients. But I will \nsay to colleagues that even with these concerns--the inability to have \na modernization of the trade adjustment program and some of the labor \nissues addressed in the way I would--it is a bigger mistake to reject \nthis agreement. If you reject this agreement, you send a message to \nChina: You ought to head for Central America as fast as you can because \nyou have an opportunity to get a toehold in America's backyard.\n  You are denying the opportunity to a lot of American exporters, \npeople in Oregon and other states who make those value-added products, \nthe high-skill, high-wage products and technologies to sell those goods \nin Central America.\n  I want colleagues to know I have met with a lot of those companies \nand the governments in Central America. I would like to see us bring \nthem together. There is no reason why energy production and \nconservation products made in our country, and computers and chips and \nhealth care technologies, should not be sold in Central America, when \nthe governments in that part of the world are prepared to make major \npurchases.\n  Let's do more to try to make sure those purchases come from American \nexporters rather then Chinese exporters. I urge colleagues to support \nthe agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nSenators be recognized in this order: Senator Roberts, 15 minutes, with \nthe time to be taken out of the time allocated to the Senator from \nIowa, Mr. Grassley; Senator Harkin, 20 minutes, with the time to be \ntaken out of the time allocated to the Senator from North Dakota; and \nSenator Graham, 15 minutes, with the time to be taken out of the time \nallocated to Senator Grassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, might we at this point find out what time \nremains of the three allocations of time on this bill? You can proceed \nwith the unanimous consent and then perhaps give us the time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 7 hours 7 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from Montana has 2 hours 50 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Two hours 50 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two hours 50 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 3 hours 52 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n\n[[Page S7661]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest for Roberts, 15 minutes; Harkin, 20 minutes; and Graham, 15 \nminutes?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kansas is recognized for 15 minutes under the \nprevious order.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, today I rise in support of the Central American and \nDominican Republic Free Trade Agreement called CAFTA. I also want to \nstate a word of caution in regards to an issue that is commensurate \nwith this vote; and that is the waning support for free trade in this \ncountry, more especially in farm country.\n  It was not long ago when the prospect of expanding our trading \nopportunities with our neighbors across the ocean--the 96 percent of \nthe rest of the world in terms of trade--was met with great optimism \nand urgency. I do not know of anybody who made a farm speech who did \nnot say: OK, point No. 2, point No. 3--in the laundry list of things \nthey were trying to get done in Washington--without involving trade and \nexpanding exports. Times have changed.\n  Today I think we are suffering from what I call ``trade fatigue.'' \nThat is to say, many times we oversell and we overestimate what is \ngoing to happen in regard to the expectations of a particular trade \nagreement. We oversell it. I know that many more times we overcriticize \nthem. As a result, in farm country, I think our producers of food and \nfiber are a little weary and a little wary of this animal we let out of \nthe chute called free trade.\n  There have to be better examples, specific examples, in regard to how \nour producers basically benefit from free trade during very challenging \ntimes in farm country--a time when we see a lot of industry \nconcentration going on and consolidation, not only in farm country but \nthroughout our entire economy.\n  Well, I am privileged to represent the State of Kansas where farm \nexports support over 47,000 jobs, both on the farm and in food \nprocessing and transportation. Farm exports from the State of Kansas \nare estimated at $3 billion, compromising one-third of all farm income. \nOur State is the Nation's top exporter of wheat and the second largest \nbeef exporter, both of which rely heavily on increased market access. \nIn short, an opportunity such as CAFTA is going to be essential for \nKansas.\n  But in my hometown of Dodge City, and in the rest of farm country, \nyou hear the discussion of trade and exports, and there is some \nreservation, not expectation. I do not think it is isolationism. I do \nnot think it is protectionism. Too many times farm organizations and \ncommodity groups are looking out for their own commodity interest \ninstead of the big picture, which involves opportunity for all American \nfarmers and businesses.\n  Perhaps more importantly, this is an issue of national security and \nstability, just south of our border as well. Let me touch on that.\n  Our country has benefitted from trade agreements with Chile, \nAustralia, Canada, and Mexico. Since NAFTA was signed--you do not get \nthe specific instances of this in the press; you always get the \ninstances of somebody who has suffered economically or seen their job \noutsourced or whatever--but basically, these Kansas exports to Canada \nand Mexico combined have increased by more than 120 percent. In the \nfirst year of the Chilean Free Trade Agreement, our Kansas exports to \nChile actually grew by more than 9 percent.\n  CAFTA will build on this trend by securing 44 million new consumers. \nUnder the agreement, half of the current U.S. farm exports to CAFTA \ncountries will become duty free immediately. This includes high-quality \ncuts of beef and cotton and wheat and soybeans--major commodities.\n  Under the existing World Trade Organization commitments and tariff \npreferences, most exports under CAFTA countries already enter the U.S. \nduty free. However, U.S. exports could face potential tariffs of up to \n250 percent in the case of beef. Despite these tariffs, why, our \nproducers in Kansas exported to CAFTA countries a total of $23 million \nlast year.\n\n  Earlier this month, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that our Nation's \ninternational trade deficit measured $57 billion. That was a $4 billion \nincrease from previous reporting. As we face the growing competition in \nglobal agriculture, it is more important than ever to secure duty-free \nrates in these countries.\n  Now I want to touch on this business of security just south of our \ncountry. As chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and as a member of \nthe Armed Services Committee, I must stress this agreement is not only \nabout expanding market access. We are talking about stability, \nstability within these countries, and our own national security. \nSpecifically, I am talking about the big issues of immigration, drug \ntrafficking, and energy.\n  If you put in Mexico and Venezuela, for instance, albeit they are \nadjacent to the CAFTA countries, we are talking about 23 percent of our \nenergy supply. I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that without \nthis trade agreement we run the risk of these countries falling prey to \nothers who have far less interest in democracy and stability than in \nmanipulation and power within these countries. I do not want to go back \nto the days of the 1980s. I do not want to go back to the Nicaraguan \nsituation and Danny Ortega. That is not in the best interests of these \ncountries in the region, and it certainly is not in the best interests \nof our national security.\n  So given this reality, it is difficult to understand how the \ninterests of one commodity--one commodity; and I am talking about \nsugar--has largely outweighed the potential for regional stability in \nCAFTA countries. In the past, whether in trade agreements or trade \ndisputes, whether it be in farm bills or budget reconciliations, our \ncommodity and producer groups sank or swam together. We either hung \nseparately or we basically tried to hang together.\n  But today that is not the case. And, I am not trying to pick on the \nsugar industry or the sugar representatives or the hard-pressed sugar \nproducers in the United States. It is just that I am terribly concerned \nthat instead of ``one for all and all for one,'' we have ``all for one \nand one for one.'' And that is not right in regards to how we approach \nthis from the standpoint of the agriculture interests in this country.\n  Sugar is already under one of the most protected U.S. agricultural \nprograms. In fact, when compared to the rest of the world, our \nproducers enjoy the highest world price for their product. I know about \ntheir cost inputs. I know about the difficulty, but my previous \nstatement is correct. In recent years, we have journeyed down a \ndangerous road in our negotiations with the Australian Free Trade \nAgreement and now with CAFTA, by allowing the singular interests of one \ncommodity to dictate the livelihood of a comprehensive and well-\nintended agreement. I do not think it is right for one commodity to \ndictate in regard to their self-interests to the detriment of other \ninterests in agriculture.\n  I remember the whole-herd dairy buyout, which pretty well ruined the \nentire beef industry. I do not want to go down that road again. I think \nthis is an example of that case.\n  Under CAFTA, during the first year of the agreement, allowable sugar \nimports will amount to only a little more than one day's U.S. \nproduction--one day. The Secretary of Agriculture pulls out of his \npocket two sugar packets and says that is what every consumer will have \nin extra supply in regard to the CAFTA agreement. Despite the nominal \nprojected effect on the U.S. sugar prices and production, our domestic \nsugar industry has demanded that they go unharmed by this and, \nplausibly, by any other trade agreement.\n  Despite efforts by the administration and others to try to reach some \naccommodation, many in this Congress support the sugar industry--and I \nhave as well. As chairman of the House Agriculture Committee during \n1996 and through six farm bills, I tried to be helpful to the sugar \nindustry. Every time we have a reconciliation bill, every time we have \nan appropriations bill, every time we have any votes on a farm bill, we \nhave tried to be of help to the sugar industry. Usually those votes are \nvery close, by two votes, four votes, five votes in the House of \nRepresentatives, and the same happens in the Senate. So you stand up \nand say: OK, let's really try to stay together in regard to\n\n[[Page S7662]]\n\nthe agricultural lobby and be fair to our producers nationwide, nobody \nsingled out. I am saying to the sugar industry, you may win this \nbattle, but you may also lose the war.\n  Sugar's insistence upon receiving special treatment makes it very \nlikely that the rest of agriculture, which overwhelmingly supports \nCAFTA, may opt not to participate in sugar's defense the next time that \nprogram faces a WTO challenge, budget reconciliation measure, and the \nendless amendments to end sugar's support program during the next farm \nbill. Let that warning be heard.\n  Some of my colleagues have expressed their concern--we just heard \nSenator Wyden, the distinguished Senator from Oregon--in regard to \nlabor and human rights standards in the CAFTA countries, arguing the \nagreement does not set strict enough standards in these areas. I am \nconcerned about the environmental concerns in these countries and the \nlabor concerns in regard to these countries and the human rights \nstandards, but trade agreements are not the appropriate forum for \naddressing these issues. Basically the country will say: Thank you very \nmuch. We are a sovereign country. We are not going to trade with the \nUnited States. We will trade with somebody else. We will address these \nproblems on our own. It is a little bit impervious in regard to that \nconcern.\n  I don't think we can expect these countries to establish and value \nthe same high labor standards we have overnight. Rather, we should \nencourage and facilitate the emergence of such standards.\n  Today the most important question is not what happens if we approve \nCAFTA but, rather, what would happen if we don't pass this agreement. \nOnly an ocean away, China is aggressively pursuing opportunities to \ncompete in both the high tech and production agricultural sectors. We \nhave only gotten a glimpse of the economic capability and resources of \nthis country. Furthermore, we face additional and continued threats and \nallegations from the WTO in regards to our international food aid and \nexport programs. I am talking about our food aid and export programs. \nThe recent cotton case brought by Brazil is one of the most serious \nagriculture trade disputes we have ever faced. And farm country has not \nawakened to this challenge. The Senate has not awakened to it. The \nramifications of this decision in this case are far-reaching and could \npotentially affect every section of our farm export programs.\n  If we fail to approve CAFTA, we stand to lose credibility in these \nnegotiations and, in turn, the ability to aptly protect the food aid \nprograms and the development assistance that are essential in our war \nagainst terror and our efforts to prevent children in the Sudan from \ngoing hungry.\n  We have not come this far to take one step forward in the WTO and, \nwith our other bilateral trade negotiations, to take two steps backward \nby failing to approve CAFTA. If we do not approve CAFTA, I don't know \nwhat we do with the Free Trade in Americas Act. I don't know what we do \nas we go into the WTO negotiations facing the Brazil challenge. I don't \nknow what we do in the next farm bill in regard to how we structure the \nfarm bill if we do not rely on trade and exports, at least to the \nrealistic degree that we should. What do you do? Do you write the farm \nbill and say: Go back to your domestic production and then pay a higher \nsubsidy for which we do not have the budget dollars? I don't think so.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this agreement. It is in the best \ninterest of the United States, not only on behalf of agriculture and \nall the other business activities that will benefit from the agreement, \nbut also from a security standpoint as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIowa is recognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as the Senate debates the Central American \nFree Trade Agreement implementing legislation today, we know that it \nhas been more than 13 months since the United States and its six \npartner countries in Central American and the Dominican Republic \nformally signed the agreement. So what has taken so long? The reason I \nthink for the long delay, obviously, is that supporters have had a hard \ntime selling this agreement to the American people. The supposed \nbenefits are murky, in the distance, while the flaws are all too \nobvious. This is a shame because we could have a much better agreement \nthat would have won broad bipartisan support.\n  I have evaluated CAFTA with a genuinely open mind, having supported \nmost major trade agreements during my three decades in Congress. I have \nno philosophical or ideological bias for or against trade. Far from it. \nI take a strictly pragmatic approach, and generally I am in favor of \ntrade. But that same pragmatism tells me that it is folly to load all \nof our economic and diplomatic hopes on the slender back of inadequate \ntrade agreements.\n  As has been my practice with past trade agreements, I have carefully \nweighed the prospective advantages and disadvantages of CAFTA. Under \nthe fast-track procedure, our only option is to vote up or down. And \nlate last evening, after thoroughly looking at this, I finally had to \ncome to the conclusion that the problems with CAFTA, as we have it \nbefore us, clearly outweigh the very small benefits. On balance, the \nfacts and reasons against CAFTA are significantly stronger than the \narguments for it. Therefore, I must vote no on this implementing \nlegislation today.\n  As one would expect, proponents of CAFTA have presented a glowing \npicture of the agreement's benefits, but there has been an awful lot of \noverselling, in some cases outright exaggeration about how important \nthis agreement really is. Let's take agriculture, for example. On \npaper, CAFTA appears to offer opportunities for some U.S. farmers and \nnegatives for others, and the magnitude of these pluses and minuses is \npart of the debate. But while in theory agriculture should benefit \noverall, the projected benefits are strikingly modest, and they come \nmany years in the future.\n  Economists at the American Farm Bureau Federation estimate that U.S. \nagricultural exports would increase by about $1.5 billion a year when \nthe agreement is fully effective. That is 15 to 18 years from now. So \nif we assume an average annual inflation rate of about 2.3 percent, \nthat $1.5 billion increase by 2024 would be only about $930 million in \ntoday's dollars. That is about 1.5 percent of our total agricultural \nexports. So the benefits 15 to 18 years from now, calculated in today's \ndollars, are relatively small.\n  There is one other aspect to this. The International Trade Commission \nof the U.S. Government also had a study. It showed that they predicted \na $100 million decline in net annual exports from the United States to \nthe six partner countries as a result of CAFTA. So we get a small 1.5-\npercent increase in agriculture in 2024. But the International Trade \nCommission says we are going to have a $100 million decline in net \nannual exports from the United States.\n  Whether CAFTA's modest predicted benefits actually materialize is in \ndispute. Average per capita income in CAFTA countries is about $1,800 a \nyear. Are they going to become good customers? About a third of the \npopulation there lives on $2 a day or less. How are they going to buy a \nNew York strip steak or one of our delicious Iowa pork chops that some \nare so optimistic that we are going to export to those countries?\n  Potential for big gains is further limited by the fact that we \nalready dominate trade in those countries. In 2003, we accounted for \nabout 45 percent of all merchandise exports to the region. The benefits \nthat CAFTA backers optimistically predict are based on the assumption \nthat CAFTA will spur economic growth in these generally poor and small \ncountries. Right now, under existing trade preference programs, these \nsix countries already face zero tariffs on 80 percent of the goods they \nship to the United States, meaning that additional tariff reductions \nwill not spur significant economic growth in those countries. Many are \nskeptical of these claims about CAFTA and the economic growth in \nCentral American countries.\n  One of the reasons that has moved me to the ``no'' column on this is, \nI recently had a meeting in my office with a Catholic bishop, Bishop \nAlvaro Ramazzini, a senior Catholic prelate in Guatemala, who came to \nmy office to lobby against CAFTA. I spent time with him. I quizzed him \nabout it. I\n\n[[Page S7663]]\n\nwanted to know why he felt so strongly that CAFTA would not be in the \nbest interest of his parishioners. He said that he and other advocates \nfor the poor in Central America opposed CAFTA because its benefits \nwould go mostly to the economic elites and it would deepen the \ndisparity between rich and poor. So if, as the bishop says, CAFTA would \nnot raise incomes broadly for Central America's people, it won't help \nthem and it won't help us.\n  The previous speaker mentioned something about Daniel Ortega. Talk \nabout a ghost out of the past. I am talking about the Catholic bishop \nof Guatemala who came to this country a few months ago to tell us that \nthis would not be in the best interest of his small farmers, his \ncampesinos, and their families. He said it would drive them off their \nfarms and push them more into cities where there is no work for them.\n  CAFTA will make it harder for U.S. workers, farmers, and businesses \nto succeed in the increasingly competitive global economy. We can \ncompete on a truly level playing field. It is not fair competition if \nother countries allow their manufacturers or farms to disregard \ninternationally recognized labor rights and child labor protections or \nif those countries have lax or nonexistent environmental rules. This \nCAFTA does virtually nothing to deal effectively with the competitive \nissues relating to labor and environmental standards. For labor, the \ninternationally recognized rights are pretty basic, such as the right \nof association and bargaining, prohibition of forced or prison labor, \nand protection of children from working at young ages or in hazardous \nor exploitative jobs. I have worked for many years in the effort to \neliminate abusive child labor around the world. It is morally wrong, \nand it leads to all kinds of other injustices and inequalities.\n  Reports from our own Department of State and the International Labor \nOrganization have documented labor rights and child labor problems \nthroughout the six countries of CAFTA. Just yesterday morning, we \nlearned that our U.S. Department of Labor had been hiding from us a \nreport it commissioned that found serious labor violations in the \ncountries that signed CAFTA. Right now--this is what is important--\nunder current U.S. law, if one of those CAFTA countries condones \nabusive child labor or other violations of internationally recognized \nlabor rights, we can keep that country from shipping goods to us at low \ntariff rates. In other words, our U.S. trade law right now allows us to \nenforce international labor rights. This came about because in 2000, I \nworked with then-Senator Jesse Helms to modify our Generalized System \nof Preferences Program, the GSP Program, so that countries that allow \nabusive child labor are ineligible to ship products to the United \nStates at low GSP tariffs.\n  The other provision is in the Caribbean Basin Initiative. It allows \nour Government to deny the benefit of lower CBI tariffs to enforce the \nbroader set of internationally recognized labor rights; that is, if a \ncountry is tolerating violations of international labor rights, we can \ntake action so that goods from that country coming into the United \nStates are subject to a higher tariff than is applicable to goods from \nother CBI countries. In fact, we have taken action under that CBI \nprovision against violations of international labor rights.\n  So right now, as pertains to these CAFTA countries, we have strong \nprovisions in law to protect against child labor and internationally \nrecognized labor rights. Guess what. CAFTA would supersede and abolish \nboth of these labor rights enforcement features of our current U.S. law \nwith respect to the six other CAFTA countries. Talk about a giant step \nbackward. Five years ago, this Congress added--and the President signed \nit into law--provisions that protect children, protect people who want \nto organize and bargain collectively, protect against forced or prison \nlabor in these countries. Guess what. CAFTA does away with it.\n  What is happening? I thought we were supposed to be progressing in \nthe world, in terms of recognizing basic, fundamental human rights. \nWhat could be more fundamental than the human right of children not to \nbe exploited and find themselves in abusive types of labor situations \nand forced to work? Yet, CAFTA removes these countries from being \ncovered by those laws. It says: Fine, if one of these countries were to \nuse kids working in places where it would be in violation of \ninternationally recognized human rights labor standards, we cannot do a \nthing about it--nothing. Today we could. When CAFTA passes and goes \ninto effect, we won't. Not too many people know that. I guess that is \nthe major reason why I am opposing this CAFTA--the giant step it takes \nbackward in protecting against abusive child labor.\n  Under this bill, we have no ability to hold a CAFTA country to \ninternationally recognized labor rights and child labor protections if \nits own laws are weaker than the international standard. So we are \nfaced with a contradiction. One of the big reasons that I keep hearing \nto support CAFTA is to boost economic and social progress in these \ncountries. Yet, we are taking a giant step backward in our ability to \npress our CAFTA trading partners to combat abusive child labor \npractices and other violations of internationally recognized labor \nrights.\n  Elsewhere, this administration insists on social and political reform \nas a condition for allocating aid to developing countries. For example, \neligibility standards for the Millennium Challenge Accounts require \nprogress on social and political fronts. Why should we jettison such \nrequirements under CAFTA? Should free trade come at the cost of \nprogress in combating abusive child labor practices? Of course not. It \nis not acceptable for me, and it should not be for any of us. That is \nthe problem with the bill before us.\n  Again, if the President would have worked with us and consulted with \nus in good faith and said we are going to keep these provisions that we \nput into law in 2000 and the provisions we put in the Caribbean Basin \nInitiative to protect child labor, well, you've got my vote. But they \ndidn't do that. In discussions with U.S. negotiators before the text \nwas completed on CAFTA, Members and staff made clear our concerns about \nall these issues. Unfortunately, little or no effort was made to \naddress those concerns until after the agreement was completed and the \nWhite House recognized it might fall short of the necessary votes. At \nthat point, it was too late; the final agreement had been negotiated.\n  Mr. President, from a broader view, the modest benefits that we are \ntheoretically promised 15 years from now under CAFTA simply do not \noffset the harm it will do to kids and poor people and small farmers in \nthose countries. The modest benefits do not compensate for what is \ngoing to happen if our small manufacturers in this country rush down \nthere for cheaper labor, lower environmental standards, make products \ndown there, pay people low wages, don't give them decent benefits, \ndon't recognize appropriate labor standards, use children as workers, \ndump the refuse out in the environment, and then ship the products back \nto the United States. That is what we are voting on here.\n  Mr. President, I don't consider this agreement worthy of passage. \nModest benefits, 15 years from now, may or may not be realized. But we \nare taking a giant step backward in terms of protecting labor rights \nand child labor and the environment. For that reason, I believe this \nCAFTA bill, as it is written, is a big mistake. I do not oppose all \nfree-trade agreements with Central America. But for these reasons, I \noppose this one. We can, and we should, do better for our people, our \nfarmers, our small manufacturers but also for the poor people of \nCentral America and the campesinos there who need to have their \nstandard of living raised, not have their children working and not \ngoing to school, not have refuse dumped into the environment which \nthreatens their health in the future. That is why this is unfair. That \nis why it ought to be defeated. We ought to have a better trade \nagreement than this one.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, Senator Graham was \nto be recognized.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I do not see Senator Graham here. I ask \nunanimous consent that the order be vitiated, and I will yield to him \nwhen he arrives.\n\n[[Page S7664]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in a narrow sense, the Senate today is \nconsidering the free-trade agreement with five Central American \ncountries and the Dominican Republic, but in a larger sense, the Senate \nis debating how the United States can remain competitive. In a larger \nsense, the Senate is debating how America can continue to earn $37,000 \nper person, or more, when there are hundreds of millions of people in \nChina who earn $1,100 per person a year.\n  Little agreements like that before us today cannot be the answer. It \nmay be a partial answer but, frankly, in the larger scheme of things, \nit is really much less important than the central question facing \nAmerica today with respect to economic competitiveness. The agreement \nbefore us today will not open enough markets for American exports to \nmake that much of a difference. That is clear.\n  No, we need a much more aggressive strategy. On trade policy, we need \nto try to negotiate bigger agreements--not these small ones, but bigger \nones that have much greater commercial value. We need to open \nnegotiations with trading partners who represent a larger share of \nAmerican trade. There are many examples. We are not doing that, but we \nshould and we must. Time is ticking by. We need to give renewed \nemphasis to multilateral agreements like the Doha Round. And we need to \ndo a better job enforcing the trade agreements we have already entered \ninto.\n  Each Senator can list many agreements the United States has entered \ninto with other countries, but the other countries, by and large, have \nnot lived up to the agreements. The most glaring example is \nintellectual property. We know who the countries are that have not \nlived up to their obligations to honor intellectual property rights \nand, as a result, American companies are losing billions of dollars a \nyear. The United States must be much more aggressive in enforcing those \nagreements.\n  We need to improve America's education. We need to ensure that we can \nremain more productive than workers in other countries. That too is \nclear. We need to give teachers the recognition and compensation they \nneed to ensure that they can help to educate the most productive \nworkers in the world. We need to increase the incentives for students \nto study the basics--math, science, engineering. Why? So that American \nstudents can remain the source of tomorrow's new ideas. We pride \nourselves--we have in the last several decades--in being the country \nthat is the most innovative and creative, and that has been true. We \nalso know that others are catching up. There is no reason why people in \nother countries cannot be as creative and as innovative as Americans. \nThere is no reason--none. They are people, and we are people. They are \nhuman beings, as we are. Their brains are the same as our brains. It \nreally comes down to who is the most educated, the most aggressive, who \nworks the hardest, and who works better together. And people in other \ncountries are becoming very well educated, very aggressive. They are \nhungry. They are working closely together, and they are investing in \nareas to increase their productivity. They are catching up very \nquickly.\n  We also need to increase our national savings. America has an abysmal \nnational savings history. It will not be much longer, if that trend \ncontinues, when we are going to face very dire economic consequences. \nWe have to do something about that; we are not. Our private savings \nrates are zero. Americans do not save. They spend. We spend. We like to \nbuy refrigerators, cars, boats, clothes. We consume; we do not save. \nWith housing prices so high these days, what do we do? We borrow \nagainst the equity in that house. What do we do with the borrowing? We \nspend. To make matters worse, the Federal Government not only has a \nsavings rate of zero, it has a dissavings rate, huge deficits and \ndebts.\n  We cannot continue like this. That is one part of the agenda that we \nmust work on if we are going to address American competitiveness. This \nagreement before us is an important debate, but it is not the real \ndebate. It is an important issue, but it is not the real issue. It is \nonly a small part of the central issue we should be facing. We need to \nexpand incentives for employees to save through work, for example. \nThere is no glamor or rocket science in this. It doesn't make the \nevening news. That is one reason we don't do it because we are people \nwith such a short attention span. It is the instant view--what is now--\nand not what can be 10, 15 years from now. We need to expand incentives \nfor employees to save through work, which is a small step in the right \ndirection to increase savings. We need to stop running massive Federal \nbudget deficits because they are reductions in national savings.\n  We need to address our outsized and very expensive health care \nsystem. We spend twice as much on health care per capita than the next \nhighest country. I ask, are we twice as healthy? Of course not. We are \nnot twice as healthy. Why do we spend twice as much? A lot of reasons. \nIt is very complex, but we do. What is the consequence of that? One \nconsequence, clearly, is that our companies are having a very difficult \ntime competing--particularly our larger, older companies. They have \nextremely high health care costs, legacy costs to employees and \nretirees. Their competitors don't have them nearly that high.\n  I have talked to CEOs of large companies who say they are thinking of \nlocating their plants in other countries largely because the health \ncare costs for those employees in those countries is much lower and so \nthey can compete.\n  I remind my colleagues, this is an incredibly competitive world. It \nis incredibly competitive, and just the slightest margins make a \ndifference. We have to, therefore, be incredibly competitive ourselves. \nIt is teamwork. It is Americans working together. We are not working \ntogether.\n  Look at this debate. This debate is pretty sterile. One side \nexaggerates; the other side exaggerates. We are not talking with each \nother. We are not focusing on the real problem. I hope in future days, \nweeks, and months we start to wake up and not get so involved with the \nperiphery. CAFTA is not really the periphery, but it is not far from \nthe periphery. We should, rather, focus on the central questions.\n  We also need to foster much greater use of information technologies \nin health care. Did you know, Mr. President, that the equivalent of two \n747s crashing every day is the number of Americans who die on account \nof medical errors? Between 58,000 and 98,000 people a year in America \ndie because of medical errors. It is not true in other countries. It is \nin America. Much better information technology in the health care \nindustry will reap immense benefits.\n  What is one of the reasons we do not invest in IT in America in \nhealth care? It is pretty simple. It is reimbursement. Hospitals will \nspend thousands of dollars on CAT scans and on PET scans, the latest \ntechnologies. Why? Because the Medicare program reimburses them for \nthose machines. It is also competition, keeping up with the Joneses. \nWhat is the Medicare DRG for IT? There isn't one. We have a system that \nreimburses and sets up incentives that discourages development of IT in \nhealth care, which we have to have, which will reduce medical errors. \nIt will have all kinds of positive consequences if we get a much better \nIT system. We have to get going in this country. We are behind the \neight ball.\n  In sum, to be competitive, we need to have a plan. This is a bit \nsimplistic, but I think it somewhat makes the point. I mentioned \nearlier how competitive this world is. We all know that. If we put two \nteams on the playing field--by the way, I am an American. I am for the \nAmerican team. I do not want to denigrate other people or hurt other \npeople. The ideal is that everybody around the world is doing extremely \nwell. I am an American. I am on the American team. I want America to do \nwell.\n  If we put two teams out on the playing field--let's take football. \nOne team has a quarterback, blocking backs, the linemen, they have a \ncoach, a play, a plan. That is one team. The other team has 11 players \non the field. One person wants to do one thing; he wants to carry the \nball. Someone else says: I want to carry the ball. No, I want to kick. \nNo plan, no coach. They are out doing their own thing. They are \nentrepreneurial. It is free competition,\n\n[[Page S7665]]\n\ngoing in their own directions, doing what they want to do.\n  Which team wins? I grant you, that is simplistic. That is very \nsimplistic, but I think it does make a point.\n  Other countries have plans. I can name them: China. China has a plan. \nJapan has a plan. I think some European countries do; I am not sure. I \ndo not know how much better organized they are, but the main point is \nwe do not have a plan. I am not asking for a centralized plan where \nsomebody decides what everybody does, but I am asking for much greater \ncooperation, much more working together so that Americans can compete.\n  I go back to what I said earlier. So much of this is education. It is \nvalue added. We need to add value up here at all levels--K through 12, \ncontinuing education, vo-tech, and so forth. Ultimately, that is where \nit is at--education. There is nothing else but education--math, \nscience, and other areas.\n  I see the Presiding Officer taking notes. I can see he is listening \nto me. I can tell I am making some points that maybe make sense and he \nis going to do something about it. I appreciate that. I wish others \nwould, too.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following Senators be \nthe next recognized for debate: I see Senator Graham is in the Chamber. \nHe will have 15 minutes, and that time will be taken out of the time \nallocated to Senator Grassley. Senator Conrad of North Dakota wants 15 \nminutes, and his time will be taken out of the time allocated to \nSenator Dorgan. Senator Thomas will be recognized for 15 minutes, and \nhis time will be taken out of the time allocated to Senator Grassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I believe my time should come from Senator \nDorgan because I oppose the bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I do not know that it matters, Mr. President. For the \nsake of moving along, we will stick with what we have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the order, the Senator from South Carolina is recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank Senator Baucus. Senator Baucus \nmade some very telling points that I think we should all listen to in \ntrying to get a game plan.\n  I rise today as a ``no'' vote to CAFTA. I do not think that surprises \nmany people. The point I am trying to make with my vote is many of the \nthings being said about the benefits of CAFTA are very true. I think it \nwill help the Central American countries, the CAFTA nations that are \ntrying to emerge as democracies in some regard. There will be some \nbenefit to the economy. There is no doubt there is some benefit in any \ntrade agreement. But my concern is of a geopolitical concern dealing \nwith China.\n  The trade agreement we negotiated with Central America, the CAFTA \nagreement, has many loopholes that China will exploit, just as they \nhave exploited every other trade agreement we have done. The cumulative \neffect of China on our trading situation throughout the world and our \nrelationship is becoming devastating.\n  In April, the U.S. trade deficit was $62.2 billion. With China it \ngrows $7.83 billion per month. Since we gave PNTR status to China in \n2001, the trade deficit with China has gone from $100 billion to $162 \nbillion. It is 47 percent greater this year than it was last year.\n  It has been devastating to the textile and other industries. During \nthe first quarter of 2005, imports from China have grown 1,250 percent \nfor cotton knit shirts and blouses, 1,500 percent for cotton trousers, \nand 300 percent for cotton and manmade underwear.\n  The bottom line is products coming in from China are not conforming \nwith international trade regimes. They are not conforming with the \nstandards we would like to see throughout the world.\n  The bottom line is they are cheap. They take advantage of trade \nagreements negotiated--NAFTA and eventually CAFTA--through \ntransshipments. What is going to happen very clearly, to me, is Chinese \ncompanies will move into the CAFTA. They will take material made in \nChina with slave-wage conditions, horrible conditions, throw a label on \nit as if it were made in CAFTA, and get it into our country in a way \nthey could not do directly from China. It is called transshipment.\n  Particularly, this agreement is poorly drafted. It does not realize \nexactly with whom we are dealing. The combined effect of the CAFTA \nnations, in terms of a market for us, is the size of San Diego. So \nthose who sell this agreement as a major way to create export \nopportunities for America I think are not realistic. If you took all \nthe combined countries' economic buying power, it is the size of San \nDiego, and that is not going to fuel the American economy.\n  We are going to see goods from the CAFTA nations cheaper than we can \nproduce here. It is going to have an effect on manufacturing in my \nState and other States that will be part of an overall trend that is \ngetting to be more than we can bear.\n  China will take advantage of this. It has many loopholes for China. \nThe rule of origin provisions requiring a yarn for arrangement is only \nfor the essential fabric of the garment. What that means in English is \nwe are trying to lock down the fabric and the yarn to be tied to our \ncountry, to give a benefit to our textile manufacturers, and that is a \ngood thing. That helps us get into that market.\n  It does not deal with pockets, collars, and nonvisible jacket liners. \nThey are exempt from that yarn for arrangement. There is a side deal \nhaving to do with pockets to address what will happen in my State. I \nhave about 500 to 600 workers who make pockets for garments. The \nChinese companies are going to put them out of business because the \npockets to be made in a CAFTA nation are not going to come from South \nCarolina or other places in the United States. They are eventually \ngoing to come from China because the pocket agreement, trying to \nprotect the pocket part of a garment, requires all six CAFTA countries \nto ratify it. That is just not realistic. It is not going to happen. So \nthere are going to be people in my State, unfortunately, if this gets \npassed, who are going to be put out of a job because China is going to \ncome into the CAFTA region and they are going to put American \nmanufacturing, when it comes to textile goods with regard to pockets, \nout of business.\n  There are other loopholes. The single transformation provision allows \nfor pajamas, boxer shorts, and bras to be imported into the U.S. duty \nfree regardless of origin so long as they are assembled in a CAFTA \ncountry. In other words, you can have all the material made in China \nfor these products and do the sewing in CAFTA, and they come into our \ncountry, and that is going to be devastating to Fruit of the Loom and \nother people who have come by to talk about it.\n  This agreement, like all other agreements I have voted for, except \nAustralia, which I thought was a pretty good deal for America, has \nmajor loopholes within it to allow China to take advantage of it even \nthough they are not party to it.\n\n  The problem we have with China and the way they manipulate their \ncurrency, the way they have no regard for intellectual property, the \nway they transship by cheating, sending goods from China into other \nregions of the world where we have existing trade agreements, is having \na cumulative effect.\n  We have lost 21.6 percent of the manufacturing jobs in South Carolina \nin the last 5 years. Some of it is due to modernization. Some of it is \ndue to factors beyond international trade. But a lot of it has to do \nwith international trade that is not being fairly policed.\n  We have a 6.5-percent unemployment rate in South Carolina. We are \nfifth in the Nation. Our State has a manufacturing-based economy. The \nside deals that are being touted for people in this agreement are going \nto be like most other side deals when it comes to agreements in the \nlast 15 years. Eighty-three percent of these agreements, according to a \nreport by Public Citizen, a watchdog group, were not kept, reversed, or \nbecame meaningless.\n  So my concern about CAFTA is my concern about trade in general. Until \nwe regulate and get buy-in by the Chinese to live within the family of \nnations when it comes to trading and doing business, every time we \nexpand an area of trade, it becomes another portal for China to enter \ninto our marketplace and to do things they could\n\n[[Page S7666]]\n\nnot do in a direct relationship with the United States.\n  They will be able to do things in the area of textiles in the CAFTA \ncountries they could not do directly with the United States. It is just \nnot going to be textiles. Eventually it is going to be other products.\n  The buying power of these nations, again, combined is the size of San \nDiego, but what will happen is the ability of China to exploit this \nagreement is going to be much larger than the buying power of San \nDiego.\n  I do believe that trade can help emerging democracies and that there \nis a logic to the idea the President is proposing for these emerging \ndemocracies for which we could create economic opportunity.\n  However, unfortunately, I believe the way this deal has been \nnegotiated, the way it will be implemented, and the way it will be \nexploited is not going to improve the democracies in Central America \nbecause they are going to lose jobs to China eventually. It is going to \nhurt the manufacturing base of this country, which is already in \njeopardy. That is why I will choose to vote no.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I will take a few minutes to talk about \nthe topic that is on our agenda today, the CAFTA trade agreement. \nCertainly, it is something in which all of us are interested. Trade \nagreements are very important, of course, and whether they fit or not \nthey are always there and we have to deal with them.\n  Frankly, I have been very involved in this, partly because sugar is \none of the products from my State and it is one of the things that has \nbeen a very controversial portion of this trade agreement.\n  Trade agreements are not easy. Whether we like it or not, trade moves \naround the world and so what we need to do is to find a way to make \nthat trade work as well as we can for ourselves and for others. \nSometimes I am a little disappointed. When we passed the free-trade \nagreement, I think we should have called it the fair-trade agreement. \nFree trade is not always the way things are.\n  There is a book called ``The World Is Flat,'' talking about how there \nis equality throughout the world, but it is changing. Well, it is \nchanging, but it has not all changed. There is a great deal of \ndifference between one country and another in terms of their economy, \nin terms of the way it works and whether one is getting paid $2 a day \nor $20 a day or $20 an hour.\n  So when one talks about free trade, one has to make sure that they \nrecognize the differences that are there. All I am saying is it is \ndifficult. Of course, we want to work with other countries. Part of the \nreason for having CAFTA before us is we are looking for relationships \nwith the Central American countries. That is a good idea.\n  We are looking at countries that are fairly undeveloped or newly \ndeveloped, certainly a different economy than we have here. Yet we want \nto strengthen those. I think over time, in terms of thinking about \ntrade, it is going to be important that this hemisphere be together and \nbe strong as we see things develop in Asia and other places around the \nworld. So it is important that we do this.\n  We are the largest Nation of purchases in the world. So we have some \nstrength to bargain and even though we need to be fair about it, we \nneed to exercise that muscle a little bit because we are in a position \nto do that. So it is a matter of coming up, hopefully, with fair trade \nand equality as much for everyone as we possibly can. It is not just a \nmatter of helping others.\n  There are other ways to help others. It is not just a matter of \nstrengthening other countries but having a relationship that is fair.\n  I mentioned sugar. Sugar is not the biggest industry in the world, \nbut it is an industry that is important to this country. It is an \nintegral part of our economy. It is a little unique. Agriculture is a \nbig thing in Wyoming, of course; mostly livestock, as one might \nimagine, in the open space and so on. In our agricultural economy, \nlivestock produces the most by a great deal. The second actually is hay \nand feed for livestock, but third in crops is sugar. So it is a \nrelatively large one for us.\n  Sugar is unique as a commodity. If one raises oats and something \nhappens to the price, they can raise barley or some other kind of \ngrain. That is not the case with sugar. With sugar, there is a high \ninvestment in particular equipment such as thinning equipment. They \nused to use Mexican workers mostly to go out with a hoe and thin sugar \nbeets. Well, they do not do that so much anymore. They use expensive \nequipment to do it. So it is a little different.\n  The second thing that is different about it is that the producers now \nalso are owners of the processing equipment. So in our State where we \nhave relatively little manufacturing, we have some sugar processing \nplants which are unique. It is about the only agricultural product in \nour State that is processed to the extent it is ready for the grocery \nstore shelf when it leaves our State. So even though, as the New York \nTimes, I think, erroneously reported that it was not very important, \nthere are lots of people hired in that industry who are not farmers, \nbut they are producers. So it is unique and it has been treated \nuniquely over time in the farm bill and other places.\n  So as one bargains into a trade agreement it is one of the things \nthat one really does not have much flexibility to work on.\n  Now, in regards to CAFTA, it is important that we deal with our \nneighbors in that part of the world. We need to work to have a \nrelationship there. They need to strengthen their economy. There is no \nquestion about that. That is a good thing. But it is a relatively small \nmarket, about half of what some of the larger cities would be in the \nUnited States. So we do need to work at it, but we need to understand \nthat it is not going to change the world in terms of what we are doing.\n\n  We have made some efforts to make it work, and I am willing to say to \nmy friends and others that several of us who are particularly \ninterested in this have worked with the sugar beet and sugar cane \ngrowers over the country and have had a number of meetings with them, \nhave listened to their issues and have worked with them before. We have \nalso worked very closely with the Secretary of Agriculture, and I want \nto commend him for his efforts to try to find some arrangements that \ncould make it better. We did, finally.\n  However, one of the strange things about this is that this trade \nagreement was signed about a year ago and was not brought up to the \nfloor until last week. So when we heard it was coming, I think, a week \nago today, we had the very first meeting with the Secretary, with some \ncongressional members who were interested, and the sugar people. There \nwas a great deal of discussion, as there should be, but no one was \nprepared to make decisions in that short time. So we tried to get back \ntogether again, work some over the weekend and be back again on Monday. \nLo and behold, here comes the bill to the Finance Committee, of which I \nam a member, before we even had our second meeting.\n  I tried to suggest we need a little more time and maybe we could work \nsomething out. Nevertheless, that is where it was. Part of our problem \nwas we have not had much time. I do again want to say the Secretary \ncame in with some ideas. He still has some ideas and they are good \nones. Our new trade ambassador, Rob Portman, is doing a great job. He \nhas done everything he could possibly do to make this workable. Of \ncourse, he had nothing to do with negotiating it in the first place, \nbut nevertheless both of those gentlemen have worked at it very hard. \nThere has not been time to do something.\n  The problem basically is that this sugar program has been one over \ntime that has been kind of measured in trying to hold its production to \nthe demand in the country. Currently, for example, there is lots of \nsugar being stored in Wyoming because production is over demand and our \nown sugar is not being put on the market because there is not enough \ncapacity for it now.\n  So the Secretary did agree that he could do some things until the \nnext\n\n[[Page S7667]]\n\nfarm bill comes up, which is 2 years from now, and I think he can. He \nmay have to use some CCC activities, exchange of one goods for another, \nto handle a relatively small amount of sugar that could come under this \npact. The problem is, with the sugar people and others, that it is \nsimply about a 2-year remedy. They need to look at something much \nfurther than that down the road.\n  I say to my colleagues, it is not just exactly the CAFTA agreement \nthat is of concern to us. It is also the fact that the NAFTA deal with \nMexico will expire in 2 years, presumably opening up the market there \nnot only for sugar but fructose and other things that could come here \nand could have a real impact on this fairly difficult to manage sugar \nindustry in our country. So we have to keep in mind we are not just \ntalking about CAFTA, we are talking about the impact that can come from \nthe changes that take place in NAFTA as well.\n  In addition, if we do something with CAFTA--and we are--then the next \nthing we are going to be looking at is other countries in Central \nAmerica, Ecuador, and Brazil--finally, Brazil, which is a big sugar \nproducer. So the precedent that is set with respect to sugar is one \nthat is very concerning to the sugar industry.\n  What are we going to do in the next immediate trade agreements? So \nthese things all go into it, and that is why a 2-year solution--even \nthough I really respect the fact that they tried to do something, we \nstill will work at it. We are not through trying to find a remedy, but \nit apparently cannot fit into this. So I do, again, want to \nrespectfully thank them for what they have done.\n  In any event, those are some of the problems that we have. Finally, \none other point, and that is that there seems to be, to me at least, a \nlittle lesson in this in terms of negotiating trade contracts. The \nauthority to do that comes from the Congress, asked for by the \nExecutive. As this is done, it seems to me we ought to have a little \nmore input into it before it is resolved.\n  What really happens in this case, at least practically, is that the \nnegotiators go on, and when their negotiation is finished they come to \nus with a package over which in this case, because some of the \ncountries had already agreed to it, there really was not any \nopportunity for changes in it when it came here. So I think we ought to \nhave more input. We could deal with this.\n  Two more points. One is how important this is. I got calls from the \nSecretary of Defense, from the Secretary of State, the President, and \nthe Vice President talking about not only is the trade aspect important \nbut also the relationships. I do not disagree with that, but I also \nhave to say that I met with the six Presidents on this and they said \nthe same thing, that this is more than just trade. I say to them and to \nmyself, Why do we let this relatively little thing hold it up? Why did \nwe not fix that knowing it was going to be a problem before we got \nthere?\n  I think we can do a better job in the future. I think we are going to \nbe faced with some more of these kinds of issues. We ought to be able \nto deal with them.\n  I am sorry we didn't have more time to perhaps come up with a remedy \nbefore we have to vote. I voted against it the second time in the \ncommittee. Unfortunately, I cannot support it this time. But I do hope \nwe can make some changes and deal with it in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that subsequent to \nthe remarks of the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, pursuant to \nthe existing agreement, Senator McCain be recognized to speak for 10 \nminutes and that time be taken from the time allocated to Senator \nGrassley; following Senator McCain, that Senator Dayton be recognized \nfor 15 minutes and that time to be taken from the time allocated to \nmyself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Baucus of Montana, for his leadership on this issue \nand for the outstanding work he does on the Finance Committee. I \nsometimes wonder if Senator Baucus ever gets any sleep at night, given \nthe number of things on his plate.\n  I thank my colleague from Wyoming, Senator Thomas, who has been a \ngreat ally in an attempt to protect an American industry from unfair \nprovisions that will decimate an industry that employs 146,000 people \nin this country. Senator Thomas has truly been a great advocate for the \npeople he represents on this issue. I very much appreciate working with \nhim.\n  I support free trade that opens markets and benefits American \nfarmers, businesses, and workers. I supported the Uruguay Round WTO \nagreement. I supported PNTR for China. I supported the Chile agreement, \nthe Singapore agreement, and the Morocco agreement. I did so because I \nbelieved those deals would benefit America and the people I represent \nin North Dakota. But I have come to the conclusion that our trade \npolicy is not working. It is not a free trade policy. It is not a fair \ntrade policy. Increasingly, it is a failed trade policy. This trade \npolicy is clearly off track.\n  I am beginning to wonder what are we thinking about in this town when \nwe look at the results of the trade policy followed by Republican and \nDemocratic administrations for an extended period of time. Here are the \nresults of this trade policy that is supposed to be such a great \nsuccess.\n  This chart shows the trade deficit year by year, going back to 1992. \nUp, up, and away it goes. The trade deficit now totals $617 billion in \n2004. For a very long time we never had a trade deficit above $100 \nbillion in a year. Now we are over $600 billion, and the latest numbers \nshow we are headed for $700 billion.\n  Colleagues, how can anybody call this a success? If this is a \nsuccess, what would be a failure?\n  We keep signing these agreements that are supposed to benefit the \ncountry and our position keeps getting worse. In the 10 years since the \nNorth American Free Trade Agreement took effect, a period in which we \nadopted the WTO agreement, China PNTR, free-trade agreements with \nChile, Singapore, Morocco, and Australia, our trade deficits have \nexploded.\n  Up until 10 years ago, our annual trade deficit had never exceeded \n$100 billion. When we look at these individual agreements, we see the \nsame story. Our trade agreement with Canada is one I opposed because I \nthought it would be injurious to my State, and indeed it has been. When \nwe passed the Canadian agreement, we had a $9 billion deficit with \nCanada in trade. After the great success of the Canadian Free Trade \nAgreement, is the deficit less or is it more? Those who say more are \nright--not just a little bit more but a lot more. The trade deficit \nwith Canada now is not the $9 billion we had when we entered into the \nagreement. Now it is $66 billion.\n  The same is true with Mexico. On Mexico, remember we were told what a \ngreat opportunity this was going to be. If we just signed up to it, our \ntrade relationship would flourish. At the time we entered into the \nagreement, we had a $2 billion trade surplus with Mexico. Let's go back \nand check the records. What is it now? Do we still have a trade surplus \nwith Mexico? No. Instead, we have a massive and growing deficit. We \nwent from a $2 billion trade surplus with Mexico to a $45 billion trade \ndeficit. And the very people who negotiated that agreement are now \ngoing all over town telling us that this next one is another great \nsuccess.\n  I told them it reminds me a little of the German general in World War \nII who said that he knew things were going bad for Germany when the \nvictories kept getting reported closer to Berlin. They had one great \nvictory after another, but the victories were all getting closer to \nBerlin, as our forces approached.\n\n  You know, I look at these great successes. My question is: How many \nmore of these great successes can we afford? What are we doing with \nthese rapidly growing trade deficits that mean we are borrowing \nhundreds of billions of dollars all over the world--over $600 billion \nfrom Japan, over $200 billion from China? We have even borrowed tens of \nbillions of dollars from South Korea. Does anybody think that makes our \ncountry stronger? I don't. I think it makes us weaker, more vulnerable.\n  What are we doing about it? We are not taking action to get China to \nstop\n\n[[Page S7668]]\n\nmanipulating its currency or stealing our intellectual property. That \nis not being done. We are not making progress to reopen the Japanese \nand Korean beef markets. That is not being done. We have not put a stop \nto Airbus's unfair subsidies. That is not being done. We have not put a \nstop to Mexico's unfair tax on beverages sweetened with corn. That is \nnot being done. We have not put a stop to Canada's unfair softwood \nlumber subsidies. That is not being done.\n  We have lost focus in these WTO talks, allowing them to drift in the \nwrong direction. Instead, the focus is on CAFTA. I love these CAFTA \ncountries. They are wonderful people. But the combined economic impact \nof these countries is equivalent to Columbus, OH. This is our priority \nwhen we have a trade deficit of this magnitude? What earthly sense does \nthis make?\n  When I look at this agreement--I am on the Finance Committee. I have \nlistened, at length, to our ambassadors and our negotiators, for whom I \nhave high regard. They are wonderful people. But they have come back \nwith a lousy agreement. They have gone all over America telling people \nthis is a great opportunity for the United States. They say 80 percent \nof Central American goods come tariff free into the United States, yet \nwe face tariff barriers when we export to their countries.\n  OK, I understand that. It sounds logical and reasonable that this \nmight be a good opportunity for us, if 80 percent of their goods come \ninto our country tariff free, but our goods face tariff barriers going \ninto their countries that would look like an opportunity. So when you \nanalyze it, I assumed this would mean great progress with respect to \ntrade deficits. Here is the report from our own International Trade \nCommission. This is not the U.N.'s trade commission. This isn't the \nCAFTA countries' trade commission. This is our own trade commission.\n  On this chart is the conclusion they come to. That is what happens to \nimports, to our imports from the CAFTA countries. This is what happens \nto our exports. The import number is bigger than the export number. In \nother words, our trade deficit with the region is getting bigger--and \nthey call this a success, when we already have record trade deficits? \nThis negotiating team goes down there, spends years and comes back and \nsays: Boy, have we done a great job. We have gotten an agreement that \nincreases the trade deficit with the region.\n  Hello. Is anybody paying attention? Not only does it make the trade \ndeficit with the region worse, here is what the International Trade \nCommission says it will do for our economy.\n  After listening to these speeches, listening to this testimony about \nhow this is a great opportunity for America, I assumed that when they \ndid the analysis of what it would mean for our economy, there would be \na big plus. Guess what. Here is what the International Trade Commission \nfound in their report. This is not my report. This is our own \nInternational Trade Commission report. They are the body that is \nresponsible for scorekeeping on these agreements. Here is what they \nconcluded. Here is what it would add to the gross domestic product of \nthe United States. I don't know if they can see that on television--\nthat is a zero. Any gain is so modest it doesn't even show up: Zero.\n  Zero is a very low number. That is what this agreement would do for \nthe U.S. economy, according to our own International Trade Commission--\nzero.\n  But you know what, it also poses a very big risk, at least to one \nindustry in this country. The industry that it puts at risk is the \ndomestic sugar industry. The domestic sugar industry employs 146,000 \npeople in this country. Apparently, our negotiators decided to just \nnegotiate that industry away. It is a $7 billion industry in the United \nStates; a $2 billion industry in the Red River Valley of North Dakota \nand Minnesota. These trade negotiators who brought back a plan that \nworsens the trade deficit with the region--that according to our own \nscorekeepers adds nothing to the economy of the United States, adds \nzero percent to the GDP--puts at risk an entire industry. It is no \nwonder that our country is in trouble. It is no wonder that we are \nrunning record trade deficits. It is no wonder that those record trade \ndeficits are getting even worse with a trade policy like this one.\n  For months, the USTR has been telling us: Don't worry. This is going \nto be a little trickle of sugar that is going to come in here. You \ndon't have to worry. It will be equivalent to a teaspoon. I wish it \nwere true. It is a glib description and characterization of what it \nwill do. The fact is, this would threaten an entire industry. Why? \nBecause, under this agreement, it would permit 109,000 metric tons of \nadditional sugar to come in. But that is not the only agreement that is \nbeing negotiated. If that same precedent would apply to the agreements \nwith South Africa, Thailand, and the Andean countries that are being \nnegotiated, you can see that would put us at over 500,000 tons of sugar \ncoming into this country, over and above what comes in now.\n  Every economist has said another 500,000 tons of sugar coming into \nthis country would collapse the price of sugar below the redemption \nprice, would unravel the sugar program and destroy the domestic sugar \nindustry.\n  That does not end the story. It is not just the agreements with South \nAfrica, Thailand, and the Andean countries that are a problem, it is \nthe previous agreement already entered into with Mexico under NAFTA.\n  For months, USDA has been saying we can absorb the CAFTA amount of \nsugar because there is a cushion between our WTO import obligations and \nthe farm bill trigger in the sugar program. But that cushion assumed \nMexico would not export significant amounts of sugar to the United \nStates. Guess what. That assumption was wrong. It is just not true. \nUSDA just revised its Mexican sugar projections, and Mexico now is \nprojected to have net surplus production of over 440,000 tons. That \nmeans under the NAFTA agreement, Mexico can send us another 250,000 \ntons of sugar duty free, completely eliminating the so-called cushion.\n  But it gets worse, much worse. Mexico's total exportable surplus this \nyear is now projected to be more than 900,000 metric tons. So they can \nsend us 250,000 duty free. But the story does not stop there. On top of \nthat, they can bring sugar in under what is called Tier 2, where they \npay a modest tariff, a tariff that makes it completely in their \ninterest to pay the small tariff on that second tier and bring in the \nsugar. That means another 650,000 metric tons of sugar above and beyond \nthe 250,000 tons of duty free sugar. Put it all together, and over \n1.151 metric tons of sugar comes into this country.\n  The point is this: When we put together the treaties being negotiated \nand we put together what USDA has just said will be the capability of \nMexico to send sugar into this country, we are way above the amount of \nsugar that would collapse the sugar industry in this country.\n  There has been a side deal offered to the sugar industry. I will talk \nfor just a minute about that deal. I have three words for those who \nthink the deal might solve the problems I just described: Don't be \nfooled. That is not a deal, it is a figleaf. Here is why. The Secretary \nof Agriculture has suggested to certain Members of Congress that he \nintends to limit sugar import to 1.53 million tons. He says that will \nensure the farm bill provision that turns off marketing allotments will \nnot be triggered.\n  Unfortunately, it does not work. Why not? First, the deal is only \ngood for 2 years. Second, it does not address the next farm bill or \nother trade agreements that are under negotiation or what happens in \n2008 when the NAFTA sugar protections are gone. In fact, the way this \nis structured, it almost guarantees that any additional access in \nfuture agreements will be backloaded into 2008.\n  My colleagues, that creates the potential for a perfect storm that \nwill leave the market badly oversupplied going into the next farm bill. \nDespite highly unpopular payments to foreigners to keep them from \nsending us sugar--what an idea that is. Want to start paying countries \nnot to send us stuff? Are we really going to do that? How long will \nthat last? How long will it last, that we pay countries not to send us \nstuff? It will make it virtually impossible to retain the program in \nits current form and threaten the existence of an entire industry in \nthis country that employs 146,000 people.\n\n[[Page S7669]]\n\n  I would be remiss if I did not make brief mention of the process that \nhas gotten us to this point--fast track. Fast track prevents Senators \nfrom having the right to amend. Instead, we conduct what is called a \nmock markup in the Finance Committee and in the Ways and Means \nCommittee in the House. We are supposed to be able to offer amendments \nthere that would change the contour and the direction of an \nimplementing bill as part of the Congress's constitutional \nresponsibility for foreign commerce. But it turns out amendments in the \nFinance Committee mean nothing.\n  Last year, when we considered the agreement with Australia, the \nFinance Committee set the precedent that if an amendment was adopted in \nthe so-called mock markup and a majority of the committee rejected the \nproposed implementing bill, the committee action could be ignored. I \ngot an amendment passed in the committee. It meant nothing.\n  This year, with the Wyden amendment, the committee has set the \nprecedent that when an amendment is adopted by the committee and the \nunderlying proposed implementing bill is then approved by the \ncommittee, that amendment, too, can be ignored. So now we have a \nsituation where this mock markup is a total mockery. It means nothing.\n  What has happened is Senators have given up their right to amend, and \nthey are left with nothing except the opportunity for a straight up-or-\ndown vote on the whole agreement. There is no opportunity to change the \nbill in committee or in the Senate. There is no other legislation that \nmoves through this Senate that can be dealt with in that way. That is \nnot how the process is supposed to work.\n  In conclusion, CAFTA is the wrong agreement at the wrong time. It has \nbeen pushed through a process that in itself is wrong. It adds $100 \nmillion to our trade deficit with the region, it puts a $7 billion \nindustry at risk, creates the likelihood of increased illegal \nimmigration, and it provides immeasurably small benefits for the \neconomy as a whole. It does not make much sense to me.\n  Here we have record trade deficits, the biggest they have ever been--\nand growing--and our negotiators go out and reach an agreement that \nmakes the trade deficit with the region in question worse and threatens \nan entire industry. They call it a success. Colleagues, I don't know \nhow many more of these successes we can afford.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nArizona is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will respond.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Does the Senator want more time? We can certainly find \nit.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I may ask for an additional 5.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I make that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Montana.\n  The Senator from North Dakota just stated, Who pays? I wonder, who \npays when my wife goes to the supermarket and pays 13 cents more for a \npound of sugar than she does and would if we had sugar from these \ncountries able to come into this country?\n  I am not in the business of producing or selling sugar, nor are many \nAmerican families. But there are a whole lot of American families who \nare in the business of buying products that have sugar in them. They \npay an exorbitantly higher price because of the protectionism that is \npracticed for the sugar industry. Since when can't the United States \ncompete on a level playing field?\n  The opposition to this is clearly one that is protectionist in \nnature--for an industry that, in my view, should be able to compete \nwith foreign producers. That is not what this debate really should be \nall about.\n  The stakes could hardly be higher--whether we import or export sugar, \nwhether the Central American Free Trade Agreement passes has \nimplications, whether the American farm exports will enter the \nDominican Republic duty free, or whether Guatemala will be able to \nincrease its textile protection.\n  By the way, I say to the Presiding Officer, if Guatemala is unable to \nexport its textiles into the United States, I don't believe it will be \nthe United States that would be producing textiles; I believe it will \nbe the Chinese and others.\n  I don't want to be hyperbolic, but I believe the vote we will soon \ntake on CAFTA is one of the most important that will be cast in the \nSenate this year. It is important because at stake is the future of \nCentral America in its economic and political dimensions and, hence, \nits security dimensions. It is important because it will determine \nwhether the free-trade agenda as laid out by President Bush proceeds \ntoward a successful Doha round of global trade talks or whether the \neffort will be stopped in its tracks. It is important because it will \nhelp determine whether the invigorating effects of free trade are \nexperienced in our country anew or whether the protectionists are able \nto erect their walls around us. It is important because it will show \nwhether a trade policy in America is determined by sugar growers, \nunions, and other special interests or whether it is determined by \nleaders who place at the forefront the interests of our Nation as a \nwhole.\n  A few years ago, we concluded a free-trade agreement with Chile. \nThere are certain facts that are available already. There were the \nusual arguments against it from the protectionists. In 2004, the first \nyear the agreement was effective, two-way trade increased by 33 \npercent. In the first 4 months of this year, it grew even faster--45 \npercent. Exports from the United States to Chile have risen at still \nhigher rates--nearly 35 percent in 2004 and almost 63 percent in the \nfirst quarter of this year. Preliminary numbers suggest that in 2005, \nU.S. exports to Chile may nearly double those recorded in 2003. That is \nwhat free trade is all about. That is based on the firm conviction that \nmost of us have that American products can compete with any in the \nworld.\n  Now, some can't. And that is terrible, and that is why we have trade \nadjustment assistance. When industries in the United States are \ndirectly affected by importation of products from other countries as a \nresult of trade agreements, we have trade adjustment assistance to \nprovide workers retraining to upgrade their ability to find other \nemployment. We need to do more in that area. But to somehow reject the \nbenefits of free trade because of the damage it may do--and I emphasize \n``may''--to certain industries is very shortsighted.\n  We see in Latin America today a growing skepticism about democracy--\nequated in the minds of many with austerity programs and lack of \nimprovement in the standard of living. Disturbing polls suggest that \ndiscontent with democracy is on the rise and that large percentages \nwould prefer a strong man who could improve living standards to a \ndemocratically elected leader who could not. CAFTA has the potential to \nillustrate the tangible benefits that come from democracy--free market \neconomics and partnership with the United States.\n  Let me give one concrete example. The apparel industry is critical in \nthe regional economy, accounting for $9 billion in exports each year. \nCAFTA will lift duty on most apparel and nonapparel goods, immediately \nbolstering an economic sector that represents tens of thousands of jobs \nin the region. The overall effect of this and other benefits would be \nto help lock in Central America's political and economic gains.\n  Let's consider what happens if CAFTA fails. Rejecting the pact would \nbe seen by our Central American partners as American disengagement from \na region important to our security. Thousands of apparel production \njobs would likely be lost as they move production facilities from \nCentral America to China, further exacerbating illegal immigration to \nthe United States. It would signal to the people of Central America \nthat the support of the United States for their freedom and prosperity \nis more rhetorical than real--even in a win-win situation for both \nsides. It would have a devastating effect on our effort to lower trade \nbarriers with other partners around the world and to push forward the \nDoha round of multilateral talks and put another notch in the post of \nthe special interests as they despoil the public good for their private \ngain.\n\n[[Page S7670]]\n\n  We need CAFTA. It is important to our economy. But it is also vital \nto our political security and humanitarian interests in Central \nAmerica.\n  The former President of Costa Rica, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, Oscar \nArias, speaking of CAFTA, said it represents ``an unparalleled \nopportunity to transform Central America into a dynamic economy, deeply \nintegrated with worldwide flows of trade and technology. We ask not for \ncharity, but enlightened self-interest from our northern neighbor.''\n  I am concerned about the state of democracy in Central America. I am \ndisturbed that in Nicaragua there is every likelihood we may see Daniel \nOrtega as the next President of that country. I am disturbed about the \nfailing economy and corruption that exists in El Salvador. I am \nconcerned about the continuing stagnation of the economies of Guatemala \nand Honduras.\n\n  Mr. President, if the countries of Central America continue to fail \neconomically, it will give rise to a situation that I do not want to \nrevisit. When I first came to the Senate, one of the overriding and \ncompelling challenges we faced was the rise of communism in Central \nAmerica, the influence of Castro in countries such as Nicaragua, the \nSandinistas in power, the effect it had on neighboring countries such \nas Honduras and El Salvador where there was an ongoing revolution. \nBillions of dollars of American taxpayers' dollars were poured into the \nregion in aiding El Salvador in combating others in the region.\n  One of the most emotional and unpleasant debates I have ever engaged \nin on the floor of this Senate had to do with aid to the Contras. I do \nnot want to revisit those days of the 1980s. I do not want to go back \nto a region that may be beset by corruption, anarchy, and possible \ninsurgencies.\n  We have another individual on the rise in our hemisphere, and his \nname is Chavez from Venezuela. He espouses policies and programs that I \nbelieve are not in the best interests of the people of Venezuela. And \nhe also, I believe, is having an influence in the region. If there is \nanything we need today, it is strong, viable economies in Central \nAmerica, so they can progress, so they can be strong, and they can \nagain be allies of the United States of America, not in a military \nfashion but in their advocacy for free and open societies, democracies, \nand places where people can raise their families in a situation of \nsecurity and peace.\n  I would like to mention again, if there is one lesson we have learned \nin the challenge of illegal immigration in this country, it is that if \npeople cannot feed themselves and their families where they are, they \nwill go to places where they think they can. If that means risking \ntheir lives crossing the Arizona-Sonora border, they will do so.\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge--I strongly urge--my colleagues to not \nonly understand the trade implications of this agreement but the \npolitical, social, as well as economic reasons for us to consider \nfavorably this agreement. The stakes are very high. I believe, with the \nleadership of this President and the bipartisan support of this body, \nwe will prevail.\n  I thank my colleague from Montana for allowing me this time. I yield \nback the remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nSenators be recognized next to speak after Senator Dayton: Senator \nKerry for 15 minutes, with the time taken from the time allocated to \nme; and then a Republican Senator not yet named, for 10 minutes, with \nthe time taken from the time allocated to Senator Grassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Minnesota is recognized \nfor 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, the \nleader of our representation on the Senate Finance Committee, the \nSenator from Montana, who has been outstanding in his guidance to all \nof us in our caucus and in standing up for the interests not only of \nhis own State but for the farmers and the workers and the people of \nMinnesota and America, as well as Montana. I thank him and I thank my \ncolleagues from North Dakota who also have been in the forefront of \nthis issue because they, like myself, represent people who are \nseriously at risk with this agreement.\n\n\n                   Tribute To The U.S. Capitol Police\n\n  Mr. President, before I address DR-CAFTA, I would like to take a \nmoment to pay tribute to the courageous men and women of the U.S. \nCapitol Police, who risked their lives yesterday, once again, to help \nevacuate the rest of us safely from the Capitol Complex.\n  This is, unfortunately, my fifth evacuation from the Capitol Complex, \nbeginning with September 11, 2001. This has been the best of them, if \nsuch a word can be applied to that race against time and the possible \nhorror that is involved.\n  But as my staff and I walked out of the Russell Senate Office \nBuilding's nearest door yesterday afternoon, which is directly across \nthe street from the Capitol, and hurried down the street away from the \nCapitol and the buildings, I saw several Capitol Police officers who \nstood directly exposed while they were calmly directing everyone else \nto safety. Other officers, I am told, remained once again at their \nposts inside or right outside the Capitol Building itself, helping \neveryone else to exit as quickly and safely as possible.\n  Had the plane yesterday been a hijacked jetliner, as it was on 9/11, \nit would--if it had not been shot down--have struck its target within 2 \nminutes of that evacuation alarm. It is questionable whether the \nevacuation of everyone in this complex would have been completed by \nthen. But it is almost certain that the Capitol Police officers--who \nwere doing their jobs heroically--would have still been at those posts, \nor very close to them, at that time. They kept themselves exposed to \nmortal danger to help their fellow citizens escape it. To all of them \nand to the other Senate staff who were involved, I say a heartfelt \nthank you.\n  It is unfortunate, Mr. President, that exceptional virtue--to place \nthe best interests of other Americans ahead of one's own--does not \napply to this trade agreement called DR-CAFTA. It is a wolf in sheep's \nclothing. It pretends to help American workers and American farmers, to \nprovide net gains to our domestic economic and employment growth, and \nalso to benefit the people in six neighboring countries, when, in fact, \nits driving motivations are higher corporate profits and capital gains \nby shifting American jobs and their production to those nearby \ncountries to exploit their low wages, scarce benefits, nonexistent \nprotections for workers, environments, local economies, and lower \ntransportation distances and costs than in China, India, Vietnam, and \nother places, to increase corporate profits and personal wealth at the \nexpense of other Americans and our national economic health.\n  This is the era of un-American capitalism, with great riches and no \ntaxes for the richest Americans and lost jobs, lower incomes, and less \nfinancial security for the rest of Americans.\n\n  Those are the facts from a decade of NAFTA, the unfortunate, \nunpleasant but actual real-world economic, employment, and trade facts \nresulting from 10 years of the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n  As with DR-CAFTA now, NAFTA's proponents prior to its enactment \npeddled lots of wonderful promises and projections: that NAFTA would \ncreate big economic gains for every country and almost everyone in \nthem; there would be increases in U.S. exports to NAFTA countries that \nwould exceed the increased imports from them; and that net gain would \nincrease domestic employment, domestic production, and domestic \nprosperity.\n  They turned out to be, unfortunately, domestic dilutions. The real \nnet effects from NAFTA have been exactly the opposite of those \npromotional fantasies. Over the last 10 years, U.S. imports from Mexico \nand Canada have increased by 10 times more than our exports to them, \nresulting in huge net losses, estimated to have cost over 900,000 \nAmerican jobs.\n  Many of them have been good-paying jobs, benefit-providing, company-\npension-offering and previously secure, reliable, lifetime jobs, the \nkind of jobs that create stable, secure, healthy, and prosperous \ncommunities all across America, throughout all of our 50 States--the \njobs that were the economic engines and the social foundations for the \nhard-working, productive,\n\n[[Page S7671]]\n\nand successful people who had those jobs for their families, who were--\nand still are--themselves the greatness of America.\n  But those ingredients of America's greatness--those jobs that support \nfamilies, provide security, provide health benefits, provide pensions, \nallow Americans to earn the American dream--they are being dissipated, \noutsourced, traded away for immediate profits and financial gains for a \nfew, at the expense of many more dislocated workers, destructed \nfamilies, damaged communities, destitute seniors, and deficit-plagued \nlocal, State, and Federal governments, with serious trade imbalances \nthat are increasing private and public debt, and having a weaker \nnational economy with even more serious consequences ahead.\n  The proponents of these free-trade agreements--and they are on both \nsides of the aisle, and they come from the preceding administrations as \nwell as this one--remind me of the story of the crew that was blazing a \nroad in the jungle. After quite a bit of work, the foreman sent \nsomebody up to survey their progress. He climbed up to the top of the \nhighest available tree and looked out and said: Stop, stop. We are \ngoing in the wrong direction. The foreman called back: But we can't \nstop now, we are making so much progress.\n  These trade agreements have made progress but in the wrong direction. \nThe proponents' solution to that predicament is more of the same--yet \nanother trade agreement with the same bad effects for much of America. \nIn fact, DR-CAFTA is the worst of NAFTA. It involves countries that \nhave even lower standards of living than our own. The per capita \nincome, the average citizen's income, in those six countries range from \none-tenth of the U.S. per capita income to one one-hundredth of our per \ncapita income.\n  We are told, by those who want to pass this agreement, that it is \ngoing to create these great export opportunities for our own \nindustries. But exports require people in those countries who can \nafford to buy what Americans produce. There will be a marginal \nincrease, to be sure, if there is increased employment in those \ncountries. That is positive. I hope--and we should hope--that any trade \nagreement we make will be good for our fellow world citizens.\n  However, we should make our trade agreements for our own citizens \nfirst and foremost, and not for anyone else's, because every other \ncountry in the world, every government in the world, whether \ncapitalist, Socialist, or even Communist--if it is rational in its \neconomic policies--makes trade agreements in its own national self-\ninterest. And then they try to maximize the benefits to their country \nfrom those agreements. Unfortunately, we have seen other countries' \ngovernments far more effective, even within the scope of these previous \ntrade agreements, at maximizing to their advantage, and often to our \ndetriment, what they can gain from the exploitation of those \nagreements.\n  Our trade policy should not be based on free trade or fair trade or \nany other kind of policy ideology or economic idolatry, as it has \nalmost become, but on what is the best policy with the best economic \nresults for the most Americans. By that measure, what is the broad \npublic interest--after you take the winners and the losers, which in an \nenormous, complex, diverse economy such as our own, almost any trade \nagreement is going to have gains and losses--you have to look at the \nnet effects, what is in the broad public interest, to decide what is \nbest for America.\n  The U.S. International Trade Commission--independent of all of us; \ntasked by law with developing the expertise to carry out these \nagreements and to analyze them and to analyze each of these proposed \nagreements in advance of our voting--has already concluded by its \nindependent, expert analysis that under the DR-CAFTA agreement, as \nproposed, the U.S. trade deficit with those six nations will increase \nby an estimated $110 million per year.\n  That is because the increases in their imports into the United States \nwill be greater than the increases of our exports into those countries. \nThat is the net balance. That is the bottom line. That is not, as some \npeople say, one group's interests or another group's interests. That is \nAmerica's best combined interest, and it is exactly the opposite of \nwhat proponents have been saying is going to be one of the benefits. \nOnce again, the facts, based on the International Trade Commission's \nprojections, but also consistent with the facts as we have seen from 10 \nyears' experience with NAFTA, do not support the Bush administration's \nfalse assurances and the claims of others who will benefit and are \npromoting this agreement.\n  The response, one would hope, from the administration, in light of \nthat projection by the International Trade Commission that came out \nabout 6 months ago, would be to negotiate changes in the agreement so \nthat we would come out as a net winner rather than a loser. But that \nhas not been their response. It is to increase the advertising, \nincrease the paid promotions for this proposed agreement by those who \nwill benefit from it and by, reportedly--and I have heard this directly \nfrom some of those involved in the sugar industry who have been in \ndirect negotiations with the administration--to threaten those who \noppose the agreement because they perceive, correctly, that it will \nhave serious negative consequences for their own livelihoods, for their \nown families, their friends, their neighbors, threaten them with \nreprisals in the future if they persist in their opposition, or to try \nto, as we are seeing now, buy them off with some special side deal.\n  I don't hear anybody on either side of the argument, for or against \nCAFTA-DR, who disputes the projections by the experts and the industry \nitself that the American sugar industry--sugar beets in northwestern \nMinnesota and central Minnesota and neighboring States, sugar cane in \nother States--would be seriously and negatively affected.\n  The extent is perhaps debatable, but the negative effects are \nindisputable, if CAFTA-DR is approved. So to tell them that they should \nsign off on their own economic death warrant, or they are going to \nsuffer future reprisals for not doing so is wrong. It is unfair.\n  The latest approach has been, well, we are going to offer you this \nspecial side deal for a couple years to buy you off. I don't know all \nthe details. It has just been disclosed. I don't fault my colleague in \nthe Senate from Minnesota who is purportedly instrumental in that \nnegotiation. I don't agree. I strongly disagree with the arrangement, \nas I understand it. But I fault the administration for insisting that \nhe or others try to work out such a deal. It is like being handed a \nhuge lemon and being told to make lemonade. Unfortunately, with this \ntrade agreement, there is not enough sugar in all of America to sweeten \nwhat is wrong with CAFTA, even for the sugar industry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I ask unanimous consent for 5 more minutes to complete my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the Chair.\n  The proponents want this agreement so much that they are going to \nuse--one way or another, directly or indirectly--U.S. taxpayer dollars \nto subsidize domestic sugar production or to buy off some of the \notherwise imported sugar from these CAFTA countries at taxpayer expense \nin order to promote a free-trade agreement. It has the added irony, \nbitter irony of using tax dollars from working Americans in some cases \nto subsidize an agreement that is going to cost them their jobs. It \nunderscores how the policy is bad economics, how it is bad trade \npolicy. But the proponents of it want it so badly, because of its \nbenefits for those companies that can outsource their jobs, based now \nin the United States, and that production to nearby countries, taking \nadvantage of low wages there, costing American jobs, costing American \ncommunities their businesses and their employment and their social \nstability for the benefit of the wealthy few corporate interests who \nare bankrolling this effort, and now, in the ultimate bitter \nconclusion, taking taxpayer dollars to pay for the political grease to \nget this agreement through.\n\n  If I really wanted to be Machiavellian in my thinking, I would say \nalso--as a big proponent of the domestic ethanol industry, which is now \njust reaching, because of the world oil price, competitive parity, even \nwithout\n\n[[Page S7672]]\n\nthe public tax subsidy for ethanol, of price competitiveness, even a \nprice advantage in my State of Minnesota with regular gasoline--that by \ntaking this, as some reports have said, excess sugar production and \nproviding what will be an effective subsidy of an additional dollar for \na gallon of the ethanol produced from it, distorting the economics, the \ncompetitiveness of ethanol, distorting the supply in the competitively \ngrowing, successful domestic ethanol industry and trying to show how--\nin this case, with sugar beets or sugar cane in this country--price \nuncompetitive making ethanol is from those products is poisoning the \nwell, the public support, is going to reinforce those opponents of \nethanol who will then say: Look at how uncompetitive it is and how \noutrageous this additional taxpayer subsidy is for the production of \nethanol from it. And in this case they will be right. And they will use \nthat, I believe, unfortunately, to try to poison the political and \npublic well of support for ethanol, which is a very important, \npromising part of our energy independence and economic future.\n  This is a bad agreement for America. It is bad for the sugar \nindustry, and I oppose it for that reason. But even taking sugar aside, \nit is bad for the rest of America. It is bad for American workers, \nAmerican industry. It is bad, as the International Trade Commission has \nconcluded, on the basis of the bottom line--the trade imbalance \nincreased, trade deficit with those countries increased, imports that \nwill exceed the increase in our exports. That means, net result, it is \nbad policy, bad trade for America.\n  I oppose it. I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak in place of Senator Kerry for 15 minutes, and that the next \nspeaker after me be a Republican Senator under the time Senator \nGrassley was previously granted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to announce my \nopposition to CAFTA. Some expect Democratic Senators to by and large \noppose trade agreements and Republican Senators to support them. I come \nto this debate as a Democratic Senator who has supported trade \nagreements in the past. I supported NAFTA, permanent normal trade \nrelations for China, trade agreements for Chile, Singapore, Morocco, \nand Australia. I think globalization is as inevitable as gravity. We \nhave to accept the fact that America cannot be a rich and prosperous \ncountry by selling to ourselves. Merely doing one another's laundry \nwill not create wealth and will not improve our standard of living. We \nneed markets. That is why I have supported trade agreements in the \npast.\n  I also understand that as you expand trade, there is pain and there \nis gain. We have seen it happen throughout the history of the world \nthat as trade expands, some industries expand with it and others \ndecline. When we Americans look at the course of history, we find \nstrong evidence that joining together democracy and free markets is a \nwinning combination. Expanding trade goes hand in hand with pushing the \nconcepts of freedom, ingenuity, innovation, efficiency--all sorts of \nrespect for people at every level. That is one of the reasons I have \nsupported some trade agreements in the past. That is the very reason I \noppose CAFTA.\n  I am disappointed. If there is one casualty in CAFTA, that casualty \nwould be the worker--not just the American worker but the workers in \nCentral America. We know what is happening. We have seen over the past \n4 years that America has lost one out of every six manufacturing jobs \nin the last 4 years and few months. It hit my State pretty hard. \nSeveral hundred thousand manufacturing jobs in Illinois are gone, never \nto return. It is happening across America. The trade policy we have \ntoday is exporting jobs. How long can this continue?\n  We would like to believe that we are going to educate and train a new \ngroup of American workers for the 21st century economy. We have to. But \nin the meantime, should we be entering into trade agreements that \nencourage the export of good-paying manufacturing jobs from the United \nStates? Should we, instead, be saying that we are going to have trade \nagreements that make certain we aren't playing to the lowest level? If \nwe have to compete with the countries that pay the lowest wages in the \nworld, we will always lose.\n  What are we going to say to American workers? Compete at a wage level \nthe same as another country? If you do that, you know what is going to \nhappen to the standard of living. How can you provide for your family? \nHow can you expect to have health insurance? How can you put any money \naway for your retirement, when you play to that level? That is what \nthis trade agreement does.\n  Let me tell you two specifics. Senator Ron Wyden of the State of \nOregon offered an amendment to this CAFTA agreement which said: If \nAmerican workers in the service industries lose their jobs because of \nour decision to enact this trade agreement, we will help retrain them, \ngive them new skills and education so they can go back to work. \nDisplaced workers from service industries would have a fighting chance \nto get back on their feet and be able to compete. The amendment was \nrejected by the Bush administration, leaving these workers, who are the \nvictims of CAFTA, high and dry. But there are other workers at stake \nhere, too. I don't think it is unreasonable for us to ask, when a \ncountry says they want to trade with us, How do you treat your workers? \nDo you treat them with dignity? Do you give them a chance to bargain \ncollectively for their future? Do you allow child labor? Do you allow \nslave labor? Why in the world would we want to get into a trade \nagreement with a country that is exporting goods to the United States \nbecause they exploit the very people who live in their country?\n\n  The language in CAFTA is the weakest language I have ever seen in a \ntrade agreement. It basically says to the Central American countries: \nJust play by your own rules, whatever they happen to be.\n  That is not enough. It isn't as if we don't know what is coming. Our \nU.S. Department of Labor, under the Bush administration, ordered a \nstudy of the labor laws in the Central American countries that we are \nentering into this agreement with. That study came out and made the \nfollowing report:\n\n       In practice, labor laws on the books in Central America are \n     not sufficient to deter employers from violations, as actual \n     sanctions for violations of the law are weak or nonexistent.\n\n  What does that mean? It means that if you hire children to make \ntextile goods or whatever it happens to be, if you exploit these little \nkids in one of these countries, if you work people enormous hours \nwithout adequate compensation, if you stop them from organizing and \nbargaining collectively, the laws in Central America are not going to \nbe there to protect those workers. Ordinarily we say: Life is different \nin other parts of the world. We shouldn't worry about it. These are the \nvery workers who will make the products who will compete with America. \nThat is what it comes down to. Are we going to continue to play to the \nlowest common denominator, that as long as businesses are profitable in \ntheir trade agreements, we don't want to know the details? That is what \nthis trade agreement does.\n  Under this administration, workers are expendable. They are \nexpendable in the United States, and they are expendable in the \ncountries that we are entering into agreements with.\n  That is a sad reality.\n  I know that there are going to be changes, and we have to accept \neconomic change. But wouldn't we want to stand by American workers \nfirst and their families? We have done it in some other agreements--the \nCaribbean Basin Initiative and the Generalized System of Preferences. \nThis agreement is one of the weakest I have ever seen when it comes to \nthe rights of working people. In those countries in Central America, it \nis not uncommon to face blacklisting, violence, even assassination of \nunion organizers. It goes largely unpunished. This agreement would not \nmove us one step toward more civilized treatment of workers in those \ncountries.\n  If we truly care about the basic protections that are supposed to be \nbehind a free-market economy and democracy, we ought to protect \nAmerican workers\n\n[[Page S7673]]\n\nfirst, not rush to the bottom when it comes to labor standards. We \nought to enter into trade agreements where parties are not free to \nignore labor standards and basic human rights. That is what is at \nstake.\n\n  Since this President took office, we have lost 2.8 million \nmanufacturing jobs--1 out of 6--and 140,000 in my home State in the \nlast 4\\1/2\\ years. It is a tragic, dismal, and shameful record of \nAmerican workers losing their opportunities. And this trade agreement, \nsadly, will only make it worse.\n  Let me tell you about the group that, frankly, will prosper the most \nfrom this agreement. It will come as no surprise to you if you \nunderstand the political dynamics of Capitol Hill.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Please advise me when I have 2 minutes.\n  One of the special interest groups with more power in Washington than \nany others is the pharmaceutical industry. We have seen it time and \ntime again. When we go into a bill for Medicare prescription drug \nbenefits, we say: Would you not want Medicare to bargain with the drug \ncompanies so seniors across America would pay lower prices? No way. It \nwas kept out of the bill so that the pharmaceutical and drug companies \ncan charge exorbitantly high prices to American citizens. That is why \npeople are going to Canada, Mexico, and Europe trying to find cheaper \ndrugs. It is because their Governments care, they force competition, \nthey keep prices down. Not our Government. Along comes a trade \nagreement. What could that have to do with the pharmaceutical companies \nand drug companies? There are roughly 165,000 people in the Central \nAmerican nations living with HIV/AIDS. These are low-income countries \nwhere the people are struggling to survive and medicine is barely \naffordable.\n  Doctors Without Borders--you may have heard of this fabulous \norganization based out of France, doing wonderful work all around the \nworld. They provide drugs to HIV patients, and 1,600 in Guatemala \nalone. They rely on generic drugs because they cannot afford the most \nexpensive drugs. They cost less than brand-named drugs. They can keep a \nperson alive with HIV/AIDS in Guatemala for $216 a year. If they had to \npay for the brand name, it would be $4,818. That is the difference--\nmore than 20 times the cost.\n  I know these patents to drug companies are important. They help to \nspur innovation by rewarding companies for investing. We need a careful \nbalance where we allow generic drugs in these Central American \ncountries and not abuse the patents of the drug companies \nunnecessarily. At the global level, there has been an active debate \nabout this very issue. We have had agreements that have been entered \ninto. These agreements try to strike a careful balance between allowing \nmore inexpensive drugs in the poor countries and still protect the \npatents.\n  Sadly, this CAFTA agreement destroys the balance that has been \nentered into in previous agreements. This CAFTA trade agreement \nrequires CAFTA countries to adopt provisions, such as keeping testing \ndata for drugs secret for longer periods of time than even required in \nthe United States of America. And without access to testing data, it \nbecomes nearly impossible for new generic companies to break into the \nmarket and provide the drugs for these people in Central America, and \nsome, of course, in our region.\n  CAFTA will require countries to extend the lives of patents, under \ncertain circumstances, for even longer periods of time than is \npermitted under U.S. law. This is a bonanza for pharmaceutical \ncompanies. They will make more money out of this agreement because we \nput their special interest provisions into this trade understanding. \nThese provisions will apply to new drugs as they are developed, not \nexisting generics.\n  The long delays that CAFTA will impose means patients will have to \nwait even longer to get access to lifesaving treatment. I think when \nyou look at this and you understand workers are losing, you have to \nunderstand as well that a lot of sick people with HIV/AIDS are going to \nlose, too. People are struggling to survive, and they will fall victim \nto the profit margins of American pharmaceutical companies. Those are \nthe priorities--the priorities of CAFTA.\n  Why aren't the American workers the priority of CAFTA? Why aren't the \nworkers of Central America the priorities of CAFTA? Why is America's \nrecord of humanitarian care when it comes to using these drugs all \naround the world--why isn't that the priority?\n  Let me speak about agriculture. I come from a strong agricultural \nState. I have promoted or stood behind many trade agreements in the \npast because it helped create agricultural markets. But CAFTA \ncountries, Central American countries, have a combined population of \nabout 31 million people who generally have limited incomes with which \nto purchase agricultural products. The market is worth about $1.6 \nbillion in annual agricultural exports. That is a large sum, but in the \nperspective of all of the exports we have, it is not overwhelming. Many \nkey U.S. commodities already have open access to the Central American \nmarket. About 94 percent of all grains imported into the six CAFTA \ncountries comes from the United States. This domination means there is \nlittle room for further upward growth when it comes to agriculture. So \nI think when we look at this, we have to ask a more important question: \nThink about the Central American country for a moment. Think about a \nsubsistence farmer living in the countryside of one of these Central \nAmerican countries who is growing grain.\n\n  Assume it is corn for the moment. Think about the possibility that \nthis trade agreement means that more and cheaper corn will come in from \nthe United States to this Central American country. Think what happens \nto that poor farmer and his family if he can no longer eke out a living \nfor himself and his family and sell enough to continue on, and he has \nto leave his farm--and it happens all the time--because of this \nagreement. Where does that peasant farmer go? His first stop is likely \nto be a large city in Central America, San Jose in Costa Rica, or some \nother city. Failing to find a job in that city, where is his next stop? \nEl Norte, the United States.\n  So as we assault the economies of Central America, without respect \nfor their workers, without respect for their farmers, we create \neconomic instability which moves families into cities first, and \nfinally, in desperation, to anyplace they can go to find any job to \nsurvive. Now, there may be large companies that will make great profits \nout of CAFTA. But, sadly, they are not taking into consideration what \nit is going to mean to workers and to a lot of smaller companies in the \nUnited States that will not survive this trade agreement.\n  If there was ever a time in our history when we should step back, as \nwe face the largest trade deficit in the United States, as we see \ncountries such as China around the world exploiting us because they are \nbuying our debt--the largest national deficit in the history of the \nUnited States under the Bush administration--and understand that China \nand these countries will continue to exploit us on the trade side--\nChina manipulates its currency, and we don't do anything about it. We \ndon't even talk about it. Because of that manipulation, they take away \nAmerican jobs.\n  This Senator has voted for trade agreements in the past. I will not \nvote for this one. If we are going to have trade agreements, there \nshould be laws enforced on both sides, exporters and importers. Sadly, \nthat has not been the case. This CAFTA agreement will hurt American \nworkers, hurt the workers of Central America, be a bonanza for American \npharmaceutical companies, and create instability in the United States.\n  It could not come at a worse time. I look forward to voting against \nit.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the next \nSenator to be recognized be Senator Cornyn for 10 minutes from our \ntime, and then Senator Kerry for 15 minutes from Senator Baucus's time, \nand then Senator Vitter for 10 minutes from Senator Grassley's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise today to lend my voice and my \nsupport\n\n[[Page S7674]]\n\nfor the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade \nAgreement. CAFTA would be a great benefit to the United States and all \ncountries involved. Momentum continues to build for this important \naccord which will, notwithstanding what some have said on the floor \ntoday, actually grow jobs in the United States and grow jobs in Central \nAmerica. It will boost opportunities for exporters in the United States \nand provide additional market access for our products in Central \nAmerica. Congress should pass this important agreement for the good of \nboth our economy and our national security, as well as those of our \nneighbors.\n  Economic growth brought about by free trade and free markets creates \nnew jobs and raises income. This growth lifts people out of poverty, \neven as it spurs positive economic development. Free trade supports \nsustainable development and strengthens private property rights while \nencouraging competition, transparency, regional integration, and the \nopen flow of technology. And a strong world economy based upon free \ntrade and transparency advances not only the prosperity of nations but \nthe cause of peace and liberty around the world.\n  A vibrant, free market that values innovation and competition is one \nof the vital components of American success. For consumers here in the \nUnited States and the DR-CAFTA countries--Costa Rica, the Dominican \nRepublic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua--free-trade \nwill provide real and tangible benefits. It will demonstrate our \ncommitment to the economic prosperity of that region, and it will also \nencourage the spread of democracy, transparency, and respect for the \nrule of law.\n  DR-CAFTA countries are our 12th largest export market, with nearly 44 \nmillion consumers. Currently, nearly 80 percent of products from these \ncountries enter the U.S. duty-free, but the average tariff on our goods \nis between 7 and 9 percent. DR-CAFTA would eliminate this imbalance and \nprovide instead for reciprocal trade between all parties to the \nagreement--this means the playing field would be leveled for American \nexporters.\n  The benefits of this agreement are clear: When CAFTA is implemented, \n80 percent of U.S. products will enter DR-CAFTA countries duty-free, \nwith the remaining 20 percent being phased in over 10 years. Currently, \nthe average tariff imposed on U.S. exports to Central America is \nbetween 7 and 9 percent--and some farm products being taxed as much as \n16 percent.\n  Key U.S. export sectors stand to significantly benefit from the \nagreement, including medical and scientific equipment, information \ntechnology products, construction equipment, and paper products.\n  As well, agriculture exports will be allowed to expand: More than \nhalf of current U.S. farm exports to Central America will become duty \nfree immediately, including cotton, wheat, soybeans, fruits and \nvegetables, high-quality cuts of beef, processed food products, and \nwine. It is estimated that U.S. agriculture producers will increase \ntheir exports by $900 million as a result of the DR-CAFTA agreement. \nFinally, after tariff liberalization has been fully implemented, and \nall economic adjustments have occurred, overall U.S. welfare is likely \nto increase in the range of $135.31 million to $248.17 million. As \nwell, the U.S. International Trade Commission has found that the effect \nof the agreement would be to reduce the overall U.S. trade deficit by \n$756 million.\n  Furthermore, over half of current U.S. farm exports to Central \nAmerica will become duty-free immediately, and other U.S. exports, such \nas information technology products, agricultural and construction \nequipment, paper products, chemicals, and medical and scientific \nequipment will immediately gain duty-free access.\n  Workers in Central America and the Dominican Republic support the \nagreement. They recognize that it will help create more and better \npaying jobs. This in turn will help fight poverty, lifting these \nworkers out of circumstances where they currently survive on only a few \ndollars a day. Enhanced opportunities for economic growth will provide \nthese governments with additional resources for much-needed health \ncare, education, and basic infrastructure.\n  By working to alleviate poverty in Central America, we increase the \nlikelihood that would-be immigrants would instead choose to stay and \nwork in their own countries. We have seen the flow of immigrants who \nflock across our borders--they come here to work hard so they can send \nmoney home to support their families and relatives. They may be well-\nintentioned, but these hard workers are doing little to help the \neconomy of Central Amerixa.\n  The young democracies of Central America still face resistance from \nthose opposed to the spread of democracy and economic freedom. In \nsupporting DR-CAFTA, the United States will stand alongside those who \nsupport these ideals--those who believe in the rule of law, and will \ndemonstrate that America does not merely view Central America as a \ntrading partner, but that we intend to support the continued democratic \ndevelopment of our neighbors.\n  Congress should promptly pass DR-CAFTA, as agreements that remove \nunnecessary barriers to free markets are good for America, and it is in \nour economic and national security interests to support a prosperous \nCentral America. DR-CAFTA will encourage economic prosperity, \nstability, transparency, and respect for the rule of law throughout the \nregion. I ask that my colleagues join me in supporting this important \nagreement.\n  Mr. President, let me focus, in the time I have remaining, on \nimmigration. I heard the Senator from Illinois claim that if we pass \nCAFTA, it will somehow displace Central American workers and they will \nbe caused to immigrate--illegally, perhaps--to the United States. I \ncould not disagree with him more.\n  About a year ago, I traveled to Central America to five of the \ncountries involved in this agreement, and in each and every one of \nthose Central American countries we were told that their new \ndemocracies' future depends on ratification of these free-trade \nagreements. To a man, the leaders of those countries asked us to do \neverything we can to see that this free-trade agreement passes.\n  While certainly we want to be a friendly neighbor if we can, I would \nnot support this agreement if it weren't in the best interests of the \nUnited States on a number of bases. There is one conversation I \nremember in particular that relates to the comments we just heard from \nthe Senator from Illinois about immigration. In Guatemala, at the \nAmbassador's residence, a gentleman told me, ``We want to export goods \nand services, not people.''\n  Mr. President, that stuck with me because what he was saying is that \nby our ratifying CAFTA, we create jobs and opportunities for the people \nof Central America where they live, so they don't have to come to the \nUnited States--illegally or otherwise--to be able to support their \nfamilies. That is one of the reasons I am so strongly for this \nagreement.\n  I am also for this agreement because these new democracies, many of \nwhich were engaged in civil war not that many years ago--and countries \nsuch as Nicaragua, where Daniel Ortega is hoping and praying that we \nwill somehow turn our back on that country and these other new \ndemocracies--there are literally people waiting to take advantage of \nAmerica if we turn our back on these countries, and to claim that \ninstead we should align our interests with people like Fidel Castro, \nDaniel Ortega, and others.\n  It is in our best interest to make sure that these new and fragile \ndemocracies flourish, that people who live there can also find work \nthere and support their families. The irony is that we hear people \nargue that unless we have stronger labor provisions or environmental \nprovisions for these agreements--this agreement in Central America--\nthat we somehow should not pass it. The fact is, there are strong labor \nprovisions and environmental provisions in this agreement. But do you \nknow what. The best guarantee for a good environment is democracy. The \nbest guarantee for good labor laws and the rule of law in these \ncountries is democracy.\n  If we turn our backs on Central America and these countries in this \nfree-trade agreement, critics and enemies of this country will point to \nus and our actions and our rejection of this agreement and claim \nvictory and say that America was not serious about\n\n[[Page S7675]]\n\nhelping; America does not care about anyone but itself, when in fact \nthe opposite is true.\n  We know, further, that the avenues used for illegal immigration up \nfrom South America, Central America, through Mexico's southern border, \nthrough seaports, and in the air are being used by organized criminals \nwho smuggle human beings, who traffic in persons, who smuggle weapons, \nand who smuggle illegal narcotics. In other words, they are organized \ncriminals who care only about making money, and they don't care one \nwhit about the human suffering that they cause.\n  It is simply in America's self-interest that we enter into this \nagreement which provides new markets for our producers in this country. \nIt opens our markets further to those fragile democracies and market \neconomies in Central America. It gives democracy a root in a way that \ncements our interest and reinforces our national interest, not only in \nthis country, but in this hemisphere in Central and South America, an \narea that could sorely use the attention after what has been called a \nperiod of benign neglect.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote with me in promptly passing CAFTA as \nagreements that remove unnecessary barriers to free markets which is in \nthe economic and national security interest of the United States and a \nprosperous Central America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Vitter be \nrecognized for his 10 minutes, and then we will go immediately to the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to S. 1307, the \nbill to implement the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade \nAgreement. I do it for one very clear and specific reason. CAFTA will \ngreatly harm Louisiana's sugarcane industry. It is, quite frankly, a \nraw deal for Louisiana sugar.\n  Because of the great disruption in our domestic sugar market that \nthis agreement would cause, I have been actively opposing this \nagreement since it was signed. This agreement would allow an additional \n122,000 tons of imported sugar into the United States in its first year \nalone, with annual increases following. These steady increases in \nimports threaten to flood the U.S. market and truly devastate the \nLouisiana sugarcane industry, as domestic sugar is displaced by highly \nsubsidized foreign imports.\n  Our current sugar program is designed to limit imports to help \ncounter unfair trade actions, and these limits help mitigate the ill \neffects of dumping by other nations. Unlike programs for many other \nforeign commodities, it should be noted that this U.S. sugar program \nprovides no cash payments and operates at no cost to the U.S. taxpayers \nthrough cash payments as mandated by the farm bill.\n  Even with that existing program in import controls, the U.S. still \nstands as the fourth largest net sugar importer in the world, importing \n15 percent of our sugar consumption every year. Allowing more imports \nfrom select CAFTA trading partners truly brings a potential flood to \nthe market, displacing even more domestic sugar. CAFTA really could set \nthe stage for future bilateral agreements focused on the largest sugar-\nproducing nations, and these impacts are compounded with other pending \nchanges, such as the NAFTA-mandated change that will allow Mexican \nsugar complete unfettered access to U.S. markets after 2008.\n  When the Jesuit priests introduced sugarcane to Louisiana in the \n1750s, I guess they could not have imagined that sugar would \nessentially be a $2 billion industry and, much more importantly, even a \nvital part of Louisiana's history and way of life for over 250 years. \nIt is this economic and even cultural impact and the thousands of \nfamilies who rely on sugarcane for their livelihood and their way of \nlife which lies behind my decision to oppose CAFTA.\n  The Louisiana Farm Bureau estimates CAFTA would have caused an $8.5 \nmillion reduction in Louisiana's agricultural sector, and sugarcane \nconstitutes one of the foundations of this important sector of \nLouisiana's overall economy.\n  Louisiana is home to 27,000 sugar industry jobs, 15 sugar mills, 2 \nsugar refineries, and more than 580,000 acres of sugarcane throughout \n24 parishes. All told, Louisiana alone produces 20 percent of all of \nour domestic sugar.\n  As I said, this represents an enormous economic impact. But even more \nimportantly, it truly represents a culture and a valued way of life.\n  The administration made a last-ditch, three-part proposal to the \nsugar industry to mitigate CAFTA's impact, but I truly believe that it \nis untenable.\n  First, they committed to hold harmless the sugar program but only \nthrough the reauthorization of the 2002 farm bill. This is something \nmodest, something I could and will support, but it is my understanding \nthat it is already the responsibility of the Secretary of Agriculture, \nunder this farm bill, to operate the program at no net cost and its \nimport trigger.\n  I know that sugarcane farmers in my State appreciate the Secretary's \ncommitment to provide this short-term relief from a flood of sugar \nimport commitments, but this temporary protection will not help them \navoid the flood in the medium and long term. We, in Louisiana, know a \nlot about hurricanes and floods, and I fear that in the past 2 years, \nour sugar industries have drowned in this flood of foreign imports.\n  The second component of the proposed deal from the administration is \nperhaps the most problematic. If imports threaten to exceed the 1.523-\nmillion-ton trigger in the farm bill, the Agriculture Department would \ncommit to compensating foreign producers for not selling their sugar \nwithin our market. U.S. tax dollars are going to compensate foreign \nproducers. USDA would also establish a pilot program to divert imported \nsugar into ethanol use up to the amount coming in under CAFTA.\n  The prospect of paying foreign producers is very troublesome, perhaps \npolitically untenable. Regardless of the Secretary's statement that he \nhas the authority to implement such a program, there are so many \nunanswered questions on how it would work and if it would \nbe politically supportable. Do we really want to make cash payments to \nforeign governments or private foreign corporations in exchange for a \ncommitment not to export sugar to our market? I don't think so. This \nproposal is expected to cost $200 million a year.\n\n  Sending our tax dollars to our foreign competition I think is an \nuntenable position for a variety of budgetary, policy, and political \nreasons, making this long-term proposed solution untenable.\n  The ethanol diversion program has its own uncertainties on how it \nwill work, and it seems to signal a desire to purchase foreign sugar \nfor possible ethanol use instead of assisting the domestic industry in \ndeveloping new markets for our own production and likely spend \nsignificant more of the taxpayers' dollars on those foreign sources in \nthe process.\n  Third, there has been a proposal for a feasibility study on \nconverting sugar into ethanol to be submitted to Congress no later than \nJuly 1, 2006. We already know sugar can be turned into ethanol because \nthey are doing just that in other countries.\n  Worldwide, more ethanol is produced from sucrose than from corn, and \nwe now need to jump start our own efforts and truly implement a program \nto provide sugar access to the national renewable fuels program.\n  The Energy bill we passed this week provides for 8 billion gallons \nper year of renewable fuels, most of which will be ethanol. The new \nrenewable fuels program would amount to more than quadruple the ethanol \ncurrently being consumed in the U.S. So there is plenty of room to \naccommodate diverse sources of ethanol, including a modest room for \nsugar.\n  Access to ethanol was the crux of the sugar industry's proposal to \ndeal with CAFTA--not a study, but real access to that established \nprogram moving forward in the Energy bill. They asked for a short-term \nincrease in the tax credit during the developmental phase of this \nprogram, something that I understand was done for the beginning of the \nprogram for corn.\n  With so much uncertainty facing the industry because of NAFTA, CAFTA,\n\n[[Page S7676]]\n\nand other trade negotiations already in progress, I think this was a \nfair ask from the industry, from an efficient domestic industry that \nhas been a robust engine for jobs in our economy for over 2 centuries. \nI wish the administration could have accepted that full and robust \nproposal in terms of ethanol.\n  Our sugar farmers and processors work hard and deserve a level \nplaying field. What I have been asking, what others have been asking is \nnot simply protectionism for our domestic industry as far as the eye \ncan see, but a level playing field dealing with this sugar issue on a \nglobal WTO basis so it can be dealt with fairly so our domestic sugar \nindustry has at least a chance. That is exactly what I will continue to \nfight for. That is precisely why I will continue to fight against CAFTA \nand urge its defeat in this body and in the House.\n  In closing, I wish to take this opportunity to thank Chairman \nChambliss and Senator Coleman for their efforts to find a solution to \nthe sugar issue within CAFTA. They have been leading a bicameral \neffort, working diligently. It did not yield the results I hoped, but I \nsalute them for their efforts.\n  Unfortunately, as I said, those efforts did not prevail. That is why \nI strongly oppose CAFTA and why I ask my colleagues to do so, and \nspecifically my colleagues in the House as this measure most probably \nmoves there.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able \nto speak instead of Senator Kerry under the previous order, to be \nfollowed by Senator Lautenberg for 10 minutes under the time controlled \nby Senator Dorgan, to be followed by a Republican Senator to speak \nunder the time of Senator Grassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able \nto speak instead of Senator Kerry under the previous order for up to 20 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the second unanimous \nconsent request that the Senator from Wisconsin be able to fill the \ntime of Senator Kerry for 20 minutes instead of 15 minutes? The Senator \nfrom Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished Senator from Wisconsin on the Democratic side be the next \nspeaker for 20 minutes, that he be followed by Senator Lautenberg for \n10 minutes, and then Senator Voinovich will immediately follow Senator \nLautenberg for at least 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Central American \nFree Trade Agreement, known as CAFTA, the latest expression of the \ndisastrous trade policies of this administration which are, \nunfortunately, a continuation of the disastrous trade policies of \nprevious administrations.\n  I hold listening sessions in each of Wisconsin's 72 counties every \nyear. I have held those listening sessions for over 12 years now, \nlistening to tens of thousands of people from all over Wisconsin. I \nrecently completed my 900th of those sessions, and I can say that there \nis nearly universal frustration and anger with the trade policies we \nhave pursued since the late 1980s. Even among those who would have \ncalled themselves traditional free-traders, it is increasingly obvious \nthat the so-called NAFTA model of trade has been a tragic failure.\n  I voted against NAFTA, GATT, and permanent most-favored-nation status \nfor China, in great part because I felt they were bad deals for \nWisconsin businesses and Wisconsin workers. At the time I voted against \nthose agreements, I thought they would result in lost jobs for my \nState.\n  Even as an opponent of those trade agreements, I had no idea just how \nbad things would be.\n  And things could hardly be worse. One can see the results of those \npolicies in hundreds of communities around my State. As one might \nexpect, our largest communities--places like Milwaukee, Madison, and \nGreen Bay--lost thousands of jobs as a result of those trade policies, \nmost notably NAFTA and permanent most-favored-nation status for China. \nBut less obvious to some may be the devastation experienced by smaller \ntowns and cities across my State. In those communities, the legacy of \nour trade policy has been especially cruel.\n  Even if we only use the extremely conservative statistics collected \nby the Department of Labor, statistics which many argue grossly \nunderstate actual job loss, smaller communities all over Wisconsin have \nbeen the victim of the trade policies of the past decade.\n  NAFTA's legacy of lost jobs includes places such as: Baraboo, with \n190 lost jobs; DeForest, with 40 lost jobs; Elkhorn, with 354 lost \njobs; Hawkins, with 443 lost jobs; Marinette, with 54 lost jobs; \nMauston, with 48 lost jobs; Merrill, with 263 lost jobs; Montello, with \n70 lost jobs; Oconto Falls, with 100 lost jobs; Peshtigo, with 95 lost \njobs; Platteville, with 588 lost jobs; Spencer, with 23 lost jobs; and \nWaupaca, with 130 lost jobs.\n  Some might suggest that 23 lost jobs in Spencer, WI are not all that \nmany but when a small town loses a business, and the dozens or possibly \nhundreds of jobs that business provides, the impact surges throughout \nthe entire community. Families are left without a breadwinner, or \nsometimes even two breadwinners. Stores are left without customers. New \nhomes are not built. Families may be forced to move away. Schools lose \nchildren. The tax base drops, putting an increased burden on those who \nremain.\n  When a bad trade deal results in lost jobs, it is not only those who \nlost a job who suffer.\n  And the suffering in Wisconsin has been considerable. Altogether, \nWisconsin has a net loss of more than 23,000 jobs because of NAFTA, and \nthousands more because of the other trade agreements into which we have \nentered in recent years.\n  Now we have CAFTA, which is based on that same failed model of trade.\n  I should note at this point that in too many instances, these trade \nagreements have been lose-lose trade agreements. They have been bad \ndeals for our workers as well as the workers of our trading partners.\n  This is a vital point, because many who are advocating CAFTA argue \nthat the agreement is critical for promoting economic growth and \nreducing poverty in these Central American nations. In fact, the \nexperience of the flawed trade model has been just the opposite.\n  Eleven years of NAFTA have lowered living standards in Mexico, both \nfor urban workers and in rural areas. Professor Riordan Roett of Johns \nHopkins wrote on this very issue in a recent column, and this is what \nhe had to say:\n\n       Mexican workers under NAFTA lost precipitously through the \n     1990s, despite the extravagant promises made by proponents of \n     the model on which CAFTA is based.\n       At least 1.5 million Mexican farmers have lost their \n     livelihoods under NAFTA. According to a 2004 report by the \n     Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, ``Agricultural \n     trade liberalization linked to NAFTA is the single most \n     significant factor in the loss of agricultural jobs in \n     Mexico. `` Thus far, limited employment growth in Mexico's \n     manufacturing sector has failed to absorb displaced rural \n     workers.\n       This does not bode well for the CAFTA countries. A 2004 \n     U.S. International Trade Commission study on the potential \n     impacts of CAFTA leads one to conclude that the agreement \n     will displace many in the rural sector in Central America. \n     Following a recent visit to Guatemala, United Nations Special \n     Raporteur for Food Jean Ziegler determined that CAFTA will \n     increase hunger and poverty once the agreement fully kicks \n     in. . . . one is left to wonder where the displaced rural \n     population of Central America will find employment.\n\n  If the arguments made by the proponents of CAFTA sound familiar, it \nis because they are. CAFTA's advocates are making exactly the same \narguments today that the proponents of NAFTA made a little over 10 \nyears ago. Because our markets are already largely open, they argue, it \nwill be American businesses and American workers who will benefit from \nthis trade agreement.\n  It is an argument that sounds neat and simple, but let's compare the \nrhetoric to the record. In 1993, before NAFTA was implemented, our \ntrade deficit with Canada and Mexico was $9 billion. In 2004, 10 years \nafter NAFTA was implemented, our trade deficit with those two countries \nhas ballooned 1,200 percent--1,200 percent--to $111 billion. By one \nestimate, the massive\n\n[[Page S7677]]\n\ngrowth of imports into this country from Canada and Mexico relative to \nexports to those two countries has displaced almost one million jobs.\n  Giving China permanent most-favored-nation trading status and \nratifying the creation of the World Trade Organization have only made \nmatters worse. Our trade deficit is now more than $600 billion.\n  Far from improving our trade balance, NAFTA and these other trade \nagreements have only made matters worse.\n  Our trade policy is fundamentally flawed. This is not a new problem, \nnor is it the fault of only one political party. The leadership of both \nparties have pushed these deeply flawed agreements, and too many \nMembers from both parties were ready to support them without scrutiny.\n  When questions were raised about the actual provisions of these \nflawed agreements, supporters were quick to play the free trade card \nand label those who questioned these policies as ``protectionist.''\n  It is somewhat encouraging that some who blindly accepted these \nagreements are now beginning to read the fine print.\n  One might think it obvious, but apparently it needs to be reiterated, \nthese are not your father's trade agreements, and the elegant theories \nof Adam Smith and others do not apply to the agreements we are asked to \napprove. As Thea Lee wrote in a recent column in the Wall Street \nJournal:\n\n       We should all understand by now that modern (post-NAFTA) \n     free-trade agreements are not just about lowering tariffs. \n     They are about changing the conditions attached to trade \n     liberalization, in ways that benefit some players and hurt \n     others. These are not your textbook free-trade deals. These \n     are finely orchestrated special-interest deals that boost the \n     profits and power of multinational corporations, leaving \n     workers, family farmers, many small businesses, and the \n     environment more vulnerable than ever.\n\n  Millions of working families across Wisconsin know this.\n  I sometimes think that if instead of exporting manufacturing goods \nChina exported editorial writers, the opinion pages of our newspapers \nmight reflect an understanding of this as well.\n  The argument we hear is that trade deals like CAFTA may cause some \nshort-term pain but they are ultimately good for all countries \nconcerned. Maybe we lose a few jobs to Mexico or China, the argument \ngoes, but we would also gain jobs. Each country would engage in the \neconomic activity for which it has a so-called ``comparative \nadvantage'' and everyone wins.\n  But this nice, neat academic theory bears little relation to what is \nactually happening in the real world. And one of the reasons for this \ndisconnect is that in an arena that has been fundamentally changed by \ntechnical advances, such as the Internet and the rapid flow of capital, \nwe are not playing by the same rules as our trading partners.\n  The trade agreements into which our country has entered in recent \nyears too often lack even the most reasonable of standards to prevent a \nrace to the bottom, and ensure that our businesses and workers can \ncompete on a level playing field.\n  This is certainly the case with CAFTA, which fails to include \nmeaningful labor standards, and the weak standards that it does include \nare effectively unenforceable.\n  CAFTA states that member countries cannot, for their own benefit, \nfail to enforce their labor laws. But the agreement also states that \nnothing in the agreement ``shall be construed to empower a Party's \nauthorities to undertake labor law enforcement activities in the \nterritory of another Party.'' Thus, any protections that might be \nafforded by the requirement to enforce current labor laws are left to \neach government to self-enforce. This really does nothing.\n  Unlike the commercial provisions in CAFTA, the labor provisions \ncannot be enforced through binding dispute settlement, or trade \nsanctions. If a country violates its commercial obligations, sanctions \ncan be imposed quickly, but a violation of workers' rights is only \nsubject to a possible fine.\n  In the unlikely event that a country is forced to pay a fine, it pays \nthat fine to itself. While the fine is supposed to be used to fund \ndomestic labor initiatives, we all know that such revenues are \nfungible, and there is no way to prevent a violating country from also \ntransferring money out of its labor budget, so the fine adds no new net \nresources for enforcement. This is not an academic concern. Studies \nhave documented serious labor violations in Central American countries.\n  American businesses and American workers should not have to compete \nwith countries with such flawed labor records.\n  CAFTA also fails to include adequate environmental safeguards. What \nenvironmental provisions there are in CAFTA are largely cosmetic in \nnature.\n  As with worker standards, the environmental standards that are in the \nagreement lack the kind of enforcement teeth provided to commercial \nprovisions in the agreement.\n  For example, while the agreement includes the establishment of a \nprocess under which citizens can identify failures to enforce \nenvironmental laws effectively, advocates note that the proposed \ncitizen process has no clear enforcement mechanism to ensure action on \npublic complaints. By contrast, the enforcement mechanisms for \ninvestment related provisions are real. Investors can demand monetary \ncompensation of governments under CAFTA's investment rules.\n  In fact, any hope that CAFTA countries might, on their own, \nstrengthen environmental standards to make the playing field a bit more \nlevel is undermined by the investment rules included in the trade \nagreement.\n  Those rules allow foreign investors to challenge environmental laws \nand regulations in front of international trade panels, circumventing \nlocal courts. Moreover, the threat of having to pay investor interests \nheavy monetary damages if a challenge is successful is certain to have \na chilling effect on the willingness of CAFTA government, both federal \nand local, to establish the kinds of environmental protections that \nmight help that region and provide better balance for American firms \nthat must live under our own strong environmental laws.\n  Among the rosiest of predictions made by the proponents of CAFTA are \nthe positive impacts they claim for U.S. agricultural sectors. But our \nexperience with NAFTA again leaves me deeply skeptical of such claims. \nThe promises made to farmers that we heard over the early 1990s, have \nlargely failed to materialize.\n  But even setting aside for the moment the failure of NAFTA to deliver \non those promises, even if we accept the most optimistic of projections \nby CAFTA's proponents, there is no scenario under which this helps \nsmall family farmers in Wisconsin or the Nation. The American market \ndwarfs the CAFTA market, so any benefits will be miniscule and \nconcentrated in the middlemen and large agribusinesses.\n  I am afraid to say that is the up side. The down side is that CAFTA \nsets up an unfair playing field that could put our farmers at a long-\nterm competitive disadvantage.\n  As my visits with Wisconsin farmers have shown me, American farmers \nare not afraid of competition and I would not hesitate to put them up \nagainst any other farmers across the world on an equal footing. The \nproblem is that CAFTA does not provide this fairness. Instead, \nWisconsin and the rest of America's farmers are required to meet \nenvironmental and labor standards to both keep the water, air and land \nclean and at the same time pay their employees a living wage.\n  As I have noted, CAFTA does not require the same standards in other \ncountries.\n  Our farmers can attest that our environmental and labor standards are \nvery real and enforced. CAFTA does nothing to level the field on which \nour farmers will be asked to compete, and that tilted playing field \napparently extends even beyond CAFTA countries.\n  For example, ethanol production has long been considered an \nopportunity for American farmers to reap greater and consistent income \nfrom their crops, while helping to reduce our dependence on foreign \nfuel. But under CAFTA, Central American countries could become a \nconduit for cheap ethanol exports to the United States, importing \nunlimited amounts of ethanol tariff free even if they were blended with \n50 percent ethanol from non-CAFTA countries like Brazil.\n   Perhaps most concerning to me is that while CAFTA would put American\n\n[[Page S7678]]\n\nfarmers at a competitive disadvantage with the relatively small CAFTA \nmarket, its impact could be far greater. CAFTA will likely be used. as \nthe blueprint for the much larger Free Trade Agreement of the Americas. \nIf this retreat from the principle of fair trade is repeated there, the \nnegative effects could be dramatic and felt throughout U.S. \nagriculture.\n  Wisconsin has paid a heavy price for CAFTA's predecessors. Since \n2000, Wisconsin has lost nearly 92,000 manufacturing jobs. NAFTA, the \nGATT, and most-favored-nation treatment for China have devastated local \nbusinesses and punished working families, taking away family-supporting \njobs, and offering lower-paying jobs, if any, in return.\n  When the impact of these agreements comes crashing down on people's \nlives, it is clear that we have already traded away too much in a \nseries of bad deals.\n  CAFTA promises more of the same devastation brought by the agreements \nthat have come before it, putting our businesses, workers and farmers \nat a competitive disadvantage, while also undermining the economic \ndevelopment that might benefit workers, farmers and small businesses in \nCentral America.\n  This trade agreement fails on every count. I urge my colleagues to \nscrap it and tell the administration to come back with a deal that is \nfair to American businesses, workers and farmers, as well as the small \nbusinesses, workers and farmers of our trading partners.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, under the order the Senator from New \nJersey is recognized next for 10 minutes. I ask unanimous consent he be \ngiven an additional 5 minutes, total of 15, and the time to be taken \nout of the time allocated to Senator Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from New Jersey is recognized.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana. \nToday I want to discuss the speech made by the President Tuesday night \nabout Iraq. I think it is encouraging that the President is reaching \nout to the country and attempting to explain his policy in Iraq. But I \nthink, to be more effective, the President has to be candid and upfront \nwith the American people.\n  Frankly, in my view, the credible speech on this subject should have \ncome from the Oval Office, not from a stage with uniformed service \npeople all around. Apparently, a patriotic backdrop behind the \nPresident, and rows of soldiers in dress uniforms, was necessary to \nspeak to the American people about the crisis our country faces in \nIraq. It was, I thought, good theater, but not a very informative \nspeech. Maybe that is why the soldiers didn't applaud until the White \nHouse staff urged them on.\n  Tuesday night's staged show reminded me of another Hollywood-type \nevent, when President Bush declared ``mission accomplished.'' We all \nremember this picture very clearly. It was on an aircraft carrier, with \nsigns up--their authorship was denied by lots of people. The Navy \npersonnel were standing there directly behind the President. The speech \ntook place on May 1, 2003, just slightly over 2 years ago, when the \nPresident said to the country at large that major combat was over in \nIraq.\n  How wrong he was. Before the ``mission accomplished'' speech on May \n1, we had lost 139 people and had about 500 of our troops wounded. \nSince President Bush's ``mission accomplished'' declaration, we have \nlost 1,594 Americans in Iraq--versus that 139, 2 years ago. Almost \n1,600 versus 139; and 12,000 seriously wounded versus 500 at the time, \nin that 2 years.\n  It has been a terrible 2 years. Despite the gigantic banner and the \ntheatrical presentation on the aircraft carrier 2 years ago, the \nmission was not accomplished then and it is not accomplished now. In \nfact, the mission isn't even close to being accomplished, as all of us \nin America, and I am sure the President is included, would like to see.\n  We are not going to solve our problems in Iraq through spin and photo \nops. We will solve these problems only with a tangible plan that gets \nour troops home and then we will all truly celebrate mission \naccomplished. Not only are we not seeing a plan, but high level \nadministration officials seem to be in serious disagreement about the \nstatus of the insurgency. One day we saw Vice President Cheney say that \nthe insurgency is in its ``last throes.'' Then a few days later we see \nSecretary Rumsfeld say that the insurgency could last ``12 years.''\n  This war has turned into a quagmire and Americans want to hear what \nchanges we are making to address our growing difficulties in Iraq, and \nunfortunately a lot of what we heard from the President Tuesday night \nwas rhetoric. Unfortunately, much of the President's rhetoric focused \non September 11. But simply referencing September 11 over and over \nagain does not explain how we are going to move forward in Iraq. In \nfact, it only serves to remind the American people that our most \ndangerous enemy, Osama bin Laden, is still on the loose, and we are all \nperplexed by the statement made by Mr. Goss, the head of intelligence, \nthat we know where Osama bin Laden is. I don't know why we don't go get \nhim if we know where he is.\n  Nearly 4 years after the 9/11 attacks, Osama bin Laden, the leader of \nthe terrorist group that killed almost 3,000 Americans, including 700 \nof our neighbors and friends from my State of New Jersey, continues to \ninflame his terrorist network. Al-Qaida cannot be effectively \ndismantled unless we capture bin Laden, and getting him should be our \nNo. 1 priority, but it seems it has moved its way down on the \nPresident's priority list.\n  I urge President Bush not to use September 11 again as a way to \nsupport our failures in Iraq. The American people would rather you \nsimply address the problems and fix them.\n  Poor planning for the war in Iraq is causing serious long-term \nproblems for our military. Mainly we are failing to meet our recruiting \ngoals. Yes, I know we had a blip up in the present month, but in May \nthe Army fell about 25 percent short of its recruiting target. That is \nafter they lowered their target. The Army also missed its monthly \ntargets in April and March and February of 2005, each month worse than \nthe one before. In February it fell 27 percent short. In March the gap \nwas 31 percent short. In April it was 42 percent. Things are so bad \nthat the Army is contemplating $40,000 signing bonuses for new \nrecruits. It reminds me of some of the bonuses offered athletes who \nsign contracts. That may rival what professional ballplayers get. And \nthe Army is perhaps going into a new deal that allows for very short \nenlistment periods, as low as 15 months of active duty.\n\n  The National Guard and Reserves are even farther behind in recruiting \nthis year. The Army Reserve met only 82 percent of its May recruitment \ngoal and the Marine Corps Reserve met only 88 percent of its recruiting \ngoal. This raises questions. Even if the President agrees to send more \ntroops to Iraq, where are they going to get them? I don't think it is \nsimply the casualty numbers that are hurting recruiting. It is a sense \nthat this administration does not have a plan for Iraq--and maybe they \nnever did. After all, in March of 2003 Vice President Cheney predicted \nthat the conflict would last ``weeks rather than months.'' Now it is \nyears and, according to Secretary Rumsfeld, it could be over a decade \nbefore the country is stabilized.\n  What about those Army service men and women who return to our country \nand become veterans? Look at how they are being treated by this \nadministration. My Democratic colleagues Senator Murray and Senator \nByrd tried three times to increase funding for the VA this year because \nthey understood that veterans returning from Iraq are going to need \nmore help. What happened? Republicans voted those amendments down each \ntime. Why? Because the administration kept saying ``we don't need the \nmoney.''\n  But just this week the VA Secretary, Jim Nicholson, suddenly realized \nhe is facing a $1 billion budget shortfall. Nicholson said it was \n``unexpected.'' Unexpected? How could they not expect increased needs \nfrom the troops coming back from Iraq? We know people are being \nseverely wounded there, and returning and needing a lot of attention. \nWhat kind of message does this send to our troops? We forgot to fund \nyour veterans health care needs? I think it is shameful and shows a \nlack of respect.\n  Only now, because of embarrassment, did we see the other side of the \naisle\n\n[[Page S7679]]\n\nvote for Senator Murray's amendment to increase VA funding. All of a \nsudden a prominent member of the Republican leadership, the junior \nSenator from Pennsylvania, after repeatedly opposing increases to VA \nfunding, has become an enthusiastic cheerleader. It is interesting how \nelections motivate people.\n  Our service men and women and their families are getting a raw deal. \nBecause of the administration's lack of planning, military families are \nstuck with extended tours of duty leading to family problems and \nserious financial difficulties. A real eye opener is to talk to some of \nthe Reserve and Guard people who have returned from Iraq and find \nthemselves in desperate situations with family problems, upset \nrelationships, financial disaster. It is terrible.\n  The bottom line is we need plain, straight talk coming out of the \nWhite House and not staged events such as ``mission accomplished'' in \nTuesday night's speech.\n  One of my distinguished Republican colleagues, a combat veteran of \nthe Vietnam war, recently said:\n\n       The White House is completely disconnected from reality.\n\n  And it is tragically true.\n  If the President wants to earn back the American people's trust on \nhis Iraqi planning, he needs to start by being truthful and admitting \nsome mistakes. So far that hasn't happened and I plead with the \nPresident and this administration: Level with the American people. It \nis a very discouraging picture out there when we see the casualties \nmount and the morass thicken.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor with this plea: Say it like it is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Central \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement--CAFTA. I have been a long-time supporter \nof expanding United States trading relationships. I believe trade is \nvital to the long-term health of the U.S. economy and to raising living \nstandards around the globe. Since my days as Governor, I have worked to \nopen markets around the world for Ohio's exports. Exports are extremely \nimportant to the Ohio economy. When I was Governor, exports were one of \nmy four economic development priorities.\n  During my tenure in the Senate I have supported the vast majority of \ntrade agreements that have been brought before the Senate. However, in \nthe last year and a half or so, I have been troubled by several aspects \nof our trade policies that I believe severely, and understandably, \nundermine the American people's support, as well as my own support, for \nnew trade agreements.\n  In particular, I believe the failure of the United States to properly \nenforce its existing trade agreements has contributed to growing \nskepticism of the American people about the benefits of trade. In \nparticular, the failure to enforce the intellectual property right \nprotections in our trade agreements has contributed to a proliferation \nof counterfeiting and pirating of American products across the globe.\n  I have met with numerous Ohio business leaders whose support for \ntrade has been severely tested when their company's products were \ncounterfeited by firms operating in countries whose governments simply \nrefuse to live up to their commitments to protect intellectual property \nrights.\n  I believe in free trade, but the cornerstone of free trade is the \nprotection of property rights. It is unreasonable to expect American \ncompanies to compete against companies from countries that do not abide \nby this basic principle.\n  Last year I was so troubled by the lack of enforcement of our trade \nagreements I decided the United States should hold off entering into \nany new trade agreements until our enforcement efforts dramatically \nimproved. Accordingly, I voted against the Australian and Moroccan Free \nTrade Agreements. Those were not popular votes, but they were necessary \nto draw attention to the need to enforce our trade agreements.\n  Although I have been critical of the way our trade agreements have \nbeen enforced, I remain committed to seeing the United States continue \nits leadership in promoting lower trade barriers and global trade. My \ncriticism is that of a friend of trade and one who wants to see the \nU.S. trade policy succeed.\n  Accordingly, I have been very pleased with the administration's new \nefforts to improve the enforcement of our trade agreements. Earlier \nthis year, I held a hearing by the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, the Federal \nWorkforce and the District of Columbia, to examine the administration's \nnew Strategy Targeting Organized Piracy or STOP! Program which aimed to \ncombat intellectual property theft abroad and help small and medium \nsize businesses protect their intellectual property. Although much more \nneeds to be done, STOP! is off to a very good start.\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate will familiarize themselves with \nthe STOP! program because it will be of great assistance to small \nbusinesses in States that have had their intellectual property rights \ninfringed upon.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I am very pleased with the efforts of Secretary of \nCommerce Thomas Gutierrez and my good friend Ambassador Rob Portman at \nUSTR to help several Ohio companies, victims of intellectual property \ntheft abroad. They have shown the importance of enforcing our trade \nagreements and are committed to improving our enforcement record, \nespecially in the area of property rights. I am very impressed by how \nmuch progress they have made during their short tenures in raising the \nissue of intellectual property rights abroad, and I am confident they \nwill continue to work closely with Congress to address trade issues.\n  Our trade policies are only as good as the people who execute them. I \nam pleased to say we have excellent leadership right now in Secretary \nGutierrez and Ambassador Portman. They both have a good background on \ntrade. Secretary Gutierrez has firsthand experience with trade issues \ndue to his work as CEO of Kellogg. Ambassador Portman has unique \nknowledge of trade legislation as a result of his work as a member of \nthe Ways and Means Committee while he was a Member of Congress.\n  Recently, I sent a letter to the President asking him to appoint a \ncoordinator for all of the agencies that deal with commerce--Commerce, \nthe Patent Office, USTR, Homeland Security, Customs, Border Patrol, and \nthe Justice Department. They need someone to coordinate them so they \nget the job done.\n  I was also pleased to hear Treasury Secretary Snow's comments earlier \nthis week that he is prepared to cite China if it does not address the \nyuan's overvalued exchange rate against the dollar.\n  In light of the administration's new effort to improve enforcement of \nour trade agreements and in consideration of the merits of the \nagreement, I have decided to support the Dominican Republic-Central \nAmerica-United States Free Trade Agreement. Passage of CAFTA will lay \nthe foundation for a growing and valuable trade relationship with CAFTA \ncountries as well as strengthen the U.S. leadership position in \npromoting global trade.\n  I believe CAFTA embodies precisely the type of long-term economic \nplanning that we too often fail to integrate into our policies. CAFTA \nwill not only facilitate the expansion of trade between the United \nStates and other CAFTA countries by eliminating most trade barriers but \nwill also help American companies get on the ground floor in those \ndeveloping countries, ahead of our competitors in Europe and in China.\n  Right now, the CAFTA countries have relatively small economies, but \nthey have made great progress over the last decade. Over the past 5 \nyears alone, U.S. exports to Central America have increased by 35 \npercent. As these countries continue to grow, we will see growing \ndemands for our exports. Presently, about 44 percent of the region's \nimports come from the United States, so as their economies expand, so \nwill purchases of American products.\n  Moreover, the United States has already accorded duty-free treatment \nto more than 80 percent of Central American imports to the United \nStates under the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act and other trade \nagreements. As a result, CAFTA is largely a one-way lowering of trade \nbarriers by the CAFTA countries and will measurably improve our \nopportunity to export to those countries.\n\n[[Page S7680]]\n\n  Presently, the CAFTA countries impose high tariffs on agricultural \nproducts, especially on several of Ohio's top agricultural exports such \nas soybeans, corn, dairy products, beef, and pork. Under CAFTA, these \ntariffs will be eliminated, making Ohio's agricultural exports much \nmore competitive in the CAFTA country. Since most agricultural products \nfrom CAFTA countries already enter the United States duty free, CAFTA \nlevels the playing field and gives American farmers the same access to \nthe markets in the CAFTA countries. For Ohio farmers, CAFTA is a good \ndeal. Not surprisingly, CAFTA has received support from the Farm \nBureau, the Ohio Cattlemen Association, Soybean Association, Poultry \nAssociation, and, of course, the Ohio Corn Growers Association.\n  CAFTA is also very important to the survival of the U.S. apparel \nindustry. Only with open access to CAFTA can American apparel compete \nwith China. Unless CAFTA is passed, we will see the entire American \napparel industry move to China.\n  CAFTA also improves the protection of intellectual property in the \nCAFTA countries. Under CAFTA's intellectual property provisions, they \nare obligated to ratify numerous international agreements on \nintellectual property rights to which the United States is already a \nsignatory and will be obligated to enforce intellectual property \nrights. The ratification of these agreements is a very important step \nto protecting American companies from intellectual property theft \nabroad. While some may argue that more needs to be done, the fact is, \nif CAFTA does not pass, American companies will not have the protection \nof even those basic agreements.\n\n  We often forget that trade agreements are about more than just trade. \nThey are key components of American foreign policy. They are one of the \nbest ways this country can develop better relationships around the \nglobe. At a time when I believe the United States badly needs to \nimprove its relationship with other countries, trade agreements offer \nus an excellent opportunity to reach out to the other countries and \nfoster economic ties.\n  The CAFTA countries are exactly the types of countries with which we \nshould build better relationships. After decades of civil wars, the \nCAFTA countries have made dramatic progress toward establishing \ndemocracy and market-based economies. Because the United States is \ntheir largest trading partner and foreign investor, the CAFTA countries \nneed a good trade relationship with the United States to fuel their \ndevelopment and help them to continue their reforms. By passing CAFTA, \nwe can help ensure that our southern neighbors succeed in their reforms \nand in the process greatly expand our influence in the region. I note \nthat President Jimmy Carter supports CAFTA for precisely this reason.\n  It is in the best strategic interest of the United States to see that \nCAFTA countries become successful republics and do not once again fall \nvictim to economic crises and civil wars. The existence of stable and \nprosperous countries in our southern border will not only be good for \nAmerican commerce but also good for American security.\n  Approval of CAFTA will also send an important signal to the countries \nin the region as well as other developing countries that the United \nStates is committed to assisting them in building their economies. If \nthe United States does not develop closer relationships with these \ncountries, they will undoubtedly look elsewhere for help, such as the \nEuropean Union or, more troubling, to Cuba, Venezuela, or China. \nRejection of CAFTA will only clear the way for our competitors to enter \nour backyard. In my opinion, a defeat of CAFTA is a victory for China \nand Cuba.\n  In addition to rejecting CAFTA, it would greatly damage Ambassador \nPortman's ability to open markets for U.S. exports at the Doha round of \nWTO negotiations and with respect to the planned trade agreement with \nthe Andean nations and for the free trade area of the Americas. The \nU.S. trading partners would have a reduced incentive to agree to open \ntheir markets to U.S. goods because they would claim, sincerely or \ntactically, that the U.S. commerce will not be willing to approve a \nfinal agreement. To get other countries to agree to politically \nunpopular reductions in trade barriers, the United States needs to have \ncredibility that it will do the same.\n  Since the end of World War II, the United States has been the driving \nforce in promoting trade liberalization. Because of U.S. leadership, \nglobal trade barriers have steadily fallen for nearly 60 years, greatly \nexpanding world trade and helping to improve living standards around \nthe world.\n  I believe it would be unfair to Ambassador Portman to reject CAFTA \nand undermine his ability to continue the U.S. leadership on trade, \nespecially given that he only recently assumed his post. Members who \nhave worked with Ambassador Portman know he is very talented and a \nskilled legislator and negotiator who understands the importance of \nclose consultations with Congress during the negotiation of any trade \nagreement. Hence, I think we have a great opportunity to improve \nCongress's involvement in the negotiation of trade agreements which \nwould build support for future trade agreements by having Congress's \nconcerns addressed early in the process. Too often, it comes in too \nlate.\n  We have somebody there as our new U.S. Trade Representative--and I \nhave spoken to him about it--who understands because of his legislative \nexperience that he needs to get over here and spend some time with \nCongress before the final touch is put on those trade agreements. By \nvoting down CAFTA, however, we would undermine Ambassador Portman's \nability to respond to our concerns in the future and negotiate better \nagreements.\n  CAFTA is a good agreement which will further integrate the United \nStates in the world economy and help ensure the United States remains \nthe world's leader in global trading.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this agreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have a rough understanding that Senator \nDorgan will speak next. He is not here.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask consent that it be charged \nequally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will respond to some of the speakers through the \ncourse of debate on this bill who pointed to a report of the \nInternational Trade Commission on CAFTA as evidence that this trade \nagreement is not meaningful to the United States.\n  Let me explain that the International Trade Commission is an agency \nof the Federal Government, but it is an agency that is very \nindependent, with 9-year terms for members to serve. They do a great \ndeal of research in international trade and are very well respected for \nthe reports they put out.\n  This report that was referred to as evidence of this trade agreement \nnot being helpful to the United States misrepresents the scope of the \nInternational Trade Commission estimates as well as the scale of the \nCAFTA agreement itself. Critics point to one part of the International \nTrade Commission report which estimates the tariff and quota \nliberalizations under the agreement will result in zero percent change \nin welfare for the United States.\n  Now, those critics ignore the Commission's conclusion that if CAFTA \nis fully implemented, overall U.S. welfare will increase in a range of \n$135 million to $248 million, with minimal impact on U.S. employment \nand output.\n  In fact, the Commission estimates that no sector of the U.S. economy \nis likely to experience a decline in output, revenue, or employment \ngreater than 2.5 percent once CAFTA is fully implemented.\n  So critics fail to acknowledge that the Commission's estimates are \nbased only on the tariff and quota liberalization provided under this \nagreement. The Commission's estimates do not\n\n[[Page S7681]]\n\nquantify the other very important elements of this agreement--which the \npeople using this report to justify a vote against CAFTA take into \nconsideration--such as the benefits from an improved regulatory \nenvironment, improved protection of intellectual property rights, \nefforts at trade facilitation, and liberalization of regulations \ngoverning investment and the provision of services we will sell to \nthose countries of CAFTA.\n  The Commission report does not attempt to quantify any broader \ngeopolitical benefit to the United States of improved economic well-\nbeing and political stability in the CAFTA countries as a result of the \nagreement. But the fact remains that those benefits--not referred to by \nthe opponents of this agreement, who find it convenient to quote one \npart of a trade commission study but not the whole study--the fact \nremains, then, that if you look at the whole report of the \nInternational Trade Commission, those benefits are a part of this \nagreement, as well, and will materialize and are obviously good reasons \nfor voting for this bill.\n  After some critics are done arguing that CAFTA is meaningless to the \nUnited States, they do, however, point to another part of the \nCommission's report and offer another doom-and-gloom scenario. They \npoint to the Trade Commission's estimates that suggest that once CAFTA \nis implemented we will increase our bilateral trade deficit with these \ncountries by as much as $110 million. Those critics ignore the \nCommission's conclusion that if you take into account likely changes in \nour global pattern of trade, once CAFTA is fully implemented, then our \noverall trade deficit is likely to decline by $750 million.\n  Now, how does the figure of $750 million get ignored, but a $110-\nmillion figure gets taken into consideration? Well, it is quite obvious \nthat the people who are quoting from this report quote what benefits \ntheir position for voting against CAFTA and do not look at the overall \nbeneficial impact of CAFTA on the United States.\n  That $750 million is a very important number. Our bilateral trade \nbalance with individual countries or regions may be interesting to \nconsider, but the one number that is of significance to our economic \nhealth is our overall trade deficit. According to the ITC, the \nInternational Trade Commission, CAFTA will help reduce that trade \ndeficit by $750 million.\n  Now, all the people crying about our trade deficit, are they going to \ntake into consideration $750 million? Why on Earth would we walk away \nfrom that benefit, as the opponents of this agreement will have the \nUnited States do with their ``no'' vote?\n  I hope this dispels the critics' misinformation about CAFTA. The fact \nis, when you read the ITC report in its entirety, it becomes clear that \nimplementing CAFTA offers meaningful benefits to the United States, \nboth in terms of improving the economic welfare of the United States \nand in terms of reducing our overall trade deficit.\n  Again, CAFTA offers us those benefits with minimal impact on U.S. \nemployment and output. That is not what Senator Grassley says, that is \nwhat the International Trade Commission says. And if you add all the \nother economic and geopolitical benefits that are not readily \nquantified, I believe the tremendous benefit of this agreement to the \nUnited States is then seen in its proper light.\n  So I urge my colleagues not to be misled by the critics. The ITC \nreport corroborates that CAFTA will be beneficial to the United States.\n  Also, let me suggest that during this debate, I have heard much talk \nabout the lack of Government policies concerning the trade deficit. I \nam not here to justify any trade deficit. I am not here to say those \npeople who say it is too big are wrong. But I think I have heard left \nout of this entire debate a policy that we have had under Republican \nand Democrat administrations for a long period of time, and that is, \nthe freedom of the American consumer to have access to any product made \nanywhere in the world that they want to buy. Because we believe in \nfreedom, we believe in choice for our consumers. We believe the \nconsumer ought to have the benefit of choice, of quality, and price. \nAnd we happen to have the consumers of America buying much and saving \nlittle.\n  Now, is that right? I do not know. But people who are concerned about \nour trade deficit, do they want to shut off the faucet that allows our \nconsumers to have the choice of anything? I may be speaking too \nsweepingly when I say this next sentence but I believe we let anything \ninto our country that consumers want to buy, except for pharmaceutical \ndrugs. Senator Dorgan and I have been working together to make sure the \nconsumer has that choice as well, to drive down prices, and give them \nthe best product they can get.\n  Now, I do not think anybody wants to take freedom of choice away from \nAmerican consumers. If we are spending too much on consumer products, \nimporting too much, maybe we ought to have more incentives for savings, \nmaybe we ought to be, without a doubt, enforcing our antitrust laws, \nantisurging laws, countervailing duties to be applied, and all those \nthings that need to be done about the problem that exists. But our \ndeficit is overwhelming because of consumer products coming into the \nUnited States.\n  Wal-Mart brings in $18 billion from China--$18 billion of our \nimports; just one company. Now, when you go to Wal-Mart--I don't care. \nI happen to go to a Wal-Mart some. I don't go there as much as I go to \nour small businesses in Iowa to buy things but occasionally go there. \nAre you going to take that choice away from the American consumer by \nnot having Wal-Mart import? I don't know. I don't see anybody \nsuggesting that.\n  Somehow we are led to believe that China is like a Japan with these \nbig surpluses. China has a trade deficit as well. China has 3 percent \nof our national debt in bonds. Japan has 8 percent. Yet you would think \nthat somehow that 3 percent is a major problem.\n  I would suggest that what we ought to be doing here is encouraging \nour consumers to buy American, buy American, or don't buy so much \nconsumer goods yourself, and invest that money that we send to Japan \nthrough Wal-Mart directly in U.S. bonds. Buy American products. Do as \nwe did in World War I and World War II, be patriotic and buy U.S. bonds \nto help our economy.\n  Consumers in America are king. And when consumers in America decide \nto cut down on our trade deficit, it will be cut down. I think \nconsumers ought to continue to be king in America because that is \neconomic freedom, that is individualism, that is America.\n  Mr. DORGAN. As to the question is all this a good thing, has it \nstrengthened our country, or is this just gloom and doom by those who \noppose the current trade strategy, my colleague is quite right, this is \nnot a strategy that is just the George W. Bush strategy. This strategy \nhas developed over about 25 years, although I must say that this \nadministration is the most helpful to corporate interests that I have \nseen. But it is not just a strategy of the last year or two.\n  But it is hard--very hard--to take a look at these devastatingly \ndangerous trade deficits that get worse and worse and worse, and then \nhear some people say it is getting better and better and better for us. \nIt is, of course, not getting better for us.\n  Ronald Reagan used to tell that old story about the young boy who \nwould look at the pile of manure and insist there must be a Shetland \npony someplace. The fact is, there is no Shetland pony here. This is \nbad news. And the quicker we decide to confront it, look it square in \nthe eye and decide as a country to do something about it, the better \nfor our country.\n  The question is about freedom. I agree with that. It is about \nfreedom, freedom for the American consumer, also freedom for American \nworkers to be able to reasonably expect in this great country they will \nbe able to find a decent job that pays well with benefits. That is \nfreedom that is important as well.\n  When American workers are told on a Monday or a Friday--most \ncharacteristically a Friday--by Maytag or by Levi's or by Fruit of the \nLoom or by Fig Newton cookies or by Huffy bicycles or by Schwinn--and I \ncould go on--that their job no longer exists because their employer has \nthe freedom to get rid of them and hire somebody for 30 cents an hour--\nthat is freedom. Yes, that is freedom.\n\n[[Page S7682]]\n\n  What does it do to the country we built? This country was built on a \ndebate in this Chamber about a wide range of critically important \nissues: Should you have the right to organize as workers? Should you \nhave the right to expect to be able to work in a safe workplace? Should \nyou have child labor laws? Should you prevent dumping pollution into \nthe skies and the streams of this country and this world? We fought \nthat battle for 100 years.\n  Now those who want to avoid those onerous restrictions pole vault \nover all of them and say: My jobs are going to China. And you American \nworkers? Sayonara. See you later. Goodbye. So long. It doesn't matter. \nYou were just tools. You were like a wrench or a pair of pliers, ready \nto be thrown away when we were done with you.\n  I have a lot to talk about this afternoon and a fair amount of time \nin which to do it. I yield to my colleague from Colorado, Senator \nSalazar, 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the Dominican \nRepublic-Central America-Free Trade Agreement. At the outset, let me \nsay I appreciate the efforts of Commerce Secretary Gutierrez and his \nheartfelt advocacy for this agreement. I look forward to working with \nhim to create jobs in Colorado and on trade and commerce issues, \nincluding future revisions to this trade agreement. I have spent the \nlast several months learning more about the CAFTA agreement, listening \nto individual farmers and ranchers throughout Colorado on their \nconcerns about being left behind. Based on extensive deliberation, I \nregret that I must oppose this agreement because it continues a policy \nin Washington that forgets huge parts of our country. Let me summarize \nmy opposition to this agreement.\n  First, there are huge parts of our country, including the eastern \nplains of Colorado, which have been forgotten by administration after \nadministration, and they continue to wither on the vine. Those rural \ncommunities that continue to decline in population are going to be \nimpacted in a very negative way by the implementation of the CAFTA \nagreement.\n  Secondly, I am troubled by the fact that we have not had a policy to \ndeal with the real geopolitical challenges that we face with Central \nand South America. When one thinks back to the days of John Fitzgerald \nKennedy and his announcement of an Alliance for Progress for the \nAmericas, he had a strategy with respect to how we are going to make \nfriends both to the north and to the south, that we are going to help \nto rebuild the democracies of Central and South America.\n  We have not seen that kind of a comprehensive policy from this \nadministration. Instead, what we have seen is an episodic approach to \ndealing with the issues of Latin America. It is for those reasons that \nI have decided to oppose this agreement.\n  In my State of Colorado, I have seen firsthand the forgotten America. \nSurveys done by the Colorado Department of Agriculture have cited \nsteady declines in the number of cattle across my State. The inventory \nof cattle is reported the lowest in Colorado since 1962. Furthermore, \nin 2002, 60 percent of farms and ranches in Colorado had annual sales \nof less than $10,000. Specifically, the eastern plains of Colorado, \nwhich would be the place most impacted by the CAFTA agreement, is truly \nthe place where you see the forgotten America in its most difficult of \ntimes. It is home to farmers and ranchers and small communities that \nare vanishing, left behind by a Washington, DC, that has lost touch \nwith what is important to the people and to the communities of the \nheartland. The eastern plains of Colorado is also home to the sugar \nbeet farmers of my State who, in 2002, in order to save their farms, \nbanded together with over 1,000 other sugar beet growers in Nebraska, \nMontana, and Wyoming to form the Western Sugar Cooperative, a sugar \nprocessing facility which continues to successfully operate today \nacross Colorado and the other States. In order for them to do that, \nthey mortgaged their homes, their farms, their ranches, their tractors \nin order to be able to build this facility for the good of the rural \ncommunities and the operations they represent.\n  The sugar beet growers believe that DR-CAFTA will set a precedent. It \nis a precedent that will send a message to our trade representatives \nthat Congress will continue to allow haphazard negotiations of free-\ntrade agreements like CAFTA that will chip away at important industries \nand programs here in the United States. I will do all I can not to let \nthese families and these communities continue to wither on the vine.\n  At the same time, the International Trade Commission has stated that \nthe U.S. trade deficit with CAFTA countries is projected to grow by \nmore than $100 million. As my good friend from North Dakota said, \nspeaking about the trade imbalance we are facing, this agreement will \nadd to the trade imbalance of our country. Therefore, other Colorado \norganizations and many farmers and ranchers from throughout my State \nhave joined together in opposition to CAFTA. It is uncommon in my \nState, frankly, to find the Colorado Farm Bureau and the Rocky Mountain \nFarmers Union coming together and speaking with one voice, saying this \nagreement is bad for agriculture. Yet it has happened with respect to \nthis agreement. They both say this agreement is bad for agriculture.\n  I also recognize that trade agreements are fundamentally geopolitical \ndocuments with important impacts on our foreign policy. It pains me \npersonally to have to vote against this agreement. I do so because I \nrecognize that many of our friends in these six countries see it as an \nimportant symbol of America's commitment to them. It pains me that I am \nnot able to vote for this agreement. I do so, looking back at the \nhistory of our relationship between the United States and the Central \nAmerican countries. During the 1980s, this country spent $5 billion on \nCentral America in an effort to ensure that democracy and freedom \nmarkets triumphed in that part of our troubled world. Because of the \ncourage and strength of our Central American friends, like \nArchbishop Oscar Romero, we see a region today that is defined by \ndemocracy and freedom, a region about which we could only have dreamed \na short 20 years ago.\n\n  It is in that context that I have come to conclude that this \nagreement is a missed opportunity. Twenty years ago, you could not pick \nup a newspaper anywhere in the United States without a headline on the \nfront page talking about some event or some episode in Central America. \nToday those countries barely merit a mention in an occasional \nnewspaper. Presidents in the last 100 years have pursued the good \npolicy, the Alliance for Progress, and the Summit of the Americas, and \nso forth. These policies have been pursued through administrations in \ndiffering parties, Democrats and Republicans, but they all shared a \nsense of commitment and focus on Latin America. I am sad to conclude \nthat the last several years have seen a policy that has been, at best, \ndisinterested in the issues of South America and Central America.\n  Consider this: The President's flagship foreign assistance program, \nthe Millennium Challenge, has yet to distribute a single dime to \nCentral America. Next, in the President's budget request for this year, \nGovernment investments in each of the countries subject to this \nagreement were cut, not increased. And finally, Latin America rarely \nappears in the administration's public remarks, despite the challenges \nof extreme poverty in Central America and democratic instability \nthroughout the Andean region of South America. Supporters of this \nagreement are now telling us that to vote against CAFTA is to vote \nagainst Latin America. That could only be true if you believe that our \npolicy toward this important region should be based only on a single \ntrade agreement. It is not. It should not be. I have personally urged \nthe President to work with members of both parties to reinvigorate our \npolicy toward this important region of our world.\n  Such a policy would do a number of things. For example, it would \nconsolidate the democratic gains the region has made throughout the \nlast two decades by investing in democratic parties. Instead of \ndeepening democracy, the United States seems paralyzed as we watch \ndemocracy take hits in countries such as Venezuela and Bolivia. Next, \nwe must battle underdevelopment in the region by investing in its\n\n[[Page S7683]]\n\npeople and microenterprise, health care, and education. Instead, Latin \nAmerica is the only region that has not seen increases in U.S. \nGovernment investment in the last several years. Finally, we should \nfight corruption and deepen law enforcement cooperation to fight the \nscourge of illegal narcotics that passes through Central America on its \nway to our streets, affecting our kids and increasing criminality \nwithin our own communities.\n  Such a policy should be, and must be, based on a vision larger than a \nsingle agreement. I regret that the tremendous energy the \nadministration is now expending on this agreement has not laid out a \nvision and plan for the larger challenges, such as illegal immigration, \ndrug trafficking, poverty, and the other issues that affect this \nimportant region of our hemisphere. That is why, in my view, this \nagreement represents a lost opportunity of action for our Nation.\n  Lastly, let me say that I support trade for the Americas. I support \ntrade for our Nation. I recognize that increased trade is good for our \neconomy, for our businesses, farmers, workers, and families. But again, \nI wish we were here today talking about how we are opening new markets \nfor our producers. Even under the most optimistic scenario, when this \nagreement is fully implemented, U.S. world exports are expected to \nincrease by only a minuscule amount, if at all, to this small region. \nWe simply need to do better at opening new markets, not just spend our \ntime fighting to keep those we already have. If we spend all of our \ntime fighting yesterday's battles on market access, we will miss the \nopportunity to leverage the major market opportunities that we have. \nThat is why I have spent much of my first 6 months in the Senate \nworking with the Department of Commerce and State to promote new \nmarkets, particularly for Colorado's agricultural products. That is why \nI asked Secretary Gutierrez to come to Denver last weekend to speak \nwith Colorado's business, labor, and agricultural leaders. I am \ngrateful for the Secretary having made this trip. I appreciated his \ncandid discussion with my constituents in Colorado. That is why I have \nmet with the Ambassador of China to urge him to send a trade delegation \nto Colorado on trade opportunities. And that is why I met with the \ndirector of the Taiwan Economic and Cultural Office to urge Taiwan to \nsend a delegation to Colorado for the same reason.\n  At the end of the day, I am hopeful there will be a CAFTA I can \nsupport. But just as importantly, I hope even more that we, as a \nFederal Government, will redouble our efforts to promote American \nexports into new markets around the world, including our own backyard.\n  As I have deliberated on how to vote on this important agreement, I \nhave thought a lot about Archbishop Romero, a courageous voice for \ndignity, change, and opportunity in Central America, and the lessons \nthat we learned from his martyrdom in El Salvador. Shortly before he \nwas assassinated, he said in Spanish:\n  El Reino esta ya misteriosamente presente en nuestra tierra; cuando \nvenga el Senor, se consumara Esta es la esperanza que nos alienta a los \ncristianos. Sabemos que todo esfuerzo por majorar una sociedad, sobre \ntodo cuando esta tan metida esa injusticia y el pecado, es un esfuerzo \nque Dios bendice, que Dios quiere, que Dios nos exige.\n\n       (English translation of the above statement is as follows:)\n\n  God's reign is already present on our Earth in mystery. When the Lord \ncomes, it will be brought to perfection. That is the hope that inspires \nChristians. We hope that every effort to better society, especially \nwhen injustice and sin are so ingrained, is an effort that God blesses, \nthat God wants, that God demands of us.\n  This agreement is not our best work as a nation. As we try to improve \nour society and the societies of Central America and the Dominican \nRepublic, we can do better.\n  I hope we get the chance to do better. I look forward to working with \nthe administration to craft a better agreement with CAFTA.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from Colorado. \nThese have not been easy issues for him. I appreciate his position and \nunderstand it fully. I think he has represented that position well in \nthe comments he offered today. We share--perhaps in some cases for \ndifferent reasons--a feeling that this trade agreement is not a good \none for our country.\n  I yield 10 minutes to my colleague from Michigan, Senator Stabenow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my friend and eloquent leader on \nthis issue, the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. President, I rise today, also, to share my great concern about \nthis agreement and to oppose what I view as an unfair trade agreement. \nWe can do much better than this. This country has been in an economic \nslump since 2001, and since then we have lost more than 2.7 million \nmanufacturing jobs. Certainly, in my State, it has never been more \nclear as we see the headlines every day regarding job loss, jobs going \nto Mexico, China, and India--every day, headline after headline.\n  At the same time, we have grown record budget deficits and a record \ntrade deficit. Workers are losing their health care and higher \neducation is becoming even more expensive. What is the response? Well, \nthe administration decides to push through a CAFTA trade agreement that \nwill dig the job holes even deeper. This makes absolutely no sense to \nme.\n  This agreement will cost us jobs. It will increase our trade deficit. \nIt will hurt our country's middle class, the backbone of our economy, \nour way of life. What makes us different from other countries is that \nrather than just having a few very wealthy people and a lot of poor \npeople, we have a vibrant middle class, people who work hard, save, put \ntheir kids through college, and they know they can count on having--up \nuntil this point--a pension when they retire or they receive health \ncare through their jobs. All of that is at risk right now for the \npeople in Michigan and others around the country.\n  This fight that we are having, this debate, is critically important. \nI think there is not a more critical debate to have on whether we are \ngoing to continue to support American businesses and American jobs and \nthe American middle class. That is really what is at stake. We should \npass legislation that will be creating jobs. We should be passing \nlegislation that will lower the trade deficit and will create more \naccess to health care, lowering the cost of care and for college. There \nis a lot we should be doing.\n  Unfortunately, I have concluded that this trade pact really moves us \nbackward. It will lead us to more offshoring of American jobs. It would \nbe better titled ``NAFTA part II.''\n  However, so that I am not misunderstood, I do support trade. \nObviously, the debate about trade or not to trade is not the right \ndebate anymore. You could not put a wall up around this country if you \nwanted to. The Internet reaches anywhere. The question is, Are we going \nto be smart so that we can compete up rather than down, compete in a \nway that increases the middle class in other countries that will buy \nour products rather than losing our middle class and exporting our \njobs? What is at stake here is really fundamental.\n\n  I have supported trade agreements in the past. In fact, I voted in \nfavor of six trade agreements in the last 4 years. I will give you an \nexample of one of them. I supported the United States-Australia trade \nagreement because our economies are similar. Our workers get paid \nroughly the same amount of money. Our companies can sell their products \nin Australia because it has a high minimum wage, sound environmental \nlaws, and good labor standards. We can sell and trade back and forth.\n  Unfortunately, the CAFTA agreement does exactly the opposite. This \npacket will ship jobs overseas and provide fewer export markets for \nAmerican companies, and it is because in these countries the minimum \nwage is very low. In Guatemala, the minimum wage is 25 cents an hour. I \ndon't want our workers having to compete with 25 cents an hour. You \ncannot live on that. Mr. President, how can we expect to export to a \nmarket and compete with an economy where workers make 25 cents an hour, \nand there are no basic\n\n[[Page S7684]]\n\nenvironmental laws and labor standards? I want to compete with a \ncountry where you can drink their water, where they can live on their \nwage, where we are competing up, not down.\n  I believe we should try to support agreements that actually lift up \nworkers in other countries as well as our own, as I said, so they can \npurchase our products. That is not what this does. Tragically, the \ncountries involved in the CAFTA agreement are poor countries. For \nexample, the median GDP in Nicaragua is only $2,300 a year. And 40 \npercent of all workers covered under the agreement survive on less than \n$2 per day. It would make sense if we were putting in place an \nagreement that would raise those wages so they can buy our products. \nBut I fear, from what I have seen in the past, that will not be the \ncase. The entire purchasing power of all six of the CAFTA countries \ncombined is less than the purchasing power of half of the city of \nDetroit.\n  We are not competing on an equal playing field in this CAFTA \nagreement. I ask, how many Nicaraguans are going to be able to buy a \n$20,000 automobile made in Michigan? We want them to buy cars made in \nMichigan, by the way, Mr. President. We all know those who don't \nunderstand history are forced to repeat it. I am afraid that is what is \nhappening.\n  When we look at NAFTA, after Congress passed NAFTA, hundreds of \nthousands of American jobs were lost to Mexico. It is still happening. \nLast year, Electrolux, a plant in Greenville, MI, that makes \nrefrigerators, announced they were going to move to Mexico, with 2,700 \ngood-paying jobs gone. Why? So they can pay $1.50 an hour in Mexico, \nwith no health benefits. This is having a devastating effect on a small \ntown community in the middle of Michigan. That is not the only story. \nThere are hundreds of those.\n  Right now, if we use NAFTA as a comparison, we see that over the past \n11 years U.S. workers have lost nearly a million jobs due to the \ngrowing trade deficits with our NAFTA partners. During the same time \nperiod, real wages in Mexico went down. Now, it would be different if \nit were true that wages went up, as we often hear, because that would \nmake sense economically. But instead, in Mexico, wages have fallen, \nwhile the number of people living in poverty in Mexico has actually \ngrown. It makes no sense to follow that line out again with another \ntrade agreement. Since NAFTA took effect in 1994, the U.S. trade \ndeficit with Canada and Mexico has ballooned to 12 times its pre-NAFTA \nsize, reaching $111 billion in 2004.\n  I believe we can expect more of the same from CAFTA, unfortunately. \nWe can do better than this for American farmers, we can do better for \nAmerican businesses, we can do better for American workers, and for \nAmerican families. I hope we will reject this proposal and send them \nback to the drawing board. There are other models, other prototypes \nthat have gotten it right. There are other agreements we have voted for \non this floor that do a better job of creating and protecting our \nmiddle class and our jobs and businesses in America than this \nagreement. We can do better than this. We need to do better than this. \nI urge my colleagues to reject this agreement.\n  We are once again rushing into a trade agreement that doesn't help, \nand in fact, has the potential to hurt American workers and their \nfamilies.\n  This country has been in an economic slump since 2001. Since that \ntime, we have lost more than 2.7 million manufacturing jobs.\n  At the same time, we have grown record budget deficits and record \ntrade deficits. Workers are losing their health care and higher \neducation is becoming ever more expensive. And, in Michigan we suffer \nfrom the nation's highest state unemployment rate.\n  What is this administration's response? It has decided to push the \nCAFTA trade treaty that will dig the jobs hole even deeper. And, the \nadministration has stripped out a trade adjustment assistance provision \nthat would have helped workers displaced by CAFTA.\n  This trade pact moves this Nation backwards. It will lead to more \noffshoring of American jobs.\n  It will cost us jobs, increase our trade deficit and hurt our \ncountry's middle class. It will turn the haves into the have-mores and \nthe have-nots into have-nothings.\n  We should be negotiating trade agreements that involve exporting \nproducts, not jobs and we should pass legislation that will help create \njobs, lower our trade deficit, and help working families get access to \nhealth care and college.\n  However, so that I am not misunderstood I support free trade on a \nlevel playing field. I have voted in favor of six free-trade agreements \nover the past 4 years.\n  For example, I voted for the U.S. Australia Free Trade Agreement \nbecause when we trade with Australia we trade on a level playing field.\n  That agreement works because our economies are similar and our \nworkers get paid roughly the same wage. Our companies can sell their \nproducts in Australia because it has a high minimum wage, sound \nenvironmental laws and good labor standards.\n  Unfortunately, the CAFTA agreement goes in exactly the opposite \ndirection.\n  This agreement will ship jobs overseas and provide few export markets \nfor American companies.\n  My State of Michigan certainly will not benefit because this \nagreement does not provide a meaningful export market for Michigan \nmanufacturers.\n  That is because in order to have an export market you need to be \nselling to people who can afford your goods. But the typical wage in \nthe CAFTA countries is very low.\n  Tragically, these countries are poor. For example, the median GDP in \nNicaragua is only $2,300 per year.\n  And 40 percent of all workers covered under this agreement survive on \nless than $2 per day.\n  The entire purchasing power of all six of the CAFTA countries \ncombined is half that of the city of Detroit alone.\n  In Guatemala, the minimum wage is approximately 25 cents an hour.\n  How can we expect to export to a market where workers make 25 cents \nan hour and lack basic environmental laws and labor standards?\n  We should try to lift up the impoverished workers in these countries \nso they can purchase American made products. But this agreement will \nnot do that.\n  As we all know, those who do not understand history are forced to \nrepeat it. Let's take a look at what has happened in recent history.\n  After Congress passed NAFTA, hundreds of thousands of American jobs \nwere lost to Mexico. And it is still happening. Just last year, \nElectrolux closed a plant in Greenville, MI, and put 2,700 high paid \nworkers on the street.\n  Despite the fact that the company was making a profit and its workers \nwere productive, the management closed the plant in Greenville and will \nsoon open a new one in Mexico.\n  If we use NAFTA as a comparison we see that over the past 11 years \nU.S. workers have lost nearly 1 million jobs due to growing trade \ndeficits with our NAFTA partners.\n  During the same time, real wages in Mexico have fallen while the \nnumber of people living in poverty there has grown, according to the \nCarnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n  Since NAFTA took effect in 1994, the U.S. trade deficit with Canada \nand Mexico has ballooned to 12 times its pre-NAFTA size, reaching $111 \nbillion in 2004. Imports from our NAFTA partners outpaced exports to \nthem by more than $100 billion, displacing workers in industries as \ndiverse as autos, aircraft, apparel and consumer electronics.\n  I believe we can expect more of the same under CAFTA.\n  American farmers have also felt the impacts of NAFTA. We quickly \ndiscovered that this trade deal was no deal because it accelerated the \nagricultural products trade deficit.\n  Consider that in the three years before NAFTA our trade surplus with \nMexico and Canada increased by $203 million.\n  After NAFTA, our surplus fell by $1.5 billion.\n  The result is that some American crops, like tomatoes, have been \npushed to the brink of extinction.\n  Also, in 1994, Congress passed the General Agreement on Tariffs and \nTrade more commonly known as GATT.\n  After we signed that agreement, we began to lose jobs to India, \nIndonesia and other East Asian countries.\n\n[[Page S7685]]\n\n  Now, workers in India are doing thousands of jobs that Americans used \nto do.\n  They now staff call centers, provide technical support for our \ncomputer networks, and even process our tax forms and read our medical \nx-rays.\n  To make matters worse, we passed so called most favored trade status \nfor China in 1998. And since then, hundreds of thousands of Americans \njobs are now done in China.\n  Mr. President, you would think that after what has happened after \nprevious trade agreements that we would know better than to pass \nanother free trade agreement with countries that don't share our wage \nstructure, labor standards, or environmental standards.\n  Before we pass another free-trade agreement, why don't we first \nenforce our existing trade agreements.\n  Currently, two of our major trading partners, China and Japan, are \nviolating world trade rules by manipulating their currencies, which has \nthe effect of making their products cheaper here and our products more \nexpensive over there.\n  Additionally, China refuses to seriously combat the rampant \ncounterfeiting of auto parts.\n  This hurts Michigan companies and costs American workers their jobs. \nThis is unacceptable.\n  That is why I, along with Senators Graham and Bayh, have introduced a \nbill that would create a trade prosecutor. This ambassador-level \nposition within the office of the U.S. Trade Representative would be \nappointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, with the \nauthority to ensure compliance with trade agreements to protect our \nmanufacturers against unfair trade practices.\n  In practical terms, this prosecutor will have the authority to \ninvestigate and recommend prosecuting cases before the World Trade \nOrganization and under trade agreements to which the United States is a \nparty.\n  Senator Grassley has assured me that this approach would be seriously \ndebated while we continue to move forward on trade reauthorization and \nI look forward to working with him on this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  In addition to enforcing our current trade laws, we should pass other \nlegislation that would help protect our jobs.\n  First, we should close loopholes in the tax code that actually reward \ncompanies for shipping jobs overseas. Senator Dorgan has introduced \nsuch legislation to do so. Why aren't we passing that in the Senate?\n  Second, why don't we help our companies deal with the runaway cost of \nhealth care so they can be more competitive overseas and keep our jobs \nhere?\n  Third, why aren't we more aggressively moving comprehensive pension \nreform to help our workers and companies through this very difficult \neconomic time?\n  Fourth, while we are building infrastructure over in Iraq, why can't \nwe do the same here at home? Our roads, bridges, transit systems, and \nsewer systems are in dire need of repair. Why aren't we setting aside \nthe resources now to repair them? Doing so would create hundreds of \nthousands of new jobs.\n  Finally, why aren't we doing more to invest in new science and \ntechnology so our companies can better compete in the future? With very \nlittle federal funding, we are on the verge of producing a commercially \nviable hydrogen car and being the leader in the world on stem cell \nresearch.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask my colleagues, why aren't we using our time \nto pass job producing legislation? How can we ask our workers to \ncompete against economies that don't allow for collective bargaining, \nthat don't maintain reasonable environmental standards, and don't \nmaintain workplace safety requirements on par with the U.S.?\n  It is not fair to their workers and it is certainly not fair to our \nworkers.\n  Why don't we work with these countries to help lift up their workers? \nLet's work with them to raise wages, provide health care, protect their \nenvironment and then we can enter into a free-trade agreement.\n  This agreement represents a race to the bottom.\n  A race to the bottom makes the world a poorer place--not a richer \none.\n  There are many things we can do to increase our trade with the world \nin a commonsense way. CAFTA is not one of them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of this \nagreement. Twelve years ago, I rose in this Chamber to speak about \nNAFTA to express a vision that free trade will one day encompass all of \nNorth, Central, and South America. Today, we have an opportunity to \nfurther that vision by entering into an agreement that will strengthen \nU.S. trade relations and promote democratic reform in Central America.\n  CAFTA will provide the U.S. exports with market access to Central \nAmerica, similar to the duty-free access we have given Central American \nexports. Although nearly 80 percent of Central American and the \nDominican Republic exports enter the U.S. duty free, America continues \nto pay high tariffs on over $1.5 billion of annual exports to Central \nAmerica, our tenth largest export market globally.\n  CAFTA rectifies this inconsistency by providing open market access to \nU.S. goods, services, and farm product exports. Specifically, over 80 \npercent of U.S. consumer and industrial product exports to Central \nAmerica and the Dominican Republic will be duty free immediately upon \nimplementation of CAFTA. The remaining tariffs are phased out over 10 \nyears.\n  Almost 20 years ago, Central American countries were ruled by \ndictators and communist insurgencies creating chaos and fostering \ncorruption. With American support and encouragement, Central America \nhas evolved into a region of fragile democracies. Elected leaders are \nwelcoming freedom and encouraging economic diversity, while looking to \nthe United States for a means to develop a mutually beneficial \nrelationship. CAFTA allows the United States to strengthen the economic \nties we currently have with Central America and the Dominican Republic, \nwhile supporting political stability.\n  History shows us that bilateral and regional free-trade agreements \npromote economic growth by significantly increasing U.S. exports. In my \nhome State of Texas, exports to Chile have doubled since the Chile \nfree-trade agreement was implemented in 2004. The success of NAFTA in \nthe last 10 years yields similar results. Since NAFTA was implemented, \ncombined exports from America to Mexico and Canada have increased by \nmore than 150 percent in Texas, and 113 percent nationally.\n  CAFTA shows the same promise and encourages U.S. growth as well. One \nout of ten jobs in the United States depends on exports. Similarly, \nforeign companies which invest in the United States create jobs. In \nfact, since 1990, foreign companies have invested more than $1.5 \ntrillion and employed more than 6 million U.S. workers. Free-trade \nagreements encourage export growth and help create jobs.\n  I think it is important, also, to look at this from a hemispheric \npoint of view. I do believe that it is important that we have free \ntrade from the very north, Canada, all the way through the tip of South \nAmerica. Strengthening our hemisphere will be good for America, and it \nwill be good for every country in this hemisphere. It will also help us \nwith many of the problems that we face with disparate economies. Many \nof our immigration issues come from people wanting to come to the \nUnited States because they cannot earn a living for their own families \nwhere they live. It is not that they want to leave their countries, it \nis that they are trying to provide for their families. If we have more \nfree trade in our hemisphere, people will be able to support their \nfamilies where they live, and we will have healthy economic relations \nwith those countries rather than dealing with that on the basis of an \nimmigration problem.\n  So I do think that as we are looking at the places where we can \nstrengthen economies, and where it is in our best interests to \nstrengthen economies, we should look in our own backyard. We are having \ntrade issues with China and with the European Union. Why not look to \nour own hemisphere, our own backyard, for strengthened relationships? \nThat is what CAFTA will continue us on the right track to do. We have \nNAFTA and now we have Canada,\n\n[[Page S7686]]\n\nthe United States and Mexico; we have Chile and we have other countries \nin South America. I think the Central American agreement will add \nanother component to that.\n  I want free trade with every country in South America with which we \ncan get an agreement. This is a very important part of our long-term \nstability and the strength of our economy and the economy of our whole \nhemisphere.\n  I hope we will look at the big picture. I know that many Senators are \nconcerned about jobs in their States and the impact this might have. \nMany people in Texas were very concerned about NAFTA because of the \nlabor being less expensive just across the border, but NAFTA has been \nan overall plus for Texas, as it has been for America. We want to \ncontinue to strengthen our relationships with Mexico, Central America, \nand all the way through the tip of South America.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this agreement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time I consumed be charged to \nSenator Grassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield such time as I may consume from my \nallocation.\n  There has been some discussion today about the U.S. International \nTrade Commission report on the CAFTA agreement. One of the complaints \nalthough not stated directly, is that this is an independent agency. \nFunny thing, independent agencies seem to be the most reliable \nagencies, at least, they are around this town. We do not get material \nfrom them that is colored one way or the other. It is an independent \nanalysis.\n  This probably is the most devastating critique of CAFTA. We have all \nof these people who load up their saddlebags and rush to the floor of \nthe Senate telling us how wonderful this is going to be. They pull out \nall the goodies and say how terrific this trade agreement is for \nAmerica. The problem is it is at odds with the independent analysis \nfrom the U.S. International Trade Commission.\n  They say effects of tariff removal under this agreement are likely to \nresult in virtually no benefit to our country. They say there will be \nlittle or no benefit to U.S. consumers. It says little or no change in \nU.S. production in distinct industry sectors, with one exception; the \nlargest decrease in production is for manufactured sugar and sugar \ncrops, of which the output of both will decrease.\n  Then it says this will increase our trade deficit by $100 million. I \ndon't know, maybe it is confusing to throw facts into this discussion \nabout theology and economics and trade and all the things that are \ngoing on here. But here is a set of facts that is pretty hard for \npeople to refute. They say, I have heard: ``You have to read the entire \nITC report.'' I don't know, maybe so. I have looked at this report. I \nam reading the summary and the sector results, and it says if we sign \non to this trade agreement, there is really no benefit to American \nconsumers, virtually no benefit to American consumers, but a detriment \nto sugar producers and an increase in the trade deficit by $100 \nmillion.\n  I went to a really small school, but I learned in a small school that \nthis would add up to a net deficit for our country. I do not understand \nhow someone looks at this and says: ``All right, I have looked at this. \nIt says this is bad for our country, but I think it is good for our \ncountry. And the problem is this is an independent agency.''\n  That is a problem having an independent analysis on issues such as \nthis that take off the rosy glasses and say: Look, here is what you are \ndealing with.\n  Let me put a few charts up to show a few of the facts. I have said \nmany times that everyone is entitled to their own opinion on this \nfloor, but not everybody is entitled to their own set of facts. Facts \nare stubborn things. Let's talk about them.\n  Since NAFTA began in 1994--that is the North American Free Trade \nAgreement--that is when we hooked Mexico and Canada with our trade. At \nthat point, we had a slight trade surplus with Mexico. We have been \nable to ratchet that up to a huge deficit through this trade agreement. \nWe had a modest trade deficit with Canada, and that has now become a \nhuge trade deficit through this agreement.\n  We have lost about 71,000 family farms. We have had a drop in \nagricultural trade surplus with Mexico and Canada by 71 percent. There \nhave been 900,000 manufacturing jobs lost. There has been a drop in net \nfarm income of 22 percent.\n  I have told my colleagues, and I will tell them again, one day I \ndrove to the Canadian border with a farmer named Earl Jensen. We got up \nto that border with a 12-year-old orange truck. This little old orange \ntruck had about 150 bushels of durum wheat on it. So in an old orange \ntruck, we pull up to the Canadian border. All the way to the United \nStates-Canadian border, we had been meeting trucks hauling Canadian \nwheat into our country at secret prices which had been set by the \nCanadian Wheat Board, a sanctioned state monopoly in Canada that would \nbe illegal in our country. All the way to our border we met these 18 \nwheelers hauling Canadian grain into our country.\n  Earl Jensen and I, with our little orange truck, get to the border, \nand they would not let us through. You cannot take American durum into \nCanada. It was not just us with the orange truck. There was a woman \nfrom Bowman, ND, who married a Canadian. She went to Canada for \nThanksgiving. She got some wheat, put it in a paper sack and put it in \nthe car because she wanted to use that to grind up and produce whole \nwheat bread. ``You cannot do that,'' they said, when she got to the \nborder. ``You have to dump out that sack of wheat.'' At the same time, \nwe were flooded with Canadian durum coming into our country.\n  Fair trade? Of course not. It is absurdly unfair. Nobody is willing \nto do a thing about it. It all came about because of NAFTA. We had a \nwritten agreement from Clayton Yeutter, who said representations of \ngood faith in NAFTA are there will not be a substantial increase of \ngrain trade across the border. In fact, that happened immediately by \nthe Canadian Wheat Board--as I said, a sanctioned monopoly that would \nbe illegal in this country--shipping into this country at secret prices \na massive quantity of grain, taking money right out of the pockets of \nAmerican farmers.\n  Earl Jensen can probably be excused, at the Canadian border stop that \nafternoon, wondering how on Earth our Government policy allows Canadian \ngrain to flood into our marketplace, and he and I cannot drive a 12-\nyear-old orange truck into Canada with just a small amount of U.S. \nwheat.\n  The answer is quite simple. These trade agreements are incompetently \nnegotiated, No. 1, and, No. 2, they are not enforced. That is where we \nare. That is what has happened since NAFTA. All bad news: A drop in the \ntrade surplus in agricultural goods with Mexico and Canada; massive \nlost jobs in agriculture; 71,000 family farms lost.\n\n  But it is not all bad news. It is bad news for the little guy. \nCorporate agribusiness profits are up 175 percent. Pretty good for \nthem. The trade deficit with Mexico and Canada increased 266 percent. \nThere is $4.3 billion in agricultural trade deficits with these two \ncountries.\n  The point is not everybody lost. You see, the corporate agribusiness \nprofits went up when we lost farms and jobs. The little bee sucks the \nblossom, the big bee gets the honey; the little guy picks the cotton, \nthe big guy gets the money. Bob Wills & His Texas Playboys sang that 70 \nyears ago and it still applies today and it applies in these trade \nagreements.\n  The U.S. Government estimates that CAFTA will increase the trade \ndeficit by $100 million. That is the ITC report I just described.\n  I don't know how anyone can come to the floor of the Senate and say: \nI have my own set of glasses. I haven't cleaned them for a long time, \nbut when I look through these glasses, I see nothing but nirvana, \nnothing but good news, when, in fact, no matter what glasses you wear \naround here, here is the ITC report which says this trade agreement we \nare about to sign onto will increase this country's deficit.\n  This trade agreement, of course, is one more bit of the circular \neconomic winds. This chart shows CAFTA will\n\n[[Page S7687]]\n\nallow transshipment of foreign textiles through Central American \nmarkets from China, from Canada, down through the CAFTA countries into \nthe United States.\n  Somebody said today to me: ``So what. It happens anyway.'' Are we all \ngiving up on helping American jobs remain viable? I don't understand \nthat.\n  Let me talk for a moment about sugar. There has been a lot of \ndiscussion about sugar. Sugar is an interesting commodity. I happen to \nlike sugar. We produce sugar beets in the Red River Valley. All of us \ncan be excused for liking something quite as wonderful as sugar. It, in \nfact, is organic. You plant a beet in the ground, watch that green \nstuff come up, and then see the growth and then pull that beet out of \nthe ground during the beet harvest, run it through a plant, slice it, \ndice it, squash it, and get the juice out of it. It doesn't smell so \nhot in that plant when they are processing it, but pretty soon you have \nsugar, and most sugar in this world is traded country to country on \nlong-term contracts. That is the way most sugar is traded in the world, \ncountry to country, in long-term contracts.\n  The sugar that is outside of that, the sugar that is left over or in \nsurplus is what is called dump sugar. It moves around the world at very \nlow prices, just pennies a pound, very low prices. That is what our \ncolleagues who know nothing about sugar, except the taste, come to the \nfloor and lecture us about: ``Well, the world price of sugar is a \nnickel or 6 cents.'' Sorry, that is not the world price, that is the \ndump price for sugar. You cannot raise sugar for that. You cannot grow \nsugar beets for that. Most of the sugar is traded at higher prices than \nthat on long-term contracts.\n  We have a sugar industry in this country, and we have a sugar program \nin this country. Some do not like it, especially those who produce \ncandy bars do not like it. The last time we had a debate on the floor \nof the Senate about sugar, I held up a Baby Ruth candy bar and read the \ningredients. Oh, man, it is a long bunch of ingredients. Most of the \nthings in candy bars you cannot pronounce. But there is a lot of sugar \nin candy bars, and that is what the debate has been about regarding the \nsugar program.\n  Those who use sugar for their confections and candy bars do not want \na sugar program; they want to buy dump sugar. The sugar program has \nbeen a good program to help stabilize prices in the country, yes, for \nproducers and consumers. We have had times when sugar spiked way up, \nand then sugar prices came back down. Did you see a change in the cost \nof a can of pop or soda, a can of Coca-Cola, Pepsi, or Sprite? Did you \never see their prices come down when the price of sugar came down from \na high spike? No, it didn't happen.\n  This sugar debate has always been about those who use a lot of sugar \nin candy, soft drinks, and so on. They want to buy dump sugar at dump \nprices, and they would like to get rid of the sugar program.\n  This sugar program is one part of the farm program that has worked \nconsistently to provide consistent stability of income for American \nfarmers. Yet a relentless urge in this Chamber is to take apart the one \npart of the farm program that has worked.\n  Let me talk about sugar and this trade agreement. This trade \nagreement provides an opportunity for the movement of additional \nforeign sugar from the CAFTA countries into our country. We know they \ncan produce sugar dirt cheap in some of these CAFTA countries. We know \nwhen we turn to the next trade agreement under the Free Trade Area of \nthe Americas, they can probably produce it less expensively in Brazil \nand massive quantities of it. If we are going to be the recipients of \ndump sugar and be like a cork on the waves of the price of sugar, we \nwill be subjected to the price spikes up high and then sometimes \ncheaper sugar.\n  The fact is we will also destroy the current sugar producers in this \ncountry. In the Red River Valley of North Dakota and Minnesota, we have \nsugar beet growers. They go out in the morning and plow the fields, \ntend the crops, plant these beets. They are good people. They have a \nfarm program that works called the sugar program. This is the first \nstep in the direction of taking that sugar program apart, much to the \nglee of some because they never liked it. This is the first step of \nseveral steps because the next step in the Free Trade Area of the \nAmericas will be the giant step.\n  It is very interesting when you listen to these discussions about \nsugar. The Agriculture Secretary says this will increase sugar imports \nby about 1\\1/2\\ teaspoons of sugar a week for every one of our nearly \n300 million citizens. That is an interesting way to look at it. Another \nway to look at it would be that CAFTA will let in enough sugar to fill \n5,389 semi-trucks. This is just the first step in the wrong direction.\n  This is just the first step in the wrong direction for trade. Through \ntrade initiatives, we have done a lot of damage to our economy--good \njobs leaving, jobs that pay well leaving, huge increased deficits. That \nmeans that it is the Chinese, it is the Japanese, the Europeans, the \nMexicans, the Canadians who hold American dollars, American stock, \nAmerican real estate in exchange for the trade deficit we have which \ngrows by $2 billion-a-day--every day, 7 days a week.\n  I said this morning that Warren Buffett describes this as heading \ntoward share cropper days because others in other parts of the world \nwill own an increasing part of America. Piece by piece, day by day, \nthey are buying part of our country.\n  I finish with the sugar program to say this: I am not bashful at all \nabout supporting our economic interests in this country. I am just a \nlittle sick and tired of people who are so quick to negotiate away our \neconomic interests. Every trade agreement we have seen in recent years \nhas negotiated away the economic interests of our country. I believe \ntrade agreements are beneficial if they become trade agreements that \nbestow mutual benefits on the trading partners, but that has not been \nthe case.\n  Can anyone in this Chamber honestly look at the United States, \nCanada, and Mexico, the three countries combined, united in a trade \nagreement called NAFTA, and describe a manner in which this country \nwon? Can anyone describe that honestly? They cannot. In each case, we \nended up with a much larger trade deficit, and that trade deficit is a \nmeasurement of substantially greater imports into this country than \nexports from this country.\n  It also means, then, that we lost jobs, lots and lots of jobs. No one \nwearing their Senate blue suit ever lost his or her job as a result of \nthis trade agreement. It is just other folks who lost their jobs, \npeople who loved their jobs, worked hard at their jobs, cared about \ntheir jobs, often worked for 20, 25, 30 years, only to find out one \nFriday their job was over because we negotiated trade agreements that \nmoved American jobs elsewhere.\n  When do we stop that? How much evidence does one need to decide it \nought to stop, especially with respect to the issue of the sugar \nprogram and the sugar trade with Central America? Let us just instantly \nunderstand they can produce sugar much less expensively than we can, \nand I am going to go through some things and talk about the \ncircumstances of labor in Central America and describe why they can \nproduce sugar less expensively than we can. But they cannot produce a \nliving wage for their workers in Central America. So let me go through \nsome of those and connect it to the sugar program among other things.\n  Under the labor laws in El Salvador and Nicaragua, it is legal to \nfire workers who belong to a union. In Honduras, it is legal to fire \nworkers who say they intend to organize. In Nicaragua, it is legal to \nprohibit strikes without government permission. Our country wants to \nsign up to a trade partnership in which our workers should compete with \ncountries with those labor standards? Are we thinking clearly here? Who \nwants to do that? Does that not by its very definition denigrate \nstandards in this country? I believe it does.\n  This is a chart that shows something about El Salvador. This was \npublished some while ago:\n\n       Jesus Franco, 14, has scars crisscrossing his legs from his \n     ankles to his thighs and more on his small hands. For more \n     than half of his young life, he's spent long days cutting \n     sugarcane. He has the machete scars to prove it and so do his \n     four brothers and sisters, age 9 to 19, all of whom work in \n     the sweltering cane fields of El Salvador.\n       Jesus' story is repeated countless times across Latin \n     America where children even\n\n[[Page S7688]]\n\n     younger than he is are found working in cane fields at \n     subsistence wages. More than 17 million children between the \n     ages of 5 and 14 are working in that region.\n       Sugarcane workers, including children, use machetes to cut \n     the hard, sharp stalks of thickly planted fields where there \n     is little room to maneuver. Children and family members said \n     cuts requiring stitches are common in the fields and many \n     more children suffer burns from the caustic fertilizer they \n     spread by hand.\n\n  Thirty-three percent of the sugarcane workers in the fields of El \nSalvador are under the age of 18. Many children in El Salvador start \nworking in sugarcane fields between the ages of 10 and 13, and the \nnumber of children between the ages of 5 and 14 working in Central \nAmerica is 17 million.\n  This is a young boy working in a sugarcane field in Central America. \nThis is a picture of the living conditions for sugarcane workers in \nGuatemala. This is a picture of the type of injuries which children and \nadult workers sustain while cutting sugarcane. This photo is from Human \nRights Watch.\n  I do not know how much more evidence is necessary to understand what \nwe are trying to do. The majority who believe in this trade agreement \nare trying to hook this country into a competition with other countries \nthat have decided they can fire workers who want to unionize, that have \ndecided even if they have labor rules they do not need to enforce them, \nthat have decided it is okay to have 9-, 10-, and 12-year-olds in the \ncane fields hacking away with machetes, and those are the conditions \nunder which we compete. That is what the majority, many in this \nChamber, will say when they vote for this trade agreement. They have \nsaid it before repeatedly with trade agreements, and they are going to \nsay it again today. In the face of all evidence to the contrary, they \nare going to say it again today. It is unbelievable to me.\n  So last evening, when I got a little cranky and objected to unanimous \nconsent requests and was walking around a little upset, I was upset \nbecause of this. This trade agreement, the Central American Free Trade \nAgreement, was negotiated over 1 year ago. It was not brought to the \nSenate floor, not brought to the floor of the House, not brought to the \nCongress at all. Do my colleagues know why? Because they did not think \nthey had the votes in the House of Representatives. But I knew some day \nthe President and the majority would say, ``We are going to vote on \nCAFTA,'' and they would wedge it in right in that little corner, right \nin that crevasse before we go home for a break.\n\n  Next week, we are not in session. There is a Fourth of July break. \nSure enough, last night, that is exactly what the majority leader did. \nI am sure White House instructions were to get this done.\n  It has been over a year. We think we now have purchased enough votes, \nwe have given up roads and bridges and dams, and we have enough people \nwho are willing now to vote for this. So we are going to have this \ndiscussion, we are going to have it now, and it is going to be done \nbefore we go home for the Fourth of July recess, and we are not going \nto have a 2-day or 3-day discussion about real things that matter a \nlot.\n  We are going to have a discussion about flag burning, I guess, I am \ntold probably in the month of July. The flag is very important in this \ncountry. It is a symbol of America's patriotism and freedom. I would \nnot ever make light of that, but I would say this: As disgusting as it \nis, and it is disgusting to see anybody desecrate an American flag, one \nmight well be hard-pressed to find someone who has burned an American \nflag. Look at the label. It might well be made in China because much of \nour textiles come from China these days. The people who used to make \nthose textiles--shirts and trousers and, yes, flags--used to be \nAmerican workers, but now they are foreign. They are gone because we \nhave a trade strategy that says we want American workers to compete \nwith workers in China, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Indonesia. Those \nworkers will work pretty inexpensively. Those are workers who can work \n7 days a week, and we can ask them to work 12 hours a day. We can pay \nthem 30 cents an hour and that will be just fine, and American workers \ncannot compete with that--that is tough luck.\n  I happen to think that what we have built on this little planet \ncalled Earth, the only spot on Earth that is the United States of \nAmerica, is extraordinary. One of the reasons it is extraordinary is we \nhad the guts as a country, all of us did, both parties and people \nmarching in the streets, to do what was right. We said there is a right \nway to do things and a wrong way to do things. One has capital, labor, \nand all of these things that come together to produce. Both have \nrights, both ought to be protected, and so people chained themselves to \nthe White House fence, people died in the streets of Detroit, people \nmanifested a belief and a passion that workers have the right to \norganize, they have a right to work in a safe work plant, they ought to \nhave child labor laws, and companies ought not be able to dump their \nsewage and chemicals into the streams and into the air. We made a lot \nof progress doing that, so we have a better country because of it. We \nuse much more energy now than we did 25 years ago, and we have a \ncleaner country.\n  All of those things we have done to make this a better place in which \nto live, to allow jobs to be available that allow workers to provide \nfor their families, are now being considered largely irrelevant because \none does not have to bother with those things in production here at \nhome. They can just produce elsewhere, and workers can be treated like \na pair of pliers or a wrench: When you are done with it, just throw it \naway, just get rid of it, just leave it somewhere else. Do not worry \nabout it because you can find another one 8,000 miles away. You can \ntransfer the capital immediately, you can transfer the technology \nimmediately and combine the capital and the technology with somebody \nwho will work for 30 cents an hour. Do not worry about the consequences \nfor the American workforce because if one is an international \ncorporation interested in shareholder profits, they do not have to say \nthe Pledge of Allegiance. So do not worry about that.\n  Those are the values we ought to be talking about when we talk about \nthese trade agreements, values long forgotten, in my judgment, during \nthese debates, values that no one wants to discuss much. That is why we \nare here for 1 day on the Senate floor on an issue this important, just \nwedging it right in between now and the Fourth of July recess.\n  As I close, I ask my colleagues to look at this one more time. This \nis a trade deficit chart that tracks the loss of American jobs and \ntracks the selling of America to foreign interests. Every single day, \n$2 billion of American cash, American assets, American real estate, \nends up in the hands of foreign interests. It is what Warren Buffett \nmeans when he says that we as a country are headed toward a share \ncropper future. I defy anyone in the Senate to come to the floor and \ntell me this is moving in the right direction, tell me this is good \nnews.\n  This is a disaster. This is dangerous for our country. This is \nevidence of a Congress that refuses to stand up, that does not have the \nbackbone, the will, and the strength to stand up for this country's \ninterests and is not willing to stand up and say: ``I want to protect \nAmerica's interests.'' Why will they not say that? Because they are \nworried that somebody is going to call them protectionists. Well, sign \nme up, for God's sake. My interest in putting on a suit in the morning \nand coming to work is to protect the economic interests of this \ncountry. Yes, I think we have a global economy and, yes, I think trade \ncan be beneficial, but if trade agreements are not mutually beneficial, \nthen this country has no business signing up to trade agreements that \ncost this country jobs and economic strength and cost us an opportunity \nfor a better future.\n  I will have more to say about a range of these issues later this \nafternoon, but I hope we will continue to hear from colleagues about \nthe underlying premise of this set of failures and how we can turn it \naround. How do we turn it around? Every kid in this country who is now \nin school is going to have a future that is injured by this strategy \nunless we turn it around. Only we can do that. There is no one better \nable to do it than us, but we have to have the will to do it. I hope \nthat perhaps at the end of the day, when we finally vote, we will find \na will to quit moving in this direction and stand up for the economic \ninterests of this country.\n\n[[Page S7689]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I spent the last few minutes listening to \nmy colleague from North Dakota discuss a very important issue for our \ncountry. While he and I have come to the same conclusion as to how we \nare going to vote on this issue, we have come from different points of \nview to arrive at I believe a similar conclusion.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Might I inquire of the Senator from Idaho, my intention \nwas to yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Idaho off our time. Is that \nthe Senator's intention as well?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I would ask that be done, if that is necessary. Ten \nminutes is clearly adequate. I need no longer than that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Since Congress gave the President fast-track trade \nnegotiating authority in August of 2002, we have had to face the \nreality that comes with it. I supported giving the President that \nauthority because clearly the executive branch is the branch that \nnegotiates trade agreements.\n  But while giving him that authority, I said that I would look at each \ntrade agreement and study it thoroughly to determine whether I believed \nit was in the best interests of our country to approve it, and, as \nimportant, in the best interests of my State of Idaho. Three agreements \nhave been reached and Congress has dealt with all three of them. I have \nvoted for two of those three.\n  The administration has been actively pursuing a vigorous bilateral \nand free-trade agenda around the world, and I believe it is in the best \ninterests of our country, both economically and socially, to trade \nwhere we can, when we can, as long as it is fair and balanced and it \nrecognizes all of the tradeoffs involved.\n  Trade with foreign nations is a valuable component to promoting \neconomic opportunities at home. This is not a one-sided economic \nplaying field. If we were to produce only that which America consumed, \nthen, working America, half of you go home. It is clearly in our best \ninterests to trade and we know that.\n  At the same time, we should not be trading off one segment of our \neconomy against another. Trade agreements ought to be there to promote \ngeneral economic growth in our country. Certainly it ought to be able \nto promote economic growth around the world. But in the end, when that \ntrade agreement is struck and implemented, we ought to be able to say \nit serves all of America well.\n  Congress is now debating, as we speak, the Central American Free \nTrade Agreement, otherwise known as CAFTA. I became involved with our \ntrade negotiators as the President and our then-Trade Representative, \nBob Zoellick, began negotiating with CAFTA nations. As an agricultural \nState, Idaho has a large stake in these agreements, and agriculture \nright now is currently learning how to restructure itself in our global \nmarkets to remain highly competitive, to supply not only food and fiber \nto America but to consumers around the world.\n  As many know, a major agricultural crop in my State is sugar. Idaho \nis the second largest producer of sugar beets, behind Minnesota, in the \nUnited States. Idaho's sugar industry employs somewhere in the \nneighborhood of 7,000 to 8,000 people and generates nearly $800 million \nin economic activities in my State. The sugar industry of Idaho and in \nmost other sugar-producing States has had to restructure itself in the \nlast several years because of the unprofitability of it. Farmers have \npooled their money, they have created cooperative processing plants to \nmarket their sugar, and so inherently have developed large personal \ninvestments in all levels of the production of sugar.\n  It is well known that the world sugar market is one of the most \ndistorted agricultural markets in the world and that most world sugar \nsupplies are simply dumped on the markets at prices well below the cost \nof production. As the Senator from North Dakota was showing a few \nmoments ago, some of that production is done at the lowest of costs and \nat a tremendous cost to human capital. U.S. producers already face an \noversupply situation, with significant quantities in storage at the \nexpense of the producer. Prices have slowly declined. Yet production \ncosts in the United States have skyrocketed.\n  Although the United States is the fourth largest importer of sugar in \nthe world--no, we have not shut the world out, we are a very large \nimporter of sugar--CAFTA seeks to significantly compound an already \nugly situation and set a ``precedent of no return'' for further \nnegotiations already underway with major sugar-exporting countries such \nas Thailand and Panama. In other words, this is not the last bilateral \nagreement this Senate will see before it that deals with the issue of \nsugar.\n  CAFTA nations already enjoy duty-free quota access for sugar with the \nUnited States. I am not prepared to trade away an industry so vital to \nmy State to the overall well-being of some other country's sugar \nindustry.\n  Other Idaho agricultural groups understand that those farmers who are \nsugar producers also are potato producers and bean producers and grain \nproducers. We are not just talking about impacting one commodity. We \nare talking about impacting a lot of commodities. If Idaho were to lose \nthe acreage that it now commits to sugar, it would have to grow \nsomething else. It would put pressure on other commodities.\n  We have sought and have obtained a relatively well balanced economy \nin agriculture. In my opinion, CAFTA will distort that. Our U.S. \nnegotiators are willing to open our markets to increased sugar imports \nwhile other competitors maintain unfair economic advantages in domestic \nsubsidies and minimal market access commitments.\n  Myself, along with my colleagues from sugar-producing States, took \nour concern with CAFTA to the administration. With the help of my good \nfriend and chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senator \nChambliss, we met late into the night with our trade ambassador, Rob \nPortman, and with the Secretary of Agriculture, Secretary Johanns. I \nmust say in all fairness to them they not only listened but finally, \nafter well over a year and a half of me saying ``don't go there'' and \nthen when they did, saying ``come work with us,'' they finally fully \nbegan to engage.\n\n  They brought forth a proposal that, in my opinion, was not all bad. \nAt the same time, it modified the 2002 farm bill, in large part, and it \ncommitted U.S. money to a program to save, if you will, or maintain, if \nyou will, that we had told our Senators on the floor was going to have \nno net cost to the American taxpayer.\n  As a result, while I thought it was a significantly improved \nproposal, the sugar industry of this country looked at it and looked at \nwhat they felt was a very weakened position because of CAFTA and \nbecause of NAFTA and because of what was happening in Mexico now and \nbecause of a position they would be placed in the 2007 farm bill \nnegotiations, and they simply had to say no.\n  Trade agreements ought not to be trading one industry off against \nanother. These trade agreements ought not to have to come to Idaho and \nany other State and say: We have weakened the capacity of your State, \nor the agricultural industry of your State in this instance, to be \ncompetitive and to produce and to sustain ourself and your livelihood.\n  It is for all of these reasons that I will be voting against CAFTA. \nHowever, I applaud this administration for their diligent and willing \nwork with us on this issue. In the final hours, they tried. The problem \nis, they didn't try a year ago, or 2 years ago, when this issue was \nbeing negotiated. More than once I sat down with Ambassador Zoellick \nand said: Don't touch sugar. It has a very static market today. It is \nin a highly competitive market. And it will be most difficult for that \nindustry to sustain itself, let alone sustain itself in a diminishing \nmarket environment.\n  They didn't listen. We have CAFTA. Anybody can waive two little \npackets of sugar around and say that is all it is about.\n  But what about the Colombian agreement? What about the Thailand \nagreement? What about the Panamanian agreement? What about the South \nAfrican agreement? All are sugar-producing nations. All are ready to \nsit down and negotiate and ask for a piece of the U.S. sugar market. \nThat is why the producers in Idaho and around the Nation, when provided \nthis last moment agreement, simply had to say no.\n\n[[Page S7690]]\n\nThey are placed, by this agreement, in a most difficult situation. As a \nresult, in my support of them, I will oppose.\n  Again, trade agreements ought not be about trading one segment of our \neconomy off against another, trading winners and losers, and therefore \ncreating an environment that pits one head to head with another. That \nis unfair. Our Government ought not be doing that.\n  While there are many benefits to be gained by CAFTA, there are \nwinners and losers. I believe the sugar producers of this Nation become \nlosers. I have to vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to make a unanimous consent \nrequest on the order of speakers to be recognized: Senator Kerry for 20 \nminutes, and that is from the time of Senator Baucus; Senator Inhofe, \nfor 15 minutes from my time; Senator Bingaman, 8 minutes from the time \nof Senator Baucus; and Senator Brownback for 10 minutes from my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is interesting, listening to the Senator \nfrom Idaho, who, as he said, came to this decision from a different \nplace than the Senator from North Dakota, and listening to the Senator \nfrom North Dakota; both of them have raised issues they tried to get \nthe administration to respond to. I am very sympathetic with the sense \nthey have that the administration just didn't respond to them and \nreally was unwilling to try to accommodate what I think are very \nreasonable concepts.\n  In May of 2003 I sent a letter to Ambassador Zoellick, asking the \nadministration to delay tabling CAFTA's labor chapter until Congress \nhad an opportunity to consult. I wrote again in October 2003, raising \nsimilar concerns.\n  All we got was a very sort of abrupt and short letter that basically \nnever engaged in the kind of discussion that could have benefited all \nof us so we would not have the kind of divide we have in the Senate and \nin the country today.\n  During the debate of TPA in 2002, I offered an amendment to allow \ncommunities to be able to preserve their health and safety laws which \nwere being challenged under NAFTA. Even now, with a lawsuit pending \nagainst the State of California for attempting to protect their \ndrinking water--imagine that. The State of California wants to protect \nits drinking water and the interests of its citizens. But nevertheless \nthey included the very same provisions that have led to that kind of \nchallenge in CAFTA.\n  In the summer of 2003, I suggested to the administration, in the \ncontext of the Chile and Singapore agreements, that the labor standards \nachieved in those agreements would not be adequate for CAFTA. The \nreason for that is in Chile, in Singapore, and in Australia--all three \nagreements which I supported last year--you have capacity for \nenforcement. You have specificity with respect to the laws on the books \nthat can be enforced. And you have a record of that enforcement. All \nthree of those ingredients--capacity, specificity of law, and record of \nenforcement--are absent in too many of the countries that are involved \nin this agreement.\n  We tried to get the Trade Representative to understand that there is \nan evenhanded way to open a fair agreement to trade but to address \nthose kinds of concerns. Regrettably the labor standards in the Chile \nand Singapore agreements may be good for those countries, but they \nshould not be applied to CAFTA because of the lack of those three \ncritical ingredients.\n  Even in this last month, as CAFTA was considered in the Senate \nFinance Committee, I offered an amendment that specifically laid out \nwhat the administration could do to fix this agreement. That amendment \nlost on a tie vote--10 to 10 was the division in the Finance Committee, \nin no small part a division that was that close because the \nadministration opposed it.\n  So I regret enormously that we are where we are with respect to this \nagreement at this point in time. I have been in the Senate now for 21 \nyears, and I was one of those who was on the cutting edge and leading \nthe effort in our party to try to make it clear that we ought to trade \nand that it is important to the United States. I still believe that. I \nvoted for NAFTA, the Uruguay Round, China PNTR, and the many bilateral \nagreements negotiated by both the Clinton and Bush administrations.\n  Last year, while I was not here to vote, I supported the Chile, \nSingapore, and Australia agreements precisely for the reason that they \nhad a strong ability and a strong record of enforcement, that they had \nvery specific laws, and that they had the capacity to be able to \nenforce those laws.\n  There are some colleagues who have always opposed each and every one \nof these trade agreements; and there are some who have been for \neverything no matter what the balance is. For a number of years now I \nhave been trying to suggest not as a matter of ideology, not as a \nmatter of party label, because I don't think this should have a party \nlabel, but as a matter of common sense, I have been trying to suggest \nthat the consensus we have built globally for trade, a consensus built \naround the notion that, yes, there are some winners and losers, but you \ndo your best to mitigate the impact on losers, that you have sufficient \ntrade adjustment assistance, that you do enough education and training, \nthat you do enough with health care and COBRA payments so people can \ncover themselves with health care during a transition, that you ease \nthe pain, so to speak.\n  At the same time, as you attempt to maximize the rising of all boats \nin the tide that we proverbially think about, the rising tide lifts all \nboats, the fact is, in many countries, it is not lifting all boats. The \nstandard of living does not move at the rate it ought to. The standards \nfor health, safety, labor organizations, or environment do not change \nin the way they ought to. All of these are quality-of-life issues and \nvalue issues, fundamental value issues that ought to be part of our \nagreements.\n  This is not just basic economics. Particularly when you look at the \nchart showing the deficits in trade that are growing, it is hard to \nmake a new economic argument about it. The fact is there are larger \nissues at stake in a trade agreement.\n  For rigid ideological reasons, over the years, we have had tension in \nthe Senate and a fight over whether you embrace some of these other \nconsiderations in a trade agreement. Part of the reason we have had \nsuch intense reactions to trade meetings around the world, with riots \nin Seattle and with other demonstrations around the globe, is because \nof the raging pace of globalization and the discomfort it brings to a \nwhole bunch of people who feel powerless to be able to do something \nabout it. If we, the people who have the power to do something about \nit, do not choose to do so, we leave people out in the cold and hurting \neven more.\n  The fact is, the consensus--which has been global, that has helped us \nto be able to build the trade structure--is fraying. It is fraying not \njust in the United States but it is fraying in other countries as well. \nThe administration had a unique opportunity in this agreement to try to \naddress some of those concerns. We all understand that opening markets \nsets in motion economic transition that everyone here knows creates \nwinners and losers at the same time.\n  While you may want to mask some of that impact, the personal impact \nto people's lives with an unemotional language of economics in the \nSenate, the fact is if you go to Ohio, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Idaho, \nNorth Dakota, or other parts of the country, it is having a profound \nimpact on communities. It is having a profound impact on the fabric of \nlife in America and on our ability to be able to have a long-term \nstrategy for success.\n  We all know the numbers. Since 2001 we have shed nearly 3 million \nmanufacturing jobs. We have endured 42 consecutive months of economic \ndecline in the manufacturing sector. Fifteen years ago, 20 years ago, \n30 percent of America's economic pace was services and 70 percent was \nmanufacturing. Today, it is 30 percent manufacturing and 70 percent \nservices. Many of those services are not the kind of high value-added \npaying jobs Americans have come to expect.\n\n[[Page S7691]]\n\n  We have long understood if we want a broad consensus for free trade \nin America, we have to make these trade agreements work for all \nAmericans, not just for the winners, but for the people who temporarily \nare in the losing position.\n  In the 1990s we began to respond to that. First we looked at the \ntrade agreements themselves and we decided we must protect American \nworkers from unfair competition. American workers should compete on the \nbasis of pay and skill and effort. But it is unfair, fundamentally \nunfair, to ask Americans to compete against child labor or against \nhabitually depressed wages or habitually unfair working conditions.\n  In the Jordan agreement of 2001, President Clinton had come to \nunderstand that in the later part of the 1990s. His administration \nmoved specifically to include these other values within the four \ncorners of a trade agreement. We gave basic labor protections the same \nstanding we give in the protections we provide to corporate America. In \nother words, we made a new bargain with the American worker in order to \nhold on to the consensus. The bargain was very simple: We will protect \nyour economic interests, your job from unconscionable competition such \nas child labor, just as we protect a corporation's economic interests, \nwhich are its product, from dishonest competition such as copyright \ntheft. It seemed like a very fair bargain, a very fair form of \nprotection.\n\n  In CAFTA, we go backwards from that standard. We go backwards from \nthat standard for no explicable reason. Once again, our corporations \nget the protections they need with an elaborate system of rules, \ncomplaints, appeals, compensation, and strict enforcement. But all our \nworkers get is some flowery language with no teeth behind it.\n  We are going to hear that CAFTA has the strongest labor provision of \nany trade agreement. That is what some folks have been trying to say. \nLook at this agreement, read the language, and you realize that is once \nagain spin. It comes down to this: There is only one labor provision in \nCAFTA that is enforceable. It is a nation's commitment to ``enforce its \nown laws.'' Now, that sounds good, or it sounds like something, but in \nreality this provision does nothing to protect workers because, No. 1, \nthere is no stipulation whatever as to what those laws are; No. 2, some \nof those laws are completely inadequate; No. 3, there is no enforcement \ncapacity in some of those countries to enforce even the inadequate \nlaws, if you can understand what they are. There could have been a \nstipulation as to what they are. There could have been an understanding \nin the four corners of this agreement as to what standard we would try \nto reach.\n  Moreover, if the provision does lead to an attempt at enforcement, \nguess what. The maximum so-called penalty is $15 million. There is a \ncap. There is no cap on the corporate penalty. But there is a maximum \ncap. Guess what. It is a so-called penalty because the fine is then \nreturned to the offending country, ostensibly, to be used to fix the \nproblem, but without any real enforcement mechanism to do so.\n  Senator Bingaman will say to the Senate that he has secured an \nagreement from Trade Administrator Portman that they will put $40 \nmillion a year into the enforcement efforts. Again, if you do not have \nadequate laws and you do not have adequate specificity and you are \nenforcing in a structure that has a cap on the payment and the payment \ngoes to the country that offended, you are not enforcing the standards \nof workers.\n  There is another labor provision in CAFTA. It asks a nation to strive \nto eliminate ``the worst forms of child labor.'' We do not even define \nwhat the gradations of the forms of child labor are. Just the worst \nforms of child labor. There shouldn't be any form of child labor. But \nwe are only going to seek to strive to get rid of the worst forms, \nsweatshop conditions and other problems.\n  But if a nation fails to do that, we can only consult. In other \nwords, we can talk about ending child labor in a CAFTA country, but we \ncannot take any action to end child labor in a CAFTA country. That is \nwrong. That is contrary to the values of our country and to the \nfundamental values of American workers. Words alone are not going to do \nanything for kids who are suffering in work sweatshops. They will not \ndo anything for the American workers who lose their jobs as a \nconsequence of being undercut by that level of competition.\n  I ask my colleagues to answer a simple question: Why is there a \ndouble standard that we are going back to when we passed an agreement \nthat set a higher standard, and there is no showing as to why that \nstandard hasn't worked, shouldn't work, and shouldn't be part of this \nagreement? Why do Americans not have the same standing as a \ncorporation? Why don't they have the same standing to end child labor \nor sweatshop conditions that corporations have to go out and protect \ncopyright or patent theft? Why the double standard that punishes \nAmerican workers?\n  I share with many of my colleagues a longstanding commitment to the \ndevelopment of the well-being of Central America, but I am concerned \nthat CAFTA is insufficient to provide for steady and balanced economic \ngrowth in the region. The administration claims supporting CAFTA is a \nsecurity issue. I agree, it is a security issue. It is about the \neconomic security of some of the more vulnerable economies in our \nhemisphere. We have to ensure that a trade agreement with Central \nAmerican countries grows their economies, protects their workers, helps \nthem preserve their sensitive ecosystems, and, most importantly, \nencourages balanced and widespread economic growth and opportunity for \nall of the people in the region.\n  The most troubling aspect of CAFTA is that its shortcomings, \nparticularly the administration's indifference to our own workers, are \npart of a larger problem. I will speak about that for a minute. What \nCAFTA underscores is the need for a national policy to make sure \nAmerica is competitive, the leader in the global economy of today and \nof tomorrow. The reality is, there is no comprehensive strategy to meet \nthe needs of a fast-changing playing field.\n  What am I talking about? Certainly when we negotiate trade deals with \nnations that have an insufficient or lackluster labor record, you have \nto give citizens the same standing to be able to end child labor that \ncorporations have to end copyright and patent theft. It seem to me it \nis a pro-trade, free-trade policy that builds consensus and which \nconsiders all Americans. But it was refused in this agreement.\n  After you have the agreement in place, we need to defend America's \ninterests. This is true of all of our agreements. The administration \nhas to stop giving in to competitors. The Clinton administration \nbrought an average of 11 trade cases to the World Trade Organization \nper year. This administration has brought a total of 12 cases in the \nfirst 4\\1/2\\ years.\n  The administration also needs--and many colleagues have spoken about \nthis--to take action against China's currency manipulation. We keep \nhearing about it. People talk about it. And they talk about it. And \nthey talk about it. And they talk about it some more. The Senate has \nactually voted and gone on record that the administration needs to do \nsomething other than talk. But nothing has happened.\n  In the administration's recent dealings with China, according to our \ntrade representative, counterfeiting and piracy in China are at \nepidemic levels. That piracy costs U.S. companies $20 to $25 billion \nannually. We are told the problem is getting worse, not better. \nAccording to press reports in May, the United States presented the \nChinese with a list of modest proposals to curtail intellectual \nproperty violations. Modest proposals. We gave them a list. The Chinese \nrejected the proposal outright.\n  What did the administration do? They did not respond by pressing the \nChinese. They did not respond by taking any particular action. Guess \nwhat they did. They told United States companies to go file lawsuits in \nChinese courts to defend their rights. It is insulting and it is \nridiculous. It is not just putting the agreements in place, it is also \nenforcing them that the American worker is asking for.\n  In addition to that, we have all heard about the Chinese firm \nrecently seeking to purchase Unocal, an American energy company. What \nmany people do not know is that Chinese company borrowed money from the \nChinese Government in order to make the bid. It\n\n[[Page S7692]]\n\nshould not come as a surprise since it is 80 percent Government owned. \nThat has upset a lot of people and generated a lot of press. But it \nought to concern us even more that we are doing the same thing in the \nUnited States in the following way. Since the start of the Bush \nadministration, the Federal Government has borrowed billions of dollars \nto fund our national debt and cover questionable and, some think, even \nreckless tax choices in fiscal policy. Billions of dollars have been \nborrowed from--guess where--none other than the Chinese Government.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield myself an additional 5 minutes off their time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we ought to be concerned about the missed \nopportunities that are related to trade adjustment assistance. The \nSenate has supported trade adjustment assistance. If people lose their \njobs, they have the right to expect that we are going to try to help \ntransition. We have done that because we have understood the movement \nto open markets means this economic transition.\n  Guess what. Once again, the administration has ignored the will of \nthe entire Finance Committee on this issue, which voted to include TAA \nfor service workers in the CAFTA agreement. In the Commerce Committee, \nSenator Ensign held an excellent hearing on America's competitiveness. \nOur witness was the administration's point person on manufacturing, Al \nFrink. He told us he believes there is a shortage of skilled workers in \nAmerica. And that shortage of skilled workers is hurting our economy.\n  What the Under Secretary did not say, or maybe he did not know, is \nthat the Bush administration has resisted congressional efforts to fund \nworker retraining and vocational education, which would, in fact, \naddress the skilled worker shortage.\n  The administration's indifference to competitiveness goes deeper. We \nhave a tax policy that rewards American and multinational companies for \nhousing operations abroad instead of housing them here in the United \nStates. It is hard to imagine a more backward tax policy. We should end \nit. But for this administration, it is not only not a priority, it is \nnot even an afterthought.\n  We also do not adequately fund the basic science and research that \nwill produce the revolutionary technologies and products of tomorrow. \nNot surprisingly, fewer and fewer American students are choosing to \nstudy science and engineering. The Bush administration has proposed \ncutting Federal research and development spending for the first time in \n10 years. The story is much the same in our public schools. Bill Gates \nhas called our high schools obsolete because they fail to prepare our \nkids to compete. Alan Greenspan said much the same thing before the \nFinance Committee last week. Yet every year the administration refuses \nto fully fund No Child Left Behind, seeming perfectly content to see \nthose kids not study science and engineering, or perhaps not study at \nall. And all of this time, the administration negotiates trade deals \nthat remain indifferent to American workers and fail to defend our \nlegitimate interests at home, all the while refusing to adequately \ninvest in science, research, training, and ignoring the problems that \ndrain our businesses, such as health care.\n  The competition is hard at work at every single one of these. China \nand India will probably turn out 300,000 engineers each over the next \nyear--way ahead of the United States. While our shortsighted policies \nstunt our competitive advantage, China, India, and all of Asia and \nEurope have developed long-term investment plans, long-term \ninfrastructure investment plans, long-term trade, and long-term \neducational plans, all aimed at one thing: eliminating America's \neconomic dominance. They have national programs aimed at educating \nworkers, reducing capital costs, and attracting businesses. And we are \nfalling dangerously behind.\n  I was visited just the other day by the new president of MIT. Every \nSenator here, I know, respects that institution. She was deeply \nconcerned. She expressed this enormous concern about what is happening \nto the competitive advantage of our great science and technology \ninstitutes across the country and our commitment to science as a whole \nas a Government.\n  In the Commerce Committee, we heard how Japan and the European Union \nare implementing large-scale, long-range R projects aimed at \ndeveloping leading-edge commercial technologies. For example, from 1995 \nthrough 2001, the emerging economies of China, South Korea, and Taiwan \nincreased their investments in research and development by \napproximately 140 percent.\n  It is urgent we consider real measures to advance America's \ncompetitiveness and forge a new global consensus on trade in our \ncountry. That global consensus begins with a set of rules that makes \nsense to the American worker, rules that work for the American worker, \neven as we open new markets, which we must do.\n  We can do better than this trade agreement. We need to.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is that CAFTA is not a good deal for \nAmerica. It is a good deal for some companies. It is a good deal for \nsome investors and shareholders. It is a good deal even for some of the \ncountries that are a party to it. But it is not a good deal for the \nAmerican worker. So I hope colleagues will help America stay at the \ntop, while making trade fair for Americans. And I hope colleagues will \njoin in saying no to this agreement in its current shape.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I think under the UC I have been allocated \naround 15 minutes. I ask unanimous consent to be granted such time as I \nshall consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Thank you, Mr. President. I think I will be able to do it \nwithin that time, anyway.\n  Let me make a couple comments. I think almost none of these items \nhave been covered before. It is approaching this whole CAFTA idea from \na different perspective.\n  Let me first of all say that when this first came up, I just heard \n``CAFTA,'' and I said: I am against it. I led the opposition against \nNAFTA 11 years ago. I thought this was more of the same, and so I was \nopposed to it. Then someone showed me how my Oklahoma farmers might be \naffected.\n  I am not sure you can see this chart, but it shows the various \ngrains, cattle, meat products, dairy products, vegetables, and so \nforth. The blue bars are the tariffs that are charged to our farmers, \nand the others are what are charged to imports coming in. I have found \nthat in every case, when this is fully implemented--if it is--my \nOklahoma farmers will benefit, and benefit materially.\n  So I actually went and talked to some of the farmer groups that were \nleaning against the agreement for a number of reasons--a number of \nreasons that have been posed on this floor--only to find out they have \nchanged their minds and they are very much supportive.\n  That is not really why I am here today. I think that is something \nvery specific we can look at. We know it is true. I would like to look \nat this in a little different way. I was distressed a little bit \nbecause some of my very good friends in the conservative communities \nwere opposing CAFTA. I have gone to any lengths to try to determine \nspecifically what their opposition was.\n  There are five organizations that are conservative organizations--\nthey are great organizations. I agree with them almost 100 percent of \nthe time. Their argument was: We are against this as we are against all \ntreaties because anything that is this kind of a multinational thing \nwill infringe upon our Nation's sovereignty.\n  Well, I have to tell my good friends in these five conservative \norganizations, there is no one who is stronger in this position than I \nam. I am the guy who stopped the Law of the Sea Treaty. Quite frankly, \nI think it was going to pass. It actually had passed out of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee with a unanimous vote. I found out what was \nin it. I found out we were ceding our jurisdiction--our sovereignty, if \nyou will--over some very important parts of the water-covered part of \nthe planet. I felt it was wrong. And we have not--I am not saying it is \nall dead in the water right now, to use a phrase, but I think it is. \nCertainly it\n\n[[Page S7693]]\n\nhas been stalled. I led the opposition. I was opposed to it. I was not \nfor it.\n  The Kyoto treaty, you all know how I feel about that. We debated \nclimate change on the Senate floor 2 weeks ago. I spent 2 whole days \ntalking about that. I think we know that under that treaty, according \nto the Wharton Econometrics Survey from the Wharton School of \nEconomics, if we had to comply with the Kyoto treaty, it would have \ncost our average family of four $2,700 a year. It would have doubled \nthe price of energy and gasoline and all that. We know that is true. I \nled the opposition to that and was very proud to do that.\n  Eleven years ago, we had NAFTA. I was in the other body, in the House \nof Representatives, 11 years ago. I was elected in a special election \nto come over to this body. So the year they had NAFTA, I was able to \nlead the opposition to the ratification of NAFTA in both the House and \nthe Senate. I was the only one who could do that. So I came over here \nto the Senate.\n  I say to my good friend from North Dakota, who posed some excellent \narguments against NAFTA just a few minutes ago, this CAFTA is not \nNAFTA. On the NAFTA part, I agree. I remember standing on the floor of \nboth the House and the Senate saying: If we pass NAFTA, that is going \nto allow a Mexican trucker to pick up a load in Brownsville, TX, take \nit to Tulsa, OK, and not have to comply with any of our health \nstandards, our environmental standards, our wage and hour standards. \nSure enough, these things turned out to be true. I do not think it was \na success. I think it was a failure.\n  So getting back to the ones who are for this agreement and against \nit, I would have to say to the very small number of conservative \norganizations that are opposing this, the vast majority of the \norganizations in the conservative column are supporting it.\n  Listen to this. Those organizations that are supporting CAFTA include \nAmericans for Tax Reform, Center for Security Policy, National Tax \nPayers Union, The Heritage Foundation, David Keene of the American \nConservative Union, Citizens Against Government Waste, Competitive \nEnterprise Institute, Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs, The Club for \nGrowth, the National Tax-Limitation Committee--that is Lew Uhler and \nhis group--Citizens for a Sound Economy, Empower America, and the James \nMadison Institute. That is just to name a few. They are the 40 most \nprominent--except for 5--organizations that are supporting it.\n\n  I am very sensitive to this. Maybe I should not be that sensitive, \nbut I am because, according to the American Conservative Union, in \ntheir rating, I am not No. 2 or No. 3 or No. 4 but the No. 1 most \nconservative Member of the Senate. Now, I am qualifying myself for this \nbecause I keep hearing that conservatives are somehow opposed to this \nagreement, as they were NAFTA. Of course, I agreed with them back at \nthe NAFTA time.\n  Now, what kind of liberal groups are opposing CAFTA? We have already \ntalked about the conservative groups that are supporting CAFTA. Those \nwho are opposing it are Earthjustice, National Environmental Trust, \nFriends of the Earth, EnviroCitizen, Freedom Socialist Party--there is \nanother great group--the Berkeley Fellowship of Unitarian \nUniversalists' Social Justice Committee, Nonviolence International, \nProgressive Democrats of America, Safe Earth Alliance, Public Citizen, \nSocial Welfare Action Alliance, Community Alliance for Global Justice, \nGray Panthers of Austin, San Francisco Neighbor-to-Neighbor, New York \nState Green Party, and the Holland Peacemakers. I could go on and on. \nAnd we will insert more of them in the Record.\n  But by and large, what I am trying to get across is that virtually \nevery far-left, extremist, liberal group in America is opposing CAFTA. \nAnd somebody has to say it. I was sent an e-mail from my State of \nOklahoma saying that they understood I was still undecided. The \nresponses are about 9 to 1 in opposition to CAFTA, and, therefore, you \ncannot dare go ahead and support CAFTA.\n  Let me just say, on many occasions, when the people at home do not \nhave available to them the information that we do because that is what \nwe are paid to do for a living and we find out the information is \nwrong, I do not mind doing that. I can explain this to the people in my \nhome State of Oklahoma. They do not want to identify themselves with \nthat group, that liberal group I just read off. And when they find out \nabout it, they will be very supportive.\n  But I only bring that up to say that if anyone is out there with the \nthought that this is a conservative versus liberal issue, it is, but it \nis on the other side. The liberals are opposed to it. The conservatives \nare supporting it.\n  But I have another concern that is far greater, that far outweighs \neven the benefits it might give to my farmers in my State of Oklahoma, \neven the benefits that would be achieved by passing this to the very \nconservative groups in America; that is, I happen to be old enough to \nremember what happened in the 1980s. I remember Ronald Reagan, a great \nPresident. I remember at that time we had Communist regimes in Grenada, \nEl Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica, and that they were \ninfiltrating--at that time, it was still the Soviet Union--they were \ntrying to take over America by doing it through Cuba, and then all \nthese organizations, all of these countries where they had taken over \nthe government.\n  By failing to pass this treaty, we could undo all of those successful \ndemocratizations of the Reagan and the first Bush administrations. I \nremember the Contras, the freedom fighters, who were down in Nicaragua \nat that time, and the fight that was almost impossible; they were \nfighting for their freedom. I remember those five countries that are \npart of this treaty: the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, \nNicaragua, and Costa Rica. They have all committed troops in support to \nthe Iraqi coalition forces and have demonstrated their support for the \nglobal war on terrorism. They are fighting side by side with our troops \nover in Iraq and Afghanistan. These are the people we want to reward. \nThese are not people we want to somehow punish, as though they have \ndone something wrong. They are fighting for freedom.\n\n  CAFTA approval for these countries and their economies should aid \nsecurity there and counter the influence by Cuban and Venezuelan \nGovernments under Castro, Chavez, Ortega, and others opposed to the \nUnited States influence in the region.\n  I mentioned Chavez, Ortega, and Castro. They are among the anti-U.S. \nforces in the region, and they are all against CAFTA. These Communists, \nthese enemies of the United States, Chavez, Ortega, and Castro, are all \nin opposition to CAFTA. If you want to be on their side, you would vote \nagainst CAFTA. They fear its passage would show support for and \nfacilitate the efforts of the pro-American countries and parties in the \nregion. Also, Daniel Ortega, former Nicaraguan president and Sandinista \nleader, is making attempts to elevate his obsolete ideology based on \nMarxist-Leninist theory. Further, upon his capture, Ortega expressed \nsolidarity with Saddam Hussein against what he called the Yankee \noccupiers of Iraq. In other words, here is a guy who has been ousted as \nPresident of Nicaragua, one we defeated back in the 1980s, one who was \ntrying to spread communism against freedom and democracy in Latin \nAmerica. He was on the side of Saddam Hussein and called us the Yankee \noccupiers of Iraq.\n  A couple weeks ago I had a pretty bitter competition with one of my \nfriends here in the Senate from Arizona, Senator McCain. I disagreed \nwith him on an issue, and we spent 2 days debating that issue and \nfighting with each other. I have to say that I wholeheartedly agree. I \nhappened to hear some of his remarks a few minutes ago. I share his \nconcern about the state of democracy in Central America. Failing \neconomies will create an environment in which regimes such as those of \nFidel Castro and Hugo Chavez may once again poison the future of these \nnations. The historical threat of communism in Central America, the \ninfluence of Castro in countries such as Nicaragua, and the Sandinistas \nin power also affected neighboring countries such as Honduras and El \nSalvador. CAFTA can protect these emerging democracies.\n  For example, Nicaragua, the second poorest country in the Western \nHemisphere, second only to Haiti, has a President Enrique Bolanos. He \nis a pro-American President. He is facing a tough 2006 election, and \nthe candidate\n\n[[Page S7694]]\n\nhe is facing is none other than Daniel Ortega. Bolanos knows that CAFTA \nis the keystone to his plans to boost economic growth and blunt the \npolitical attacks of the Sandinistas. Who would have ever thought in \nthe last 10 years that they would reemerge, but they have. So now we \nhave Daniel Ortega back there trying to do some things. To quote \nSenator McCain:\n\n       If there's anything that we need today, it is strong, \n     viable economies in Central America so that they can \n     progress, so that they can be strong and they can again be \n     allies of the United States of America, not in a military \n     fashion but in their advocacy for free and open societies, \n     democracies, and places where people can raise their families \n     in a situation of security and peace.\n\n  That is what Ronald Reagan did back in the 1980s.\n  I heard the junior Senator from Massachusetts speaking in opposition \nto the agreement. I don't know whether it is because of his past \nrelationship with what was going on down in Nicaragua some 12 or 14 \nyears ago, but I would like to quote from an April 26, 1985 edition of \nthe Washington Post. Keep in mind, this was back when we had Daniel \nOrtega down there being promoted by Castro and by the Soviet Union to \ntry to spread communism in Central America.\n\n       The lengths to which some Democrats were willing to go in \n     pursuit of nonintervention were extraordinary. Sens. Tom \n     Harkin and John Kerry returned home from an 11th-hour trip to \n     Managua [Nicaragua] clutching a piece of paper signed by \n     President Daniel Ortega which they announced was a ``new, \n     bold and innovative approach'' and ``a wonderful opening.'' \n     At their arrival home, only the umbrella was missing.\n\n  We have a difference of opinion. We don't agree. We didn't agree back \nin the middle 1980s about Daniel Ortega and what the Communists were \ntrying to do in Central America and we don't agree today.\n  For those who weren't around at that time, it was a very emotional \ntime. The contras were the freedom fighters. They were supposed to win. \nI used to go down there. There was a hospital tent that was right \nacross the border in Honduras. That is where they would take the \nfreedom fighters from Nicaragua. They would take them over there to \ntreat them. This tent was about the size of this Senate Chamber. It had \nbeds all around the periphery. In the middle, not even screened, was \nthe operating table. The only operations they performed there were \namputations because of all the mines that were there. And so these \nfreedom fighters would come in there and be mended and go back and \nfight for their freedom across the border in Nicaragua. There must have \nbeen 40 beds all the way around, people who had had these amputations.\n  At that time I did a pretty good job of speaking Spanish. I thought, \nyou kids--the average age was 16 years old because the older ones had \nalready been killed--you kids are fighting for your freedom, you are \nfighting against this force, the Communists, supplied by Castro and the \nSoviet Union. It is impossible. Why are you doing this? And I went \naround and talked to each one of them. I remember coming up to a little \ngirl who was 15 years old. Her name was Elena Gonzales. I asked her \nthat question. And she looked up to me. It was her third trip back to \nthat hospital tent, and they had amputated her right leg a few hours \nbefore. The blood was coming from the bandages. She looked up at me \nwith teary brown eyes and she said:\n  Es porque han tomado nuestros campos . . . han tomado todo de lo que \ntenemos. Pero de veras, ustedes en los Estados Unidos entienden. Porque \nustedes tuvieron luchar para su libertad lo mismo que estamas luchando \nahora\n\n       (English translation of the above statement is as follows:)\n\n  Yes, it is almost impossible, but we are fighting. We are fighting \nbecause they have taken our farms and ranches. Why would you in the \nUnited States question why we are doing this? You had to fight against \nthe same odds for your freedoms as we are fighting now.\n  That little girl didn't know whether the Revolutionary War was 200 \nyears ago or 20 years ago. But she knew we were that beacon of freedom \nand that the beacon was about to go out in their country. They were \nwilling to fight. And they died and they won. So now we have the rest \nof the story.\n  This is an opportunity for us to do something that is good down \nthere. Yes, I think it is good for my Oklahoma farmers. And yes, the \nconservatives support it, and the extreme liberals oppose the CAFTA \ntreaty. But I think the strongest argument is that this is an \nopportunity for us to keep the Ortega and Chavez and Castro forces from \nundoing all the progress that was made throughout the 1980s and the \nearly 1990s.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield myself 8 minutes off the time on \nthis side.\n  I want to speak briefly about the CAFTA agreement. I start from the \nproposition that increased trade with the international community can \nadvantage us, and it also can advantage those with whom we trade. Most \nof the trade of these countries that are covered by this CAFTA-DR \nagreement, most of their trade, over 70 percent of their trade, is, in \nfact, with the United States. It is very much in our interest that that \ncircumstance remain the case. It can benefit us, and it can benefit \nthese countries to see that trade increase. And it is very much in our \ninterest, not only to strengthen our own country's economy but to see \nthe economies of this region strengthened.\n  This trade agreement comes at a time when our trade imbalance with \nthe world is enormous. It is the largest in the history of our country. \nIt is the largest in the history of any country in the world. \nUnfortunately, it is continuing to grow. As far as I can tell, our own \nGovernment has no strategy to deal with that problem. We have no \nstrategy to promote investment in the United States. We have no \nstrategy to promote the building of productive capacity or to keep this \ncountry competitive in the global economy.\n  I hope very much that the Finance Committee, which I am privileged to \nserve on, can play a role in developing such a strategy over the next \nfew months. When we had the markup of this legislation yesterday, I \ndiscussed that with Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus. It is my hope \nthey will be able to schedule some hearings to begin understanding this \nissue better and helping us to craft a set of proposals to help deal \nwith the very real problem we have in global trade.\n  That being said, when I look at the provisions of this DR-CAFTA \nagreement, I do not see them contributing significantly to that trade \nimbalance. These are countries that have exported over 85 percent of \nwhat they send to the United States duty free. They have done that \nsince the implementation of the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act \nin 2000, and before that they were shipping most of their product into \nthe United States duty free under the Caribbean Basin Initiative. The \nmain effect of this agreement we are now debating will be to phase out \nand eliminate tariffs that they currently impose upon our products that \nwe are exporting to them.\n  I don't see the basis for the claim, which I have heard on the Senate \nfloor and from others around the country that this agreement will \nresult in the further export of jobs from the United States to Central \nAmerica. The reality is that U.S. companies have many options about \nwhere to build their next plant, where to manufacture the products that \nthey sell. Central America has been one of those options for a very \nlong time. There is nothing I know of pending here in the Congress that \nwould change that circumstance. In my view, this agreement would not \nchange that circumstance as well.\n  I would hope and expect that if this agreement is implemented, as I \nexpect it will be, we will see the encouragement of more investment in \nproductive capacity in Central America, but at the same time, as our \nexports to that region increase, we will see more investment in \nproductive capacity here in the United States.\n  There are clearly some problems with this agreement. Many of those \nhave been pointed out. I don't suggest I have answers for all of those, \nby any means. Two of the problems that have particularly concerned me \nare, No. 1, the serious lack of attention to the enforcement of worker \nrights in these countries and, secondly, the inadequate provision of \nassistance with regard to the negative impacts that U.S. exports of \nagricultural product into that region may cause.\n\n[[Page S7695]]\n\n  Let me talk first about enforcement of worker rights. I have urged \nthe administration to commit resources to this as a priority. It is not \nreasonable to require U.S. producers and workers to compete with \nforeign producers who do not afford their workers certain basic rights. \nTo begin addressing this issue, Ambassador Portman, our trade \nrepresentative, has assured me the administration will propose and will \nsupport funding for worker rights enforcement to the extent of $40 \nmillion per year for fiscal years 2006 through 2009. Second, on \nmonitoring of compliance with the various requirements on worker \nrights, there is a need for an independent and transparent monitoring \nof the treatment of workers in these countries. I have urged the \nadministration to fund the International Labor Organization, or ILO, \nheadquartered in Geneva, to conduct ongoing monitoring on worker rights \nin Central America. This would include reports that they would publish \nevery 6 months beginning when the agreement goes into effect and \ncontinuing to the end of the 2009 fiscal year.\n  The administration has agreed to commit $3 million per year to \naccomplish that task. That $3 million would come out of the $40 million \nper year in funding that they are otherwise committing for enforcement \nof worker and environmental rights.\n  I believe both of these commitments--to worker rights enforcement and \nthe commitment to ILO monitoring--should be a part of all trade \nagreements that we have with developing countries. In addition, of \ncourse, I hope that the actual commitment to workers' rights standards \nin the language of the treaties, in any future treaties we sign, will \nbe stronger than we find in this agreement. I believe it is also \nincumbent upon us to urge the next administration, after President Bush \nleaves office, to continue with these same commitments in the future.\n  The other issue I mentioned is agricultural assistance--adjustment \nassistance for those working in the agricultural sector. I have also \nurged the administration to commit resources to allow subsistence-level \nfarmers to make a transition without undue dislocation problems. This \nshould help reduce the problem of dislocation of workers in these \ncountries and the additional illegal immigration to the United States \nthat likely would result if that dislocation occurs.\n  Again, the administration is committed to provide increased support \nto address this issue. The level of funding is not what I would like it \nto be, but if these countries do receive funding under the Millennium \nChallenge Corporation grants, those funding levels should increase \nsubstantially.\n  Mr. President, each of these commitments that I have referred to are \nset out in a letter that Ambassador Portman has provided to me.\n  I ask unanimous consent that that letter be printed in the Record \nfollowing my comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, with these additional commitments, I \nhave concluded that I can support the implementation of this trade \nagreement. I will do so when the roll is called later today.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         Executive Office of the President, the United States \n           Trade Representative,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 28, 2005.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Jeff, as the Congress considers the Central America-\n     Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR), you have \n     raised concerns about ongoing efforts to improve enforcement \n     of labor laws and to monitor progress in this regard in the \n     CAFTA-DR signatory countries. As you know, Congress \n     appropriated $20 million in FY05 specifically for projects to \n     improve labor and environmental law enforcement in these \n     countries.\n       The recent House Appropriations Committee mark-up of the \n     FY06 Foreign Operations appropriations bill increases this \n     commitment for the next fiscal year, with $40 million \n     earmarked for labor and environmental enforcement capacity-\n     building in the CAFTA-DR signatory countries. The \n     Administration is willing to support this level of funding in \n     the FY06 Senate appropriations bill.\n       Furthermore, because we are willing to make a longer-term \n     commitment to improve labor and environmental law enforcement \n     in the CAFTA-DR countries, the Administration is willing to \n     propose and support this same level of labor/environment \n     capacity-building assistance for the next three fiscal years, \n     FY07 through FY09.\n       More specifically, you have suggested the assistance of the \n     International Labor Organization (ILO) in monitoring and \n     verifying progress in the Central American and Dominican \n     governments' efforts to improve labor law enforcement and \n     working conditions.\n       We are willing to implement your idea. Your proposal, as I \n     understand it, is that the ILO would make a transparent \n     public report of its findings every six months. The \n     Administration has now consulted with the ILO and determined \n     that this function would require additional funding to the \n     ILO of approximately $3 million annually. The Administration \n     is willing to devote approximately $3 million of the $20 \n     million in FY05 labor enforcement assistance monies to \n     support and fund this ILO monitoring initiative. To ensure \n     that this monitoring continues, the Administration is willing \n     to continue a funding commitment to ILO monitoring for the \n     next three fiscal years, FY07 through FY09.\n       The Administration also shares your goal of ensuring that \n     we pair expanded trade opportunities with economic \n     development assistance designed to ease the transition to \n     free trade, especially for rural farmers in our CAFTA-DR \n     partners. On June 13, 2005, the U.S. Millennium Challenge \n     Corporation (MCC) signed a $215 million compact with Honduras \n     targeted specifically at rural development and \n     infrastructure, and on the same day the MCC announced a \n     $175 million compact with Nicaragua that will be signed \n     shortly.\n       As Secretary Rice and I have already communicated to you, \n     we are willing to give high priority to negotiating compacts \n     with El Salvador, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic when \n     those countries become eligible for MCC assistance under \n     higher per capita income caps next year. I anticipate that \n     such compacts would provide substantial U.S. economic \n     assistance for rural development in these countries.\n       In addition, the Administration has worked with the Inter-\n     American Development Bank (IDB) to provide new assistance, \n     including $10 million in new grants announced by the IDB \n     earlier this month for rural development and institution \n     building. I hope you will join me and officials from the IDB, \n     World Bank, and other institutions next month for an \n     international donors conference to discuss other ways we can \n     direct development assistance toward meeting the needs of \n     rural populations.\n       To address your specific concern about the period before \n     MCC compacts might be negotiated with El Salvador, Guatemala, \n     and the Dominican Republic, the Administration is willing to \n     support additional spending for rural development assistance \n     of $10 million per year for each of those countries starting \n     in FY07 for a total of five years, or until the signing of an \n     MCC compact with such country, whichever comes first. This \n     amounts to a $150 million commitment in transitional rural \n     assistance for these countries over five years.\n       These monies will provide transition assistance to rural \n     farmers in these three countries for a defined period, while \n     preserving a very strong incentive for candidate countries to \n     meet the statutory criteria to receive what would likely be \n     much higher levels of economic assistance under an MCC \n     compact. Since the implementation of CAFTA-DR requires steps \n     which reinforce the statutory criteria for funding under the \n     MCC law, I believe that implementation of the agreement will \n     assist these three countries to move quickly toward \n     qualifying for a successful MCC compact with the United \n     States.\n       Furthermore, because many of the agreement's requirements \n     for agriculture liberalization in the CAFTA-DR countries for \n     sensitive commodities--such as dairy, poultry, and rice--will \n     not fully occur until ten, fifteen, or even twenty years \n     after CAFTA's implementation date, I am confident that this \n     transitional mechanism provides ample time for adjustment in \n     the rural economies of these nations.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Rob Portman.\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7697-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7697-S7739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n[[Page S7697]]\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                                 Senate\n\n DOMINICAN REPUBLIC-CENTRAL AMERICA-UNITED STATES FREE TRADE AGREEMENT \n                     IMPLEMENTATION ACT--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I ask for approximately 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, may I ask my colleague to yield for a \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. OBAMA. I yield for that purpose.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nof speakers be as follows: Senator Obama, 15 minutes from the time of \nSenator Dorgan; Senator Brownback, 15 minutes from Senator Grassley's \ntime; Senator Coleman, 15 minutes from Senator Grassley's time; Senator \nCorzine, 10 minutes from Senator Dorgan's time; and Senator Burr, for \n10 minutes from Senator Grassley's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, as the previous speaker, I rise to speak on \nthe Central American Free Trade Agreement.\n  I have thought long and hard about this agreement, and I come to the \nfloor predisposed to support free trade. In the end, I believe that \nexpanding trade and breaking down barriers between countries is good \nfor our economy and for our security, for American consumers and \nAmerican workers.\n  On the margins, I recognize that CAFTA, although a relatively modest \ntrade agreement by the standards of the U.S. economy, would benefit \nfarmers in Illinois as well as agricultural and manufacturing interests \nacross the country. The language in the agreement is also optimal with \nrespect to intellectual property and telecommunications, issues that \nare of particular interest when it comes to trade with other countries, \nsuch as China. Unfortunately, CAFTA falls short, as a matter of process \nand substance, in protecting workers' rights and interests. My \ncolleague, Senator Bingaman, mentioned some of those concerns.\n  I recognize that we should not kid ourselves into believing that \nvoting against free-trade agreements will stop globalization, \nespecially agreements like CAFTA, where the countries involved have \ncombined economies one-sixth the size of the State of Illinois.\n  Globalization is not someone's political agenda. It is a \ntechnological revolution that is fundamentally changing the world's \neconomy, producing winners and losers along the way. The question is \nnot whether we can stop it, but how we respond to it. It is not whether \nwe should protect our workers from competition, but what can we do to \nfully enable them to compete against workers all over the world.\n  That brings me to the problem. So far, America has not effectively \nanswered these questions, and American workers are suffering as a \nresult. I meet these workers all across Illinois--workers whose jobs \nmoved to Mexico or China and are now competing with their own children \nfor jobs that pay $7 an hour and offer no health or pension benefits. \nIn town meetings and union halls, I have tried to tell these workers \nthe truth--that the jobs they have lost are not coming back; that \nglobalization is here to stay; and that they are going to have to train \nmore and learn more to get the new jobs of the future.\n  I don't mind delivering that message. But when these same workers ask \nme exactly how are they going to get their training and their \neducation, and when they ask what will they do to pay for their health \ncare bills in the interim, and how will they deal with lower wages and \nthe general sense of financial insecurity that seems to be growing \nevery single day, I cannot look them in the eye and tell them honestly \nthat their Government is doing a single thing about these problems.\n  Since I have arrived in the Senate, I haven't seen us debate--much \nless pass--legislation that would address these issues. That is the \nreason I will be voting against CAFTA when it comes up later today.\n  There are real problems in the agreement itself. It fails to uphold \nthe principles set out in previous trade agreements that say we must \ngive equal protection to the rights of workers and the rights of \ncommercial interests. But CAFTA, while encouraging the protection of \ncommercial rights, does less to protect labor rights than some of the \nagreements that we have already passed. So there is a sense that we may \nbe going backward instead of forward. Nor does CAFTA do much in the way \nof enforcing environmental standards in these countries.\n  I recognize that no piece of legislation is perfect, and if it were \njust these provisions, perhaps I could do what my colleague from New \nMexico has done and obtain a letter of agreement from the White House, \nindicating they will try to address some of these problems.\n\n  But the real problem is more than CAFTA. It goes beyond the four \ncorners of this piece of legislation. The real problem is what is \nmissing, generally, from our prevailing policy on trade and \nglobalization: meaningful assistance for those who are not reaping the \nbenefits of trade, and a plan to equip American workers with the skills \nand support they need to succeed in the 21st century.\n  So far, almost all of our energy and almost all of these trade \nagreements are about making life easier for the winners of \nglobalization, while we do nothing for those who find their lives \ngetting harder as a consequence of trade liberalization. In 2004, \nnearly 150,000 workers were certified as having lost their jobs due to \ntrade and were thus eligible for trade adjustment assistance--and that \nnumber doesn't count the janitors and cafeteria workers who may have \nlost their jobs.\n  Senator Wyden and others have tried to encourage the Administration \nto\n\n[[Page S7698]]\n\nmodernize this assistance and expand it to displaced service workers, \nbut the Administration refuses to help on this issue.\n  But even beyond displaced workers, our failure to respond to \nglobalization is causing a race to the bottom that means lower wages \nand stingier health and retiree benefits for all Americans. It is \ncausing a squeeze on middle-class families who are working harder but \nmaking even less and struggling to stay afloat in this new economy.\n  I recognize the soundness of the economic argument that free trade \nreduces overall prices in this country. But as one downstate worker \ntold me during a recent visit back in Illinois: ``It doesn't do me much \ngood if I am paying a dollar less on a t-shirt, but I don't have a \njob.''\n  So now we have to choose. It is a choice that is bigger than CAFTA \nand bigger than our trade agreements. It is one that America has faced \ntime and time again in our history, and we have responded. To ease our \ntransition from an agricultural to an industrial economy, we set up the \npublic school system, busted up monopolies, and allowed workers to \norganize. To help us emerge from the Great Depression, we regulated the \nmarket, created unemployment insurance, and provided all workers access \nto a secure retirement. At the end of World War II, we grew the largest \nmiddle class in history by providing our returning heroes with a chance \nto go to college and own their own homes.\n  Now we face the same choice. We are at the same juncture today. We \nhave to decide whether we are going to sit idly by and do nothing while \nAmerican workers continue to lose out in this new world, or if we will \nact to build a community where--at the very least--everybody has a \nchance to work hard, get ahead, and reach their dreams.\n  If we are to promote free and fair trade--and we should--then we have \nto make a national commitment to prepare every child in America with \nthe education they need to compete; to make sure college is affordable \nfor everybody who wants to go; to provide meaningful retraining and \nwage insurance so that even if you lose your job, you can train for \nanother; to make sure worker retraining helps people without getting \nthem caught up in a bureaucracy; that such training helps service \nworkers as well as manufacturing workers; and that it encourages people \nto reenter the workforce as soon as possible.\n  We also have to figure out a way to tell workers that no matter where \nyou work or how many times you switch jobs, you can take your health \ncare and your pension with you always, so you have the flexibility to \nmove to a better job or start a new business.\n  All of this is possible. It is not going to be easy, and it is not \ngoing to be quick. I don't expect the Administration to try to shoehorn \nall the solutions to the displacements caused by globalization into a \nsingle trade agreement. But what I do expect--and I said this directly \nto the President when I met with him in the White House on this \nmatter--is that we at least have, on a parallel track, an effort to \ndeal with the losers in globalization, our displaced communities and \ndisplaced workers. We must not only look after profits and \nshareholders, but also those folks who are adversely affected by trade. \nLower prices are good and important, but we also have to make sure that \njobs exist that provide people the opportunity to raise a family.\n  Mr. President, in order to compete, every single one of us is going \nto have to work more, think more, train more. I am not afraid of global \ncompetition, and I don't think a single American worker is afraid of \nit. We cannot insulate ourselves from all of the dislocations brought \nabout by free trade, and most of the workers don't expect Washington to \ndo so. On my side of the aisle, we cannot resort to protectionist \nlanguage over the long term if we are, in fact, going to be looking \ntoward the future of America. We have the talent and the brain power to \ncontinue to lead the world in this challenging new century, but now we \nneed the political will. Now we need a national commitment. And that, \nso far, is what appears to be lacking on Capitol Hill.\n  In America, we have always furthered the idea that everybody has a \nstake in this country, that we are all in it together, and that \neverybody deserves a shot at opportunity. The imbalance in this \nAdministration's policies, as reflected in the CAFTA debate, fails to \nprovide American workers with their shot at opportunity. It is time we \ngave them that shot.\n  I yield back my time.\n  (Applause in the Gallery.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Expressions of approval or nonapproval are not \npermitted in the Senate Chamber.\n  Who yields time. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 1 hour 32 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. How much time remains for the Senator from Montana and \nalso on the majority side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 1 hour 11 minutes for the \nSenator from Montana, 5 hours 20 minutes for the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it would seem to me the Senator from Iowa \nwould want to use some time at this point. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum and ask that the time run against the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, on this beautiful day in Washington, \nDC, we are about to create some great opportunities for Kansas farmers, \nKansas manufacturers, and opportunities of hope for people in Central \nAmerica. That is to me what this CAFTA bill represents. I do not want \nto oversell it. I do not think it should be oversold. I do not think it \nis a panacea for democracy building or opportunity in Central America. \nI do not think it is a panacea for all my farmers and manufacturers in \nthe State of Kansas. But I do think it is a little more good in the \nworld, a little more good for opportunities for people in the United \nStates, lowering tariffs and trade barriers in our neighborhood, in \nthis region of the world, a little more good and opportunity for \neconomic chances and opportunities in Central America and the Dominican \nRepublic, chances that do not exist today, chances that are not doing \nwell today in Central America, chances that are hurting the spread of \ndemocracy, free societies, even in our own hemisphere.\n  I was troubled recently when I read a poll published by one of the \nmajor newspapers in this country. The poll was asking people in Central \nand South America would they give up their democracy if their economy \nwould grow. In other words, if a dictator comes in and can produce \neconomic reform and opportunity where you would have a growing economy \ninstead of the stagnant situation you are in today, would you give up \ndemocracy?\n  A surprisingly large number of people said yes. I suppose in their \nhierarchy of needs, what they were looking at is: Look, democracy is \ngreat, but what I need right now is a job, what I need right now is \nincome for my family, what I need right now is to be able to pay my \nbills and send my kids to school. If I have to give up this other right \nto do that, I am willing to look at it.\n  I was very troubled by that poll. I have relatives traveling to \nCentral America talking with me in return about the troubling aspects \nof what they are seeing in the willingness to give up democracy and the \nfragility of democracy in our own hemisphere because of a lack of \neconomic opportunity.\n  I think as well a lot of this is because of the juggernaut China is \ntoday, more than we solve by CAFTA. CAFTA is a little more good. CAFTA \nis a positive step in the right direction for those democracies to \nbuild economies and for opportunities for us in this country. It is not \nopportunities for everybody. There will be winners and some losers, as \nthere are in trade agreements, because on the basis of a trade \nagreement, each country does what they do best and then you trade goods \nback and forth. Overall, the economy is lifted. There are people who \nare dislocated and harmed in these processes.\n  Overall, there is a betterment of societies, cultures, and \nopportunities. That\n\n[[Page S7699]]\n\nis what I think overall will take place with CAFTA.\n  I do believe we have an extra issue that is at risk and is rewarded \nby CAFTA, and that is democracy building in our hemisphere. I do not \nthink it can be put forward too lightly.\n  While I do not think people in Central America will say, OK, I am \ngoing to rejoice with the passing of CAFTA, that this is going to solve \nall my problems, I do think it will remove a great deal of hope if this \ndoes not pass. It will certainly have a negative impact in Central \nAmerica if it does not pass, and I think we have to look at that as \nwell.\n  Everybody has heard the numbers until I am sure they are blue in the \nface. The U.S. tariff regime is one of the lowest in the world, 3 \npercent. For a State such as mine, Kansas, having open markets is vital \nfor the exportation of agricultural commodities. The aircraft industry \nis also dependent upon an export market. So additional liberalization \nshould benefit our producers.\n  About one-third, or $3 billion in farm cash receipts out of a total \nof $9 billion of gross farm income in Kansas comes from exports. Kansas \nranks sixth in the Nation for States with the greatest share of \nagricultural exports. Movement toward freer economies is helpful in \ndoing that.\n  I want to focus briefly in the time I have on a couple of specific \nproducts that will benefit my State. As I mentioned, we have a heavy \nagricultural export industry. Agricultural exports support some 47,000 \njobs in Kansas. I think, in this particular case, we have a decent \nchance of expanding more agricultural exports.\n  Beef is our largest section of the agricultural economy of my State. \nWe are the second largest beef exporter in the country. As I mentioned, \nit provides the single largest source of cash receipts in agriculture \nin my State at over $5.6 billion. We believe CAFTA will help the cattle \nindustry.\n  Pork producers, who add about $252 million to Kansas annually, will \nalso benefit from the trade agreement.\n  Current import tariffs on U.S. beef exports is as high as 30 percent \nin some of these countries. Duties on the products most important to \nthe U.S. beef industry--prime and choice cuts--would be eliminated \nimmediately in these Central American countries.\n  I don't want to paint that again as a panacea because I don't think \nthere is going to be a large initial export. There is not a large \nmarket of that cut initially, although there is market opportunity.\n  The American Farm Bureau Federation economic analysis of CAFTA \nestimates that Kansas will increase meat exports to the six countries \nby $130 million per year on the full implementation. That full \nimplementation has a very long window to it, 2024. This is some period \nto come.\n  These are economic analyses which are useful to use to generally show \ntrend lines. I have learned enough over the years to not rely upon \nthese as money in the bank because factors come in to play--sanitary \nissues enter the picture, and we have recently been wrestling with BSE. \nThose all are major factors. Still, it points to a positive trend line.\n  As the Nation's top wheat exporter and with State farm cash receipts \nof $1.3 billion, Kansas wheat producers will benefit from CAFTA. Grain \nsuppliers will benefit from zero tariffs immediately on wheat in all \nsix countries, as well as some processed grain products.\n  Again, the American Farm Bureau economic analysis of CAFTA estimates \nthat Kansas will increase wheat exports to the six countries by $8 \nmillion per year. Again, this is after full implementation of CAFTA. \nThat is some time in the future. Its economic analysis could well be \noff, but it shows a generally positive trend line--small but positive. \nThat is why I say a little more good in the world for my producers.\n  I conclude by saying, as we continue to fight this global war on \nterrorism, we must continue to spread democracy and hope throughout the \nworld. Engaging in free trade practices and policies helps improve \nrelationships with other countries and improves the standard of living \nin these developing countries. Helping to improve other countries' \nstandard of living will result in a more hopeful society and a more \npeaceful world.\n  Certainly we have learned over the years that democracies are far \neasier and better for us to deal with. If we can help strengthen \ndemocracy, particularly in our hemisphere, by this passage, minor as it \nmight be as a positive point, that is a good and hopeful sign and \nsomething we should do.\n  I support CAFTA, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of passage \nof the CAFTA trade agreement.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of CAFTA. There are a \nlot of reasons to support this trade agreement. I came to this \ndecision, by the way, in the last couple of days.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Peace Corps, \nand Narcotics Affairs of the Foreign Relations Committee, I understand \nhow pivotal CAFTA is on U.S. foreign policy goals, not just in Central \nAmerica but Latin America and the Caribbean. There are folks in Latin \nAmerica looking at this agreement and what we do with it. I think they \nare going to judge us as to whether we are committed to strengthening \nthis hemisphere, committed to strengthening the democracies that are \nnow in Central America. There have been decades of civil war. We have \ndemocracies flourishing in Central America. Every President in those \ncountries was democratically elected. These leaders have come to us and \nsaid: We want to reform, we want to grow our economies and strengthen \ndemocracy.\n  CAFTA is important. Democracy in Central America is still fragile. \nPoverty is endemic. There is weakening enthusiasm for democracy. \nPressures are already present in Nicaragua. That is what we have.\n  We have to be realistic about CAFTA. It alone is not going to ensure \ndemocracy or prosperity in Central America, but it will put in place \nbuilding blocks for economic growth in the future. It will help these \nnations compete with the face of a rising China and, perhaps most of \nall, CAFTA is a political message that the United States recognizes how \nfar these nations have come and stands shoulder to shoulder with our \ndemocratic hemispheric neighbors. That is important.\n  I try to guide myself at times by the physicians' adage, which is, \n``Do no harm.'' Up until 2 days ago as I looked at CAFTA, it did harm. \nIt did harm to an industry that is very important to me in Minnesota. I \nrepresent probably the largest production of sugar beets in the \ncountry. People say: You are protectionist of an industry. It is not \nabout an industry, it is a matter of 40,000 moms and dads whose \neconomic livelihood is dependent on what happens with sugar. There is \n$2 billion a year injected into that economy in that region, and that \nis important.\n  As my colleagues know, yesterday the Agriculture Committee chairman, \nSaxby Chambliss from Georgia, and I secured a commitment from the White \nHouse to address the serious concerns we had regarding CAFTA and sugar. \nChairman Chambliss--I don't think they grow a lot of sugar beets in \nGeorgia. In fact, I was expecting by the end of that negotiation that \nthere would be a peach-to-ethanol program coming out of that \narrangement, but that did not happen.\n  Chairman Chambliss made it very clear that he is going to protect the \nfarm bill, see the continuation of the farm bill which is set to expire \nin 2007.\n  As we looked at CAFTA as we negotiated, it would have violated the \nfarm bill in that it had the prospect of having sugar from CAFTA \ncountries entering this country, if it reaches a certain level and goes \nover that--I will not get into the technicalities of the sugar \nprogram--one sees the collapse of the sugar program. One sees sugar \nforfeited to the Government, prices falling, economic disaster for \nthose involved in the sugar industry.\n  So Chairman Chambliss showed great leadership and great courage in \nsaying he was not going to support CAFTA because it had this hole in \nthe agreement that would in the end perhaps amount to a violation of \nprovisions of the farm bill. He stood firm. Together, then, with a \nnumber of our other colleagues, both in the House and the Senate, he \nhad a series of discussions with the administration, with the sugar \nindustry, and got a commitment.\n\n[[Page S7700]]\n\nAgain, I want to thank Chairman Chambliss, who stood with those of us \nwho represent sugar, though that was not a personal thing. It was \nsimply the right thing to do. That is the way he operates, with good \nGeorgia common sense and that incredible Georgia strength.\n  The commitment we have from the administration pledges to ensure that \nthe maximum sugar import cap established under the 2002 farm bill will \nnever be violated through the life of this farm bill. So that magic \nlevel of 1.532 million tons that we call short tons is not going to be \nviolated. This commitment was made in the context of CAFTA, but the \ncommitment is not limited to CAFTA and that is important. During the \ncourse of our discussions, we became aware that other things were going \non regarding sugar, that under NAFTA we were facing a situation in \nwhich resolving a high fructose corn syrup issue that involves the \nability for us to bring more of that into Mexico, the result would have \nbeen more Mexican sugar coming into the United States and, again, then \ngoing over this level and triggering the collapse of the program.\n  In the end, as I stood there working for my sugar growers and those \nwhose livelihoods depend on sugar, I wanted to make sure our folks were \nheld harmless by CAFTA. We got that commitment from the administration. \nWe wanted to make sure they were held harmless by the impact of what is \nhappening with NAFTA. We got a commitment to hold them harmless during \nthe course of this farm bill.\n  Then we were concerned about other trade agreements that are being \nnegotiated at this time. There are discussions with Panama, discussions \nwith Thailand, all of which could have had the same effect of reaching \nthat maximum sugar import cap and violating and causing a collapse of \nthe program. We wanted to be held harmless for that, our sugar growers \ndid, and we got them that commitment.\n  Under this agreement any sugar imports above the current cap \nestablished by the farm bill, whether under CAFTA, NAFTA, or any other \ntrade agreement, would be denied entry into the United States \naltogether unless an equivalent amount of U.S. sugar is converted into \nethanol or other nonfood uses with at least 109,000 tons--and that is \nwhat we would have gotten from NAFTA--being converted to ethanol under \na pilot program run by the USDA.\n  In addition, we received a commitment to begin a study on the long-\nterm promise of the sugar-to-ethanol program. That promise is real. I \nwas in Brazil not too long ago. Fifty percent of all the new cars in \nBrazil run on ethanol. Those cars are manufactured--the largest \nmanufacturer is General Motors, an American manufacturer, and all the \nethanol in Brazil is done by sugar. So we know the rest of the world \ndoes it. We can do it here.\n  The commitment has been made. The commitment stands. It is through \nthe length of the farm bill. The farm bill goes for another 3 years, \nbut if it should be extended--and I think it should be--the White House \ncommitment is also extended.\n  The bottom line is this: Not only do we prevent CAFTA from breaking \nthe farm bill limit on sugar imports, but we prevent NAFTA and all \nfuture trade agreements from breaking the farm bill cap as well.\n  In addition, what we do--and I think this is so critically \nimportant--is lay the ground for the long-term future of the U.S. sugar \nindustry which lies not just in production in the United States--\nbecause we do not export sugar to other countries; it is for domestic \nconsumption--but production to fuel our country through renewable fuels \nright alongside corn and soybeans. That is the future.\n  This country is beginning to understand that we simply cannot deal \nwith the continuing increase in imports of foreign crude. A barrel of \noil is $60. A price of a gallon of gas is $2.30, $2.40, $2.50, $2.70. \nWe have our own oilfields, and there are cornfields, soybean fields, \nand sugar fields, beet and cane. They are providing an opportunity--we \nhave sugar now on the path.\n  I know many of my sugar farmers and cooperatives do not agree with me \non this commitment, do not agree with me on this solution. I respect \nthat. What we have is a concern that they would much rather see a \npermanent solution. We have permanent solutions now with corn into \nethanol and soybeans into ethanol. These are dedicated folks. They sat \nat the table the whole time.\n\n  One of the critics of this proposal or commitment that I have, and I \ntake it seriously, said, this is a Band-Aid on a gaping wound. I would \nsay to my friends at American Crystal, at Minn-Dak, at Southern \nMinnesota, and other cooperatives and other places throughout the \ncountry that, in fact, there is a gaping wound; that the sugar industry \nis one that is right now in a fragile place. I would argue that rather \nthan a Band-Aid, this is a tourniquet; that for 3 years we stop the \nbleeding; for 3 years we then will be able to begin to develop a \nnascent sugar-to-ethanol industry; that we then get ourselves to focus \non the next farm bill and try to make sure we have a program that has \ngreater permanence, that has greater long-term security so the kids in \nFisher and Hallock and throughout, certainly. Western Minnesota can go \nto school with moms and dads not worrying about their jobs. I am \ntalking not just farmers but truckers and factory workers and seed \ndealers and implement dealers. The list goes on and on. Up and down \nMain Street, sugar makes a positive mark on communities throughout my \nState. So, for me, this is worth fighting for. It is worth defending. \nThat is what I believe we have done with this commitment.\n  Without it, the Red River Valley has zero protection from NAFTA, zero \nprotection, obviously, from CAFTA which we are talking about today, \nzero protection from future trade agreements. Again, under NAFTA alone \nthere is some discussion of perhaps 900,000 tons of Mexican sugar \npouring in over the border the next couple of years. Without this \nprotection, without this commitment, prices would tank and the U.S. \nsugar policy would be placed in serious jeopardy. That keeps me up at \nnight. That worries me.\n  I am going to sleep a little easier knowing that my farmers are \nprotected with this commitment. That is what we have then, this 3-year \nwindow to turn all the attention and energy we had to focus on the past \non putting our fires toward creating a positive solution and a future \nfor this industry. That is my choice. That is the future that I choose.\n  That said, let me be very clear about something, and I want to lay \nthis on the line, kind of talk as we look to the future. Two years ago, \nI said sugar should not be included in these bilateral regional \nagreements. We would not have these discussions, if that was the case. \nJust as domestic support for every other American farmer is not \nincluded in these kinds of agreements, sugar was not asking for \nanything special. The fact is, sugar should not be included in these \nagreements because the distortions in a global sugar market cannot be \naddressed fairly in any other setting other than WTO. This has to be \naddressed on a global perspective; otherwise, what we have is little \nbits and pieces come in. Ultimately, we flood this country without \ndealing with what is happening in this global environment.\n  Europeans have a lot more protective interests and support they \nprovide for their sugar growers than what we face right here. So every \nsugar-producing country in the world subsidizes and supports this \nindustry, which is why American sugar farmers, who are among the top \nthird in efficiency, need a strong U.S. sugar policy to stand with \nthem.\n  We did what is right in the Australian agreement, which is why it \npassed so quickly. For some reason, this common sense did not show \nthrough when CAFTA was negotiated. Again, the good news is in the near \nterm we have a commitment from this White House to hold the U.S. sugar \nprogram harmless not only under CAFTA but under NAFTA and any future \ntrade agreements.\n  At the end of the day, let me say that I share the disappointment of \nthose in the sugar industry who want something more permanent, but I do \nfeel I have to grab hold of the possible when the optimal seems to be \nout of reach. I think politically it would be easy for me to just cast \na ``no'' vote, just say to my producers the industry does not like this \nand kick the can down the road. Then, if 900,000 tons of NAFTA\n\n[[Page S7701]]\n\nsugar gets dumped in, I can maybe pretend that it is just enough to be \nangry, just enough to say why did we not do something.\n  The easy thing is not always the right thing to do. Sometimes when \none is dealing with friends, they have to be told they are wrong. \nSometimes leadership is letting people know that we have to go to a \ncertain place even if they do not yet see the righteousness of going \nthere.\n  The right place to be is to have this insurance policy, to have \nprotection from CAFTA, from NAFTA, from future trade agreements, and \nreally important, get us involved in the sugar-to-ethanol industry.\n  Last comment: I listened as I sat in the Presiding Officer's chair to \na lot of debate. I heard so many of my colleagues today saying we have \nto be doing more for Central America, except the one thing Central \nAmericans say they want and need most. It reminds me of a joke we have \nin Minnesota about the Scandinavian guy who loved his wife so much he \nalmost told her.\n  I listened to my friends across the aisle and they tell me they care \nso much, and we have to be doing more, but they do not want to do \nanything. They want to protect the workers, those in Central America, \ngive them economic opportunity. Listen to their elected leaders who say \nthis is important rather than lamenting what we should have done or \ncould have done but did not do.\n  We have an opportunity to do something, and that is what we are \ndoing. In the end, my decision was only made in the last couple of days \nbecause the concern about sugar has been so great. Maybe it is the dad \non me who focuses not so much on the ones who are doing well but the \nones who need a little help. Our friends in sugar needed a little help \nafter this agreement was negotiated. We provided that help.\n  Doing that, I can then stand with all the other producers in my \nState: the commodity groups, the cattlemen, the corn growers, the \nsoybean growers, the pork producers, the businesses, the chambers of \ncommerce, the high-tech folks, the 3Ms--all who say this is a good \nthing for jobs in Minnesota, this is a good thing for the economic \nfuture, and as a result I will cast my vote for CAFTA.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my time be \ncharged against that of Senator Grassley, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I first want to say thanks to my good \nfriend from Minnesota for his kind comments. I am going to have more to \nsay about him in a few minutes. The one thing we all find out in this \ngreat institution that we have the privilege of serving in is that \neverybody in their own way represents, in a very strong manner, the \nconstituents who sent them here. Nobody has represented their \nconstituents better over the last several weeks relative to this issue \nof CAFTA, and particularly the sugar issue, like Norm Coleman has.\n  Senator Coleman has been a true advocate for the interests of his \nState. They need to erect a big sugar beet for him and call it the \nSenator Coleman Memorial back in Minnesota.\n  I rise today to support the Dominican Republic-Central America Free \nTrade Agreement or DR-CAFTA. Earlier this year, I expressed opposition \nto DR-CAFTA since a provision in the agreement violates a part of the \n2002 farm bill.\n  As chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I have a \nresponsibility to the agricultural community to ensure Congress \nfulfills the commitments that we made to farmers and ranchers back in \n2002 when we negotiated the farm bill and when it was passed by the \nHouse, by the Senate, and signed into law by the President.\n  My specific concern centered on a provision that severely impacts the \nimplementation of the farm bill by increasing sugar imports into the \nUnited States.\n  We grow very little sugar in my State. This is not a parochial \ninterest to me. Senator Coleman is right, perhaps I should have \nnegotiated a peach, tobacco, or cotton ethanol provision in here. My \nwhole point in this matter is that we have to maintain the integrity of \nthe farm bill. It could just as easily have been a corn issue, wheat \nissue, or a peanut issue, but it just happened to be sugar. This could \npotentially result in exceeding the import trigger provided for in the \nfarm bill.\n  Exceeding the import trigger is of utmost concern because it is \ndesigned to manage domestic supplies and ensure the program operates at \na no net cost to the U.S. taxpayer. The DR-CAFTA could compromise that \ntrigger when combined with existing commitments to Mexico under the \nNorth American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.\n  In addition, the so-called compensation mechanism in the DR-CAFTA \ndoes not provide any additional comfort. I do not think it is a good \nidea to pay other countries not to import sugar into the United States \nwhen we can use those resources to promote fuel security here at home. \nI believe we all should be chastised back home if we let that happen.\n\n  There have been several long weeks of discussions between the \nadministration, which included the White House, USDA and USTR \nofficials, Senators and House Members, and industry representatives. \nAfter much hard work, the administration has agreed to a proposal that \naddresses my concerns relative to this trade agreement.\n  Secretary Johanns has sent me a letter that provides assurances that \nthe sugar program will operate as we originally intended through the \n2007 crop year. Furthermore, the Secretary committed to holding the \nsugar program harmless for the next 2\\1/2\\ years, to the completion of \nthis farm bill, from any harmful effects of CAFTA, of NAFTA, and of any \nother trade agreement that may be negotiated during the interim period.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Secretary's letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                 The Secretary of Agriculture,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 29, 2005.\n     Hon. Saxby Chambliss,\n     Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, \n         Russell Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Bob Goodlatte,\n     Chairman, House Agriculture Committee, Longworth Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Chambliss and Chairman Goodlatte: The purpose \n     of this letter is to provide assurance that the Dominican \n     Republic-Central America-United States (CAFTA-DR) Free Trade \n     Agreement will not interfere with our ability to operate the \n     sugar program in a way that provides the full benefit to \n     domestic growers through the remainder of the Farm Security \n     and Rural Investment Act of 2002.\n       The Farm Bill contains a sugar ``import trigger'' of 1,532 \n     million short tons which if exceeded precludes the use of \n     domestic marketing quotas and thus could prevent the program \n     from being operated on a ``no net cost'' basis as required by \n     the law.\n       Since the U.S. Government already is obligated under \n     international agreements to import annually 1.256 million \n     short tons, there is some concern that annual imports from \n     NAFTA, CAFTA, and other trade agreements in addition to this \n     amount could exceed the Farm Bill trigger and thus jeopardize \n     operation of the program. However, the Charter Act of the \n     Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) provides additional tools \n     required to preclude that eventuality.\n       In the event I determine that sugar imports will exceed the \n     current Farm Bill trigger, appropriate steps will be taken to \n     ensure the program is not put at risk. As Secretary of \n     Agriculture, I have the authority to preclude the actual \n     entry of imported sugar into the domestic sweetener market by \n     making payments to exporters and direct purchase of the sugar \n     for restricted (nonfood) use, including ethanol. It would be \n     my intention to use agricultural commodities in payments or \n     to make direct purchases.\n       Two possible situations could obtain:\n       If I determine that the Farm Bill import trigger will be \n     exceeded and that the domestic market is adequately supplied \n     with sugar (i.e., that the imported quantities above the \n     trigger will jeopardize sugar program operation), then I will \n     direct that excess imported sugar up to an amount equivalent \n     to the CAFTA-DR imports be purchased by CCC and be made \n     available for conversion into ethanol. Excess sugar above \n     that amount could either be precluded entry by payment to \n     exporters or made available for non-food use, as I deem \n     appropriate.\n       If I determine that the amount of sugar that can be \n     provided by domestic growers plus the minimum import \n     requirement is insufficient to meet the domestic market's \n     needs and that imports sufficient to do so will exceed the \n     Farm Bill import trigger, then those imports will be allowed \n     and no sugar would be diverted for conversion to ethanol.\n       In addition, USDA will undertake a study of the feasibility \n     of converting sugar into\n\n[[Page S7702]]\n\n     ethanol. Data obtained from any conversion of sugar to \n     ethanol, as noted above, will become a part of the study \n     analysis. This study will be completed and submitted to the \n     Congress not later than July 1, 2006.\n       Such actions would ensure that the Farm Bill trigger is not \n     exceeded to the disadvantage of growers and that U.S. sugar \n     procedures will still have a share of the market no less than \n     the amount provided for by the Congress through the sugar \n     program.\n       I will establish a special monitoring mechanism to review \n     all U.S. Customs, Bureau of the Census, and other import data \n     through the year. This mechanism will enable me to stay \n     apprised of the pace of imports and to use the Charter Act \n     authorization in a timely manner. Also, the Office of the \n     U.S. Trade Representative has analyzed this approach and \n     concluded that it is not inconsistent with our World Trade \n     Organization obligations.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Mike Johanns.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Specifically, if the farm bill import trigger is \nexceeded and the domestic market does not need additional quantities, \nthen the excess imported sugar, up to an amount equivalent to the DR-\nCAFTA imports, will be purchased by the Commodity Credit Corporation \nand made available for conversion into ethanol. Excess sugar above the \ntrigger in the DR-CAFTA amount would be precluded entry by payment to \nexporters or preferably directed to other nonfood uses, such as \nadditional ethanol production.\n  I think this is a very important development, since it is the first \ntime the Department is committing itself to a sucrose-to-ethanol \nprogram. The Department will also conduct a feasibility study examining \nthe economics of sucrose-based ethanol. The study will be completed and \nsubmitted to the Congress not later than July 1, 2006. This should be \nenough time for us to use the information contained in the study to \ndevelop a long-term future program for the sugar industry in the next \nfarm bill.\n  On Tuesday of this week, we passed a very historic bill in this body. \nOur country has the greatest natural resources of any country in the \nworld, but yet we have never established a long-term energy policy. For \nthe first time in the history of the country we passed an Energy bill \nthat will move us in the direction of becoming less dependent on \nforeign imports of oil for our petroleum and other fuel needs in this \ncountry. A major part of that Energy bill was a provision for \nalternative fuel resources like ethanol. In fact, there is a provision \nin there for the production of 8 billion gallons of ethanol per year in \nthis country, which would be great if we could produce that amount and \nhave it available all across America and not in the limited areas where \nit now is used.\n  The reason it is in limited areas today is because we simply do not \nhave the production of organic-based material to provide ethanol all \nacross America. But with this provision that has been negotiated as a \npart of this agreement with the Secretary and USTR, we are going to \ntake another crop, sugar, and we are going to convert sugar into \nethanol in much the same way that we convert corn into ethanol, so we \ncan have a greater supply of an alternative fuel, other than gasoline, \nfor use by the American consumer.\n  Under this agreement, the Secretary will have the ability to meet any \nchanging domestic market conditions. If the amount of sugar provided by \ndomestic growers, plus the minimum import requirement, is insufficient \nto meet the domestic market's needs and imports sufficient to do so \nwill exceed the farm bill import trigger, then those imports will be \nallowed and no sugar would be diverted for conversion to ethanol.\n  Another important aspect of this agreement will ensure that the USDA \nwill review all U.S. Customs, Bureau of Census, and other import data \nto monitor imports throughout any given year. Many of us have heard \ncriticism with regard to past trade agreements about lax enforcement \nand implementation of their provisions to the detriment of our \nproducers. This will help address those concerns.\n  In spite of the letter from Secretary Johanns and the assurances of \nthe administration, the sugar industry opposes this agreement and will \nnot support passage of this trade agreement. While I may disagree with \ntheir conclusions, that is their right. I want to say, at this time, \nthat we have had a number of meetings between Members of the House, \nMembers of the Senate, members of the industry--which have included \nUSTR and other administration officials, including Secretary Johanns. \nWe have had meetings with them and without them. At every single \ncrossing, the sugar industry has negotiated in good faith and they have \nbeen very straightforward and above board with us. I commend those men.\n  It is a great country that we live in that will allow us to dialog \nover an issue that is so important, as is this, to those farmers, to \nthe Members of the House, and the Members of the Senate, as well as to \nothers who have a significant interest in this, and to come out at the \nend of the day with an agreement with which some of us agree but with \nwhich others still have the opportunity to disagree.\n  This agreement can be a real building block for sugar provisions in \nthe next farm bill. Let me emphasize that my concerns have been fully \nsatisfied, and I do plan to vote in favor of DR-CAFTA.\n  This trade agreement is also important to many people in my home \nState of Georgia. I have heard from many workers who will reap the \nbenefits of increased trade with Central America and the Dominican \nRepublic. Reducing trade barriers will not only enhance American \neconomic growth but will greatly benefit businesses in Georgia as well, \nby allowing more Georgia-made products to be sold into Central America.\n  The DR-CAFTA region is an important trading partner with Georgia. \nGeorgia's exports to the DR-CAFTA region increased $113 million from \n2000 to 2004, and collectively the countries of DR-CAFTA were Georgia's \n9th largest export destination.\n  According to the Department of Commerce, the DR-CAFTA will help \nGeorgia's textile manufacturers, chemical and paper manufacturers, as \nwell as Georgia's farmers, because DR-CAFTA provides U.S. suppliers \nwith access to these markets and levels the playing field with other \ncompetitors.\n  Let me take a moment to praise the efforts of the Secretary Mike \nJohanns and U.S. Trade Representative Rob Portman for their hard work \nand their tireless efforts. These officials addressed each and every \nissue that we discussed. Without their good-faith efforts, this \nagreement simply would not have been possible.\n  Special note should also go to my good friend, Senator Norm Coleman. \nHis leadership and hard work in this effort has only increased my \nenormous respect for him. We have worked very closely over the past \ncouple of weeks helping lay the foundation for a long-term and \nprofitable future for the U.S. sugar industry. He is a workhorse, and I \nwant him on my side every time.\n  Let me conclude by saying I am very pleased with what we have \ncrafted. This agreement will protect the sugar industry for the next \n2\\1/2\\ years, through the life of this current farm bill. It deserves \nthe support of the Congress. I look forward to voting for DR-CAFTA.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. CORZINE. If the chair will be so kind to let me know when I have \n2 minutes left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Certainly.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, let me say from the start, I have thought \nabout this long and hard. I believe in the seriousness and the \npotential for free-trade agreements. But after looking at this \nparticular one, and looking at it in the context of our overall \nmacroeconomic policy, I am unfortunately going to have to vote against \nthis proposed Dominican Republic-Central America-Free Trade Agreement.\n  I have supported other agreements: Australia, Jordan, and Morocco. I \nbelieve in comparative advantage. There are lots of good reasons why \nfree-trade agreements that are fair are ones we ought to promote. But \nthey need to preserve and protect important labor, environmental, and \nsecurity interests as well. I do not think this one does that. As a \nmatter of fact, a trade agreement between the United States and Central \nAmerica with the proper safeguards I think is a good thing. I just do \nnot believe that we have embedded those in this particular agreement.\n  American workers justifiably feel insecure in today's economy, \nparticularly with the outsourcing or exporting\n\n[[Page S7703]]\n\nof American jobs that comes from so much of our trade policy. People \nare concerned whether those American jobs are going to stay at home. \nThe increasing trade deficit puts an exclamation point on ``there is \nsomething afoul'' with our trade policy.\n  All I have to do is point to this chart. Since 1993, when we started \nwith NAFTA to where we are today, we have seen nothing but red ink flow \nfrom the trade agreements and trade arrangements that we have. \nSomething is not working.\n  I would like to understand how this agreement is not just another \npiece, another one in a long line of bad trade agreements. Before we \nrush forward with this, I would like to understand what is happening \nthat has brought about this kind of problem. We have a $617 billion \ntrade deficit on an annualized basis this year. I believe we have a lot \nof evaluation that needs to be taken before we step forward on this. We \nare clearly on the wrong track, based on the policies that we have.\n  On a parochial level, since NAFTA was implemented back in 1994, New \nJersey has lost 130,000 manufacturing jobs. We used to have about 25 \npercent of our workforce in the mid-1980s in the manufacturing \nindustry. Today it is below 9 percent.\n  We have seen the textile industry in New Jersey absolutely decimated. \nFrom the economic calculations that I have seen, 46,000 of those \n130,000 manufacturing jobs lost were due to NAFTA.\n  We had great companies--Allied Signal, American Standard. All of \nPatterson's textile industry left our State. We have had enough of it. \nI think we need to understand what we are doing and what the \nimplications are for working men and women of this country of another \nfree-trade agreement.\n  If you put this into a context that the gross metropolitan product of \nthe city of Newark is $103 billion, and this is only $85 billion for \nall these countries--I don't understand why this is such a priority, \nparticularly given all the other issues that we have in this country \nand particularly while we are thinking about it in the context of a \n$617 billion trade deficit.\n  I don't think we have our priorities ordered right here. I \nparticularly think we do not have them ordered right when you compare \nthis issue with our trade deficit with China, which is $162 billion. \nThis, I am told, is the No. 1 priority of the administration with \nregard to trade policy. Where does that come from, when we have all of \nthese difficulties in our trade arrangements?\n  China has had a fixed currency pegging versus the dollar since the \nlate 1990s, not working to protect intellectual property rights between \nour two countries, and there are all kinds of enforcement issues with \nthe WTO. I don't get it. Where are our priorities? We have a $617 \nbillion trade deficit. We are talking about something that will be a \nminuscule piece of that. And we are doing it with a blind eye to major \nproblems in our trade policy.\n  That is the major reason I am voting against it. There are a whole \nhost of other issues that need to be considered. What happens to labor \nrights and what happens to environmental rights not only with regard to \nour workers but in those countries themselves? Where are we going to \ngo, when we look at the lack of enforcement with regard to labor \nprinciples in those individual countries? The same thing goes for \nenvironmental issues. I don't understand why we are ceding the ground \non these issues. Believe me, we have enforcement standards with regard \nto commercial rights and investment rights, but when it comes to \nworking men and women, when it comes to our environmental protection--\nwhich, by the way, is a global issue--we just say it is up to them with \nregard to their own standards.\n  That is not the way to do business, in my view, and I think this is a \nfailed piece of legislation. It is a step back from what we did with \nMorocco and Jordan and other trade agreements that had positive \nenforcement responsibilities with regard to labor and environmental \nrights. This harms workers in those countries, not only harming workers \nin the United States.\n  There is a very clear example. I want to talk a little bit about it. \nNAFTA's liberalization, so-called, was supposed to promote job growth \nin Mexico. It lost 1.7 million rural farmers their access into the \nagricultural sector in Mexico, with the only increase, of about 800,000 \nnew jobs, in the industrial sector. Some of those are now leaving \nbecause they are losing out to other parts of the world that have even \nlower labor standards and environmental standards and lower costs of \nlabor. There is something wrong with this vicious cycle of eroding jobs \nhere at home, even in some of the places that we think we are promoting \nthem, through these free-trade agreements, and we have to get this \nsettled out.\n  I do not understand why we continue to stay on the same track--and I \nam an old, washed-up businessman. I believe in making sure the \ncomparative advantage follows in the proper way. If it turns out you go \nfrom a balanced trade arrangement to a $617 billion trade imbalance in \na given year, and you have seen almost nothing but a straight line fall \noff in our ability to export our goods on a relative basis to the rest \nof the world, we are making a big mistake, and we have a lot to \nreevaluate.\n  It is time for a change with regard to our trade policies because \nthey are not working economically and we are losing our ability to \ncontrol our own destiny in our foreign reserves in other countries. It \nis not working because we are losing jobs at home and undermining \nworking men and women's ability to have a high-quality standard of \nliving, and we are not particularly helping others overseas. It is not \na net boom for the countries we think we are trying to support.\n  If we are not going to have strong labor, strong environmental \nrights, if we are not going to get some kind of benefit, a major \nmacroeconomic benefit, I don't understand why we are approving all of \nthese trade agreements. That is why I will be voting no on this CAFTA \nlegislation before the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes from the time of \nSenator Grassley.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I shall not object, but I wonder if I \nmight add to the unanimous consent request. Senator DeWine has asked \nfor 10 minutes of Senator Grassley's time; we ask that Senator Byrd be \nrecognized for 20 minutes from my time following the presentation by \nSenator DeWine; following that, Senator Burr be recognized for 10 \nminutes from Senator Grassley's time; following that, Senator Reid will \nbe recognized for 10 minutes from Senator Baucus's time. I ask that by \nunanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator specify which Senator Reid?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Senator Reid from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Thank you. I apologize for interrupting my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, DR-CAFTA is good for my home State of \nOhio, and it is good for our country.\n  I was in the House of Representatives in the 1980s when significant \nstrides were made toward democracy in Central America. We all remember \nthat struggle. We all remember the resources that were put into Central \nAmerica by the United States. It is time for us to refocus on Central \nAmerica. If Central America is going to flourish, if democracy is going \nto continue in Central America and the economy is going to develop \nthere, this is an essential component of that, an essential piece of \nthat. While it is true that DR-CAFTA is only one piece of the puzzle, \nit is an important piece in determining the economic health of our \nneighbors to the south. Also, it is important to our own Nation as \nwell.\n  DR-CAFTA is about fairness. It is about reciprocity. It would provide \nU.S. exporters with the same market access to Central America that \nCentral American exporters unilaterally received through the past 20 \nyears through various trade agreements. These trade agreements led to a \none-sided lowering of tariffs. Currently, approximately 80 percent of \nCentral America's exports enter the United States duty free. This \nunilateral tariff reduction helped Central American countries export to \nthe United States but left U.S. producers facing steep and often \nprohibitive tariffs when they\n\n[[Page S7704]]\n\ntried to export their own goods into Central America.\n  With DR-CAFTA, more than 80 percent of U.S. manufacturing exports to \nthe region will be duty free immediately, and the remaining tariffs \nwill be phased out over 10 years, including the up to 15 percent \ntariffs on some of Ohio's top exports to the region such as chemicals, \nelectrical equipment and appliances, machinery, plastics, rubber, \npaper, processed foods, and transportation equipment. For Ohio's \nagricultural producers, DR-CAFTA would eliminate tariffs on 50 percent \nof U.S. exports immediately and most remaining duties within 15 years.\n\n  A perfect example of the benefits of DR-CAFTA is a situation faced by \nHeinz. Heinz has a catsup production facility in Fremont, OH, where \nthey produce 80 percent of the catsup consumed in the entire United \nStates. Heinz also produces numerous other condiments throughout the \nUnited States. Yet Heinz faces 15 to 47 percent tariffs on their \nproducts when they try to export to Central America. DR-CAFTA will \nchange that. CAFTA will help ensure that the up to three generations of \nworkers in Fremont, OH, in that factory will have jobs for themselves, \njobs for their children when they grow up. This is just one example of \nwhy Ohio needs DR-CAFTA and why this entire country needs DR-CAFTA.\n  Another good example is Polychem, located in Mentor, OH. They have \nbeen in business for over 30 years. They have grown to more than 200 \nemployees. They manufacture industrial strapping but cannot export into \nthe Central American market competitively now because of high tariffs. \nDR-CAFTA would level the playing field for Polychem, allowing them to \nexpand their exports and grow jobs in Ohio.\n  By requiring Central American countries to lower their tariffs on \nU.S. products, the United States would be able to sell into a consumer \nbase 45 million strong that already today buys American. The 45 million \ncitizens represented by the DR-CAFTA agreement purchase today more U.S. \ngoods than the 1.53 billion citizens of India, Indonesia, and Russia \ncombined. DR-CAFTA will simply increase that.\n  Not only do these consumers already buy America but, significantly \nfor my State, they buy Ohio. In the past 5 years, Ohio exports to the \nDR-CAFTA region have grown by 90 percent, far outpacing their demands \nfor exports from any other State in America. In 2004 alone, Ohio \nexported $197 million in manufactured goods to the region, including \nchemical and manufacturing goods, plastics, rubber products, fabric \nmilled goods, electrical equipment, and appliances. These are just the \nlargest categories. Each and every Senator could easily come to the \nSenate today and add a list similar to this.\n  The list of DR-CAFTA support is long in my home State of Ohio. In \nOhio, the Ohio Pork Producers Council, the Ohio Soybean Association, \nthe Ohio Poultry Association, the Ohio Dairy Producers, the Ohio \nCattlemen's Association, the Ohio Farm Bureau, the Ohio Farm Growers, \nand the Ohio Wheat Growers Association all support DR-CAFTA. Those are \njust the supporters in the Ohio agricultural sector.\n  While many are helped by free trade, we understand whenever we have \nfree trade legislation or free trade there are some individuals in \nsociety who are hurt. We need to make sure we always are concerned \nabout them, that we pass legislation that assists them, and we must \ncontinue in this Congress to do that. Yet if we turn our backs on free \ntrade, we would ultimately have far more unemployed Americans, and our \neconomy would be a fraction of what it is today.\n  For example, in the first year after the enactment of the United \nStates-Chile Free Trade Agreement, Ohio's exports to Chile grew 20 \npercent; and since NAFTA was enacted in 1993, Ohio's combined exports \nto Canada and Mexico have increased by more than 106 percent. More \nexports means more jobs for Ohio and more jobs for our country as a \nwhole.\n\n  Mr. President, as I said already, DR-CAFTA is good for Ohio, it is \ngood for the United States. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of \nthis important free-trade agreement. But let me say one additional \nthing. As much as I support DR-CAFTA, there is something else that \nneeds to be done, and that is this Congress needs to pass trade \nlegislation that will assist the country of Haiti.\n  Last year, the Senate passed an important trade bill for Haiti, only \nto see that trade agreement die in the House of Representatives. I have \nraised this issue with the administration and with my colleagues in \nboth the House and the Senate. Haiti, the poorest country by far in our \nhemisphere, arguably needs our attention the most. To leave them out \nand to not pass trade legislation to assist them is shortsighted, it is \nwrong, and it is not helpful. We make a mistake by leaving them out.\n  If nothing is done by this Congress soon to pass a trade agreement \nthat will be of assistance to Haiti, it will really be a deathblow to \nwhat remains of Haiti's economy, and we will be seeing boats swollen \nwith Haitians heading back to our shores again.\n  Mr. President, I simply implore my colleagues, as well as the Bush \nadministration, that after CAFTA is passed, we look again to \nlegislation that I have proposed with many of my colleagues to be of \nassistance to Haiti. It is the right thing to do from a humanitarian \npoint of view, but it is also the right thing to do from a foreign \npolicy point of view as well.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from West Virginia is recognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, on April 6 of this year, Senator Dorgan and I \nintroduced S. Res. 100, a resolution to prevent a 2-year extension of \nthe so-called fast track or trade promotion authority, which the \nCongress granted the administration in the Trade Act of 2002. If our \nresolution were approved, existing fast-track negotiating authority \nwould expire this year. If only it would. If only it would. Wouldn't it \nbe ideal if it would expire? I think so. But, instead, it will be \nextended through 2007. That is a crying shame.\n  Senator Dorgan and I introduced that resolution of disapproval to \nfast track because we oppose giving any executive--any chief executive, \nDemocrat or Republican--the unfettered authority to negotiate trade \nagreements such as CAFTA which cannot be amended by the Congress. It \ncannot be amended. All of this praise I hear of CAFTA--we have too \nlittle time here to consider and no time to amend. We cannot amend. Too \nlittle time. Too much praise. Too much short shrift. Too much short \nshrift is given to this, the Constitution of the United States, which I \nhold in my hand. Yes, too much praise, too little time, too much short \nshrift.\n  I opposed fast track when it was used to negotiate the NAFTA; I \nopposed fast track when it was used to negotiate the Uruguay Round; and \nI oppose fast track today.\n  Let me restate what I have said so many times--so many times--in the \npast, something that I think people may be finally beginning to \ncomprehend. Article I, section 8 of this Constitution, which I hold in \nmy hand, states that the Congress--hear me--that the Congress, not the \nexecutive, shall have the power to ``regulate Commerce with foreign \nNations.'' And under Article I, section 7, the Senate is permitted to \n``propose or concur with'' amendments to all revenue bills.\n  But under fast track--this shabby, shabby piece of trash--under fast \ntrack--this trumped-up power grab called fast track which is now \ndisingenuously called trade promotion authority--listen to that: trade \npromotion authority--the Congress is left with no ability to modify the \ntext of these trade agreements. And we did it to ourselves. Congress \ndid it to itself. As a result, they are negotiated by a small band of \nbureaucratic gnomes--bureaucratic gnomes--accountable to whom? \nAccountable to no one, bureaucratic gnomes accountable to no one. But \nwe should not blame them. We should blame ourselves. The Congress of \nthe United States cut its own throat.\n  Under fast track, the Congress cannot modify, the Congress cannot \namend, the Congress cannot delete any section of trade agreements \nnegotiated by the USTR. Congress is excluded from the process, just \nlike we did to ourselves when we shifted the power to declare war to a \nPresident, one man. We did it to ourselves. We shifted power under this \nConstitution--lodged\n\n[[Page S7705]]\n\nin the Congress, which shall declare war under this Constitution--we \nshifted that power to one man, and in so doing we relegated ourselves \nto the sideline.\n  So today what can we say? We cannot say anything. We did it to \nourselves. We said: Here, Mr. President, take it. It is yours, lock, \nstock, and barrel. That is what we did when it came to declaring war. \nAnd we are paying for it in Iraq.\n  But let's get back on this matter. We did it to ourselves again. We \nexcluded ourselves from the process. We cut ourselves out of the loop. \nWe cast ourselves aside, like excess baggage, shunned, shunned like the \nwoman who wore the scarlet letter.\n  But unlike Nathaniel Hawthorne's Hester Prynne, who had to sport only \none letter as a symbol of her wrongdoing, the shamed in this story \nshould be forced to wear three letters to highlight their humiliation. \nAnd those letters are ``TPA,'' which stands for ``trade promotion \nauthority.'' What a misnomer. How disingenuous can we become? Fast-\ntrack negotiating authority is an abomination--an abomination.\n  Is this what we think the Founding Fathers had in mind when they \ncreated our three separate branches of Government? We don't pay too \nmuch attention to that these days. Is this what they had in mind when \nthey created our three separate branches of Government? First, in this \nConstitution, the legislative branch, then the executive branch, then \nthe judicial branch. But that first branch, the people's branch, is \nthis what they had in mind when they created that first branch? Blind \nadherence to agreements negotiated behind closed doors, dictated word \nfor word by only one branch of the Government, the executive branch? Is \nthat what they had in mind? That is not what the Constitution says. It \nsays that the Congress shall regulate foreign commerce.\n  But the Congress, like blind mice or hyperactive lemmings, time and \ntime and time again just keeps on making the same mistake. It approves \nfast track. Each agreement negotiated under fast track destroys more \nAmerican jobs and leads our Nation into deeper and deeper deficits.\n  The overall U.S. trade deficit in 1993, when NAFTA was enacted, was \n$75.7 billion. Today what is it? Not $75.7 billion. It is nearly $700 \nbillion. Back in 1993--that hasn't been too long ago, back in 1993--the \nUnited States had a trade surplus with Mexico of $2.4 billion. Not too \nlong ago, 1993. Look backward, O time, in thy flight. We had a trade \nsurplus with Mexico of $2.4 billion in 1993, $2.4 billion. Last year we \nran a trade deficit of $45 billion with Mexico. There you have it. The \nfacts speak for themselves. Were these some of the promised benefits of \nNAFTA? It is too easy to forget. Were these some of the promised \nbenefits of NAFTA? Sky high, yes, way up in the stratosphere, sky-high \ntrade deficits? Since NAFTA and the Uruguay Round were negotiated under \nfast track, the United States has lost thousands--thousands, I say--of \nmanufacturing and service jobs, a substantial portion of which have \nbeen outsourced--we hear much of that word these days, ``outsourced''--\nto India or to China, leaving American workers' jobs without health \ncare and with diminished pensions.\n  I have seen it over and over again in West Virginia. I have seen it \nhappen time and time and time and time again, firsthand, in West \nVirginia. It has happened in our steel industry in West Virginia. It \nhas happened in the aluminum industry. It has happened in the glass \nindustry. It has happened in the communications industry. It has \nhappened in the special metals industry. It has happened in the \nfurniture industry. It has happened in textiles. It has happened in \nhandtools. Were these the promised benefits of NAFTA? Were these the \npromised benefits of the Uruguay Round? Who could have foreseen that \nthese agreements would cause such massive dislocation, such grief? Who? \nWho?\n  I will tell you who: Those of us who wisely voted against them. I \ndid, and so did about a third of the U.S. Senate. But the majority back \nthen refused to see what was coming. The majority refused to look. The \nmajority blindfolded itself and refused to see what was coming. I hope \nthey recognize what they see today.\n  Administrations like to allege that because they sometimes deign to \n``consult'' with the Congress on fast track trade agreements, their \nconsultations satisfy the need of Congress to be involved in drafting \nthe text of these agreements. We all know what a sham that is. Yes, \nthey condescend to consult with Congress, the people's elected \nrepresentatives. The President is indirectly elected by the electors, \nthe representatives of the people. We are elected by the people, \ndirectly by the people. I come here, as it were, directly from the \nvoting booth of the people. Despite all the assurances we heard during \nthe 2002 trade debate, I have been told that even members of the \nFinance Committee, the Senate Committee that is charged with \njurisdiction over trade matters, have been shut out. Can you believe \nit? Let me say that again. I can hardly believe what I am saying.\n  Despite all the assurances we heard during the 2002 trade debate, I \nhave been told that even members of the Senate Finance Committee, the \nSenate committee that is charged with jurisdiction over trade matters, \nhave been shut out of substantive consultations on CAFTA. My, how the \nmighty have fallen. Since only certain members of the Finance Committee \nare part of the congressional oversight group which was supposedly \ncreated in 2002 to ``consult'' with the White House, other Senators on \nthe Finance Committee who are not a part of that group have rarely been \nconsulted on CAFTA at all. What kind of consultation is that? What \nkind?\n  Similarly, the majority-controlled Senate Finance Committee refused \nto hold a hearing on the TPA resolution of disapproval that Senator \nDorgan and I introduced in April. The committee also refused--maybe I \nshould say ``declined''--to discharge the resolution so it could \nreceive an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor.\n  You hear that a lot around here, this demand for an up-or-down vote. \nI hear it said that nominees deserve an up-or-down vote. Who said that? \nThe President and others say the nominees deserve an up-or-down vote. \nThe Constitution doesn't say that. Here is the Constitution. It doesn't \nsay that. What do the American people deserve? That is what counts.\n  Well, the Senate leadership refused to give our resolution an up-or-\ndown vote. Instead, they killed it in committee. It died a natural \ndeath. They killed it in committee, despite a written request asking \nfor its discharge that was sent by Senators Dorgan, Graham, \nRockefeller, Johnson, Levin, Inouye, Dayton, and myself.\n  The proponents of fast track, TPA, and CAFTA argue that by expanding \nfree trade in Central America we will help the workers in those \ncountries--I have heard some of that today--become more stable and less \nof a national security threat. That is what we were told about NAFTA. \nWhat happened? Did NAFTA stabilize immigration? No. Since NAFTA was \nimplemented, the number of those migrating illegally into the United \nStates to seek work has doubled. Perhaps this is because the wages of \nMexican workers have declined and the number of people in poverty there \nhas grown.\n  Yet the administration wants us to enact now another NAFTA, this time \ncalled CAFTA--NAFTA, CAFTA; NAFTA CAFTA. Poetic, isn't it? It has a \nrhyming sound. NAFTA, CAFTA. Yesterday NAFTA, today CAFTA, what the \nAFL-CIO tells us will not require its members to maintain or improve \ntheir labor laws or to protect the core labor rights of their workers.\n  So the administration continues to negotiate these failed free-trade \nagreements, when it should be focusing on the real trade crises that \nface our Nation.\n  For example, while the administration has been spending its resources \non these agreements, it is doing nothing to address our Nation's \nenormous trade deficit, which soon will surpass $700 billion. What a \ndeficit--$700 billion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am so sorry about that, Mr. President. I ask unanimous \nconsent that I may be given 5 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair for his courtesy. May I say that the \nchairman\n\n[[Page S7706]]\n\nof the Finance Committee is a man whom I like. He is always friendly, \nalways courteous to me, and in Shakespeare's words, ``He's a man after \nmy own kidney.''\n  The administration also refuses to bring WTO cases against other \ncountries that violate international law. Yet it acquiesces when the \nWTO unfairly and deliberately twists international rules to strike down \nour own laws. In fact, the current administration has taken on only 12 \ncases to the WTO in over 4 years, compared with its predecessor, which \nfiled an average of 11 WTO cases per year.\n  The U.S. Trade Representative sits idly by while the WTO tries to \nundermine and/or eliminate our most critical trade laws, including the \nContinued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act, also known as the Byrd \namendment. A strong majority of the Senate supports the Byrd amendment, \nand this law will not be repealed or modified in response to the WTO. \nIn fact, in the fiscal year 2004 and 2005 Consolidated Appropriations \nActs both Houses of Congress directed the administration to start \nnegotiating a solution to this WTO dispute. In response to this \ncongressional mandate, the administration, in early 2004, submitted a \nproposal to a negotiating group in Geneva to reverse this WTO ruling \nagainst our law. But the administration has done nothing to advance \nthose negotiations since April 2004. The administration needs to stop \nstalling and start solving this problem.\n  History shows that it is a big mistake for the Congress to cede its \nauthority to negotiate trade agreements to the Executive--and I am not \njust talking about this administration. I have been in Congress 53 \nyears, and it is the same in every administration, Democratic and \nRepublican. They follow the State Department line all the time--because \nthe outcome of those agreements can have disastrous consequences for \nAmerican industry.\n  How much more negative history, how many more flawed consequences \nmust our Nation suffer before we wake up and realize that fast track \nhas been a disaster? Instead of negotiating more unfair, at any rate, \nagreements such as CAFTA, we should be fighting aggressively to \npreserve our Nation's trade laws and to protect the American workers \nand their families, and also protect the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I probably won't be as eloquent as the \nsenior Senator from West Virginia, but rest assured that I am just as \npassionate about the issue before this body.\n  I rise today, after months of countless discussions with interested \nparties, farmers, manufacturers, textile workers, and small businesses, \nto voice my support for the Central American Free Trade Agreement. It \nis not a decision that I have reached lightly.\n  While some in my State continue to raise concerns with this agreement \nand trade in general, I believe this agreement is in the long-term best \ninterests of North Carolina and our Nation. When I wake up in the \nmorning, I look forward, I don't look back; I look to the future. \nSimply put, Mr. President, voting no on this agreement would be the \neasy thing to do. However, I believe voting yes is, in fact, the right \nchoice for the State of North Carolina and its economic future.\n  It is only through agreements with our friends, neighbors, and allies \nthat we will be able to compete with Asia. Many will argue that this \nagreement is a jobs loser, and I certainly understand that feeling and \nrespect those opinions. After all, my home State of North Carolina is \nundergoing a significant economic transition which is changing the \nnature of our job market. However, I believe CAFTA will provide \nopportunities for economic growth in my State down the road.\n  CAFTA will provide garment makers in the region with a critical \nadvantage in competing with Asia--particularly Chinese--garment \nmanufacturers. This is crucial for one very important reason: those \nregional garment makers buy their yarn, their fabric, from American \ncompanies. Many of those companies are based in North Carolina. Those \nAmerican companies buy their cotton from American farmers. This is not \nthe case in Asia.\n  I am persuaded by the impressive level of trade between North \nCarolina and Central America today. North Carolina exported almost $2 \nbillion worth of merchandise to Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El \nSalvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua in 2004 alone. Only \nFlorida and Texas exported more. My State's exports to the region last \nyear accounted for almost 10 percent of our total exports. These \nexports translate into real jobs in North Carolina.\n  I am also persuaded by the side agreements that I know the President \nis well aware of--side agreements intended to address shortcomings in \nthe underlying agreement. Our new Trade Representative, my friend, Rob \nPortman, has committed he will utilize the CAFTA amendment mechanism to \npursue a rule-of-origin change for pockets and linings, helping ensure \nthat $100 million in U.S. pocketing and lining exports to the region \nare not lost. The administration has also reaffirmed its commitment to \nnegotiate an aggressive customs enforcement agreement with Mexico \nbefore the cumulation provisions of CAFTA can be used. Finally, \nNicaragua has committed to allocate its trade preference levels, or \nTPLs, to its current nonqualifying U.S. trade, ensuring that existing \nU.S. business is not impacted by this provision.\n\n  I am not the only one persuaded by these side agreements. On June 27, \n10 organizations, representing textile and apparel businesses, wrote \nMembers of the House and Senate in support of CAFTA. Those \norganizations wrote:\n\n       This agreement is vitally important for the United States \n     textile and apparel industry and the more than 600,000 \n     workers who are still employed in the United States in this \n     industry.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that this letter be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    June 27, 2005.\n       Dear Senator/Representative: We are writing to express our \n     strong support for and urge passage of the implementing \n     legislation (HR 3045/S 1307) for the U.S.-Central America-\n     Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR).\n       This agreement is vitally important for the U.S. textile \n     and apparel industry and the more than 600,000 workers who \n     are still employed in the United States in this industry.\n       Last year, we exported more than $4 billion of textile and \n     apparel products to Central America and the Dominican \n     Republic. More than 25 percent of all U.S. fabric exports and \n     40 percent of all U.S. yarn exports go to this region. As a \n     result, garments imported from the region contain on average \n     more than 70 percent U.S. content. In contrast, garments \n     imported from Asia contain less than 1 percent U.S. content.\n       Recent changes in the international trade regime--through \n     the elimination of quotas have eroded the competitiveness of \n     the partnership we now have with Central American region. \n     Moreover, the existing program--because of burdensome \n     documentation requirements and because it will expire soon--\n     no longer provides as strong an incentive to make clothing in \n     the region using U.S. inputs.\n       CAFTA-DR will solidify and stabilize this partnership by \n     making the current program broader, easier to use, more \n     flexible, permanent, and reciprocal. It will create new sales \n     opportunities for U.S. textile and apparel products by \n     providing permanent incentives for the use of U.S. yarns and \n     fabrics in textile articles made in the region. And because \n     it will promote duty free access for U.S. textile and apparel \n     exports to local markets in the region--which currently does \n     not exist--it will give us new advantages over our \n     competitors.\n       For all these reasons, textile and apparel companies from \n     across the supply chain have come together to express support \n     for CAFTA-DR and to urge its swift approval.\n       On behalf of the U.S. companies we represent and the \n     workers they employ, we urge you to support the agreement and \n     vote YES on the CAFTA-DR.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Apparel & Footwear Association (AAFA),\n       American Cotton Shippers Association (ACSA),\n       American Fiber Manufacturers Association (AFMA),\n       American Textile Machinery Association (ATMA),\n       Association of the Non Woven Fabrics Industry (INDA),\n       National Cotton Council (NCC),\n       National Council of Textile Organizations (NCTO),\n       Sewn Products Equipment & Suppliers of the Americas \n     (SPESA),\n       Textile Distributors Association (TDA),\n       United States Hosiery Manufacturers Coalition (USHMC).\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, North Carolina textile and apparel firms are\n\n[[Page S7707]]\n\nby no means unanimous in their support of CAFTA. I clearly understand \nthat. But when companies as diverse as Sara Lee, Russell, Glen Raven, \nNational Textiles, and Parkdale, companies that have not agreed before, \nagree on this, we should take notice, and I have.\n  Without CAFTA, more and more garment manufacturing will simply find \nits way to China to be manufactured. As Central American manufacturers \nare forced out by Chinese manufacturers, more American jobs will be put \nat risk for the simple fact that Chinese manufacturers do not use \nAmerican yarn, they do not use American fabric, and they do not use \nAmerican cotton.\n  I am persuaded by agriculture's support for this agreement, and in a \nletter to me recently, North Carolina's Farm Bureau president Larry \nWooten said:\n\n       On balance, the CAFTA-DR is a positive trade deal for North \n     Carolina agriculture. It will boost our State's number one \n     industry by helping North Carolina's farm families develop \n     new markets for their products. North Carolina Farm Bureau \n     strongly supports CAFTA-DR.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                        North Carolina Farm Bureau\n\n\n                                                   Federation,\n\n                                       Raleigh, NC, June 30, 2005.\n     Hon. Richard Burr,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Burr: As the U.S. Senate prepares to vote \n     today on the Central America--Dominican Republic Free Trade \n     Agreement (CAFTA-DR), I am writing you to express North \n     Carolina Farm Bureau's support for this important agreement. \n     Thank you for your vote last night to invoke cloture on S. \n     1307, and we hope you will vote for this measure again on \n     final passage today.\n       Currently, U.S. agriculture faces a $700 million trade \n     deficit with the six countries included in the CAFTA-DR. This \n     is largely the result of the General System of Preferences \n     (GSP) trade provisions and the Caribbean Basin Initiative \n     (CBI), which together allow 99 percent of Central American \n     and Dominican Republic agricultural products to enter U.S. \n     markets duty free. Conversely, U.S. exports to the region are \n     subject to applied tariffs that range from 15 to 43 percent. \n     Indeed, North Carolina's farm families have already paid for \n     this agreement.\n       CAFTA-DR will eliminate these trade barriers, and provide \n     North Carolina farmers and agribusinesses with the same duty-\n     free access that CAFTA-DR countries already enjoy in our \n     markets. In fact, many U.S. competitors in the region, like \n     Chile, already receive preferential access from the CAFTA-DR \n     countries.\n       A News & Observer article published earlier this year \n     reported that, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, \n     North Carolina exports to the CAFTA-DR countries grew by $678 \n     million from 2001 to 2004, the largest increase in the \n     nation. The article went on to say that North Carolina is the \n     CAFTA-DR region's third largest trading partner behind Texas \n     and Florida. Clearly, North Carolina agriculture has much to \n     gain from CAFTA-DR's enactment.\n       According to a recent study conducted by the American Farm \n     Bureau Federation (AFBF), II CAFTA-DR is a good deal for \n     North Carolina agriculture. In 2003, North Carolina's farm \n     cash receipts equaled $6.9 billion. Of that figure, $1.3 \n     billion, or about 19 percent, came from agricultural exports. \n     If CAFTA-DR is enacted, AFBF estimates that North Carolina \n     will increase agriculture trade to this region by nearly $70 \n     million per year by 2024.\n       As you know, North Carolina is a major producer of pork, \n     poultry, and cotton, as well as a significant producer of \n     soybeans. Under CAFTA-DR, North Carolina could expect to \n     increase meat exports to CAFTA-DR nations by $24 million per \n     year once the agreement is fully implemented. Poultry, our \n     third largest agricultural export, would experience export \n     increases of $42 million per year. Exports of cotton would \n     increase approximately $1 million per year, while soybeans \n     and soybean product exports would grow by $770,000 per year.\n       It is important to remember that the global community is \n     closely monitoring congressional deliberations regarding \n     CAFTA-DR. Rejecting this agreement will damage U.S. \n     credibility in the World Trade Organization (WTO) and deter \n     other nations from negotiating future trade agreements with \n     us. Further, failing to approve CAFTA-DR and any subsequent \n     trade agreements will exert more pressure on Congress to \n     increase Farm Bill spending.\n       On balance, the CAFTA-DR is a positive trade deal for North \n     Carolina agriculture. It will boost our state's number one \n     industry by helping North Carolina's farm families develop \n     new markets for their products. North Carolina Farm Bureau \n     strongly supports CAFTA-DR, and we urge you to support on the \n     Senate Floor today.\n       As a friend of North Carolina Farm Bureau, you have always \n     been accessible and I appreciate your support for North \n     Carolina's farm families. As you consider how you will vote \n     on this critical matter, please know that I stand ready to \n     assist you in any way. I look forward to hearing from you \n     soon.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Larry B. Wooten,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, current agricultural trade between the \nUnited States and the region can be a one-way street. That street is \noften closed to our farmers by regional barriers. CAFTA will remove \nthose barriers, increasing access for U.S. farmers. With exports \naccounting for 20 percent of North Carolina's farm cash receipts, \nalmost $1.5 billion, my State's farmers stand to make tremendous gains \nin Central American markets.\n  The key to making this trade agreement an economic success for North \nCarolina, though, is enforcement. I am a proponent of free trade, but I \nam an even bigger proponent of fair trade. The rules must be enforced. \nI intend to make sure that neither this Nation nor our partner \ncountries turn a blind eye to the provisions set out and the assurances \nmade in CAFTA.\n  Several of my colleagues have come down to the Senate floor to \nexpress their concerns with China. Let me be specific. I have concerns \nabout China, too. I voted against normal trade relations status for \nChina eight times as a Member of the other body. Hindering our Nation's \ntrade with other nations to get back at China is not the answer. \nEnforcing our laws and enforcing the provisions of the trade agreement \nwith China is the answer to China.\n  If I held up a chart today and suggested that chart listed every time \nChina had voluntarily broken our trade agreements, it would be blank. \nIf we want trade to work, we as a country have to enforce the \nagreements we have with our partners.\n  This is not the China free-trade agreement. It is the Central \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement. We need to stop holding our friends in \nCentral America and elsewhere accountable for China's unlawful \npractices. We should not let China get away with unfair trade \npractices, and we must strengthen our trade enforcement efforts. If \nChina is going to break the rules, let's call them on it. Let's make \nthem pay for it. But we should not make other countries the scapegoat \nfor China.\n  In the 2 years since CAFTA was signed, I have worked to better \nunderstand the agreement and the impacts it will have on my State. \nToday I am convinced there is no choice--no choice--but to look to the \nfuture and approve this agreement. The new and emerging sectors of \nNorth Carolina's economy, from computer manufacturing to biotechnology \nand established sectors such as financial services and agriculture, \ndepend on agreements such as this.\n  What makes CAFTA fairly unique is the recognition by many in the \ntextile and apparel industry that CAFTA represents one of their last, \nbest chances to compete with Asia. We cannot afford to wall ourselves \noff from the rest of the world if we hope to compete in a global \nmarketplace and to create jobs in the United States.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at the long-term benefits of prosperous, \nsuccessful, established democracies to our south and the economic \nopportunities it provides for our own citizens here. If we fail to look \nto our friends in the south, we will only be strengthening our \ncompetitors to the west.\n  I urge my colleagues at the end of this debate to vote in favor of \nthe CAFTA agreement, and I urge my colleagues to stay vigilant, whether \nit is CAFTA or China, as it relates to enforcement mechanisms with our \ntrade partners.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for up to 15 minutes and that the time be charged \nunder the control of Senator Grassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from California may proceed.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I have been listening to the debate \nupstairs on television. I thought I might come down and indicate the \nreasons I am going to vote for this Central American Free Trade \nAgreement.\n  This agreement has sparked a great deal of debate about our trade \nagenda,\n\n[[Page S7708]]\n\nthe effects of trade agreements on labor rights and the environment, \nand the impact of increased imports on sensitive domestic industries. I \nunderstand the concerns of my colleagues, including members of my own \nparty, who do not support this agreement.\n  For me, I have always approached these agreements on a case-by-case \nbasis. I have supported some, and I have opposed others. For example, I \nopposed the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Singapore-Chile \nFree Trade Agreement. I opposed NAFTA because of the concerns about the \nimpact of jobs and the environment, and I opposed the Chile-Singapore \nFree Trade Agreement because of the inclusion of immigration \nprovisions.\n  But in my view, this is an important opportunity for this Congress to \ngo on record in support of economic growth and political stability in \nthese countries and new markets and opportunities for our manufacturers \nand farmers.\n  Bottom line, this agreement provides immediate benefits for American \nexports. It balances an uneven trading relationship. Some have said \nthis, but I do not think it has sunk in: approximately 80 percent of \ngoods manufactured in these countries and 99 percent of their \nagricultural products already enter the United States duty free. But \nAmerica's exports into these countries face stiff tariffs on a number \nof key products. Let me give some examples.\n  Wood products have an average tariff of 10 percent; motor vehicles \nand parts, an average of 11.1 percent; vegetables, fruits, and nuts, an \naverage of 16.7 percent--that is today--dairy products, an average of \n19.5 percent and up to 60 percent in some cases. In some cases, to send \ndairy products into these countries, they face a tariff of 60 percent; \ngrains, an average tariff of 10.6 percent; beef, up to 30 percent; \nrice, up to 60 percent; and wine is as high as 35 percent.\n  Upon enactment of this agreement, 80 percent of U.S. industrial \nexports will enter the CAFTA countries duty free, with the remaining \ntariffs eliminated over 10 years. That is good for us. That is good for \nour workers because in these industries it will produce more jobs. \nFifty percent of agricultural exports become duty free immediately, \nwith remaining tariffs eliminated over 15 and 20 years.\n  A World Bank and University of Michigan study estimates that with the \nagreement, U.S. income will rise by $17 billion and the income of CAFTA \ncountries by $5 billion. I think that is substantial. According to the \nAmerican Farm Bureau, CAFTA would increase U.S. agricultural exports by \n$1.5 billion annually.\n  Now let me just talk about my own State of California. It has often \nbeen said we are the fifth largest economic engine on Earth. We have a \n$1.4 trillion economy. We are a leader in U.S. and global markets, with \nproducts ranging from high tech to agriculture. Our workers, our \nfarmers, and our businesses need access to new and expanding markets to \nsustain that leadership position.\n  In 2004, my State exports to the CAFTA countries totaled $660 \nmillion. That was the sixth largest of the 50 States. Manufactured \ngoods accounted for 89 percent of the total, including computers and \nelectronic equipment, fabric mill products, and coal products.\n  CAFTA will provide significant opportunities for several California \nexport industries. Let me go over them. Let us take dairy, for example. \nCalifornia's producers represent a $4 billion dairy industry. We know \nit is the largest in the Nation. Their exports face duties as high as \n60 percent today. Each country in this agreement establishes tariff \nrate quotas for certain dairy products totaling 10,000 metric tons \nacross the six CAFTA countries. Access will increase by 5 percent a \nyear for the Central American countries and 10 percent a year for the \nDominican Republic, and all duties will be eliminated over 20 years.\n  Beef: Current duties on beef are as high as 30 percent. Duties on \nprime and choice cuts will be eliminated immediately in the Central \nAmerican countries. Duties on other beef products will be phased out \nover 5 to 10 years.\n  Wine: Current duties on American wine are as high as 35 percent. \nDuties on standard size U.S. bottled wine will be eliminated \nimmediately. All others will be phased out over 15 years.\n  Rice: Currently, U.S. rice exports face tariffs of up to 60 percent. \nUnder the agreement, each country will establish a tariff rate quota \nfor milled rice and rough rice, except for the Dominican Republic, \nwhich will have a tariff rate quota for brown rice. In the first year, \n400,000 metric tons will be imported duty free, growing as the tariff \nis eventually eliminated.\n  Fruits: Duties of up to 20 percent on U.S. grapes, raisins, fresh and \ncanned peaches, and fresh and canned pears will be eliminated \nimmediately upon enactment of the agreement.\n  Tree nuts: Duties of up to 20 percent on U.S. walnuts, almonds, and \npistachios will be eliminated immediately upon enactment of the \nagreement.\n  Services: The agreement provides broad market access and regulatory \ntransparency for telecommunications, insurance, financial services, \ndistribution services, computer and business technology services, and \ntourism, among others. U.S. financial service suppliers will have full \nrights to establish subsidiaries, joint ventures or branches for banks \nand insurance companies.\n  High tech: The agreement eliminates distribution barriers for \ninformation technology products. It requires countries to eliminate \ninformation technology tariffs by signing the World Trade Organization \nInformation Technology Agreement, and it opens up information \ntechnology services. All exports of products covered by the Information \nTechnology Agreement, including computer equipment and communications \nequipment, will receive immediate duty-free treatment.\n\n  Entertainment: California is a big entertainment State, and this is \nvery important. The agreement provides for increased market access for \nU.S. films and television programs through cable, satellite, and the \nInternet. Currently, movies face tariffs ranging from 5 to 20 percent. \nCompact discs and DVDs face tariffs of up to 10 percent. The agreement \nprovides for zero tariffs on movies, music, consumer products, \nsoftware, books and magazines, and nondiscriminatory treatment for \ndigital products such as U.S. software, music, text, and videos. It \nalso includes protections for U.S. trademarks, copyrighted works, \npatents, trade secrets, and penalties for piracy and counterfeiting. As \na matter of fact, Peter Chernin, the CEO and president of the Fox \nGroup, said this: This agreement sets a template for what agreements \nshould look like.\n  Textiles: Apparel from garment factories in Central America \nsupporting 400,000 jobs will be duty free and quota free in the United \nStates if they contain U.S. fabric and yarn, thus benefiting U.S. \nfabric and yarn exports. The CAFTA countries are the largest market for \nU.S. apparel and yarn exports. That is $2.2 billion in 2003. Tariffs on \nU.S. textile exports are currently 18 percent, and they will be \neliminated immediately upon enactment of the agreement.\n  Now, these are all win-win-win for my State and I believe for the \nUnited States. Perhaps because of the NAFTA agreement, which was a very \ndifferent agreement, people look at this agreement as they looked at \nNAFTA. In fact, CAFTA countries now export most of their products into \nthe United States at no tariff, and most of our products face tariffs \nwhich would either be eliminated immediately or eliminated over a \nperiod of time under CAFTA.\n  So I do not think it should come as any surprise that there is very \nwide support among California businesses, farmers, and agricultural \norganizations: the Farm Bureau, the Wine Institute, the United \nDairymen, the Rice Commission, the Cattlemen's Association, the Pork \nProducers, the Table Grape Commission. In high tech, virtually every \ncompany: Cisco, Intel, National Semiconductor, Apple, Oracle, Hewlett-\nPackard, Qualcomm, IBM, Kodak, and the Telecommunications Industry of \nAmerica. This is opening markets for our products. Entertainment: the \nMotion Picture Association of America, the Recording Industry of \nAmerica, the Independent Film and Television Alliance, and the \nEntertainment Software Association.\n  As the New York Times stated in an editorial:\n\n       Denying poor people in Central America the benefits of \n     better access to the American market is certainly not the way \n     to lift them out of poverty.\n\n\n[[Page S7709]]\n\n\n  That is the flip side of this, that by creating an agreement that \nreduces these tariffs on American products, a more competitive and \nhigher quality marketplace is produced for citizens of these countries, \nand that is not bad.\n  Denying these countries access to the U.S. market is certainly not \nthe way to reward them for advances made in the area of democracy, \nhuman rights, and the rule of law. Twenty years ago, these countries \nwere marred by constant warfare, human rights abuses, poverty, and \npolitical instability. Since then, they have all made enormous strides, \nand passage of CAFTA will not only promote economic development and \nrising standards of living by allowing their products to compete in the \nU.S. market, it will also lock in economic reforms, respect for the \nrule of law, and solidify democratic institutions. Each country now has \na democratically elected leader, and I think we should reward those \nallies and not turn our backs on them.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a letter from former President Jimmy \nCarter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     June 8, 2005.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       To Senator Charles Grassley: As you prepare for your \n     initial consideration of the Central American Free Trade \n     Agreement (CAFTA) with the nations of Central America and the \n     Dominican Republic, I want to express my strong support for \n     this progressive move. From a trade perspective, this will \n     he1p both the United States and Central America.\n       Some 80 percent of Central America's exports to the U.S. \n     are already duty free, so they will be opening their markets \n     to U.S. exports more than we will for their remaining \n     products. Independent studies indicate that U.S. incomes will \n     rise by over $15 billion and those in Central America by some \n     $5 billion. New jobs will be created in Central America, and \n     labor standards are likely to improve as a result of CAFTA.\n       Some improvements could be made in the trade bill, \n     particularly on the labor protection side, but, more \n     importantly, our own national security and hemispheric \n     influence will be enhanced with improved stability, \n     democracy, and development in our poor, fragile neighbors in \n     Central America and the Caribbean. During my presidency and \n     now at The Carter Center, I have been dedicated to the \n     promotion of democracy and stability in the region. From the \n     negotiation of the Panama Canal Treaties and the championing \n     of human rights at a time when the region suffered under \n     military dictatorships to the monitoring of a number of free \n     elections in the region, Central America has been a major \n     focus of my attention.\n       There now are democratically elected governments in each of \n     the countries covered by CAFTA. In negotiating this \n     agreement, the presidents of each of the six nations had to \n     contend with their own companies that fear competition with \n     U.S. firms. They have put their credibility on the line, not \n     only with this trade agreement but more broadly by promoting \n     market reforms that have been urged for decades by U.S. \n     presidents of both parties. If the U.S. Congress were to turn \n     its back on CAFTA, it would undercut these fragile \n     democracies, compel them to retreat to protectionism, and \n     make it harder for them to cooperate with the U.S.\n       For the first time ever, we have a chance to reinforce \n     democracies in the region. This is the moment to move forward \n     and to help those leaders that want to modernize and humanize \n     their countries. Moreover, strong economies in the region are \n     the best antidote to illegal immigration from the region.\n       I appreciate your consideration of my views and hope they \n     will be helpful in your important deliberations.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Jimmy Carter.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Former President Jimmy Carter states:\n\n       If the United States Congress were to turn its back on \n     CAFTA, it would undercut these fragile democracies, compel \n     them to retreat to protectionism, and make it harder for them \n     to cooperate with the United States.\n\n  I do not think there has been any American President that has reached \nout more fully to the rest of the world with more humanitarian work and \nmore concern about human rights and labor rights than Jimmy Carter.\n  I understand several of my colleagues believe labor and environmental \nprovisions of the agreement fall short of what is needed to protect \nworkers' rights and the natural resources of the CAFTA countries. I \nthink free-trade advocates often make the mistake of arguing that these \nagreements are a panacea for the ills of the developing world, \nincluding lax labor and environmental standards. I certainly do not \nbelieve that.\n  The passage of the CAFTA alone will not bring labor and environmental \nstandards and the capacity to enforce those standards up to United \nStates levels. We have to admit that. But--and I say ``but''--combined \nwith a robust assistance package to help the CAFTA countries identify \nshortcomings and improve the enforcement of their laws, this agreement \nwill mark an important step in the right direction. This is not about \nsacrificing the rights of workers and the protection of the environment \nfor open markets and increased trade. We can provide new opportunities \nfor American and Central American goods and services and establish \nprograms to help those countries raise their labor standards.\n  What Senator Bingaman said when he came to the floor is very \nconstructive. I give him a great deal of credit and credit to the \nadministration. This is the first trade treaty I can remember when they \nhave been open to change.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent just 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. This is the first trade agreement where the \nadministration, perhaps because they have had to struggle for the \nvotes, has been welcoming of suggestions; not only welcoming of \nsuggestions, they made some changes. That is appreciated.\n  One of the changes was $40 million earmarked for labor and \nenvironment capacity building for the CAFTA countries, from 2006 \nthrough 2009, and $3 million annually through 2009 for the \nInternational Labor Organization to monitor and verify progress in \nCAFTA countries in improving labor law enforcement and working \nconditions, with periodic reports that are transparent, every 6 months, \non such projects.\n  That is a first and I think it is important and I do believe it can \nmake a difference. I do believe the comments of those who are concerned \nabout impact on Central America's labor laws are right to be concerned. \nI join them in that concern. This $3 million can go a long way to \nseeing the kind of enforcement that is necessary to begin to bring \nthose countries up to where it is an approximately level playing field. \nThis is a significant commitment, and I thank Ambassador Portman for \nhis willingness to engage with the Congress on this issue.\n  I also look forward to providing assistance to workers in this \ncountry through the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program for those who \nhave lost their jobs because of increased trade.\n  This is where I think the rub really is. It is always hard to see \nwhether the benefits of free trade do in fact outweigh the negatives. \nBut we must recognize that some workers lose their jobs and they have \nto be helped to learn new skills. We have to find ways to keep \nmanufacturing in this country. We have to find ways to limit research \nand development tax credits to the production of jobs in this country.\n  Some of us were struck a mortal blow when we repatriated tax funds \nand there was an amendment on the floor of the Senate that said ``as \nlong as those funds will be used for production of jobs in this \ncountry,'' and that amendment failed. That, for me, was a dark day \nbecause I believe that American corporations do have an obligation to \nthis country, not only to the bottom line but an obligation to their \nworkers. American workers are the best in productivity and the best in \nthe world. We have to find ways to see that this country is competitive \nin education, in standards, to be attractive for manufacturing once \nagain.\n  Today, the Democrats in the Democratic Policy Committee heard a very \ninteresting presentation which pointed out how necessary manufacturing \njobs, production line jobs--not high-skilled jobs--were going to be to \nthe future of this great country. I remember when I was mayor of San \nFrancisco, Akio Morita, the chairman of Sony, at that time he was the \nhead of The Keidanren, saying to me that when America loses its \nmanufacturing edge, it is the first step to America becoming a second \nrate power. I believe that is correct. Yet a trade agreement which \nreduces tariffs on our exports is not bad; it is good. I think that is \nthe benefit of that, and of this agreement.\n  With that in mind, and because I believe virtually every industry in \nmy\n\n[[Page S7710]]\n\nState is in support of this agreement, I intend to vote aye.\n  I thank the Chair for the extension of time, and I yield the floor.\n  I appreciated the recent efforts the administration made to engage \nthe sugar industry to work out an agreement. However, I am concerned \nthat the two sides only recently came to the table to address this \ndivisive issue. The trade agreement has been signed for nearly a year, \nbut talks only began about 3 weeks ago. The problem should have been \nrecognized and truly addressed earlier in the process. I am convinced \nthat an agreement could have been reached. As it was, the sugar \nindustry chose not to accept a short-term offer by the administration. \nThe offer would have provided a remedy for the length of the farm bill, \nthis year and next year's sugar beet crop. As I stated before, sugar \nbeet farmers in Wyoming have made long-term investments in their \nprocessing facilities. They need a long-term solution, not a short-term \nfix.\n  This problem will not go away. As the administration continues to \nseek additional free-trade agreements with countries that desire to \nsend their sugar to our markets, this issue will resurface. I recommend \nthat the administration and the sugar industry continue creative \ndiscussions to identify a long-term solution beyond the next farm bill \nto ensure the viability of the sugar industry and the small family \nfarmers that the industry supports in the United States.\n  Beyond Wyoming sugar, Wyoming cattle producers have made it clear to \nme that they want mandatory country of origin labeling implemented \nbefore new trade agreements are signed that could bring in additional \nbeef and meat products. I agree that consumers should have the \nopportunity to make an informed purchase regarding their meat's country \nof origin at their grocery store. U.S. beef is competitive, but it does \nnot receive a chance to compete when it is not labeled as U.S. beef for \nconsumers.\n  With my vote against this bill, it would be easy for my opponents to \ncast me as a free-trade obstructionist. I remind them that until today, \nI have never voted against a free-trade agreement on the floor of the \nSenate. The principles of fair trade, which I support, generally bring \nabout increased democracy, more transparency in Government and \nincreased productivity. Along these lines, there are industries in \nWyoming that communicated their support of CAFTA to me. I am pleased \nthe agreement will improve market access for important industries, such \nas soda ash and oil and gas. I recognize the benefits this agreement \nwill bring to many and applaud the administration for their hard work \nin bringing this agreement to fruition. Unfortunately, I cannot vote \nfor the agreement today because the costs outweigh the benefits for my \nState as a whole.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to the \nDominican Republic-Central American-United States free trade agreement, \nknown as CAFTA. I am opposing the implementing legislation before the \nSenate today due to the negative impact that passage of the agreement \nwill have on the domestic sugar industry. I also believe mandatory \ncountry of origin labeling should be implemented before we sign trade \nagreements that will bring in additional meat products.\n  The production of sugar is vitally important in Wyoming. Behind hay, \nwhich is fed to our livestock, sugar beets is the No. 1 cash crop in \nWyoming. So small sugar beet farms in Wyoming have a big impact on my \nState's economy. For example, my office received calls from bankers and \nlocal economic development agencies in towns that depend upon the \nviability of the sugar beet industry. They were concerned about the \nimpact of CAFTA on the health of their local economies--the economies \nof my home State.\n  In addition, the sugar industry is vertically integrated. Sugar beet \nfarmers are invested in their land and specialized farming equipment. \nHowever, across the Nation, sugar beet farmers have also banded \ntogether to purchase the processing plants that add value to their \ncrop. So their investment in sugar is higher than the investments of \nother farmers in their crops. Many of these plants have been purchased \nin recent years with a long-term debt load. Wyoming sugar beet farmers \nhave a special interest in ensuring that their industry has long-term \nviability. The sugar that would be imported from CAFTA countries under \nthis agreement, in addition to the sugar expected to be imported from \nMexico under NAFTA, would have a detrimental impact on the sugar beet \nindustry in the near and distant future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nspeak for up to 30 minutes from the time under the control of Senator \nDorgan, to be followed by Senator Martinez for up to 10 minutes from \nthe time under the control of Senator Grassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Connecticut is recognized for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me begin by commending, again, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Grassley, and Senator \nBaucus, the ranking Democrat, and members of that committee. It is a \nvery important committee of the Senate, obviously. They are charged \nwith the responsibility of dealing with trade agreements. The \nimplications of these trade agreements obviously go beyond just the \njurisdiction of the Finance Committee. It can be argued, I think very \ncorrectly, that these agreements have huge foreign policy implications, \nnational security implications as well as, obviously, labor \nimplications. So the Finance Committee is asked to grapple with very \ncompelling issues that touch on a lot of other subject matters when \nthey deal with it.\n  I rise today to speak about this Central America-Dominican Republic \nFree Trade Agreement, known as the CAFTA-DR agreement. Yesterday \nevening, I came to the floor to express my hopes that this agreement \ncould be strengthened in the waning hours before a vote on its \nimplementing legislation. I did so because I very much want to support \nthis agreement.\n  Let me explain why again. Many of my colleagues, I suppose, know the \nreason. As long as I have been a Member of this body I have served on \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I have, for most of those \nyears, been either the chairman or the ranking Democrat of the \nsubcommittee dealing with Latin America.\n  My colleagues, many of them, know as well that some 39 years ago, as \nI finished my college education, I joined the Peace Corps and traveled \nto the Dominican Republic where, for about 2 years I served as a Peace \nCorps volunteer in the wonderful mountain village of Bonito Moncion, \nnot very far from the Haitian border. I have a special affection for \nthe Dominican Republic. The people of that small mountain village \nembraced me as one of their own. In fact, only a few weeks ago I \ntraveled back to that mountain village of Moncion after a 24-year \nabsence and spent a remarkable day with people I had known, who had \nsuch a wonderful impact on my life as a young Peace Corps volunteer.\n  When I came to this body and went to the Congress in 1974, along with \nPaul Tsongas of Massachusetts, we were the first two former Peace Corps \nvolunteers to be elected to the U.S. Congress.\n  Paul Tsongas came to the Senate 2 years before I did. When I arrived \nhere, we became the only Peace Corps volunteers to have served in this \nSenate. Today, I believe I am the only one to have had that privilege \nof being a volunteer in the Dominican Republic and to serve in this \nSenate. The countries of Central America I know well. I have traveled \nto all of them extensively over the years. I know the heads of states \nof each of these countries and have known virtually all of the heads of \nstate over the last 24 years. It is with a great deal of personal \ninterest, in addition to the subject matter interest, that draws me to \nthis debate and to the Senate this afternoon. I have worked closely \nwith many of these countries. As much as any Member of this Senate, I \nunderstand what a great boom a well-crafted agreement on trade can be \nto the people of Central America and for the Dominican Republic, as \nwell as for we Americans.\n  I don't expect CAFTA-DR agreement to be perfect. No trade agreement \never is. There are always matters either left unaddressed or under-\naddressed when\n\n[[Page S7711]]\n\nwe have these agreements. The question should be whether trade \nagreements, on balance, serve to protect American interests and lift up \nthe countries that we are negotiating with, or whether they will lead \nus all in the opposite direction.\n  That is why I welcome the efforts of my colleague from New Mexico, \nSenator Bingaman, to strengthen the capacity of these nations of \nCentral America and the Dominican Republic to effectively enforce and \nuphold internationally recognized labor rights. I believe the \ncommitment by the administration to provide funds for the International \nLabor Organization, the ILO as it is called, in these CAFTA-DR \ncountries is a step in the right direction. I commend my colleague from \nNew Mexico, Senator Bingaman, for pursuing this provision. I commend \nAmbassador Portman for accepting the idea.\n  But to strengthen the effectiveness of the International Labor \nOrganization in carrying out its work in Central America, I believe \nthere also needs to be a clear understanding, before we vote on the \nCAFTA-DR agreement, of the freedom activity that the International \nLabor Organization must have if its efforts are going to be effective. \nAfter all, the problem is not just about capacity building, as \nimportant as that is, which was the focus of the agreement with our \ncolleague from New Mexico, it must also, out of necessity, be about \nenforcement of those rights.\n  That is why I met yesterday, at some length, with Ambassador Portman \nand his staff and contacted the ambassadors of the five Central \nAmerican countries and the Dominican Republic to describe what I \nbelieve is needed to make the International Labor Organization \ninitiative of this agreement a meaningful one.\n  As my colleagues know, over the years, I have generally been a \nsupporter of free-trade agreements. If properly constructed, I believe \ntrade agreements are in the best long-term interests of the United \nStates. That is because, in today's highly interconnected world, we \nmust keep up and adjust to the changes around us if we are going to \ncompete effectively.\n  This great surge toward a globalized world economy has brought gains \nand losses here in our own country. Some industries have benefitted \ngreatly; others have struggled to compete. On balance, I believe free \ntrade has benefitted our country. But we have not done enough, \nespecially during the past few years, to help ease the transition for \nthose many Americans who are struggling.\n  Globalization has affected other nations around the globe. From Latin \nAmerica to India, Africa to China, no country has escaped the impact of \nthis process. The difference is that while globalization has helped \nlift many nations, it has also left many others behind.\n  In this hemisphere, the results have been mixed. Countries such as \nBrazil and Chile are doing quite well.\n  Others have stagnated or, worse, even regressed. I put this in \ncontext for my colleagues when it comes to Central America and the \nDominican Republic. When considering this debate and the conclusion of \nit, consider that one-third of the entire population of Latin America \ncurrently lives in poverty. In the nations south of the Rio Grande \nRiver, 128 million people survive on less than $2 a day; 50 million on \nless than $1 a day. That is more than a third of the entire population \nof these nations. In Central America alone, three out of every five \ncitizens live in conditions of poverty. Two out of every five are \nindigent or in conditions of extreme poverty.\n  In Nicaragua, for instance, there is widespread malnutrition and \nunemployment rates are way over 40 percent. Nicaragua is the second \npoorest nation in this hemisphere, with nearly half its population \nliving on less than $1 a day.\n  In Guatemala, the situation is also dire. Malnutrition rates are \namong the highest in the world. Life expectancy as well as infant and \ninfant mortality rates are among the worst in this hemisphere. \nIlliteracy exceeds 30 percent and most people have less than 5 years of \na formal education.\n  But there is not only tremendous poverty in these nations, income and \nequality in Latin America is also one of the highest in the world. \nConsider that the richest 10 percent of all Latin Americans earn \nroughly 50 percent of the total national income in these nations; \nwhereas the bottom 10 percent earn only 1.6 percent of income.\n  Despite economic growth throughout the 1990s, unemployment in Latin \nAmerica has actually increased. The Central American region has \nsuffered greatly as a result of natural disasters. Hardly a year goes \nby that some natural tragedy does not occur in these nations. My \ncolleagues will recall the mud slides in Haiti which last year cost \nthousands of people their lives and homes. There are repeated \nhurricanes that have hit Central America over the last decade and a \nhalf.\n\n  In early 1993, after one of those hurricanes hit Nicaragua, I went \ndown to work with the people of those nations to clear mud out of \nschools and impoverished communities. Bridges were wiped out, crops \nwere lost, the country was devastated.\n  In 1998, Hurricane Mitch, a category 5 storm, hit Honduras, \nNicaragua, Guatemala, and El Salvador, killing 9,000 people and leaving \nmore than 700,000 people in those four countries homeless.\n  We are also talking about nations, many of which were almost ripped \napart by brutal civil wars and political violence. Guatemala's troubled \nhistory dates back to 1954, when a military coup overthrew Guatemala's \npopularly elected president, Jacobo Arbenz Guzman, triggering a bloody \ncivil conflict that lasted more than 30 years. Guatemala's conflict was \nlargely a struggle for land rights and resulted in the murder or \ndisappearance of more than 200,000 people, many of them indigenous \nMayans living in the highlands of Guatemala. Fortunately, this armed \nconflict ended in 1996, with the signing of the peace accords between \nthe Guatemalan Government and the armed opposition, grouped together as \nthe Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unit.\n  In El Salvador, it was discontent over social inequalities, a poor \neconomy and a repressive dictatorship that in 1980 finally ignited a \ncivil war between a repressive military government and leftist guerilla \ngroups who united under the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front. \nDuring 12 years of that civil war, 75,000 Salvadorans, mostly \ncivilians, were killed and thousands more fled to refugee camps in \nHonduras and many more made their way north to the United States as \nimmigrants. The United States provided more than $5 billion in economic \nand military assistance to the Salvadoran Government over the course of \nthat conflict. But it took the U.N. to broker a peace accord to end a \nconflict that military force failed to resolve.\n  Nicaragua's story is almost somewhat similar. In 1979, the Sandinista \nNational Liberation Front of Nicaragua overthrew the 40-year \ndictatorship of the Somoza family and took control. In 1981, the Reagan \nadministration responded aggressively to regional concerns with respect \nto the leftist regime. The United States funded and organized the new \nparamilitary force which became known as the Contras. The Contra war, \nas it became known, lasted until 1988 and resulted in more than 25,000 \ndeaths in that country and 700,000 refugees and displaced people.\n  Although Honduras faced no serious civil conflict of its own, it \nserved as a staging ground for efforts of the United States to fight \nthe insurgencies in Guatemala and El Salvador and to overthrow \nNicaragua's Sandinista government.\n  Honduras's geographically central location made it a convenient base \nof operations for the Contras and a center of training and supply for \nthe Salvadoran and Guatemalan militaries.\n  Even democratic Costa Rica felt the ripple effects of its neighbors' \nconflicts as displaced persons from other countries took up residence \nin that nation.\n  Finally, the governments of Central America courageously decided to \ntake matters into their own hands. In 1987, without any real assistance \nfrom the United States, the Presidents of Guatemala, El Salvador, \nHonduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica negotiated and signed an agreement \nto create conditions for peace in Central America, which became known \nas the Esquipulas Agreement. That agreement marked a\n\n[[Page S7712]]\n\nturning point for the people of Central America and created real \npossibilities for peace, reconciliation, and prosperity for the people \nof that region.\n  Since 1990, the countries of the region have made progress. The guns \nhave been silenced. There has been political reconciliation. There have \nbeen domestic or democratic elections. But still the region struggles \nfor many of the root causes that sparked the civil conflicts in the \nfirst place: poverty and inequality and injustice.\n  Taken individually or as a whole, this poverty, inequality, \nsuffering, and political instability have severe implications. First, \nthey threaten the political stability of Latin America. And I am very \nworried not only about this region but also other nations in the \nhemisphere that are democratic governments but are very fragile \ndemocracies. And second, by extension, they also threaten the national \ninterests of the United States, as political instability did in the \n1980s.\n  To understand how this is possible, I would point to--and advise my \ncolleagues, if they have the time, to read--a 2004 report by the United \nNations Development Program.\n  According to that report, progress in extending elective democracy \nacross Latin America is threatened by ongoing social and economic \nturmoil. Most troubling, the report suggests that over 50 percent of \nthe population of Latin America would be willing to sacrifice \ndemocratic government for real progress on economic and social fronts. \nThat is a very frightening statistic. And it should make crystal clear \nthe urgency of this situation.\n  Two decades of democratic progress in our hemisphere are at risk. \nCertainly, strong trade relations remain a key to creating a healthy \neconomy both here in the United States and throughout the region. But \ntrade alone cannot address the myriad of challenges facing Latin \nAmerica, where millions of citizens in this hemisphere remain \nmarginalized by economic insecurity and social dislocation. And, sadly, \nthe attention and foreign aid dollars of the United States have been \ndiverted to other parts of the world in recent years.\n  That is why I welcome the Bush administration's decision to reengage \nwith the region and to strengthen economic ties by negotiating a \nregional free-trade agreement. I believe that the right kind of trade \nagreements can help these countries get on the proper course to \nstronger and more just societies.\n  The question is whether, on balance, the agreement before us is that \nright kind of agreement. I stress the term ``agreement'' because it \nreminds us that these documents are about much more than free trade.\n  They are about the worker who could lose his or her job. They are \nabout the average citizen trying to provide for their families. And \nthey are about social cohesion and political stability.\n  These agreements are also about the future of a nation's economy. \nThey are about protecting our national security. And they are about \nensuring that the next generation will inherit a stronger foundation on \nwhich to build their futures.\n\n  Or at least they should be.\n  We, in the Congress need to decide if these agreements live up to \nthese standards. As I said earlier, I have been, throughout my years \nhere, a strong supporter of free-trade agreements. The case we have \nbefore us--of course, CAFTA-DR, deals with the Dominican Republic, \nGuatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Costa Rica.\n  A meaningful agreement with these countries could, in my view, \nbenefit the United States and the nations involved alike. For the most \npart, they need help. Poverty, corruption, social dislocation, and \ninstability are all too familiar to the citizens of many of these \nnations.\n  But the CAFTA-Dominican Republic agreement has some weaknesses, ones \nwe tried to address over the last several days.\n  Mr. President, I understand the sense of urgency the administration \nfeels in having this agreement be decided upon in the waning hours \nbefore the Fourth of July recess. I regret, unfortunately, that we have \nto rush at this. But I understand why. If you do not have these \nagreements up under these time constraints, then they may not pass at \nall. So I appreciate the politics of why it is up under this shortened \ntime-frame or up against the wall of this recess.\n  That said, I regret we did not have a few more days. If we did have \nsome more time I believe we might have been able to make some very \nimportant improvements to weaknesses in the current agreement.\n  The most fundamental of these weaknesses I discussed last evening and \nI talked about at great length with Ambassador Portman yesterday.\n  I also sent him a letter addressing the specificity of them; and that \nis, namely, the issue of labor laws in the CAFTA-Dominican Republic \ncountries.\n  When I speak of labor laws, I am speaking about the kinds of laws \nthat these countries have enacted and about the enforcement of these \nlaws. I am also speaking about current trade packages in this \nhemisphere that have been a major step forward to guarantee \nimprovements in quality of life, creating wealth in these countries \nwhich, obviously, benefits us, as we want trade with nations that have \npeople who can afford the cost of our goods and services. Both of these \nissues are critical components, I might add, to protecting Americans \nand to ensuring real progress is made in these nations.\n  I would turn here to the issue of labor laws. According to the CAFTA-\nDominican Republic agreement, signatory countries must simply enforce \nthe labor laws of their own nations--whatever they may be--in order to \nbe in compliance. Indeed, I would note that the Dominican Republic and \nall the Central American countries, except El Salvador, have ratified \nwhat the International Labor Organization refers to as its eight \nfundamental conventions on labor rights. El Salvador, I might add, has \nratified six of the eight. And while El Salvador needs to be brought up \nto speed, other signatories' laws seem to be at least minimally \nsufficient to the task, in my view.\n  Why then does the current arrangement, with respect to labor laws, \nweaken this agreement? Because of two things. First, it does not hold \nthose countries to the same objective standards. In fact, the CAFTA-DR \nagreement would actually lower current standards. Second, it ignores \nthe impact that a lack of objective standards could have on the region.\n  Let me explain.\n  Previous trade preference programs for the region--previous ones; \nthis is not new ground; previous ones--provided that the President \nshould at least take into account the extent to which the beneficiary \ncountries provide internationally recognized workers' rights. This is \nnot the case with the CAFTA-DR agreement.\n  In addition, as currently written, the CAFTA-DR agreement would \nweaken standards that these countries have been living under through \nthe Caribbean Basin Initiative and the Generalized System of \nPreferences, where these agreements are not required. So instead of \nasking them to do the same with the CAFTA-DR agreement--or more--we are \nactually asking them to do less. It is a step backwards.\n  Under the current trade agreements in this region, trade benefits can \nbe withdrawn if a country lowers its labor laws below international \nstandards or simply fails to meet these standards. And they can be \nwithdrawn if a government directly violates internationally accepted \nworkers rights that might not be protected under their laws.\n  Under the Caribbean Basin Initiative, and the GSP, the right to file \na complaint for violations of these rights is extended beyond just \ngovernments and to civil societies. But again, with this agreement, we \nexclude all of that.\n  Under this agreement, governments will only have to enforce whatever \nlaws they have on their own books at any given time. They will not be \nheld to any international standards. That means the ocean floor is the \nlimit, with respect to how weak these laws can get.\n  Moreover, the lack of an objective standard here is troubling because \nit could create a race-to-the-bottom mentality where investors and \ncompanies play governments, one against the other, seeking lower labor \nstandards in a quest for increased profits. That type of situation, in \nmy view, could wreak havoc on civil societies in these countries, and \nit could also cost American workers their jobs.\n\n[[Page S7713]]\n\n  A second facet of the labor rights question deals with the issue of \nenforcement.\n  As I said earlier, for the most part, CAFTA-DR nations have laws on \ntheir books. But they face a lack of resources, as well as domestic \npolitical opposition from influential people, which prevent them from \nenforcing these laws.\n  Again, this is not about pointing the finger or accusing these \ngovernment leaders of malice toward their workers. I don't believe \nthat. I don't believe that is the case here either. I believe they \nactually want to do the right thing. I know these leaders. I respect \nthem. But our neighbors to the south are democratic countries. And as \nin all democracies, they have to deal with powerful opposition \ninterests.\n  The question remains, will CAFTA-DR help these nations overcome this \nopposition to enforcement? In my view, it doesn't go nearly far enough \nto do so. That is why I met with Ambassador Portman yesterday to see if \nwe could strengthen the prospects for enforcement. Laws that can't be \nenforced might as well not be there.\n  The administration seems to hold the view that support for expanded \ntrade and economic growth is incompatible with advocating core labor \nstandards in developing countries. But, in fact, experts in this area \nfrom the well-respected Institute for International Economics have \nconcluded that ``core labor standards support sustainable and broadly \nshared political, social, and economic development.'' The operative \nword being ``shared.''\n  Let me say clearly I believe this agreement is fixable. I wish it \ncould have been fixed. Ambassador Portman and I met. We exchanged \nletters. We worked hard yesterday to try and see if we couldn't \nstrengthen this agreement with respect to enforcement. What we sought \nwas the following, exactly what exists in the Cambodian Agreement that \nwas negotiated by the Clinton administration and renewed by the Bush \nadministration, to their credit. There we said that the International \nLabor Organization ought to be able to make site visits to actually go \nto plants and industries to see whether the labor standards were being \nupheld. Under CAFTA-DR, all they can do is go to the labor ministries \nand ask them whether the laws are being enforced. Obviously, in most of \nthese countries the labor ministries are political appointees. They are \nnot likely to be critical of their own government's efforts. By not \nhaving any standard which all countries must meet, each country will be \nable to set the floor. When they do so, of course, the competition to \nhave a lower floor to attract more industry from outside the country \nlowers the living standards for the very people I have described who \nare living under some of the worst conditions anywhere in the world.\n  I am deeply troubled by this. I so much wanted to be for this \nagreement. I care so much about this region and what happens to these \npeople. I would like nothing more than to be standing here today urging \nmy colleagues to be supportive of this. This is not a minor point. It \ngoes right to the heart of what we try to do with trade agreements; \nthat is, to reduce these barriers, expand markets for our businesses \nand industries, create opportunities for additional job creation, and \nalso to create and generate wealth in these countries so that in the \nlong term, we can produce high value products, high value services, \nthat are affordable in these countries.\n  So trade agreements have worked both ways--expanding economic \nopportunities for ourselves and creating wealth and opportunity in the \ncountries with whom we trade. That is why I supported NAFTA and the \nJordanian Free Trade Agreement and others. Indeed, I have supported far \nmore of these agreements than I have opposed. But with CAFTA-DR, we are \nstepping backwards in a region of the world that needs a commitment to \nlift up the quality of life for its citizens.\n  I am not suggesting we could do it solely through this agreement, but \nyou can begin to make a difference in these people's lives by insisting \nthat they have to meet some minimum standards.\n  This is what we should be saying: We want to do business in your \ncountry. We want to accept your products. We want to trade with you. \nBut the small price we ask is that you have some basic standards for \nthe people who are going to do the jobs.\n  When you eliminate that, then you invite the kind of problems we are \ngoing to see with these people.\n  I am terribly disappointed today. I had hoped I would be able to \nsupport this agreement. I wanted to be a part of this effort. I respect \nimmensely the President inviting us down and talking about this. I \nraised the issue with him. I also respect Rob Portman. He is a good \nman. Obviously, he has the difficulty of dealing with all 535 of us, in \nboth this Chamber and the other, to try and get the votes to pass these \nagreements. This agreement is probably going to be passed tonight. My \nhope was that we would be able to broaden the specter along bipartisan \nsupport for this agreement both here and in the other Chamber. \nUnfortunately, I don't believe that will be the case.\n  Let me say to my colleagues: Even with the adoption of this agreement \nand the absence of these labor standards I feel so strongly about, it \nis my intention, through appropriate vehicles, to condition aid and \nother assistance on improving these standards in these countries. I \nwill find one way or the other to try and improve them, to insist that \nthese countries, in exchange for getting the kind of access to our \nmarkets, at the very least they ought to be required to improve the \nquality of life and the standards under which many of these people \nwork.\n  We stand today at a moment of great opportunity and great risk for \nthis hemisphere. The past two decades have witnessed the rise of \ndemocratic governments in nations that have long languished under \ndictatorship of left or right. But this progress is endangered. \nGlobalization and free trade promise to bring historic levels of \nprosperity to nations north and south. But economic and social \nconditions for millions of men and women continue to lag dangerously \nfar behind, threatening what we have worked so hard to build. Through \nwell-crafted trade agreements, the United States can enhance its own \nprosperity and lift other nations on a stable and democratic path.\n\n  That is why I am so disappointed the administration wasn't able to \nexplicitly support the efforts to give the ILO a greater role in the \nmonitoring and verification process. I believe that in doing so, we \nwould have significantly strengthened this agreement, especially given \nthe troubled history of the region and the potential for mutual \nprosperity that a CAFTA-DR agreement held for all. Unfortunately, the \nagreement before us won't do that.\n  Last night I sent Ambassador Portman a letter detailing proposals \nthat have already been adopted in other agreements. This is not \nbreaking new ground. I appreciate Ambassador Portman's response today \nin the letter he wrote back to me, but I regret that his letter \nincluded no real concrete commitment that the U.S. Government would \nguarantee the implementation that I am requesting--specifically, that \nthe ILO would be granted unfettered access to workplaces, permitted to \nestablish mechanisms for receiving and investigating matters related to \nILO labor standards, to make private recommendations to worker and \nemployer organizations and appropriate officials within each \ngovernment, and to issue periodic public reports of its findings on \nmatters of concern.\n  Therefore, I am left to conclude that instead of breaking new ground \nand raising standards, the CAFTA-DR agreement is a step backwards from \nexisting law. That fact saddens me deeply. This agreement will create a \nweaker set of standards that could very well negatively impact the \npeople of this region, negatively impact American workers and our \nnational security, and weaken democracy in these countries.\n  Regrettably, I won't be able to support this agreement when it comes \nto a vote. I say this with a very heavy heart.\n  But I will make a promise to the American people and to the people of \nthese countries that I will work vigorously to ensure as we move \nforward with this agreement, workers' rights are protected and new \navenues are explored for pursuing this goal. I hope at the end of the \nday, with all of the interests in this agreement, that our keeping the \nlight shining on labor rights issues will make this agreement\n\n[[Page S7714]]\n\nwork. Because even though I can't support this agreement in its current \nform, I truly want to it work for all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nFlorida will be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of this \nCAFTA Free Trade Agreement. Like the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut, I care greatly about this part of the world. This is a \npart of the world I know well, having been born in the Caribbean \nmyself. I do believe it is an important moment, and it is an important \nagreement from a geopolitical sense for the United States and for \nCentral America. I believe this is a good-faith effort on our part to \nfurther strengthen the struggling democracies and economies of our \nneighbors in Central America against the forces opposed to democracy \nand economic freedom and opportunity. I believe this also opens an \nimportant neighboring market of 40 million people and levels the \nplaying field for American businesses as we seek to export our goods \ninto this region.\n  Although I do think it is important to recognize this agreement will \nnot come close to solving all of the problems in Central America, it \nshould be a building block in addressing the great needs of this \nimportant part of our hemisphere. I believe DR-CAFTA is an important \nmoment. I believe its adoption does not fix all that needs to be done. \nI think its rejection would be a tremendously bad signal to this \nregion. It would be a tremendous blow to our furtherance of democracy \nand stability and economic prosperity for Central America. It is a very \nimportant step in improving labor conditions, boosting economic growth \nthroughout the Central American region.\n  CAFTA is a critically important trade agreement for the State of \nFlorida. We are the gateway to Latin America, to Central America \nparticularly. Countries in Central America and the Dominican Republic \nform the largest foreign market for Florida exports.\n  In 2004, Florida exported $3.2 billion of merchandise to the region, \nfar surpassing that of the other 49 States. CAFTA is Florida's largest \nexport market for paper, electronic equipment, and fabric.\n  The CAFTA region is Florida's second largest export market for \ncomputers and computer equipment, machinery, and processed foods. Most \nof DR-CAFTA agricultural goods already enter the United States duty \nfree. This will now even the playing field for our exports into the \nregion.\n  The CAFTA treaty is supported by the Florida Chamber of Commerce, \nGreater Miami Chamber of Commerce, the Orlando Regional Chamber of \nCommerce, the Greater Tampa Chamber of Commerce, Governor Jeb Bush, \nFlorida Citrus Mutual, Seaboard Marine, Associated Industries of \nFlorida, the Florida Ports Council, the Florida Poultry Federation, the \nWorld Trade Center of Florida, Florida East Coast Industries, and many \nothers.\n  No other State stands to benefit more economically from CAFTA than \nFlorida.\n  Mr. President, I have been undecided in my position on CAFTA, as much \nas I support free trade and understand the power of leveling trade \nbarriers, an important sector of Florida's agricultural industry was \nleft unprotected by the original CAFTA agreement.\n  The sugar industry in Florida is an incredibly important part of our \nState. It provides over 23,000 jobs, mostly in rural Florida. Over $2 \nbillion in economic activity is generated in Florida from the \nproduction of corn and sugar sweetener products. And because of this \ncritically important economic engine for our State, I have resisted \nsupporting CAFTA because of the potential impact on Florida's sugar \nproducers.\n  So I and other colleagues began working to see what type of \ncompromise might be reached for Florida's sugar producers so that they \nwould be treated fairly in the event of a CAFTA agreement.\n  After many meetings, phone calls, conference calls, and hard work by \nSecretary of Agriculture Johanns, Ambassador Portman, my good friend, \nthe distinguished chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Senator \nChambliss, along with a group of colleagues that Senator Chambliss \npulled together, an agreement has been offered that I believe extends \nand offers an opportunity to deal with the sugar problem.\n  I thank our Trade Representative, Rob Portman, for his hard work in \ntrying to address the concerns of this important part of our \nagricultural industry. I am also very thankful for the leadership of my \ncolleague, Senator Chambliss, chairman of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee. Secretary Johanns, from the Department of Agriculture, was \nalso instrumental in ensuring that we could come to a proposal on how \nwe could best ensure that our domestic sugar producers were treated \nfairly after a CAFTA agreement. I thank them all for their work on this \nimportant issue to our State.\n  My goal was to ensure that the Florida sugar industry was treated \nfairly, be given a viable role in the future, and that they did not \nbecome the one industry in Florida, the one segment of our agricultural \nindustry that would be harmed by a CAFTA agreement. But I do believe \nthat this proposal offered by Secretary Johanns and the administration \nis the best case scenario for Florida's sugar producers.\n  The Secretary's offer is multifaceted. One, foreign sugar from all \nforeign countries cannot exceed the farm bill's 1.532-million-ton \nlimit, regardless if it came from CAFTA countries, Mexico--which is \nunder NAFTA and not subject to the farm bill--and other future trade \nagreements. This agreement will last until the current farm bill \nexpires.\n  Two, USDA will conduct a feasibility study on the potential \ndevelopment of using sugar to produce ethanol on a wide scale in the \nUnited States.\n  Thirdly, if the domestic market reaches the sugar trigger from \nforeign sugar, USDA will purchase the excess amount of CAFTA sugar that \nis imported to the United States and then use it to produce ethanol. \nThis pilot program will last until the farm bill expires. It \nessentially guarantees that if CAFTA sugar is proven to depress the \nmarketplace, the U.S. Government will purchase this sugar from Florida \nfarmers and others to produce ethanol.\n  This is a very substantial offer. It is an agreement that I think \nrepresents the sugar industry's best chance to plan for a future. It \nholds the industry harmless from CAFTA and, more than that, from NAFTA. \nThe future of the domestic sugar industry lies in new technology and \nethanol production, and this treaty allows them to begin that very \nimportant process.\n  Mr. President, this is an important moment for us and Central America \nand the Dominican Republic. It represents a future partnership in trade \nand economic development, a better future, a better life, and will \nhopefully help improve economic conditions and provide political \nstability.\n  We have a chance to help our Nation's manufacturers, businesses, \nfarmers, and ranchers knock down trade barriers and help our country \nremain competitive in a global marketplace.\n  In summary, I have said consistently that before I voted for CAFTA, I \nwanted to ensure that all of Florida's agricultural sectors were \ntreated fairly under this agreement, including the sugar producers.\n  I have worked hard to find a compromise that would offer protections \nto Florida's sugar producers from the threat of a flooded domestic \nsugar market.\n  I believe the proposals put forth by Secretary Johanns and the \nadministration to hold imports of sugar to levels included in the 2002 \nfarm bill is the best case scenario for Florida's sugar producers and \nensures that they are treated fairly not only under CAFTA but NAFTA as \nwell.\n  The sugar industry is incredibly important to our State, to our \neconomy, and a vital part of our agricultural sector. The industry \nprovides, as I said, over 23,000 jobs. Therefore, this is an industry \nthat we want to make sure was not overlooked as we went about seeking \nthis agreement.\n  Having obtained what I thought was a fair and reasonable offer, I \nbelieve now I can wholeheartedly support the CAFTA agreement. I believe \nit will be good not only for the United States and the State of \nFlorida, but also for our neighbors in Central America and the \nDominican Republic. I think it will provide a new opportunity and \nbeginning and a new hope for this region to\n\n[[Page S7715]]\n\nbegin on a much stronger road to economic development, to economic \nself-sufficiency, and, hopefully, tied into that is political \nstability, democracy, the rule of law, and the free market system.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida, and following the remarks of the Senator from Florida, I ask \nunanimous consent that 10 minutes then be allocated to Senator Sessions \nand that the time be taken out of the time allocated to Senator \nGrassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Did the Senator yield 10 minutes to the \nSenator from Florida?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes, 10 and 10.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I worked on this trade \nagreement pretty hard. Now that this agreement is in front of us, \ndespite some lingering concerns I have, I will support it. This \nagreement affects my State of Florida more than any other State in the \nUnion. For example, in 2004, the State of Florida exported $3.2 billion \nworth of merchandise to the DR-CAFTA region. Florida has the highest \ntotal among any State. The next nearest State, Texas, exported $1.8 \nbillion. And the DR-CAFTA region accounts for 11 percent of Florida's \ntotal exports.\n  Florida does stand to gain a great deal from this agreement. Miami, \nwhich is really the capital of the Americas, is the national gateway to \nCentral America and the Dominican Republic. Throughout the rest of \nFlorida, we have other industries that will also increase their \nbusiness and explore new opportunities in the region.\n  These Florida industries stand to grow enormously. Because of our \nunique relationship, we have been talking about thousands of jobs \ncreated in the first year and tens of thousands of jobs in the coming \nyears as a result of DR-CAFTA's enactment.\n  I have been to the Dominican Republic. I have spoken with the \nPresident, Leonel Fernandez. I recently went to Honduras at the \ninvitation of the President Maduro and spent a couple of days there and \nspoke at length with not only our U.S. embassy personnel but members of \nthe Government of Honduras.\n  I believe that dramatically lower tariff barriers also will lead to \nincreased exports to the region from Florida and through Florida's \nports. This increase in business and industry for my State is a good \ndeal and will increase our connections with these countries and all of \nLatin America.\n  This agreement is also, I believe, in our national interest. Free and \nfair trade creates new economic opportunities for Americans, and it \ncreates economic uplift in these other countries. This economic uplift \nis critical to ensuring that these countries remain stable and people \nare not forced to emigrate in search of employment.\n  As we try to stabilize countries in the region, promote democracy, \nclearly their economic enhancement is in the interest of the United \nStates, in order to see those struggling democracies flourish. And that \nis the clear message I heard as I traveled extensively throughout Latin \nAmerica.\n  Unfortunately, as we know, free-trade agreements do not affect all \nindustries equally, and Florida has vulnerable industries that we must \nprotect from unfair trade practices. My colleagues have heard me speak \nmany times about the Florida citrus industry and the threat that it \nfaces from Brazil. Today, I raise my concerns about another important \nFlorida industry, and that is the sugar industry.\n  DR-CAFTA, as negotiated, asks our sugar industry to sacrifice more \nthan other commodities. American sugar producers face an international \nmarket where sugar is sold at artificially low prices because of unfair \nlabor practices and habitual dumping.\n  In the last FTA, the Australia agreement, interestingly, sugar was \nexcluded, but the administration changed course on CAFTA negotiating \nextra sugar access and, at the same time, establishing a new precedent.\n  I worked with numerous Senators, especially over the last 3 weeks. I \nhave raised sand with the administration about these provisions. I have \nlet them know that there was more that could be done to protect the \nAmerican sugar industry. In response, the administration has made some \ncommitments that I believe will help mitigate the impact on our \ndomestic sugar producers through the life of the 2002 farm bill, which \nwill go for another 2 or 3 years.\n  Sugar levels available on the U.S. market will not go above the level \nestablished in the farm bill. Ambassador Portman, the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative, and I had a personal eyeball-to-eyeball meeting this \nafternoon. He made it clear to me that there is no prospect of any \nsubstantial sugar concessions being included in any other trade \nagreements through the life of the farm bill. This was an individual \nconversation, and he is not going to take that position officially \nbecause he does not want to tie his hands, but that is the bottom line \nof our conversation.\n  The administration has also committed to study the feasibility of \nconverting sugar into ethanol. At my urging, the Deputy Secretary of \nAgriculture--and this was arranged by Ambassador Portman who directly \ngave me his word--said: Do you want it in writing? I said: I accept \nyour word, that is good enough for me, but others may like to see it \nmemorialized. He said: I will get you a letter.\n  I have this letter, and I ask unanimous consent that the letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The Deputy Secretary\n\n\n                                               of Agriculture,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 30, 2005.\n     Hon. Bill Nelson,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nelson: I write to provide further guidance on \n     the feasibility study outlined in Secretary Johanns' June 29, \n     2005 letter to Senator Chambliss (attached), which was the \n     result of discussions between the Senator, the Administration \n     and the Members of Congress that the Senator brought \n     together.\n       They agreed that the Secretary would conduct a feasibility \n     study on converting sugar into ethanol and submitting the \n     results of the study to Congress not later than July 1, 2006. \n     The Department of Agriculture will begin the feasibility \n     study immediately and I intend to have an initial meeting \n     with our economists during the week of July 4. Furthermore, \n     it would be USDA's intention to issue an interim report by \n     December 15, 2005.\n       I hope this additional clarification is helpful to you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Charles F. Conner,\n                                                 Deputy Secretary.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, this letter is from the Deputy \nSecretary of Agriculture, who has promised to commence a feasibility \nstudy on converting sugar into ethanol and to start it immediately, \nwith an initial meeting of the agricultural economists next week, the \nJuly Fourth week. I believe at that point they will and should lay out \na baseline of the knowledge we have on this issue.\n  I expect that will occur, and I expect that quite a lot of research \non converting sugar into ethanol has already been carried out and that \nthis study should acknowledge this research and build upon it. In other \nwords, don't start the feasibility study from scratch.\n  The Deputy Secretary has also promised me that the Department of \nAgriculture will issue an interim report in addition to what they had \nearlier promised, a report that would be concluded by July of next \nyear, 2006. In this letter, the Deputy Secretary says they will issue \nan interim report by December 15, 2005.\n  The feasibility study is a start, but we can do much more. In every \nother ethanol program around the world, sugar is included. I urge the \nconferees on the Energy bill and the administration to make sugar a \npart of the ethanol program established in that bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my letter to the conferees be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S7716]]\n\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 30, 2005.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Senate Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Joe Barton,\n     Chairman, House Energy and Commerce, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John D. Dingell,\n     Ranking Member, House Energy and Commerce, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Sirs: I support the inclusion of provisions in the \n     House and Senate energy bills to increase the renewable \n     content of our motor vehicle fuel. Renewables such as ethanol \n     burn cleaner, reduce tailpipe emissions and decrease the \n     amount of oil in our gasoline. But, I urge the Energy Bill \n     Conference Committee to require that 100 million gallons of \n     the five to eight billion gallon-a-year ethanol mandate be \n     sugar-based.\n       As you know, sugar cane stalks, or bagasse, produce almost \n     twice as much ethanol per acre as corn and several countries \n     use sugar-based ethanol to fuel their motor vehicles. In \n     fact, Brazil reduced their importation of oil from 80% of \n     their demand in the 1970s to 11% today in part by using \n     ethanol, much of it sugar-based. For these reasons, \n     specifying that a 100 million gallons of sugar-based ethanol \n     be required as part of the overall ethanol motor vehicle \n     fuels program would be an important step towards decreasing \n     our use of fossil fuels and increasing our use of renewable \n     fuels.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Bill Nelson.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Expansion of alternative fuel programs is an \nurgent national priority. If we are concerned about importing 60 \npercent of our daily oil consumption from foreign lands, we best \ndevelop a substitute, and ethanol works in our existing gasoline \nengines.\n  In conclusion, frankly I believe the administration could have done \nbetter. They could have started discussions with the industry sooner by \nallowing all parties to explore the available options. I believe more \ntime could have led to further agreements and compromise, but I must \nlook not to the interests of one very important industry in my State \nbut also to the greater interests of Florida and especially the Nation \nas a whole.\n  I will vote for CAFTA today. It is important to my State and it is \nimportant to the Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have great respect for all of my \ncolleagues no matter what they decide to do on this vote. I think the \nvote is probably predetermined this evening. I must say there are a lot \nof promises I have heard on the floor the last day or so. There have \nbeen a lot of promises made downtown. I would only point out that I \nhave seen the result of most of these promises after the votes are \ntaken and most of them have not been worth the paper they are written \non or the assurances given have not been valuable at all.\n  One might want to look at the side agreement dealing with sugar from \nMexico; one can then go on to a sweetener agreement with Mexico; then \ncan go on to a lot of these areas and understand that there are a lot \nof promises in order to get these bills passed, but by and large they \ndo not amount to very much. They will not need anybody in this Senate \nafter the ``yes'' votes are cast.\n  I start at the beginning, if I might. I know we are nearing the end \nof this debate. I do not want to go all the way back to the beginning, \nbut let me go back a fair piece. It is when John Adams is in Europe as \nthey are putting this new country together. He is in Europe \nrepresenting our country. He writes back to his wife Abigail and asks \nAbigail the question: Where is the leadership going to come from? Where \nwill the leadership emerge to help form this great country of ours, to \nhelp form a new government?\n  He plaintively kept asking, where will the leadership come from? Then \nin subsequent letters he would say to her, there is really only us. \nThere is me. There is Thomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin, George \nWashington, Madison, Mason. Of course, in the rearview mirror of \nhistory, the only ``us'' represents some of the greatest human talent \never assembled. They wrote a document that is the most remarkable \ndocument. It is a document called the U.S. Constitution that begins \nwith ``we the people.'' That Constitution that begins with ``we the \npeople'' provides mechanisms, the framework of our Government, the \nframework of a representative democracy.\n  Over many years, with that document providing the fabric of the \ngrowth of this great country, we have been a country that has been \ndivinely blessed in many ways. We have built a place unlike any other \nplace on the face of this Earth. There is no place like it. One can \nspin the globe and on this little planet called Earth, with 6 billion \nneighbors, there is no place quite like the United States of America.\n  We created an expanded set of opportunities for all Americans, \nthrough a lot of good decisions; for example, universal education. We \nas a country decided long ago every young child ought to be whatever \ntheir God-given talents allow them to be. We are not going to separate \nkids in our school system. They get to go to school and they get to \nbecome whatever their talents allow that child to become.\n  That universal education for all Americans has created a country that \nis unlike any other in the world. We went from the Colonies to the \nStates. We survived a Civil War. We beat back a Depression. We resisted \nthe oppression of Adolf Hitler, won a Second World War. We provided a \nGI bill, and when those soldiers came back from that war, they went to \ncollege. They got their college degrees. They came back to their \ncommunities. They built a home, got married, raised a family, built \nschools, built communities. What a remarkable country this has been.\n  It all comes back to this book, this Constitution. Other countries \nhave constitutions, but none are quite like this Constitution. This \nConstitution says something about international trade and commerce. It \ndescribes the regulation of commerce and trade to the Congress. It is \nour responsibility, not the President's responsibility.\n  So over a number of years we have worked on and dealt with these \nissues and then we have had in many ways an almost breathtaking series \nof decades. We have split the atom, we have spliced genes, we have \ncloned animals, we invented plastics, nylon, the radar, the silicon \nchip. We cured polio, smallpox. We built airplanes, learned to fly \nthem. We built rockets, flew to the Moon and walked on the Moon. We \ncreated telephones, television sets, computers. What a remarkable set \nof achievements for the men and women in this country who are the \ndoers, the achievers, the inventors. We stand on each other's shoulders \nlooking to the future.\n  So about three decades ago things began to change. This world became \nsmaller. We started hearing about the global economy. We began to do \nmore and travel more and have more connections with other parts of the \nworld, and particularly large corporations which were developed because \nof economies of scale. Those large corporations began to be able to do \nbusiness in more than one country. Then they defined for their own \ninterests the opportunities by which they would do that business. It \nthen became a global economy. In that global economy, we began to hear \nthe term free trade, free trade, like a chant, almost like the hare \nkrishna chanting on a street corner, wearing robes: Free trade.\n  Well, free trade is of little interest to me. I am very interested in \nexpanded trade and fair trade, but free trade, there are a lot of \nthings that are free.\n  This country built a place unlike any other on the face of this Earth \nand we need to be concerned about its continuation. So the question is \nwhat kind of trade gives us the opportunity to continue improving the \nstandard of living in America, creating an economy that produces new \njobs and new opportunities?\n  I am sure every single set of parents in this country wants things \nbetter for their kids. If there is something in second place, beyond \nthe importance of their children, I guess I understand that, but \neverybody would believe, I expect, that what is most important in their \nlives is their children. We care about these things that affect our \nchildren. Are we sending our kids to good schools? Are we proud of \nthese schools? Do we believe we are able to leave a world that is a \nbetter place in which to live than the one we found? Is that what we \nare going to do for our kids?\n  So as we confront this question of the new global economy and a new\n\n[[Page S7717]]\n\nglobal strategy, the galloping globalization of our economy, without a \nset of rules that has kept pace, the question for all of us is: What \ndoes it mean for our country? What does it mean for our future? What \ndoes it mean for our kids--especially our kids?\n  In the past decade, we have seen a very substantial loss of American \njobs. Some people say, do not worry, be happy, ignore it. It is all \npart of the transition. What we will see is our low-skilled jobs move \nelsewhere, we will educate our children, and we will assume the role of \nhigh-skill, high-paying jobs; don't worry.\n\n  So we pass trade laws. They are called CAFTA and NAFTA and GATT, WTO. \nWe do all of these things. Then somehow, at the end of this process, we \nlook back and we see, you know, something fundamentally has changed. \nSomebody has pulled the rug out from under what are the basic strengths \nof this country--a good job that pays well, that provides benefits, \nthat you can count on.\n  About 30 years ago the biggest corporation in America was General \nMotors. In most cases, people who went to work for General Motors \nexpected to work there for a lifetime. They were paid well and they had \nbenefits, health care and retirement. That was 30 years ago.\n  Now the largest corporation is Wal-Mart. They do not pay so well. \nMost people do not spend a lifetime at Wal-Mart. The average wage is \nmuch lower, and a fairly substantial number of their employees do not \nhave benefits.\n  That is a very substantial change, really a dramatic change in our \ncountry. But the biggest change has been the development of a set of \nideas by those who are able to influence thought in this country, \nparticularly the largest corporations that have unlimited quantities of \nmoney, who convinced us that free trade, as a moniker, is a mechanism \nfor success in our country.\n  So we pass trade agreements, the end of which means we lose American \njobs, lose economic strength, and somehow believe that somewhere in the \nfuture things are going to get better.\n  I want to show a chart I have shown many times during this debate. It \nis a chart that shows what has happened with our trade deficit. This is \na dangerous trend. Behind these red lines are lost jobs, families who \nlost their jobs, hundreds of them, thousands of them, and millions of \nthem. Not many people in here know those people. No one in this Chamber \nlost his or her job because we all put a suit and necktie on and come \nto work. Nobody is going to get outsourced or offshored in the Senate. \nBut all these folks did.\n  I have lists of companies and lists of names of people who just lost \ntheir job because of this new approach, a new defined approach in \ninternational trade that says in our country, we will be the leader \nthat says go ahead and find, with the mechanism of production, the \nlowest cost production in the world. Get your Gulfstream, circle the \nglobe and find out where you can produce for 30 cents an hour. Move \nthat job to that area and, by the way, when you do, we will give you a \ntax cut. Let me say that again, because that is kind of a Byzantine \nproposition. When you close your American factory and fire your \nAmerican workers, you get a tax cut from our Government. And, yes, I \nhave tried twice to change that in the Senate and, yes, a majority of \nthe Senate voted to keep a tax cut for workers who get fired and \ncompanies that move those jobs overseas. I will put in the \nCongressional Record their names. I really don't need to. A very easy \nNexis-Lexis search will give you the names of who decided they should \nkeep their tax cuts for companies that move their jobs overseas.\n  The point is, we are seeing this inevitable, relentless move to \nproduce where it is cheap and then sell into the established \nmarketplace. The problem is, this is unsustainable. This is a theory \nthat is off track and it is a practice that injures this country.\n  Why do I say the theory is off track? Henry Ford decided, when he was \ngoing to make Fords, that he wanted to pay his production workers \nsufficient money so that they could buy the cars they were producing. \nThat is pretty simple. That is simple economics. If you are paying your \nworkers enough money so they can buy the products they are producing, \nyou have a market and a consumer for the product. A pretty smart guy, \nHenry Ford.\n  Now it has changed. Now we should produce those shirts and those \nshoes and those trousers and all the trinkets where you can do it for \n30 cents an hour and then ship it to Fargo and Toledo and Dayton and \nLos Angeles and New York and sell it there.\n  The question is, Who ultimately is going to buy that? Who ultimately \nwill buy this?\n  We have a lot of dislocations that are dangerous. I have not talked \nat all about this, and I will not talk at length. A part of this, by \nthe way, is oil. A part of this is oil. There are some on this globe \nwho are lucky enough to have enough oil under the sands so if you stand \nin a depression in the sand with boots, your soles are going to look \noily because some parts of this world are loaded with oil, particularly \nthe Middle East. So the Saudis, Kuwaitis, Iraqis, and others have a lot \nof oil. We are desperately and hopelessly addicted to it. Our economy \nis addicted to it, and that is part of this. It also relates to jobs \nbecause, when you have the purchase of oil from these countries--Saudi \nArabia and Kuwait and so on--they end up with American dollars, which \nmeans they want to buy American companies. They want to buy American \nstock. It is a way of buying part of our country.\n\n  In today's newspaper it says, ``China Tells U.S. Not To Meddle in the \nBid for California Oil Giant.''\n  The story is the Chinese want to buy the ninth largest oil and gas \ncompany in the United States called Unocal.\n  Why would they want to buy Unocal? They are like everybody else. They \nwant to control oil to the extent they can. The Chinese, I am told, now \nhave 20 million cars. They have 1.3 billion people. By 15 years from \nnow they are expected to have 120 million automobiles. They are going \nto need gas. They are going to need a lot of gas. The price of oil is \nnot going to go down, it is going to go up. They want to buy an oil \ncompany. I don't think this should happen in a million years, by the \nway. I don't think we should have the Chinese buying American oil \ncompanies, but I will tell you why this is happening. It is happening \nbecause these trade deficits are putting massive amounts of money in \nthe hands of Chinese, and it gives them the opportunity to purchase, on \nthe open market, America's stocks, bonds, companies.\n  I mentioned previously that Warren Buffett, whom I like a lot--I \nthink he is the second richest man in the world, but you would never \nknow it. Warren is just a great guy. Warren Buffett described this \nproblem as ``a country that is now aspiring to an ownership society \nwill not find happiness in a sharecropper society.''\n  This is where we are heading, he says, a sharecropper society. He \ndescribes this is when every day, 7 days a week, you put $2 billion in \nthe hands of foreigners. You are buying $2 billion more from foreigners \nthan you are selling to them every day, 7 days a week. You are putting \n$2 billion more into hands of foreigners and foreign governments. That \nmeans each day they have more purchasing power to buy another part of \nAmerica. That is where this comes from. The Chinese want to by Unocal. \nThat is where the money comes from, the $140 billion trade deficit with \nChina last year. That means they have our country's currency. They have \nthe capability of buying our stocks and our companies.\n  The question is, Do we care about that? Does anybody here want to \nchange the strategy or do you want to do some more of it?\n  The attitude in the Senate, as I think we will discover when the vote \nis taken tonight is that if you are digging yourself into a hole, what \nyou need is more shovels and just dig a little harder. That makes no \nsense to me.\n  If there is one person in the U.S. Congress who does not understand \nthe danger of this, then they are in the wrong business. This is \ntrouble. This comes from CAFTA, it comes from GATT, it comes from \nincompetent trade negotiators and bad trade deal after bad trade deal. \nI just heard on the floor of the Senate today, I will bet you six \npeople who talked about promises that have been made to them in order \nto get this trade deal through the Congress. These promises mean \nnothing. These are totally, completely empty promises.\n\n[[Page S7718]]\n\n  Let me briefly describe this. I am going to use Warren Buffett to \ndescribe it because, again, I like Warren Buffett. He described it this \nway. Stay with me just for a moment.\n\n       To understand why, take a wildly fanciful trip with me to \n     two isolated, side-by-side islands of equal size, \n     Squanderville and Thriftville. Land is the only capital asset \n     on these islands, and their communities are primitive, \n     needing only food and producing only food. Working eight \n     hours a day, in fact, each inhabitant can produce enough food \n     to sustain himself or herself. And for a long time that's how \n     things go along. On each island everybody works the \n     prescribed eight hours a day, which means that each society \n     is self-sufficient.\n       Eventually, though, the industrious citizens of Thriftville \n     decide to do some serious saving and investing, and they \n     start to work 16 hours a day. In this mode they continue to \n     live off the food they produce in eight hours of work but \n     begin exporting an equal amount to their one and only trading \n     outlet, Squanderville.\n       The citizens of Squanderville are ecstatic about this turn \n     of events, since they can now live their lives free from toil \n     but eat as well as ever. Oh, yes, there's a quid pro quo--but \n     to the Squanders, it seems harmless: All that the Thrifts \n     want in exchange for their food is Squanderbonds (which are \n     denominated, naturally, in Squanderbucks).\n       Over time Thriftville accumulates an enormous amount of \n     these bonds, which at their core represent claim checks on \n     the future output of Squanderville. A few pundits in \n     Squanderville smell trouble coming. They foresee that for the \n     Squanders both to eat and to pay off--or simply service--the \n     debt they're piling up will eventually require them to work \n     more than eight hours a day. But the residents of \n     Squanderville are in no mood to listen to such doomsaying.\n       Meanwhile, the citizens of Thriftville begin to get \n     nervous. Just how good, they ask, are the IOUs of a shiftless \n     island? So the Thrifts change strategy: Though they continue \n     to hold some bonds, they sell most of them to Squanderville \n     residents for Squanderbucks and use the proceeds to buy \n     Squanderville land. And eventually the Thrifts own all of \n     Squanderville.\n       At that point, the Squanders are forced to deal with an \n     ugly equation: They must now not only return to working eight \n     hours a day in order to eat--they have nothing left to \n     trade--but must also work additional hours to service their \n     debt and pay Thriftville rent on the land so imprudently \n     sold. In effect, Squanderville has been colonized by purchase \n     rather than conquest.\n\n  That is my friend Warren Buffett's description of what is happening. \nAnd it is why, by the way, the Chinese have the money to buy Unocal. \nThis is about Squanderville and Thriftville. The question he asks: Is \nanybody listening? Regrettably, the answer in the Senate is: Precious \nfew.\n  I have spoken at great length about companies. I have not spoken \npreviously about Pennsylvania House, which I will do just for a moment. \nI have talked about Huffy bicycles, Radio Flyer little red wagons, Fig \nNewton cookies--which, by the way, went to Monterrey, Mexico, so if you \nwant some Mexican food, order Fig Newton cookies.\n  Let me tell you about Pennsylvania House Furniture, high-end \nfurniture made with Pennsylvania wood, hardwood and cherry wood, high-\nend, terrific furniture, made for many decades in Pennsylvania and \nmarketed as Pennsylvania Furniture.\n  Pennsylvania House Furniture was purchased by Lazy Boy Corporation \nabout 4 years ago. Lazy Boy decided it is just too expensive to \nmanufacture Pennsylvania House furniture in Pennsylvania, so we have to \nmove it to China. Now Pennsylvania House furniture will be made in \nChina. They will ship the wood from Pennsylvania to China, the \nhardwood, the cherry wood. They will put it together in China and ship \nthe furniture back.\n  So it is for Robert Zechman. Robert Zechman worked for that company \nfor 29 years. On December 21, four days from Christmas, he got his \nletter: You get $92-a-year severance for the service you have given \nthis great company. Now we are shipping the wood and your job to China. \nThey put the furniture together and ship it back. We will still call it \nPennsylvania House Furniture, but the only Pennsylvania part of that \nfurniture is the wood. The people are expendable.\n  The question is, Does anybody care about that? Does it matter to \nanybody? It mattered to Pennsylvania. Governor Rendell said: We have \n500 people who work here. We would like to save these jobs. They put \ntogether an effort to save those jobs. Finally, we were told that Lazy \nBoy said: We are not interested in having competition domestically, so \nwe are not going to sell. We are moving to China.\n  Same story with Huffy bicycles. Same story with dozens and dozens and \ndozens of companies.\n  I spoke last week about a refrigerator company that decided they will \nclose their American plant, notify the workers: No jobs in this country \nfor you anymore. Why? Because we are going to make those refrigerators \nin Mexico. And, by the way, just to rub salt in the wound, one part of \nthe manufacturing plant with which they will manufacture those \nrefrigerators in Mexico has an Ex-Im Bank loan. That is a loan \nsubsidized by this Government to build a part of a plant in Mexico to \nhouse the jobs of the workers who were fired in this country to build \nsome refrigerators.\n  Does it matter? Maybe not to some. It matters to me. Does it matter \nwhether we make refrigerators? Does it matter whether we make fine \nfurniture? Does it matter whether we have a manufacturing base? Will \nAmerica remain a strong world-class economy if it gives its \nmanufacturing sector away?\n  In the last 25 years, we have lost one-half of our manufacturing \ncapacity. Is there anybody here who is having an apoplectic seizure \nabout that? Not hardly. We snore our way through this. President after \nPresident gives us a new trade law to see if we can improve on this \nmassive debt that keeps growing and growing and growing. In the \nmeantime, Robert Zechman will probably ask his Congressman or his \nSenator: What is going on there? Are you standing up for America, \nstanding up for jobs in this country? Absolutely, he will hear. You bet \nyour life. We are all for American jobs. It is just that the trade \nagreements trade them away--quickly. The majority of the people in the \nHouse and the Senate are going to vote for these trade agreements.\n  America Online--December 2003--had just laid off 450 American \nemployees, mostly design engineers and software engineers, in its \nCalifornia offices. Then those same engineers read that America Online \nwas trying to hire software development teams and engineers in \nBangalore, India. Does that mean you change your name to India Online, \nor is it still America Online that divests itself of U.S. employees and \nhires the engineers in Bangalore?\n  The list is endless. We come down, finally, to a choice, a choice \nthis Senate will make once again on another trade agreement. The NAFTA \ntrade agreement, called North American Free Trade Agreement, was \nnegotiated between the United States, Mexico, and Canada. It was just \none more chapter of bad trade agreements. But before that trade \nagreement, we had a slight surplus in trade with Mexico. We had a \nmodest deficit with Canada. Now we have had about 10 years of trade \nagreements called NAFTA, and now we have a very large trade deficit \nwith Mexico and a larger trade deficit with Canada. One would wonder if \nsomebody would stand up and scratch their head and say: Gee, I wonder \nif we didn't make a mistake here.\n  The economists, by the way, who most trumpeted the benefits of NAFTA, \nthe North American Free Trade Agreement, were two economists named \nHufbauer and Schott. I am sure they are still practicing economists. I \nsee the names Hufbauer and Schott.\n  I actually used to teach economics. Economics is just a little bit of \npsychology pumped up with a lot of helium. I taught it for a little \nwhile and was able to overcome that experience and still lead a \nproductive life.\n  But these economists, Hufbauer and Schott, said: If you just pass \nNAFTA, we will promise you a remarkable future. What will happen is \njobs will transpose. We will see low-income, low-skilled jobs being \nperformed by Mexicans and high-skill, high-wage jobs now producing a \nproduct to be sold into an emerging middle class in Mexico, and those \nwill be produced in America.\n  These people were totally, completely wrong about everything. Has \nanybody said, We were wrong? Of course not. In this debate on CAFTA, \nwhich is another acronym--NAFTA, CAFTA, SHAFTA, whatever it is--on this \ndebate, we are now hearing NAFTA was really good. Boy, if we could just \nget some more of this spoiled trade agreement, somehow things would be \nbetter off. They would not be better.\n  Let me try to tell you what I believe our obligation is. Yes, I want \na strong\n\n[[Page S7719]]\n\neconomy. Yes, I want American companies to understand we support their \ninterest in competing around the world.\n  But I believe that, first of all, in the boardrooms they ought to say \nthe Pledge of Allegiance from time to time. If we charter American \ncorporations as artificial people--and that is what a corporate charter \nis about. We say we are going to create you as an artificial person. We \nare going to give you a charter which gives you limited liability. You \ncan sue and be sued, contract and be contracted with. You are, in fact, \nan artificial person. If that artificial person, by corporate charter, \ngiven by this country, is in America, then it ought to care just a bit \nabout this country's interests. And, yes, maybe just a recitation of \nthe Pledge of Allegiance, occasionally, in the boardroom might help.\n  When we hear people say, ``We want all the benefits for our \ncorporation being American, except the responsibility for paying taxes \nis something we want to shed,'' I worry about loyalty and commitment to \nthis country. And, yes, that is happening. We see what is called \ninversions, where corporations want to renounce their American \ncitizenship to become citizens of the Bahamas. Why? Because they want \nto become Bahamian citizens? No. Because they want to avoid paying U.S. \ntaxes. I have always said, if they want to do that, if they run into \ntrouble, let them call out the Bahamian Navy. My understanding is, \nthere are about 24 people in the Bahamian Navy. Let them call on the \nBahamian Navy.\n  The point is, I think we ought to support American companies in \ncompeting around the world, but we ought to expect certain things from \nthem as well. The same is true with respect to other countries. Whether \nit is China, Japan, Europe or Korea, we should not any longer sit idly \nby and roll our eyes at trade agreements that are unfair to our workers \nand unfair to our companies.\n  Let me again mention just one specific piece of information. I do not \nmean to pick on Korea for the sake of picking on Korea. I have spoken \nabout the Chinese automobile trade previously. Korea, this year, if \nthis year is similar to last year, will likely send us about 680,000 \nKorean cars, all on ships, to be delivered to the United States, and to \nbe sold in the United States--680,000 cars produced in Korea, with \nKorean labor, to be shipped to the United States.\n  Do you know how many cars the United States will produce that we will \nbe able to sell in Korea? Do you think it will be 680,000? No, 3,900. \nDo you know why? Because Korea does not want American cars sold in \nKorea. They had a little spurt once on the Dodge Dakota pickup, and \nthey shut that down real quickly. So 680,000 cars coming this way; \n3,900 cars going from the United States to Korea.\n  I think for us to put up with this stuff is unbelievable, just \nunbelievable, in its ignorance. I would say to the Koreans, with \nrespect to that piece of bilateral trade, if that is what you want to \ndo on bilateral automobile trade, then, for a while, why don't you sell \nyour cars in Zambia? Just ship them to Zambia, and we hope you have a \ngood commercial success with them. Very soon, they would understand \nthey need the American marketplace, and in exchange for needing the \nAmerican marketplace, to have their marketplace wide open to us.\n  We know, those of us who will vote against this, and especially those \nwho speak as I do, we know that the Washington Post, which will largely \nnot run any op-ed pieces from those of us who hold our view, they and \nthe other institutional thinkers on this will say: Well, do you know \nwhat you are? We have just heard you speak, and you basically ignore \nthe world as it is. You are willing to reject the global economy, \ndespite the fact that it exists and is there. And what you are is a \nxenophobic, isolationist stooge that simply is incapable of seeing over \nthe horizon. You don't have the breadth of thought we do. And because \nyou don't, you have a basic level of ignorance. That is how they treat \npeople who do not buy into the jingoism of free trade.\n  This country used to be known as a country of shrewd Yankee traders. \nWe were good. Our country wants us to succeed. We should want us to \nsucceed. And we want to help others succeed with trade relationships \nthat help lift others up, not push us down. But I have described \nalready what we have gone through in the last century.\n  Unlike almost any other country on Earth, in the last century we \ndecided some pretty basics things. And there are some people who had a \ntough time forcing these things to happen. I do not have the names of \nthe people who were killed on the streets of America who were demanding \nthe right for labor to be able to organize, but they died. Those who \nfought for a safe workplace, they suffered. Those who demanded a fair \npart of the income stream in this country for those who work for a \nliving, they too paid the price for that. Those who fought, who said, \nbelching chemicals into the air and water out of our factories, it is \npoisoning where we live, and you have to stop it--and they forced \nCongress to put an end to it--they paid a price for that as well.\n  But we did all that. It made sense. And now all of a sudden we see \nthat does not matter. What matters is to be able to pole-vault over all \nof those regulations and go set up a factory in Guangzhou and produce \nthat commodity and send it to Pittsburgh. And the consumer may get a \n$25 lower bill for that commodity. The consumer probably lost their job \nto the worker in the factory in Guangzhou, but they are able to pay \nslightly less for that commodity. That is not a bargain for our \ncountry. It is a way for our country to lose economic strength and to \nlose its way.\n  Now, let me just conclude by saying I have great hope for this \ncountry. If I did not have hope, I would not serve here in the Senate. \nWe come here from a quiltwork of interests around the country--some big \nStates and some small States, some big towns, some small towns, ivy \nleague colleges and State schools. I come from a town of 300 people. I \nthink it is a thrill every day to go to work. I think it is a special \nprivilege to be here. If I did not have hope, I would not keep coming \nhere, I would not have run for reelection last fall.\n  I still have hope that, in the long run, we will understand that the \npath we are on cannot be sustained and there is a better path. And it \nis not a path that is selfish. It is not demanding ``us or nothing.'' \nIt is just a path that understands our first responsibility is to \nnurture and strengthen and protect this country of ours and to do what \nwe think is necessary to give our kids opportunities. We need to leave \nthis place better than the way we found it. And that is not what is \ngoing to happen unless we change course.\n  So I am on the floor of the Senate, not to preach but just to try to \nplay a role in seeing if we cannot finally make a U-turn on these \nissues and head in the right direction, in a direction that says to our \ntrading partners--China, Korea, Africa, South America, CAFTA, Central \nAmerica--it says to them: Yes, we care about this. We want to help you. \nWe want to work with you. But we do not want to do that at the expense \nof taking the American economy apart. We do not want to do that at the \nexpense of saying to American families: We are busy helping somebody \nelse down there, and so we do not have time to worry about your job.\n  If this country says to the people who make bicycles, ``You are paid \nway too much. You are paid $11 an hour plus benefits. We cannot afford \nthat. Those jobs go to China,'' there is destined, in my judgment, to \nbe nothing but hopelessness for those who come after us. I do not \nbelieve we can allow that to be the case.\n  I started by saying John Adams used to write back to his wife, when \nhe was helping put this great country together, and asked her \nplaintively: Where is the leadership? Who will be the leaders? Where \nwill the leadership come from in this country? And the answer in every \ngeneration in America has been to provide that leadership. And that \nquestion is a loud question in this country, again. It begs for an \nanswer. Who will be the leaders? Where will the leadership come from to \nput this country back on track, to put its economy back on track, so 5 \nyears, 10 years, and 25 years from now we can see something that gives \nus some confidence and some faith this is going to be a better place \nfor our children.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the \nfloor.\n\n\n     U.S.-Dominican Republic, Central American Free Trade Agreement\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the U.S.-Dominican \nRepublic, Central American-Free Trade\n\n[[Page S7720]]\n\nAgreement, CAFTA. I support free trade when it is fair trade. Yet this \nagreement is not fair for workers in America or in Central America.\n  The truth is, this agreement will not dramatically change the trade \nrelationship between the United States and our neighbors in Central \nAmerica.\n  Thanks to existing agreements, like the Caribbean Basin Initiative, \nthere are relatively few trade restrictions today between the U.S. and \nthe nations of CAFTA.\n  The small increases in trade of textiles and agriculture products \nthat will result under CAFTA represent a very modest increase in U.S. \nrevenue. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, CAFTA \nwill generate a net increase in U.S. revenues of just 0.01 percent per \nyear.\n  So this agreement is not going to do much to help the American \neconomy. But it contains provisions on labor, the environment and sugar \nthat could harm America's working men and women and their families.\n  I think we have widespread agreement that workers in the CAFTA \ncountries face very difficult conditions.\n  In most countries, workers have a very hard time trying to unionize \nand bargain collectively. Intimidation of union organizers is not \nunusual. It often goes unpunished.\n  There is even a significant amount of child labor in some sectors in \nthese countries.\n  So CAFTA is a prime example of a trade agreement that must have \nstrong labor provisions if it is to guarantee trade that is not just \nfree, but fair.\n  But there is only one labor provision in this agreement that is \nenforceable through the regular dispute settlement procedures, and it \nis a weak one.\n  It does nothing more than require a country to enforce its own trade \nlaws, no matter how weak. And if a company is found in violation of its \nnational trade laws, the government pays the fine--not the company.\n  That is not much incentive to encourage employers to abide by the law \nand treat their workers with respect and dignity.\n  Let me be very clear about one thing. I support trade. I encourage \ntrade. Trade is very important to my State. Maryland workers can \ncompete successfully in a global marketplace, if they're given a level \nplaying field. That's why I support expansion of fair trade.\n  I have supported past trade agreements, like the Jordan Free Trade \nAgreement, that included strong, enforceable labor provisions. This \nagreement does not live up to those standards.\n  CAFTA's weak labor provisions are a raw deal for American workers.\n  They send a terrible message to the men and women in CAFTA nations \nwho are trying to earn a fair wage to support their families.\n  Our message to them is, we want to do business with the companies you \nwork for, but we aren't concerned about how they treat you. That's not \nthe message I want to send to our neighbors.\n  On the environment, we also face some serious challenges in the CAFTA \ncountries.\n  As with the labor provisions, the environmental provisions in CAFTA \nare too weak. The one enforceable environmental provision simply \nrequires countries to ``effectively enforce'' their own environmental \nlaws.\n  Again, I believe in free trade that is fair trade. And fair trade \nmust include environmental protections. We need strong, enforceable \nenvironmental provisions to protect American jobs. We also need them to \nensure that our neighbors have access to the same clean air and safe \ndrinking water that we enjoy.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I am very concerned that CAFTA unfairly \nexposes the American sugar industry without opening other markets for \nU.S. sugar.\n  Even the administration recognizes that CAFTA as it was negotiated \nwill unfairly target our sugar industry. That is why they have come up \nwith a complicated scheme to pay CAFTA-nation governments and sugar \nproducers not to export sugar to America.\n  But this deal is no deal for the men and women of America's sugar \nindustry. And it is no deal for the American taxpayer who, under this \nplan, would pay between $150 million and $200 million a year to foreign \ngovernments and companies.\n  It makes no sense to negotiate an agreement that opens U.S. markets \nto foreign sugar and then pay foreign producers not to take advantage \nof that agreement.\n  Even this flawed plan would not do enough to protect the U.S. sugar \nindustry from unfair trade. It would expire after just two years, \nexposing the U.S. market to cheap, low quality imports.\n  And it does nothing to open large, protected sugar markets in Europe \nthat remain closed to U.S. sugar exports.\n  I support the idea of developing stronger ties between the U.S. and \nour neighbors in Central America.\n  These nations have made great strides toward democracy and openness. \nWe should work more closely with them to support their recent gains in \nthe rule of law and efforts to fight terrorism, organized crime and \ndrug trafficking.\n  But this trade agreement is seriously flawed. It does not do much to \nincrease free trade, and it certainly does nothing to support fair \ntrade. It is not fair to American workers and their families, and it is \nnot fair to workers in Central America. I will vote no, against CAFTA.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I cannot in good conscience support the \nCAFTA agreement as proposed by the Administration. I reviewed this \nagreement carefully and evaluated the arguments of both sides. Exports \nplay a central role in the economy of my home State of Vermont, where \nsome of the finest specialized goods in the world are made, from \ncomputer chips to cheese. Free and fair trade benefits us as \nVermonters, and it benefits the country. I have often voted in favor of \nvarious trade agreements, including NAFTA and recent bilateral trade \naccords with Jordan, Singapore, and Chile.\n  I strongly believe free trade and the agreements that facilitate it \nwill be critical to the well being of my State and our country in the \nyears ahead. But we have a responsibility to ourselves and those we \ntrade with to make sure these agreements are soundly predicated, are \nfair to both sides, are constructed to advance the interests of the \nmany and not just a few, and that they will protect the environment \nupon which we all ultimately depend. I do not believe this trade \nagreement adequately meets these tests, and I cannot in good conscience \nvote for CAFTA.\n  I have great respect for some of Central America's leaders who favor \nthis agreement. I know they have the interests of their countries at \nheart. But I believe they overstate the positive effects this agreement \nwould have and give too little weight to negative effects. The weak \nlabor and environmental provisions of this agreement will do little to \nhelp the hardworking men and women of Latin America, and in fact may \nmake their already difficult lives even harder and more dangerous.\n  I also believe that this agreement is a diversion from the larger \ntrade issues that will make a real difference for the long-term health \nof our own economy. This deal should be carefully and conscientiously \nre-negotiated to adequately address these pressing concerns.\n  There has been a lot of ink spilled from the administration and from \ngroups representing particular interests arguing that CAFTA will be a \nsignificant boost to the U.S. economy. When you are talking about \nCentral American economies that have a combined gross domestic product \nof a medium-sized U.S. city, this argument just does not carry weight. \nYes, U.S. consumers might be able to buy some Central American exports \nat a cheaper price. And, yes, U.S. manufacturers might gain greater \naccess to these markets. But these countries are so small that the \nimpact on the U.S. economy will be negligible. For instance, this \nagreement would help the dairy producers in my home State of Vermont \nonly marginally, at the very best.\n  We all know that when we talk about trade, what makes a real \ndifference for the economy is trade with our larger trading partners--\nEurope, the NAFTA countries of Canada and Mexico, several Far East \nAsian countries--but, above all, China. Yet we have an enormous trade \ndeficit with China today\n\n[[Page S7721]]\n\nthat threatens interest rates and the strength of the dollar.\n  China has maintained an artificially low exchange rate, removed \nvoluntary export quotas, and continually infringed on international \npatents and copyrights. It does not seem that this administration has \nany strategy for dealing with these unfair trade practices, let alone \nwith the fact that China's GDP is growing at almost 10 percent every \nyear and will challenge us economically in the decades ahead. It is a \nwonder to me that the administration is seeking trade agreements that \nare not part of a comprehensive strategy to deal with this kind of \ncontinually escalating foreign competition.\n  While this agreement will not make much difference for our economy, \nit is likely to have significant negative impacts on the countries of \nCentral America, and we should be concerned for the people of those \nimpoverished countries. Over the past several decades, dictatorships, \ncivil wars and fierce class struggles have buffeted the region, \nparticularly during the Cold War when the larger geopolitical \nstruggle--in which we were a central player--exploited and heightened \nthese local tensions. These countries have set out on a new, democratic \npath over the past year, and our foreign policy should encourage these \nfavorable developments. Unfortunately, the weak labor and environmental \nlaws of these countries and the complete failure of this agreement to \nelevate and strengthen those standards ensures that any growth that \nrises out of the agreement is unlikely to translate into significant \nreal gains for everyday workers and the broader population.\n  Under CAFTA, participating countries are only forced to abide by \ntheir own often weak and rarely enforced labor laws. Sadly, an \noligarchic culture persists in these countries, whereby wealthy \nbusiness and landowners rarely trickle down profits to the hardworking \nmen and women who do the work. Without stronger labor provisions that \nprovide increased benefits and protections to workers, CAFTA will do \nlittle to change that culture.\n  A recent World Bank report on the agreement found that Central \nAmerican countries will have to boost spending for schools and rural \ninfrastructure to take full advantage of the agreement's benefits. \nThose investments are not realistically forthcoming, and this \nadministration has not shown a serious commitment to supporting this \ntype of development in those nations to make up the difference. This is \na lost opportunity. At the same time, CAFTA will displace poor \nsubsistence farmers who will abandon their land and follow in the \nfootsteps of those who have come illegally to the United States in \nsearch of employment. And CAFTA will contribute to ongoing \nenvironmental problems associated with manufacturing and the pesticides \nused in large-scale agriculture.\n  I urge the President to send his trade negotiating team back down to \nCentral America to rework this deal. We need a better agreement that \nreaches the so-called Jordan Standard, including the strong labor and \nenvironmental provisions of the United States-Jordan Bilateral Free \nTrade Agreement that we ratified a few years ago.\n  More importantly, I hope the President will deal with the mounting \npile of economic and trade problems that really do have profound \nconsequences to our economy and the living standards of the American \npeople. Let's come up with a broader approach to trade that addresses \nunfair trading practices, that reduces our ballooning trade deficit, \nthat boosts our economy, and that protects the environment and the \nrights of workers. I look forward to working with this or any other \nadministration on these challenges. I cannot cast a vote for an \nagreement like this that over-promises and under-delivers to the \nworkers of our own country and to the people of Central America.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong opposition \nto the CAFTA implementing legislation before us today. Unlike NAFTA, \nCAFTA won't encourage the migration of a large number of manufacturing \njobs out of the country or significant worsen our already terrible \ntrade deficit; CAFTA countries only account for 1.5 percent of total \nU.S. trade. And unlike the U.S.-Australia free trade agreement which \nput my State's dairy farmers at a competitive disadvantage, CAFTA harms \nmost industries like sugar and textiles that do not have a large \npresence in Wisconsin.\n  But there are bigger reasons to reject CAFTA today--reasons that \napply across all regions of the country and should convince all \nSenators. We should reject CAFTA because it makes equal trading \npartners out of countries with labor and environmental standards far \nbelow those in the United States. Instead of using our negotiating \npower with these countries to lock in improvements in these standards, \nCAFTA establishes rules on workers' rights that take a step backward \nfrom the labor conditions that exist in current trade programs with \nCentral America.\n  When we make deals like CAFTA, we do more than give up jobs to low-\nwage countries. When we make deals like CAFTA, we accept and encourage \na global economy where workers' rights, living wages, and humane \ntreatment are an anachronism. When we make deals like CAFTA, we tell \nU.S. businesses that the tough environmental standards they live by--\nand pay for--are not necessary for their overseas competitors. Why does \nthe continuing flow of jobs moving overseas surprise us given this \nmessage--a message sent by our top trade officials and negotiators?\n  In a region where labor laws fall far short of minimum international \nstandards and where workers are routinely intimidated, fired, and \nthreatened for trying to exercise their most basic rights on the job, \nCAFTA's move backwards on workers' rights is unacceptable. As a \nbusinessman, I understand that trade agreements that open markets can \nbe good for the economy--but not if they do so by accepting as the \nglobal norm the least common denominator in labor and environmental \nstandards.\n  The administration has agreed to support $40 million per year from \nfiscal year 2006 to fiscal year 2009 to aid CAFTA countries with their \nlabor and environmental protection programs and an additional $30 \nmillion per year over the same period to assist farmers in CAFTA \ncountries who may be displaced by the expected increase of agricultural \nimports from the U.S. Mr. President, I am in favor of opening \ninternational markets for U.S. goods, but why do we need to spend $190 \nmillion over 3 years to have countries trade with us? Wouldn't it have \nbeen easier to have CAFTA countries work with the International Labor \nOrganization to develop the capacity to monitor and enforce labor and \nenvironmental protections?\n  At a time when the trade deficit keeps rising--$655 billion in fiscal \nyear 2004 up from $530 billion in fiscal year 2003--and the Federal \ndeficit is at an all-time high, the U.S. needs to negotiate free-trade \nagreements where both sides play by the same rules. When I meet with \nconstituents and the conversation turns to trade or jobs, the topic of \nChina inevitably comes up and I am asked what we are going to do about \nChina. Mr. President, what are we going to do about China? I certainly \nhave trouble trusting those who negotiated CAFTA to work out the answer \nto that dilemma--an answer that will have a much larger and more direct \nimpact on our economy.\n  We cannot remain competitive with countries that pay their workers \nnext to nothing, have no labor or environmental standards, and who \noffer their employees little or no health care. Yet we are considering \na trade agreement right now that asks us to do just that. And though \nthe CAFTA countries are not large enough to impact our economy \nsignificantly, the precedent set by agreements like CAFTA--and the \nattitude among our trade negotiators that CAFTA reveals--will. We are \nthe strongest economy in the world and can and should be able to \ncompete and prosper in a global marketplace. But we will not if we \ncontinue to sign up for trade agreements that allow other countries to \nundercut us by producing goods using underpaid, abused labor and \nunacceptable environmental practices. I urge my colleagues to reject \nCAFTA--and reject the misguided, eventually disastrous trade policy it \nrepresents.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am a long-time supporter of free trade \nagreements because I believe free trade agreements can be beneficial to \neveryone. Free trade agreements have a positive impact on the job \nmarket and the economy.\n\n[[Page S7722]]\n\n  I have spent many hours listening to this body debate the Dominican \nRepublic-Central American-United States Free Trade Agreement (DR-\nCAFTA). Upon careful consideration of the issues at stake in this \nimportant economic measure, I have come to the conclusion that the \nratification of DR-CAFTA will result in the growth of our national \neconomy. Additionally, DR-CAFTA's passage will represent an enormous \nstep towards increased prosperity in Central America.\n  The reasons to support DR-CAFTA are numerous. The measure is \nfavorable to our Nation's export market. DR-CAFTA countries currently \nmake up the twelfth largest market for U.S. exports, with those \ncountries purchasing more than $15.1 billion in U.S. exports in 2003. I \nbelieve we should do what we can to foster additional growth in that \nmarket. Passage of DR-CAFTA will do just that. In addition, DR-CAFTA is \nfavorable to our country's textile suppliers. Passage of this bill will \nput our suppliers on a level playing field with their counterparts in \nAsia.\n  I believe that the argument that DR-CAFTA will represent an exodus of \njobs and dollars to Central America is unfounded. Under the status quo, \n80 percent of all imports from Central America and 99 percent of \nagricultural imports from Central America enter the United States duty \nfree. In contrast, many American farmers suffer from the burden of \ntariffs ranging from approximately 7 percent in the case of Nicaragua \nto 23 percent for certain products from the Dominican Republic. \nCreating a more equitable duty system for agricultural imports and \nexports is important to my home State of New Mexico, which is heavily \ninvolved in the agricultural industry.\n  This agreement is also important to New Mexico because an estimated \n$234 million worth of products, many of them semi-conductors and \nelectronics, were exported from New Mexico to DR-CAFTA countries in \n2004. This ranked New Mexico thirteenth among U.S. States exporting \ngoods to CAFTA countries. Clearly, my home State will benefit from a \nfree trade agreement with these Central American countries.\n  DR-CAFTA is important to our country. It is a pro-export, pro-worker, \npro-agriculture, pro-economy trade agreement, and I appreciate the \nefforts of the administration and our trade negotiators in crafting \nsuch an agreement. I am proud to vote in favor of DR-CAFTA.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nCentral American Free Trade Agreement. CAFTA will be one of the most \nimportant pieces of legislation considered by the Congress this year. \nPassage of CAFTA means increased markets for our agricultural products \nand manufactured goods to the nations of Central America--Costa Rica, \nEl Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua--and the Dominican \nRepublic. Already, 47,000 Nebraska jobs are supported by exports of \nfarm products. CAFTA means more of these jobs across the United States.\n  Passing CAFTA will further open new markets for beef, corn, soybeans \nand other products by lowering and eliminating tariffs on U.S. goods in \nCAFTA countries. Currently, U.S. goods exported to CAFTA countries face \nsignificant tariffs. Despite these tariffs, the U.S. exports more than \n$15 billion to CAFTA countries every year. Nebraska exported over $19.5 \nmillion worth of goods to CAFTA countries in 2004, according to the \nDepartment of Commerce. With these tariffs eliminated, this region \nprovides significant potential for States like Nebraska which depend on \nour ability to export our products. The Office of the United States \nTrade Representative views Central America as a larger market for U.S. \nproducts than India, Indonesia, and Russia combined.\n  All previous trade agreements have benefitted the United States \neconomy. Since the North American Free Trade Agreement was signed in \n1993, trade among NAFTA nations rose 150 percent. Nebraska's combined \nexports to Canada and Mexico have increased by more than 160 percent. \nIn the first year of the U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement, U.S. exports \nto Chile grew 33.5 percent.\n  There are those who have argued that there is a danger to the U.S. \nsugar industry if CAFTA is passed into law. They are worried about \nsugar from the Dominican Republic and Central America crowding out \ndomestically produced U.S. sugar. These fears, while understandable, \ndon't hold up against the facts. Under the current U.S. Farm Bill, \nCongress set an import ceiling of about 1.4 million metric tons of \nsugar. The domestic sugar program is unaffected when imports are below \nthis limit. Currently, the U.S. is not close to exceeding that ceiling. \nAccording to the U.S. Trade Representative, in the first year of the \nagreement, increased access to the U.S. sugar market will be equal to \nlittle more than one day's sugar production in the United States.\n  CAFTA has stronger protections for workers than any other Free Trade \nAgreement. It has a three-part strategy that will ensure effective \nenforcement of domestic labor laws, establish a cooperative program to \nimprove enforcement of domestic labor laws, and enhance the ability of \nCentral American governments to monitor and enforce labor rights.\n  Trade is an opportunity, not a guarantee. CAFTA is supported by over \n50 agricultural industry and farm groups, including the Nebraska Farm \nBureau and the Nebraska Corn Growers.\n  Ultimately, the argument for CAFTA is not about numbers on a page or \nstatistics, it is about American families and communities that need the \nopportunities provided by these markets to grow and remain competitive. \nCAFTA is good for the United States. I urge my colleagues to vote for \nthis trade agreement.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am opposed to and will vote against the \nCentral America Free Trade Agreement, CAFTA.\n  I am not against trade agreements, provided they are fair. But when \nthose agreements unfairly disadvantage American workers and businesses, \nI oppose them.\n  I could vote for CAFTA if it meant more jobs in America and a \nstronger American economy. But, I do not believe that is the case. \nBecause of CAFTA, Americans will lose jobs and manufacturing will move \noverseas.\n  CAFTA will not foster free trade; it will result in unfair \ncompetition. Most of the Central American governments are notoriously \nlax in enforcing their labor laws. Under CAFTA, the Central American \ncountries pledge to enforce their labor laws and strive to ensure \nworkers' rights are protected, but these are merely ``paper pledges.'' \nMoreover, unlike other trade agreements, the mechanisms for forcing the \nCentral American governments to enforce their own labor laws are \nlimited and the penalties for noncompliance are negligible. Worse \nstill, nothing in CAFTA prohibits a country from further relaxing its \nexisting laws.\n  In addition, most Central American countries do not have strong \nenvironmental protection laws, and enforcement of the laws that do \nexist is limited. Companies are permitted to destroy the environment \nand harm their workers in order to produce cheaper products for export.\n  U.S. manufacturers and workers are the best in the world. Their \nproductivity and innovation cannot be matched. But even they cannot--\nnor should they have to--compete with foreign companies that have weak \nlabor protections and that ignore the environment in order to cut \nprices.\n  After careful consideration, I have come to the conclusion that CAFTA \nwill result in American workers losing their jobs, U.S. companies \nclosing their doors, a downward pressure on wages, and a worsening \ntrade deficit.\n  For these reasons, I cannot support CAFTA and will vote against it.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to express my support for the Central \nAmerica Free Trade Agreement, which is not just important for job \ncreation and business opportunities in Arizona, but for the economic \nand political futures of five Central American countries and the \nDominican Republic, all of which are eagerly awaiting the passage of \nthis trade agreement. CAFTA will enhance both economic and political \nties between Central America and the United States. It will also help \npromote freedom and democracy in our own Hemisphere.\n  The United States exports $15 billion annually to the CAFTA-DR \ncountries--El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and \nthe Dominican Republic. This is more than our\n\n[[Page S7723]]\n\nexports to Russia, India, and Indonesia combined. In my home State of \nArizona, our top agricultural exports to the region are beef, \nvegetables, and cotton. We also exported more than $208.9 million in \nmanufactured goods to CAFTA countries. The American Farm Bureau \nestimates that CAFTA will increase farm exports from Arizona to CAFTA \ncountries by $8 million per year for beef, $1 million per year for \nvegetables, and $800 thousand per year for cotton, part of a total \nfuture annual increase of $12.14 million in agricultural exports over \nthe anticipated pre-CAFTA growth level. The total national increase in \nagricultural products to CAFTA countries is estimated at over $1.5 \nbillion, and manufacturing exports nationwide will increase \ndramatically as well, which is great for Arizona where 25 percent of \nthe manufacturing jobs depend on exports. CAFTA will also reduce the \nU.S. trade deficit by $756 million.\n  While the U.S. economy has been growing steadily over the past 2 \nyears, creating record numbers of new jobs, we can expect even more \ngrowth with the passage of CAFTA. That, in turn, will foster the growth \nof Central American economies. Take, for example, the textile industry \nin the Central-America region. The CAFTA countries are the largest \nconsumers of U.S. apparel and yarn exports, and the second largest \nconsumers of U.S. fabric exports. 11,000 Arizonan jobs are supported by \nthe textile industry, and approximately 700,000 Americans are employed \nin the yarn and textile sectors. The yarn and fabric we create and \nexport to Central America and the Dominican Republic support another \n500,000 jobs in the apparel sector in those countries. By working \ntogether, the United States and CAFTA countries can more efficiently \ncompete with large textile markets such as those in the Asia region. \nWith the expiration in 2004 of global multi-fiber quotas in effect \nsince the 1970s on textiles and apparel, regional producers face a new \ncompetitive challenge from Asian imports. CAFTA would provide regional \ngarment-makers--and their U.S. or regional suppliers of fabric and \nyarn--a critical advantage in competing with Asia.\n  Many Arizona farmers and businessmen are excited about the economic \ngrowth CAFTA will bring them. There is also just as much excitement in \nCentral American countries. I have been to El Salvador and I can tell \nyou that people there are looking to the United States to pass CAFTA to \ngive them better opportunities and a higher standard of living. They \nhave hope that their country's economy will see dramatic growth, \nincreasing jobs and the wages that those jobs pay. Without CAFTA, they \nfear that jobs once performed by El Salvadorian workers will be moved \nto Asia.\n  CAFTA gives El Salvadorians hope for a better economic future, which \nmeans a more stable and peaceful future, through rising wages, \ndecreasing unemployment rates, and more affordable basic commodities. \nThis will raise the standards of living in El Salvador, as well as the \nother countries in this region. The President of El Salvador has said \nthat CAFTA matters most to his country because it will strengthen the \nfoundations of democracy by promoting economic growth, providing a \nsolution to the persistent problem of poverty, and creating equality of \nopportunity. And by addressing the underlying problems of poverty and \nunequal economic opportunities, CAFTA will help stem the tide of \nthousands of Central Americans who leave their homes seeking a better \nlife in neighboring countries to the north. CAFTA will help Central \nAmericans to earn better livings and successfully support their \nfamilies in their home countries.\n  Economic growth fosters stability and peace throughout this region. \nTo strengthen democracy in the region, its people need to see concrete \nbenefits from economic freedom--tangible improvements in their daily \nlife. When a middle class develops and people have a larger economic \nstake in their society, they demand more of a say in how that society \nis run. This is critical for a region's democratic success.\n  We can be instrumental in the region's democratic, as well as \neconomic, success by passing CAFTA now. If we fail to pass CAFTA, \nAmerica will be turning its back on the hopes and dreams of our \nsouthern neighbors.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the \nRepublican Policy Committee's recent policy paper, ``The U.S.-Dominican \nRepublic-Central American Free Trade Agreement is a Win-Win.'' This \npaper goes into further detail as to why the CAFTA agreement is in \nAmerica's interest.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed, as \nfollows:\n\n United States-Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement \n                              Is a Win-Win\n\n\n                           executive summary\n\n       Congress should soon pass the United States-Dominican \n     Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA). \n     This important agreement expands market access for U.S. \n     exporters of manufactured goods, agriculture products, and \n     services.\n       On February 20, 2004, President Bush notified Congress of \n     his intent to enter into a free trade agreement with the \n     Central American nations of Costa Rica, El Salvador, \n     Honduras, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. The Dominican Republic \n     became a party to CAFTA on August 5, 2004.\n       The Central American markets are significant to the \n     American economy: the DR-CAFTA countries constitute our 12th \n     largest export market with a consumer base of nearly 44 \n     million.\n       Passage of DR-CAFTA is vital to the economic and security \n     interests of both the United States and the DR-CAFTA \n     countries, and it will demonstrate the U.S. commitment to \n     foster economic prosperity in the region. It will serve to \n     nurture democracy, transparency, and respect for the rule of \n     law in a region that, only decades ago, was marked by \n     internal strife.\n       Commonly heard arguments against DR-CAFTA include concern \n     that U.S. sugar producers will be adversely affected, that \n     American textile jobs will be lost, and that Central American \n     workers' rights and the environment will be harmed.\n       The Bush Administration counters that passage of this \n     agreement is a win-win for all parties and that it will \n     preserve the U.S. sugar program, level the playing field for \n     U.S. workers, strengthen freedom and democracy in the region, \n     enable U.S. textile suppliers to compete with Asia, and \n     enhance the enforcement of labor and environmental laws in \n     the region.\n       Among the significant consequences of failing to pass the \n     DR-CAFTA would be: (1) a message that the U.S. is not \n     committed to open market principles; (2) the continuation of \n     high tariff barriers on U.S. exports to the region; and (3) \n     the loss of an important export market for numerous U.S. \n     suppliers of cotton, yarns, and fabrics.\n       This paper addresses concerns expressed about the agreement \n     and highlight the broad support DR-CAFTA is receiving from \n     many different sectors of the U.S. economy.\n\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       Congress will soon consider whether to pass the United \n     States-Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade \n     Agreement (DR-CAFTA). This important agreement builds on \n     other recent trade agreements by substantially expanding \n     market access for U.S. exporters of manufactured goods, \n     agriculture products, and services. In fact, DR-CAFTA will \n     level the playing field with our southern neighbors by \n     providing reciprocal access for U.S. businesses to the \n     markets of Central America and the Dominican Republic, which \n     already enjoy liberal access to the U.S. market.\n       On February 20, 2004, President Bush notified Congress of \n     his intent to enter into a free trade agreement with the \n     Central American nations of Costa Rica, El Salvador, \n     Honduras, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. [Text of a letter from \n     the President to the Speaker of the House of Representatives \n     and the President of the Senate, February 20, 2004.] On May \n     28, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick fulfilled the \n     President's pledge and signed the U.S.-Central America Free \n     Trade Agreement. The Dominican Republic became a party to \n     CAFTA on August 5, 2004.\n       The United States has much to gain from this agreement \n     because the Central American markets are significant to the \n     American economy. The DR-CAFTA countries constitute our 12th \n     largest export market with a consumer base of nearly 44 \n     million. [U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), ``U.S.-\n     Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement: \n     Potential Economy-wide and Selected Sectoral Effects,'' \n     August 2004.] Nearly 80 percent of Central American products \n     already enter the United States duty-free due to unilateral \n     preference programs such as the Caribbean Basin Initiative \n     and the Generalized System of Preferences. CAFTA will \n     eliminate these one-way barriers and provide reciprocal free \n     trade. The Agreement will also provide a chance to unite with \n     customers in the region to better compete against China, \n     especially in apparel and textiles.\n       The DR-CAFTA agreement will also serve to nurture \n     democracy, transparency, and respect for the rule of law, in \n     a region which only decades ago was marked by internal \n     strife. Today the Central American nations and the Dominican \n     Republic are democracies wanting to strengthen economic ties \n     which will in turn reinforce their progress in political and \n     social reform. Passage of DR-CAFTA is, thus, vital to the \n     economic and security interests of both the United States\n\n[[Page S7724]]\n\n     and the DR-CAFTA countries, and it will demonstrate the U.S. \n     commitment to foster economic prosperity in the region.\n       Despite the great appeal of this agreement to many sectors \n     of the American economy, there are some groups that remain \n     opposed to it. Commonly heard arguments against DR-CAFTA \n     include concern that U.S. sugar producers will be adversely \n     affected, that American textile jobs will be lost, and that \n     Central American workers' rights and the environment will be \n     harmed. [Representative Hilda Solis (D-CA), Congressional \n     Record, March 1, 2005; Representative Sherrod Brown (D-OH), \n     Congressional Record, March 2, 2005.] The Bush Administration \n     counters that passage of this agreement is a win-win for the \n     United States, the Dominican Republic, and Central America \n     that will preserve the U.S. sugar program, level the playing \n     field for U.S. workers, strengthen freedom and democracy in \n     the region, enable U.S. textile suppliers to compete with \n     Asia, and enhance the enforcement of labor and environmental \n     laws in the region. [Office of the U.S. Trade Representative \n     (USTR), ``DR-CAFTA Facts: The Case for DR-CAFTA,'' February \n     2005.]\n       This paper will examine the benefits of DR-CAFTA for the \n     United States, the Dominican Republic, and Central America. \n     This paper will also address concerns expressed about the \n     agreement and highlight the broad support DR-CAFTA is \n     receiving from many different sectors of the U.S. economy. \n     And, it will review the consequences to the United States, \n     the Dominican Republic, and Central America if Congress \n     should fail to pass the trade agreement.\n\n    Why DR-CAFTA is a Win-Win for the United States, the Dominican \n                     Republic, and Central America\n\n\n  Economic Benefits--leveling the playing field for American exporters\n\n       The DR-CAFTA market provides a large export market for the \n     United States. As an integrated market, Central America, and \n     the Dominican Republic purchased more than $15.1 billion in \n     U.S. exports in 2003. [USTR, ``Trade Facts: Free Trade with \n     Central America, Summary of the U.S.-Central America Free \n     Trade Agreement,'' December 17, 2003.] By tearing down tariff \n     barriers, American workers will be able to gain better access \n     to the 44 million consumers living in the Dominican Republic \n     and Central America. Moreover, population in this region is \n     expected to grow by almost 20 percent by 2015, thus adding \n     nearly 10 million new consumers to the marketplace. \n     [Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social \n     Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat, World Population \n     Prospects: The 2004 Revision and World Urbanization \n     Prospects: The 2003 Revision.]\n       While the DR-CAFTA countries buy many goods and services \n     from the United States, it is economically important to the \n     U.S. economy to level the playing field on trade between the \n     United States, the Dominican Republic, and Central America. \n     Due to trade preference programs currently in place, 80 \n     percent of all Central American goods currently enter the \n     United States duty-free, while the average tariff imposed on \n     U.S. exports to Central America is between 7 and 9 percent. \n     [Chris Padilla, ``DR-CAFTA: A Vote for Freedom, Democracy, \n     Reform,'' Textile News, February 28, 2005.] Some tariffs on \n     many farm goods are as high as 16 percent. [USTR, ``DR-CAFTA \n     Facts: CAFTA Levels the Playing Field,'' February 2005.] \n     These high tariffs hurt our ability to export to and compete \n     in the growing markets of the Dominican Republic and Central \n     America. In addition, U.S. exporters face numerous non-tariff \n     barriers that currently inhibit their ability to export goods \n     and services to the region.\n       Upon full implementation of DR-CAFTA, U.S. products will \n     enter the Dominican Republic and Central America duty-free. \n     In fact, 80 percent of consumer and industrial goods exports \n     are immediately duty-free upon enactment of the agreement, \n     with the remaining 20 percent becoming duty-free over 10 \n     years. Key U.S. export sectors will benefit including medical \n     and scientific equipment, information technology products, \n     construction equipment, and paper products.\n       The agreement will expand markets as well for U.S. \n     agriculture. Currently, U.S. tariff barriers to agricultural \n     exports from DR-CAFTA countries are much lower than tariffs \n     faced by U.S. agricultural exports to DR-CAFTA countries. \n     [USTR, ``DR-CAFTA Facts: CAFTA Levels the Playing Field,'' \n     February 2005.] According to the USTR, more than half of \n     current U.S. farm exports to Central America will become \n     duty-free immediately, including cotton, wheat, soybeans, \n     fruits and vegetables, high-quality cuts of beef, \n     processed food products, and wine. Tariffs on remaining \n     farm items will be phased out over 15 years. [USTR, \n     ``Trade Facts: Free Trade with Central America, Highlights \n     of the U.S.-Central America Free Trade Agreement,'' \n     January 27, 2004.] On May 28, 2004, the American Farm \n     Bureau Federation (AFBF), a national organization \n     representing U.S. farmers and ranchers across the country, \n     stated that the ``U.S.-Central American Free Trade \n     Agreement will provide a substantial competitive advantage \n     to U.S. agriculture,'' and that the Bush administration \n     has ``opened up promising trade potential for the whole of \n     U.S. agriculture.'' [Statement by Bob Stallman, President \n     of the American Farm Bureau Federation regarding the \n     signing of the U.S.-Central American Free Trade Agreement, \n     May 28, 2004.] It estimates that U.S. agricultural \n     producers will increase their exports by $900 million as a \n     result of the DR-CAFTA agreement.\n       In the area of services, the DR-CAFTA countries will accord \n     substantial market access across their entire services \n     regime, offering new access in sectors such as \n     telecommunications, computer services, tourism, financial \n     services, insurance, and entertainment among others. The \n     agreement also provides state-of-the-art protections and non-\n     discriminatory treatment for digital products such as U.S. \n     software, music, text, and videos. Protections for U.S. \n     patents and trademarks are strengthened.\n       The benefits of DR-CAFTA will be numerous. In its analysis \n     of DR-CAFTA implementation, the U.S. International Trade \n     Commission (ITC) found the effect of trade facilitation would \n     likely ``benefit U.S. producers, exports, service providers, \n     and investors.'' [ITC, 2004.] The USITC noted that, ``after \n     tariff liberalization has been fully implemented and all \n     economic adjustments have occurred under the FTA, overall \n     U.S. welfare is likely to increase in the range of $135.31 \n     million to $248.17 million.'' [ITC, 2004.] U.S. exports to \n     DR-CAFTA countries are likely to increase by $2.7 billion (or \n     15 percent), and U.S. imports are likely to increase by $2.8 \n     billion (or by 12 percent). [ITC, 2004.]\n       DR-CAFTA also provides an atmosphere and, more importantly, \n     a legal framework for guaranteeing the security of American \n     investment in Central America. As noted by some policy \n     analysts: ``By locking in these liberal economic policies, \n     [DR-CAFTA] offers investors certainty that policies will not \n     suddenly reverse--a key component in investment decisions.'' \n     [Brett D. Schaefer and Stephen Johnson, ``Backgrounder #1822: \n     Congress Should Support Free Trade with Central America and \n     the Dominican Republic,'' The Heritage Foundation, February \n     8, 2005.] An open and transparent legal framework will \n     encourage investment and economic growth in a region of the \n     world that needs foreign capital to grow its economy and \n     create jobs.\n\n\n            Political benefits--promoting regional stability\n\n       In the 1970s, every Central American country except Costa \n     Rica and Belize were ruled by military dictators. Lack of \n     democracy and lack of economic opportunity led to communist \n     insurgencies in many parts of the region that were only \n     defeated with the support of the United States. [Ed Greser, \n     Progressive Policy Institute Policy Report, ``DR-CAFTA: The \n     United States and Central America 10 Years After the Wars,'' \n     October 2003.] Today, democracy flourishes in the region. \n     People can freely choose their elected leaders. Through free-\n     market economic reforms and U.S. trade preference programs, \n     workers' wages are now on the rise and the standard of living \n     throughout the region has generally improved. Many observers \n     agree that DR-CAFTA will help lock recent political and \n     economic gains into place by bolstering transparency and the \n     rule of law, thereby attracting additional investment which \n     will help to foster continued growth and stability in the \n     region. [See, e.g., The Los Angeles Times, editorial, \n     November 18, 2004; USTR, ``DR-CAFTA Facts: Emphatically \n     Yes,'' February 2005; Stuart E. Eizenstat and David Marchick, \n     ``Trade Wins,'' Wall Street Journal, March 8, 2005.]\n       Twenty years ago, trade between Central America and the \n     United States was minimal. In 1984, trade between the U.S. \n     and CAFTA countries totaled $798 million compared to $3.6 \n     billion in 2003--an increase of nearly 350 percent. \n     [Statistical data provided by USTR.] During the past few \n     years, significant progress has been made in Central American \n     economic integration, including a May 2000 free trade \n     agreement between Mexico and El Salvador, Guatemala, and \n     Honduras. In December 2001, an agreement was signed to \n     interconnect the electricity networks of the Central American \n     countries, allowing for regional power trading among the \n     member states beginning in 2006. [U.S. Department of Energy, \n     Energy Information Administration, ``Regional Indicators: \n     Central America,'' September 2004.] The integration of \n     electricity grids is only one of several initiatives by the \n     Inter-American Development Bank's Puebla-Panama Plan, which \n     seeks to promote regional development and integration of \n     Central American countries. [U.S. Department of Energy, \n     2004.]\n       Public opinion throughout Central America finds that people \n     want to have a strong trading relationship with the United \n     States and want to see DR-CAFTA enacted. According to recent \n     State Department polling, the opinion pattern throughout the \n     region shows that, in most of the CAFTA countries, half of \n     those polled are aware of the trade agreement (up from about \n     a third in 2002-2003). Among those, a majority perceive \n     benefits for their country (e.g., 57 percent in D.R.; 56 \n     percent in Costa Rica; and 56 percent in Nicaragua). [Memo \n     from U.S. State Department to Senate Finance Committee on \n     ``Central American Attitudes Toward CAFTA,'' March 16, 2005.] \n     Anticipated benefits include job creation, lower prices, and \n     a wider variety of goods available to consumers.\n       Passage of DR-CAFTA by the U.S. Congress will help \n     reinforce the positive image many Central Americans have of \n     the United States, and will show that America does not view \n     Central America only as a trading partner. It will show that \n     the United States believes it has a stake in the development \n     of\n\n[[Page S7725]]\n\n     its neighbors. During his confirmation hearing before the \n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 15, then \n     Deputy Secretary of State nominee Robert Zoellick stated that \n     ``economic power is a very important component of America's \n     power'' and that ``economic freedom is linked to political \n     freedom,'' and so ``how we integrate those can build on some \n     of America's values and its interests.'' [Remarks by Robert \n     B. Zoellick during a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee on his nomination to be Deputy Secretary of State, \n     February 15, 2005.]\n       The United States has long fought for democracy and \n     economic freedom for the people of Central America. DR-CAFTA \n     would reinforce democratic and free-market processes through \n     such provisions as transparency and anti-corruption measures. \n     It will also strengthen new democracies and leaders who are \n     working to grow their economies, reduce poverty, fight crime, \n     and deepen the roots of democracy.\n\n                         Criticisms of DR-CAFTA\n\n\n                                 Sugar\n\n       Some charge the DR-CAFTA will greatly harm U.S. sugar \n     producers due to increased imports of sugar. In fact, U.S. \n     imports of sugar from the DR-CAFTA countries are today \n     limited by tariff rate quotas (TRQs) currently imposed by the \n     United States on each DR-CAFTA country, [ITC, 2004.] and this \n     system (albeit with slightly increased import amounts) will \n     remain in place with DR-CAFTA.\n       Under the TRQs, sugar from the DR-CAFTA countries enters \n     duty-free if it is within quota. [ITC, 2004.] Sugar imported \n     over-quota is assessed high tariffs, which are in effect \n     prohibitive tariffs [ITC, 2004.] (of over 100 percent). \n     [USTR, ``DR-CAFTA Policy Brief, Sugar: A Spoonful a Week,'' \n     February 2005.] Because of the high over-quota tariffs, \n     imports of sugar from the DR-CAFTA countries essentially \n     correspond to their TRQ levels. [ITC, 2004.] It is important \n     to note that TRQs on sugar imports from the DR-CAFTA \n     countries will be increased only slightly as a percentage of \n     consumption under the trade agreement, [ITC, 2004.] and \n     prohibitive tariffs on over-quota imports will remain intact \n     under the DR-CAFTA. [ITC, 2004.]\n       In 2003, the DR-CAFTA countries exported to the United \n     States 325,146 metric tons of sugar--most of which was raw \n     cane sugar--at a value of $141.3 million. [ITC, 2004.] These \n     imports constituted approximately 3 percent of sugar consumed \n     in the United States during that year. [ ITC, 2004.] \n     Additional increased access during the first year of the \n     trade agreement will total 109,000 metric tons. [ITC, 2004.] \n     That increase is equivalent to little more than one day's \n     production of sugar in the United States, [USTR, ``DR-CAFTA \n     Policy Brief, Sugar: A Spoonful a Week,'' February 2005.] or \n     about 1.2 percent of current annual U.S. sugar consumption. \n     [USTR, ``DR-CAFTA Policy Brief, Sugar: A Spoonful a Week,'' \n     February 2005.]\n       By the end of the 15-year phase-in period, sugar imports \n     from this agreement will have increased by a total of 153,140 \n     metric tons. [ITC, 2004.] The additional access during the \n     entire 15-year phase-in period represents less than 2 percent \n     of the approximately 7.8 million metric tons of sugar \n     produced in the United States in the 2003/2004 growing \n     season. [USTR, ``DR-CAFTA Policy Brief, Sugar: A Spoonful a \n     Week,'' February 2005.] Again, what the trade agreement \n     permits is an increase in import competition of less than 2 \n     percent relative to domestic production--stretched out over a \n     15-year period. Following the phase-in period, the TRQs will \n     grow by an additional 2,640 metric tons each year. [ITC, \n     2004.]\n       The potential impact of these increases in the in-quota \n     TRQs for DR-CAFTA countries appears minimal. USTR has found \n     that approval of DR-CAFTA ``would not have a destabilizing \n     effect on the U.S. sugar program.'' [USTR, ``DR-CAFTA Policy \n     Brief, Sugar: A Spoonful a Week,'' February 2005.] And the \n     ITC, using its models, found that there would likely be a \n     decrease in the U.S. price of sugar ``of about one percent as \n     a result of the increase in imports under the FTA.'' [ITC, \n     2004.] Clearly this suggests a negligible impact on U.S. \n     producers. Furthermore, one could argue that such declines in \n     consumer prices could boost demand and actually increase U.S. \n     producers' revenue.\n       Moreover, additional TRQ access for the DR-CAFTA countries \n     is conditioned on each country's trade-surplus position. \n     [ITC, 2004.] Specifically, only net-surplus-exporting \n     countries in the region will obtain increased access to the \n     U.S. market. This is because the agreement limits access to \n     the lesser of the amount of each country's net trade surplus \n     in sugar or the specified amounts provided in each country's \n     TRQ. [ USTR, ``DR-CAFTA Policy Brief, Sugar: A Spoonful a \n     Week,'' February 2005.] For example, at the present time the \n     Dominican Republic--currently the largest TRQ holder among \n     the DR-CAFTA countries--would not qualify for increased \n     market access to ship additional sugar to the United States \n     under the agreement. [Inside U.S. Trade, ``USTR Threatens \n     Dominican Republic Over Proposed HFCS Soft Drink Tax,'' \n     September 3, 2004.] As noted by the American Farm Bureau \n     Federation (Farm Bureau), this situation makes the issue of \n     increased sugar imports from the Dominican Republic moot for \n     now. [American Farm Bureau Federation, ``Implications of a \n     Central American Free Trade Agreement on U.S. Agriculture.''] \n     According to Farm Bureau calculations, even if the Dominican \n     Republic were to become a net exporter of sugar by 2024--the \n     year in which the agreement would be fully operational--its \n     exports of sugar would increase by only $11.7 million from \n     the Dominican Republic's current allocation of $96.3 million.\n       Still, some critics of the DR-CAFTA assert a second \n     argument--that increased sugar imports under the agreement \n     would have a destabilizing impact on U.S. domestic sugar \n     policies by suspension of sugar marketing allotments. [ITC, \n     2004.] Under marketing allotments, the U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture restricts the amount of sugar that can be sold by \n     domestic producers, [ITC, 2004.] a policy designed to ensure \n     stable sugar prices and supplies in the U.S. market. \n     [American Sugar Alliance, U.S. Sugar Policy Under the Farm \n     Bill, retrieved on 03/15/05.] Under the policy, if U.S. \n     imports of sugar were to exceed a specified amount \n     (approximately 1.5 million tons in a given year) marketing \n     allotments could be suspended, thus enabling U.S. producers \n     to compete with imported sugar under prevailing market \n     conditions. [ITC, 2004.]\n       A cushion exists, however, between the ``trigger level'' of \n     imports that would suspend marketing allotments and projected \n     imports under the DR-CAFTA. [ITC, 2004; USTR, ``DR-CAFTA \n     Policy Brief, Sugar: A Spoonful a Week,'' February 2005.] The \n     U.S. International Trade Commission estimates that it would \n     take about 60 years following the agreement's implementation \n     for this cushion to be exceeded, taking into account growth \n     in imports during the phase-in period and subsequent annual \n     imports of 2,640 metric tons under the agreement. [ITC, \n     2004.] In 60 years, it is unknown whether marketing \n     allotments would even be a part of U.S. sugar policy. In any \n     case, the ITC believes it unlikely that increased imports \n     resulting from the agreement will trigger the suspension of \n     marketing allotments. [ITC, 2004.]\n       Furthermore, in the unlikely event that U.S. domestic sugar \n     policies were threatened by imports from the DR-CAFTA \n     countries, the agreement includes a mechanism that will \n     permit the United States to restrict sugar imports from these \n     countries and provide them with equivalent benefits to \n     compensate for lost market access. [USTR, ``DR-CAFTA Policy \n     Brief, Sugar: A Spoonful a Week,'' February 2005.] This \n     compensation mechanism further alleviates possible pressures \n     that might threaten U.S. sugar policies.\n\n\n                                Textile\n\n       Some textile producers argue that passage of DR-CAFTA will \n     lead to textile job losses in the United States. [American \n     Manufacturing Trade Action Council, ``CAFTA Bad for \n     U.S. Textile Industry and Workers,'' May 28, 2004.] \n     Additionally some of the same critics have argued that the \n     U.S. textile sector is currently restructuring in response \n     to China's growth in this economic sector and, therefore, \n     American companies cannot allow additional jobs to be lost \n     to Central American textile factories. [New York Times, \n     ``Chinese Textile Flood?'' March 10, 2005.] Both arguments \n     fail to grasp the long-term benefits of regional \n     integration to the U.S. textile and apparel industry of \n     promoting regional integration under the agreement.\n       DR-CAFTA will benefit the U.S. textile and apparel industry \n     by expanding the benefits currently provided by the Caribbean \n     Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA) and making the benefits \n     reciprocal. The CBTPA (which includes all DR-CAFTA countries) \n     allows apparel exports from the region to enter the United \n     States duty-free and quota-free, provided that they use U.S. \n     yarn and fabric. This supports U.S. exports and jobs. Indeed, \n     in the past four years, the region has become one of the \n     largest and fastest-growing export markets for U.S. cotton \n     growers, yarn spinners, and fabric mills. Regional producers \n     face new competition from Asian imports since global quotas \n     on textiles and apparel ended January 2005. This agreement \n     will give the region a critical advantage in competing with \n     Asia in a post textile-quota world by helping to retain \n     textile production in the region, rather than moving \n     production to China. [John T. Hyatt, ``Good for Central \n     America, Good for U.S.,'' Times-Picayune, March 15, 2005.]\n       When facilities move from Central America to China, they \n     are much less likely to buy U.S. yarns and fabrics. Thus, the \n     competitiveness of the U.S. fiber and yarn industry is \n     inextricably linked to maintaining the competitiveness of the \n     DR-CAFTA region. [Cass Ballenger, ``Producing for N.C.'s \n     Textiles,'' The News and Observer, March 1, 2005.] Currently, \n     71 percent of DR-CAFTA-made apparel enters the United States \n     using U.S. yarns and fabrics, while one tenth of 1 percent of \n     apparel from China enters the United States using U.S. yarn \n     or fabric. [Statistical data provided by the Office of \n     Textiles and Apparel in the International Trade \n     Administration at the U.S. Department of Commerce.] More than \n     $2.6 billion of U.S. fabric and yarn exports went to the six \n     DR-CAFTA nations in 2004. [Jeffrey Sparshott, ``A Tough \n     Sell,'' Washington Times, March 10, 2005.] By keeping apparel \n     assembly in the region through DR-CAFTA, we will retain and \n     grow the market for U.S. exports of fabrics.\n       The agreement also contains tough custom enforcement \n     procedures to ensure that only products eligible for DR-CAFTA \n     tariff treatment benefit from the agreement. Further, the \n     agreement contains a special textile safeguard, which \n     authorizes the imposition of tariffs on textiles when injury \n     occurs due to import surges.\n\n[[Page S7726]]\n\n       Many of those who oppose the agreement are weavers, who \n     point to a tariff preference level (TPL) for Nicaragua that \n     extends duty-free treatment for 10 years for cotton and \n     manmade-fiber apparel made in Nicaragua from fabrics made \n     anywhere else (otherwise known as ``non-originating \n     fabric''). In other words, the fabrics do not have to come \n     from either the United States or other DR-CAFTA countries for \n     the apparel to be eligible under the TPL. The TPL was \n     included only for this one country because Nicaragua is by \n     far the smallest and least-developed apparel supplier among \n     the DR-CAFTA countries. However, TPLs have been in every \n     trade agreement negotiated before the DR-CAFTA (excluding \n     Israel and Jordan). Indeed, DR-CAFTA does not include TPLs \n     for the major Central American apparel producers--the first \n     time that a trade agreement did not provide TPLs to our \n     negotiating partners. The TPL granted to Nicaragua would \n     cover only about 3 percent of the total amount of garments \n     shipped by all CAFTA countries.\n       Costa Rica is the beneficiary of a small concession for \n     wool fabric, allowing Costa Rica to source non-originating \n     fabric up to capped amount. This concession will be phased \n     out over two years, and was put in place to allow a wool \n     apparel producer to coordinate with suppliers in the United \n     States who are planning to be a source for the fabric in the \n     future (the concession is subject to review after 18 months). \n     [For more details on the textile provisions of DR-CAFTA, see \n     the February 2005 USTR policy brief, ``Textiles of CAFTA--\n     Details of the Agreement.'']\n       The agreement also contains tough custom enforcement \n     procedures to ensure that only products eligible for DR-CAFTA \n     tariff treatment benefit from the agreement. Further, the \n     agreement contains a special textile safeguard, which \n     authorizes the imposition of tariffs on textiles when injury \n     occurs due to import surges. Many in the U.S. textile \n     industry (retailers, yarn spinners, knitters, and apparel \n     producers) support passage of DR-CAFTA, such as Burlington \n     Industries, the American Apparel and Footwear Association, \n     Levi Strauss and Company, ERICO, International Textile Group, \n     Union Apparel, Sara Lee, and Warnaco.\n\n\n                                 Labor\n\n       Organized American labor groups oppose this free trade \n     agreement, alleging that it does not include adequate \n     provisions for workers' rights. [Statement by AFL-CIO \n     President John Sweeney on Central American Free Trade \n     Agreement, May 28, 2004.] It should be noted that the AFL-\n     CIO, a leading labor union opposed to DR-CAFTA, has never \n     supported a free trade agreement, including the U.S.-\n     Australia Free Trade Agreement. Further, Costa Rica, \n     Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic \n     have ratified all eight International Labor Organization \n     (ILO) core labor conventions, and El Salvador has ratified \n     six of the eight. In contrast, the United States has ratified \n     only two ILO core conventions.\n       An analysis by the ILO demonstrates that the labor laws and \n     constitutions of the DR-CAFTA countries are comparable to ILO \n     core labor standards. [USTR, ``CAFTA Facts: The Facts About \n     DR-CAFTA's Labor Provisions,'' February 2005.] The problem \n     has been, however, that the governments have lacked the \n     capacity to enforce their labor laws due to financial \n     constraints. To address this, the United States is taking a \n     three-pronged approach in DR-CAFTA: First, each country must \n     enforce its own labor laws. If they do not, then a fine will \n     be imposed and the monies from the fine will be used to \n     address the enforcement deficiency. [USTR, ``CAFTA Facts: The \n     Facts About DR-CAFTA's Labor Provisions,'' February 2005.] \n     Second, each country must make the necessary economic and \n     legal reforms to improve ILO adherence. Third, each country \n     must undertake capacity building to enforce its domestic \n     labor laws. To accomplish this, the United States is offering \n     capacity-building assistance to improve labor law \n     enforcement. As a first step, Congress appropriated $20 \n     million in the FY05 Foreign Operations appropriations bill \n     specifically to help build the capacity of Central America \n     and the Dominican Republic on labor and environmental law \n     enforcement. [Rep. Jim Kolbe (R-AZ) authored a provision in \n     the FY05 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill that provided \n     $20 million to assist CAFTA countries with labor standards \n     enforcement.]\n       Ironically, while the AFL-CIO opposes DR-CAFTA because the \n     agreement doesn't overtly include ILO standards, the \n     conditions in the agreement pertaining to the enforcement \n     of standards for workers' rights will serve as a catalyst \n     for these countries to take labor laws seriously. \n     Moreover, the labor provisions in DR-CAFTA are the same as \n     those contained in the U.S.-Morocco Free Trade Agreement \n     that Congress passed overwhelmingly last July (by a vote \n     of 323-99 in the House and by a vote of 85-13 in the \n     Senate).\n\n\n                              Environment\n\n       The DR-CAFTA environmental provisions promote policies that \n     ensure protection of current laws while striving to improve \n     those laws, with effective remedies for violating the \n     agreement. This type of environmental protection goes beyond \n     the requirements called for in the Trade Promotion Act (2002) \n     and recently implemented FTAs with Chile and Singapore. The \n     agreement has taken groundbreaking steps to mitigate \n     environmental degradation by involving all stakeholders \n     through meaningful public participation and capacity building \n     for the region. There is wide appeal for the environment \n     provisions because of these new initiatives and it is \n     demonstrated by the support it has received from local \n     environmental conservation NGOs from five of the six DR-CAFTA \n     countries. [Letter to Ambassador Zoellick from 10 NGO's dated \n     January 31, 2005.]\n       Failure to pass the agreement will only serve to undermine \n     these important initiatives to strengthen environmental \n     protection in the region.\n\n\n                  Broad American Support for DR-CAFTA\n\n       Since last year, scores of organizations, associations, and \n     businesses have made known their support for passage of DR-\n     CAFTA. Perhaps one of the most compelling, detailed, and \n     broadly supported endorsements was issued on January 26, 2005 \n     by the Business Coalition for U.S.-Central America Free \n     Trade. In a letter to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, the \n     Business Coalition listed five reasons why the ``timely \n     implementation'' of DR-CAFTA was important, citing commercial \n     importance (``over the last five years, the [DR-CAFTA] \n     countries have been our fifth largest growth market \n     worldwide''); reciprocity in U.S.-Central American trade \n     relations and creation of new opportunities for all sectors \n     of the U.S. economy; strengthening of democracy and rule of \n     law ``in a region that was wracked by civil war not that long \n     ago;'' critical importance of maintaining and fostering ``key \n     partnerships in the textile and apparel sector;'' and the \n     signal that would be sent to ``all of the United States'' \n     trading partners that the United States remains committed to \n     trade and investment liberalization at an important juncture \n     in WTO negotiations.'' [A letter to Senator Bill Frist (R-\n     TN), dated January 26, 2005 by the Business Coalition for \n     U.S.-Central America Trade.]\n       The letter was signed by the representatives of more than \n     100 organizations, associations, and companies, including \n     Pepsi, Boeing, American International Group, Warnaco, the \n     American Farm Bureau Federation, Caterpillar, Exxon Mobil, \n     Grocery Manufacturers of America, JC Penney, Microsoft, Mars \n     Incorporated, National Cattlemen's Beef Association, National \n     Pork Producers Council, Procter and Gamble, Time Warner, and \n     the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n       President Clinton's former senior Treasury and trade \n     official, Stuart Eizenstat, has strongly argued that DR-CAFTA \n     is a must-pass agreement. Writing in the Wall Street Journal \n     earlier this month, Eizenstat stated, ``The agreement is \n     deeply in our national interest and will create, not destroy, \n     jobs.'' [Stuart E. Eizenstat, ``Trade Wins,'' Wall Street \n     Journal, March 8, 2005.] He went on to remark that ``the \n     agreement would solidify the United States as the leading \n     supplier of goods and services to Central American and the \n     Dominican Republic at a time when China is making serious \n     inroads as an investor and exporter in the Western \n     Hemisphere.'' [Eizenstat.]\n\n                   Consequences Should DR-CAFTA Fail\n\n       The economic and social consequences of failing to pass the \n     DR-CAFTA would be significant. Economically, U.S. exporters \n     would continue to face high tariff barriers on their exports \n     to the region. Furthermore, U.S. service providers would \n     continue to face numerous non-tariff barriers to their \n     service exports.\n       Thousands of apparel production jobs in Central America and \n     the Dominican Republic would be lost as investors move \n     production facilities to China. As a result, numerous U.S. \n     suppliers of cotton, yarns, fabrics and other components \n     would lose an important export market--America's third \n     largest--for their products as Chinese facilities will likely \n     source their needed components from Asia instead of the \n     United States. [USTR, CAFTA Policy Brief, ``Textiles of \n     CAFTA--Details of the Agreement,'' February 2005.] Further \n     economic consequences could also include increased \n     immigration from the Dominican Republic and Central America \n     as displaced workers seek opportunity abroad.\n       Politically, failure to pass DR-CAFTA would be seen by our \n     Central American partners as American disengagement from a \n     strategically important region of the world. It would send a \n     signal to our other trading partners that our nation is not \n     committed to the principles of open markets and, thus, \n     discourage them from making market access and other economic \n     commitments that are vitally important to our nation as we \n     negotiate in the Middle East, Asia, Europe, or other areas in \n     the Western Hemisphere. Furthermore, failure to pass DR-CAFTA \n     would have a chilling effect on the Doha Development Agenda \n     of trade negotiations at the World Trade Organization, \n     potentially jeopardizing our most significant opportunities \n     to gain broad access for our agriculture, manufacturing, and \n     services exports.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       DR-CAFTA is the latest in a series of successfully \n     negotiated, far-reaching, economically-beneficial trade \n     agreements undertaken by the Bush Administration. DR-CAFTA is \n     the first trade agreement since the U.S.-Chile Free Trade \n     Agreement was passed in 2003 that includes economies in \n     America's geographic backyard. Most importantly, DR-CAFTA is \n     a great economic package for both the nations of Central \n     America and the United States. The agreement will provide new \n     economic opportunities for American investors and secure \n     American and Central American jobs.\n       DR-CAFTA is as much a political statement as it is an \n     economic one. As Senator\n\n[[Page S7727]]\n\n     Charles Grassley (R-IA) has noted: [DR-CAFTA] shows our \n     strong desire to reach out and form deeper and lasting bonds \n     with the international community, particularly in Latin \n     America. The agreement will help to lock in economic reform \n     and increase transparency in the region. DR-CAFTA can serve \n     as a cornerstone of economic growth and democracy for the \n     region which will enhance the standard of living for millions \n     of our southern neighbors. [Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA), \n     Congressional Record, July 22, 2004.]\n       Congress should pass DR-CAFTA. It is in our national \n     economic, political, and security interests to do so.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Central America \nFree Trade Agreement, its importance to our country, to our economic \ninterests both here and at home, and around the world.\n  Since Congress gave the President fast-track trade negotiating \nauthority in August of 2002, we've had to face the realities that come \nwith it.\n  I supported giving the President fast-track authority then, with the \ncaveat that I would approach all trade agreements sent to Congress with \nan open mind.\n  Three agreements have reached Congress since 2002 and I have voted \nfor two of those three.\n  The administration has been actively pursuing a vigorous bilateral \nand free-trade agenda around the world, and I believe it is in our best \ninterest to do so both economically and socially.\n  Trade with foreign nations is a valuable component to promote \neconomic opportunities here at home, but also to spread our democratic \nideals that we value so highly in our country.\n  Congress is now debating the Central American Free Trade Agreement, \notherwise known as CAFTA. I became heavily involved with our trade \nnegotiators as the President and our then-Trade Representative Bob \nZoellick began negotiations with the CAFTA nations.\n  As an agricultural State, Idaho has a large stake in these agreements \nand agriculture right now is currently learning how to restructure \nitself as our global markets become highly integrated.\n  As many know, a major agricultural crop in my State is the production \nof sugar. Idaho is the second-largest producer of sugarbeets behind \nMinnesota.\n  Idaho's sugar industry employs somewhere in the neighborhood of 7 to \n8,000 people and generates nearly $800 million in economic activity for \nthe State economy.\n  The sugar industry in Idaho, and in most other sugar-producing \nStates, has restructured itself after several years of unprofitability. \nFarmers pooled their money to create cooperative processing plants to \nmarket their sugar and so inherently have a large personal investment \nin all levels of production.\n  It's well known that the world sugar market is one of the most \ndistorted agricultural markets in the world, and most world sugar \nsupplies are simply dumped on the market at prices well below the cost \nof production.\n  U.S. producers already face an oversupply situation with significant \nquantities in storage at the expense of producers. Prices have slowly \ndeclined, yet production costs have sky-rocketed.\n  Although the U.S. is the 4th largest importer of sugar in the world, \nCAFTA seeks to significantly compound an already ugly situation and set \na precedent of ``no return'' for further negotiations already underway \nwith major sugar-exporting countries like Thailand and Panama.\n  CAFTA nations already enjoy duty-free quota access for sugar with the \nU.S., and I am not prepared to trade away an industry so vital to my \nState and to the overall farm economy in Idaho.\n  Other Idaho agricultural groups understand that those farmers who are \nsugar producers are also potato, bean, and grain producers. We're not \njust talking about impacting one commodity, we are cutting a wide swath \nacross several industries and sending an economic ripple through our \nrural communities that may not be recoverable.\n  Our U.S. negotiators are willing to open our markets to increased \nsugar imports, while our competitors maintain unfair economic \nadvantages in domestic subsidies and minimal market access commitments.\n  Myself along with my colleagues from sugar-producing States took our \nconcerns with CAFTA to the administration. With the help of my good \nfriend and Chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Senator Chambliss, we \nspent some late nights and several conference calls to come up with a \nsolution that would allow could address the concerns of the sugar \nindustry.\n  Our new U.S. Trade Representative Rob Portman and U.S. Department of \nAgriculture Secretary Mike Johanns joined us in trying to iron out the \ndifferences and find some mutually agreeable options. I am very \nimpressed with these two men's willingness to roll up their sleeves and \nwork with me and others on what has been a very difficult issue.\n  Although these discussions should have occurred much earlier, the \nadministration came a very long way in a short amount of time to reach \na resolution.\n  A proposal was offered to maintain the sugar program as passed in the \n2002 Farm Bill and to provide the industry with relief from surges of \nimported, cheap foreign sugar by studying and beginning to establish a \nsugar-to-ethanol program in the U.S.\n  I think this proposal represents a strong effort of compromise in a \ncomplex and difficult environment. I would like to praise Secretary \nJohanns and Ambassador Portman for their willingness to make this \nquantum leap to accommodate our concerns. I think the proposal brings \nsome good ideas to the table that we can build upon.\n  I understand that Secretary Johanns has sent the proposal in writing \nto Congress to affirm his commitment to the agreement. I will be \nworking with Chairman Chambliss on a Sense of the Senate to solidify \nthis proposal and strengthen the promise made to the industry.\n  The only fault of this proposal is that it does not provide the long-\nterm solution that the industry desperately needs. I also have major \nconcerns that the proposal compromises the law by changing our sugar \nprogram from that of operating at ``no-cost'' to the taxpayer to one \nthat could cost hundreds of millions of dollars. This is just not \nsustainable and a major departure from our promise to the industry.\n  I know I share the same strong concerns with Chairman Chambliss that \nfree trade agreements should remain faithful to current U.S. policy and \nnot restrict options available to Congress in future farm bills.\n  For these reasons, I will be voting against CAFTA. However, I do \napplaud the administration for their diligence and willingness to work \nwith me on this issue. I hope that as we near the next Farm Bill in \n2007, we will continue to work on a sustainable answer that maintains a \nvery important industry in my State but also the agricultural economy \nin the U.S.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, our trade policy is failing. This failure \nis reflected in a trade deficit that grew by 25 percent last year to \nmore than $617 billion, and in the loss of 2.8 million manufacturing \njobs over the past 4 years. We are in this predicament in part because \nwe have pursued one-way trade agreements that are not in the best \ninterest of the United States and because we have not insisted that our \ntrading partners grant us true reciprocity.\n  It is difficult to see how pursuing yet another trade agreement in \nthe same failed mold will produce a different result. The Central \nAmerica Free Trade Agreement will not benefit American workers and \nfarmers because it fails to insist on basic internationally recognized \nlabor standards, the agreement will not meet its promise to improve the \nstandard of living for the people of Central America and the Dominican \nRepublic; Instead, it will set off another race to the bottom.\n  The administration is asking the Senate to rubberstamp implementing \nlegislation for CAFTA under fast-track procedures that only allow \nMembers of Congress an up-or-down vote and no chance to amend or \nimprove it. Although I support increased trade with Central America and \nbelieve that fair trade policies would benefit all parties, I do not \nsupport the agreement as crafted. Without the chance to improve it, I \nmust oppose it.\n  The administration is not doing the work necessary to get our trade \npolicy on track. The five Central American countries and the Dominican \nRepublic account for less than 1.5 percent of\n\n[[Page S7728]]\n\ntotal U.S. trade, and our own International Trade Commission found that \nthe U.S. trade deficit with CAFTA countries would likely increase \nslightly as a result of CAFTA. Yet the administration has made CAFTA \nits No. 1 trade priority. A better focus for our trade policy would be \nopening markets in Nations and sectors where the most egregious trade \nbarriers block the sale of U.S. goods and services. We should break \ndown barriers faced by U.S. manufacturers, farmers and services in key \nexport markets including China, Japan, the EU, Korea, and elsewhere.\n  This administration has also failed to deal with our trade deficit \nwith China, which is on track to surpass $200 billion this year. The \nadministration has failed to take action against China for undervaluing \nits currency by between 15-50 percent relative to the dollar to promote \nexports to the United States and to keep out goods made in the United \nStates. This is a violation of the WTO prohibition on gaining a trade \nadvantage from currency manipulation. The administration has also \nfailed to deal with our large and persistent automotive deficit with \nJapan.\n  Likewise, our recent record on trade agreements has not been strong; \nsome of the trade agreements the U.S. has entered into have not been in \nthe best interest of the United States. The clearest example is NAFTA, \nwhich made it easier for U.S. companies to outsource production to low-\nwage countries. Between NAFTA's enactment in 1994 and the end of 2003, \nthe Department of Labor certified that more than 525,000 \nAmerican workers suffered job losses as a result of increased imports \nor plant relocations to Mexico and Canada. Under NAFTA, our trade \nbalance with Mexico went from a surplus of $1.663 billion in 1993 to a \ndeficit of $45 billion in 2004. While it is true that our exports to \nMexico increased under NAFTA, our imports from Mexico also increased, \nand at a faster rate.\n\n  The American people and Members of Congress are understandably \nfrustrated by the failure of NAFTA, and they are equally skeptical \nabout the need to enter into another trade agreement pitting low wage \nworkers from countries with weak labor and environmental laws against \nU.S. workers. Trade should not be a race to the bottom in which U.S. \nworkers must compete with countries that do not recognize core \ninternational labor standards and basic worker rights, but that is \nexactly what CAFTA would do.\n  I am disappointed by the weak labor and environmental provisions \nincluded in CAFTA. Writing labor and environmental standards into trade \nagreements is an important way to ensure that free trade is fair trade. \nBut unlike the 2001 Jordan Free Trade Agreement, CAFTA fails to include \ninternationally recognized, core labor standards. Those standards \ninclude the right to organize/associate; the right to bargain \ncollectively; a prohibition on child labor; a prohibition on \ndiscrimination in employment; and a prohibition on forced labor. I am \nnot seeking that CAFTA countries commit to American standards but at \nleast to the five basic international standards developed by the ILO \nand supported by virtually every country in the world.\n  Indeed, the CAFTA-DR countries are signatories of the International \nLabor Organization conventions. Requiring them to abide by their own \ninternational obligations is the least we can do when considering \nwhether they deserve to receive trade preferences from us. But CAFTA \nonly requires member countries to enforce their own labor and \nenvironmental laws, however inadequate they may be.\n  Unlike the Jordan FTA, the CAFTA labor provisions are not \nenforceable. The U.S.-Jordan FTA treats the labor and environmental \ncommitments the same as the commercial commitments, enforceable under \nthe agreement's dispute settlement procedures. Under CAFTA, however, \nthe labor provisions are not subject to the same binding dispute \nsettlement mechanisms as are the commercial provisions, and violations \ncannot lead to the same level of fines or sanctions. There is a much \nlower standard for labor and environmental commitments, and that makes \nthis a flawed agreement. Under CAFTA, the only labor rights and \nenvironment provision that is enforceable through dispute settlement \nmechanisms is if a party fails to enforce its own labor or environment \nlaws effectively.\n  This is of significant concern because CAFTA nations' own labor laws \ndo not meet international standards. In fact, these countries have \nhistories of serious worker rights abuses. The 2004 U.S. State \nDepartment Country Reports on Human Rights Practices; the October 2003 \nILO Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work'' A Labor law Study, and \nother ILO reports confirm at least 20 areas in which the labor laws in \nthe CAFTA countries fail to comply with the right of association, ILO \nConvention 87, and the right to organize and bargain collectively, ILO \nConvention 98.\n\n  To give just a few examples, in El Salvador and Nicaragua it is legal \nto fire workers simply because they are union members; Human Rights \nWatch found that the use of child labor in El Salvador's sugar cane \nfields is widespread; and under Honduran law, it is legal to fire \nworkers who say they intend to organize a union. One company in the \nDominican Republic fired 140 workers at once because they sought a \ncollective bargaining agreement. The company was fined $660, or about \n$5 per worker.\n  Our own Department of Labor and State Department reports show that \nCAFTA countries fail to provide their workers internationally \nrecognized rights. The U.S. State Department's 2002 Human Rights report \non Guatemala said:\n\n       Retaliation, including firing, intimidation, and sometimes \n     violence, by employers and others against workers who try to \n     exercise internationally recognized labor rights is common \n     and usually goes unsanctioned.\n\n  The U.S. State Department's 2002 Human Rights report on El Salvador \nsaid:\n\n       There were repeated complaints by workers, in some cases \n     supported by the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association \n     (CFA), teat the Government impeded workers from exercising \n     their right of association. In June 2001, the CFA reiterated \n     its 1999 finding that the existing labor code restricts \n     freedom of association.\n\n  That same report also said of El Salvador:\n\n       The constitution prohibits the employment of children under \n     the age of 14; however, child labor is a problem.\n\n  CAFTA would give away the current leverage we have against these \nviolations of basic workers rights. Under CAFTA, the U.S. can only take \naction against a country if it deliberately fails to enforce its labor \nand environmental laws in an effort to gain a trade advantage. Even \nthen, the country must only pay a fine to itself, which will be used to \nfund labor enforcement in that country. This is a step backwards from \nthe status quo.\n  CAFTA countries currently have preferred access to our markets \nthrough the Caribbean Basin Initiative, CBI, and the Generalized System \nof Preferences, GSP. Under these trade preference programs, beneficiary \ncountries must meet internationally recognized labor standards or risk \nlosing their preferential trade treatment. These current trade \npreferences can be completely withdrawn for failure to meet ILO core \nlabor standards. The possibility of losing trade benefits works as a \nstrong incentive for CAFTA countries to make improvements in their \nworker rights laws. CAFTA eliminates that incentive because it gives \nCAFTA countries permanent trade benefits regardless of how they treat \ntheir workers and no matter how far their labor laws fall short of \ninternational norms.\n  If we give away that leverage, CAFTA countries would have no \nincentive to improve their inadequate labor laws or the treatment of \ntheir workers. If a country wants to have preferential access to the \nU.S. market through a trade agreement or preferential trade benefit \nprogram, it ought to agree to abide by the ILO labor standards. Without \nsuch a commitment, we might be giving special access to our markets to \nproducts made with child labor or forced labor, or to employers that \nintimidate or use violence against workers attempting to organize or \njoin labor unions. That is not something we as a Nation would want to \ndo.\n  Countries getting benefits from the U.S. should comply with \ninternationally recognized labor standards as a condition for receiving \nthose benefits. That is a reasonable expectation and one that is \nreflective of basic American values. Trade should not be a race to the \nbottom. And American workers should not be asked to compete with\n\n[[Page S7729]]\n\ncountries that do not recognize core international labor standards and \nbasic worker rights.\n  Rejecting the CAFTA implementing legislation as currently drafted is \na rejection of the failed and flawed trade policies of the past and a \nsignal of support for a better approach to trade that supports both the \nrights of American workers and the rights of our trading partners.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, throughout my 30 years in the Congress, \nI have considered myself a free-trader. I believe that breaking down \nbarriers to trade and opening access to markets in a fair and balanced \nway in the long run benefits all economies, both consumers and \nproducers. As the distance between economies shrinks, integration of \neconomies in a positive way is increasingly important. The \nimplementation of free-trade agreements to codify the rules of fair \nplay and bind all parties to strong and enforceable labor and \nenvironmental protection standards are important steps in the \ndevelopment of a more broadly beneficial and less biased world trading \nsystem.\n  In the case of our nearest neighbors, trade agreements take on a \nsecurity component as well. I believe a strong trade agreement can help \nbreak the cycles of poverty, deprivation and marginalization currently \noperating in many of the Central American countries. We know the \neconomic status quo is unjust and dangerous. Many people in the region \nfeel they have little hope of earning a good living or providing a good \neducation for their children. That must change. It is in the United \nStates' economic and security interest that positive change occurs.\n  Throughout the Dominican Republic--Central America--U.S. Free Trade \nAgreement, CAFTA, negotiation process, I joined a number of my \ncolleagues on the Finance Committee in urging President Bush and the \nU.S. Trade Representative to address concerns about the labor and \nenvironment standards and enforcement mechanisms in this agreement. I \nindicated my deep concern that historically, in most of these \ncountries, economic benefits are not shared by all strata of society. \nWhen negotiating trade agreements between economies of such unequal \nscale, these concerns are of particular importance. I am disappointed \nthe administration did not do more to advance these causes in this \nagreement. Some progress was made, but more could have been \naccomplished if our recommendations had been adopted in full.\n  I have heard from a great many points of view as this agreement has \nfirmed up and the implementing legislation came before Congress. I have \nheard from many Vermonters who are opposed to increased trade in \ngeneral and this agreement in particular. On the other hand, Vermont \ndairy farmers have come to me in support of CAFTA. Dairy industry \nexperts predict that the ratification of this agreement will increase \nthe sales of American dairy products to Central America by $100 million \nover the next several years--not a huge amount, but a significant one, \ngiven the economics of our dairy industry. As an important dairy State \noffering a number of high-quality cheeses and specialty products, \nVermont stands to gain from this agreement. The agreement will create \nopportunities for other Vermont exporters as well, particularly small, \nniche businesses for which Vermont is famous. As with dairy sales, I \ndon't expect these opportunities will be voluminous, but every bit \nhelps in a global economy.\n  I have heard very diverse viewpoints from the Central American \ncountries as well. The region's historic inability to spread economic \ngains to all sectors of society is of deep concern to many in the \nregion, and I share this concern. For two decades, I have been involved \nin the struggle to end human rights violations and labor rights abuses \nin many of these countries. While CAFTA extracts important promises \nfrom Central American Governments to abide by international standards \nof human rights and labor rights, my experience leaves me very \nskeptical of these commitments. Furthermore, the economic deprivation \nof much of the region frustrates all but the most committed efforts at \nreform. Current trends are leading to greater disparity between the \nrich and the poor, urban areas versus rural areas, and economically \nconnected versus economically marginalized populations. These trends \nmust be reversed--not just for the health of the region, but also for \nour own economic health and national security.\n  The key question is whether CAFTA will exacerbate these trends, or \nwhether it can help reverse them. Many in the region fear the United \nStates will move in to benefit from markets in the region while \nfrustrating Central American efforts to access U.S. markets. I have \nalso heard from Central Americans who believe the reduction of tariffs \nand the standardization of commerce will greatly enhance their ability \nto sell to the U.S. market, thereby benefiting communities, often \nmarginal ones, in Central America.\n  After hearing diverse points of view, I concluded that without \nsignificant support from the United States to assist in the enforcement \nof labor agreements and development of greater capacity for balanced \neconomic growth, I could not support CAFTA. Over the past few weeks, I \nhave joined several of my colleagues in pushing the administration to \ncommit to greater support for foreign assistance to the region, aimed \nspecifically at the most vulnerable sectors of Central American society \nand the need for a strong international presence to monitor labor \nrights compliance. While we requested greater levels of aid, our \nnegotiations produced a commitment from the White House to budget for \nand support $40 million in labor and environment capacity building \nassistance for the next 4 years. Additionally the administration has \nagreed to increase funding to the International Labor Organization, \nILO, by $3 million annually for on the ground monitoring of each \ncountry's labor rights commitments and actual labor practices. This \ncould potentially produce the first significant step forward in broad \nenforcement of labor standards throughout the region.\n  In response to our concerns, the administration has also agreed to \nprovide, through the Inter-American Development Bank, $30 million \nannually to El Salvador, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic, $10 \nmillion to each country, for rural development and institution building \nfor a period of 5 years. This commitment of $150 million for rural \ndevelopment assistance to the region is very significant. We have asked \nthat these funds be targeted most directly to the poorer sectors of \nthese economies, particularly those most likely to suffer adverse \neffects from CAFTA. The administration had previously announced \nagreements to provide Honduras and Nicaragua with U.S. foreign \nassistance through the Millennium Challenge Corporation, MCC, at $215 \nmillion and $175 million, respectively. In the course of recent \ndiscussions, the administration has agreed to give higher priority to \nthe development of MCC compacts with El Salvador, Guatemala, and the \nDominican Republic as well.\n  While I still have concerns about CAFTA's effect upon Central \nAmerica, I believe the commitments we have received from the Bush \nadministration on foreign aid, labor rights and the environment \nrepresent a significant step forward in the ability of the region to \nreverse current trends and improve regional standards of living. I am \nhopeful these steps will lead to the improvement of the region's vital \ninstitutions and help ensure that the benefits of the agreement will \ntrickle down to all members of society. The proof will be in the \nimplementation, which I plan to follow very closely. However, I am \nheartened that we now have more to work with, and we are assured of \ngreater support from the administration for this process. Based on the \nstrength of these assurances, I will support the CAFTA agreement.\n  Mr. HATCH. Over the years, I have been a strong advocate for free \ntrade. Free trade is important. I know of no other endeavor that \naffords us the opportunity to forge closer links between nations while \nsimultaneously improving the lives of millions.\n  The vast majority of economists agree that free trade is in every \nnation's long-term best interests. Diplomats also know that it is far \neasier to reach a compromise between nations whose economies are \nmutually reliant. That being said, there are certain aspects of free \ntrade that cause me concern. We need to be ever vigilant to ensure our \napproach to free trade does\n\n[[Page S7730]]\n\nnot relinquish our sovereign rights as a nation.\n  Over the last few years, I have heard from many Utahns who are \nconcerned that the U.S. is relinquishing sovereignty to other countries \nthrough our trade agreements. Let me make clear that we absolutely \ncannot give up our right to govern within our own borders. We have laws \nfor a reason and they represent the ideals and values we hold dear in \nour society.\n  Constituents contact me on a constant basis to underscore their \nfrustration with the gradual loss of sovereignty the U.S. is \nexperiencing in international arenas. Local lawmakers from across the \ncountry are reaching out to us and asking for our help in ensuring \ntheir local laws and authority remain intact as we enter into \ninternational trade agreements. Indeed, recently, the Utah State \nLegislature passed a resolution which echoes these concerns.\n  The issue of maintaining sovereignty was highlighted by a recent \nWorld Trade Organization, WTO, dispute resolution body ruling on \nInternet gambling. The ruling stated that the United States cannot \nblock other countries from offering Internet gambling to U.S. \nresidents, even if they live in States such as Utah where gambling is \nillegal.\n  This is outrageous.\n  We absolutely cannot enter into agreements where our laws are \noverturned by outsiders. It is important for my colleagues to be aware, \nhowever, that the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has \ninterpreted the language in the WTO decision stating that gaming laws \nare ``necessary to protect public morals or to maintain public order'' \nto mean that ``WTO members are entitled to maintain restrictions on \ninternet gaming . . . and U.S. restrictions on internet gambling can \nstand.''\n  I am aware that many in Utah are concerned that CAFTA could usurp our \nState's right to regulate gambling. That is a concern I shared as well. \nHowever, many of us were reassured by the statements made by the Office \nof the U.S. Trade Representative that CAFTA does not jeopardize any \nexisting State laws, including Utah's antigambling laws.\n  We will have to stay on top of this, though. I do not intend to let \nany international agreement affect the laws our great State has enacted \nthat represent the predominant moral views of our citizens.\n  Other concerns with CAFTA regarding ``investor-state provisions that \nwill allow corporations to challenge public interest policies at the \nstate and local level'' have also been raised. Once again, however, the \nOffice of the United States Trade Representative has clearly stated \nthat ``nothing in CAFTA, or any other free trade agreement or bilateral \ninvestment treaty, interferes with a state or local government's right \nto regulate. An investor cannot enjoin regulatory action through \narbitration, nor can arbitral tribunals.'' This statement, in black and \nwhite, will ensure that Internet gambling is not--and will not--become \nlegal in the State of Utah without the consent of its citizens. There \ncan be no ``end-run'' around the USTR's interpretation of the Internet \ngambling decision.\n  Although our CAFTA trade negotiators have done much to protect our \nsovereignty, it is obvious that we must remain vigilant and ensure that \nthe sovereignty of not only our Nation, but also our States, is \nmaintained. I will work to maintain this sovereign right of the people.\n  Mr. President, I have become convinced that many of these problems \nand concerns with U.S. trade agreements could be alleviated if we \nimproved the amount and quality of consultation occurring between \nStates and the Federal Government with respect to trade agreements. \nSimply put, we need to provide greater opportunities for substantive \nconsultation to occur.\n  This problem was the topic of a recent letter signed by 28 States \nattorneys general, including Utah, requesting greater consultation \nbetween the U.S. Trade Representative and the States on issues \naffecting States rights.\n  I believe we need to take action on this immediately and ensure that \nwe provide greater access to and consultation with our States and \ncitizens. We clearly are seeing how big of an impact these trade \nagreements are having in every State and city in America.\n  We need to give the States a direct conduit for their input.\n  Negotiators need to have this information in order to ensure we are \nrepresenting the interests and beliefs of our constituents.\n  Mr. President, these concerns have weighed heavily upon my mind. At \nthe same time, I am encouraged by the many positive results CAFTA will \nhave for our State, our country, and for Utah's farmers and industries. \nAccording to the Department of Commerce, between 2000 and 2004, Utah's \nexports to CAFTA nations increased by 58 percent. This includes such \nproduct areas as plastics, electronics, and instrumentation.\n  In plastic products, Utah industries sold $18.6 million in goods in \n2004. In electronic and instrumentation products, Utah businesses sold \n$5.6 million worth of goods in 2004. The elimination of tariffs will \nmake these products even more competitive in this developing market.\n  We have reason for our optimism. While our experience with the \nChilean Free Trade Agreement provides no guarantees, it is \nillustrative. In the first year of the U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement, \nUtah's exports to Chile grew by 152 percent.\n  I am also pleased that CAFTA will level the playing field so that \nAmerican goods and products can have better access to Central American \nmarkets. As part of our long-standing effort to support democracies in \nthe region, the United States has afforded unilateral preferences to \nCentral American goods under the Caribbean Basin Initiative and the \nGeneralized System of Preferences. CAFTA eliminates these preferences \nwhile simultaneously strengthening our commercial ties by making the \ntrading relationship permanent. All of this will be accomplished while \nAmerican products will have greater opportunities for export in the \nregion.\n  One example of the positive attributes of CAFTA can be found in the \nagreements effect on the hard-pressed textile and yarn producing \nindustries. Our nation, through the use of modern equipment and greatly \nimproved efficiency, continues to be competitive in this area. Where we \nhave lost ground is in the labor-intensive apparel construction \nindustry.\n  CAFTA provides an opportunity to help rectify this setback. Under \ncurrent agreements, 56 percent of all textile products that are \nimported from CAFTA nations to the United States contain U.S. yarns or \nfabrics. When CAFTA is enacted, we can only expect these numbers to \nincrease. This stands in marked contrast to apparel imported from \nPacific Rim, and in particular China, where less than 1 percent of all \nof apparel imports contain U.S. yarns and fabrics. Therefore, I \nbelieve, that in the case of CAFTA, the pros do outweigh the cons.\n  But, I will end on this note of caution. I will watch implementation \nof this agreement carefully. We need to have recognition of the fact \nthat States are partners in these agreements. There must be greater \nopportunities afforded to the States to be consulted on free-trade \nagreements.\n  Likewise, we must remain vigilant that our Nation's and respective \nStates' sovereignty is maintained.\n  On balance, Mr. President, any reasoned analysis indicates that CAFTA \nwill benefit our Nation and our State. It is for this reason that I \nwill cast my vote in support of the Dominican Republic-Central American \nFree Trade Agreement.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today the Senate votes on the Central \nAmerican-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement. During my tenure as \nSenator, I have voted for every trade agreement that has come before \nthe Senate and I believe that properly negotiated trade agreements can \nincrease living standards and foster openness and economic development \nfor all parties. When DR-CAFTA negotiations began, I was eager to \nsupport an agreement. It was my sincere hope that President Bush would \nsend an agreement to Congress that would help address the DR-CAFTA \nnations' development challenges and spread the gains from trade more \nbroadly. Unfortunately, the Bush administration has not submitted such \nan agreement, instead missing a tremendous opportunity to conclude an \nagreement that\n\n[[Page S7731]]\n\nstrengthens the bonds between the United States and the DR-CAFTA \nnations. While this agreement provides some benefit for New York, I \nregretfully conclude the harm outweighs the good. I must therefore vote \nto oppose.\n  My vote to oppose DR-CAFTA is one taken with great difficulty. I have \nheard strong arguments both for and against from many New Yorkers who \nhave a stake in the agreement and I have weighed them seriously. \nSegments of the New York economy would benefit from this agreement, but \nat the end of the day, I cannot support an agreement that fails to \ninclude adequate labor standards and is a step backward in the \ndevelopment of bipartisan support for international trade.\n  At the outset, it is important to understand that consideration of \nDR-CAFTA is not occurring in isolation. This agreement must be read \nwithin the larger context of the failed economic and trade policies of \nthis administration. Under this administration, the trade deficit has \nsoared. The offshoring of U.S. jobs has continued to increase, and the \nU.S. economy has experienced a net loss of U.S. jobs. The \nadministration has no plans to address rising health care and pension \ncosts that are imposing such a tremendous burden on American \nbusinesses. This administration has also failed to enforce existing \ntrade rules and has not been aggressive in addressing the tax and \ncapital subsidies of our competitors.\n  Turning to the specifics of the agreement itself, DR-CAFTA fails in \nsignificant respects. The most problematic elements are its labor \nprovisions which retreat from advances made in the late 1990s and that \nculminated in the labor provisions of the U.S.-Jordan Free Trade \nAgreement. The U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement included \ninternationally recognized enforceable labor standards in the text of \nthe agreement. Sadly, DR-CAFTA is a step backward. The labor provisions \nof the DR-CAFTA agreement instead used an ``enforce your own laws'' \nstandard which is not included in any other area of the agreement. An \n``enforce your own laws'' standard may work in nations with a strong \ntradition of labor enforcement, but the International Labor \nOrganization, ILO, has documented that the CAFTA countries' labor laws \nhave not complied with international norms in at least 20 areas.\n  The Jordan FTA made labor rights obligations subject to the same \ndispute settlement resolution procedure as commercial obligations. \nConversely, DR-CAFTA includes a separate dispute settlement procedure \nfor labor disagreements, which caps the damages that can be imposed for \nlabor violations.\n  The Chile, Australia and Singapore free trade agreements, which I \nsupported, contained similar ``enforce your own law'' labor provisions \nto DR-CAFTA, but as I noted when I voted for these agreements, I was \ngreatly disturbed by these provisions' departure from the labor rights \nstandards negotiated in the U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement. In the \nend, I supported these agreements despite these concerns because I \nbelieved the agreements would not harm the average working person in \nthose nations and, thus, the flawed labor provisions did not outweigh \nthe benefits offered by the agreements. I noted, however, that I would \nnot continue to support agreements with these provisions where the \nimpact was greater on workers. In the DR-CAFTA agreement, the flawed \nlabor provisions represent a real missed opportunity to spread the \nbenefits of trade not just to the wealthy elites, but to the broader \nworkforce as well.\n  There are other problems with the DR-CAFTA agreement. The final \nagreement excludes provisions for assisting U.S. workers harmed by \ntrade. The environmental provisions of CAFTA undermine environmental \nprotection, by including a lack of parity between the enforcement of \ncommercial and environmental provisions. This is a clear step back from \nthe Jordan Free Trade Agreement. Finally, the environmental \nconservation provisions lack a commitment to fund their implementation.\n  The agreement also fails in the area of public health. Regarding \npharmaceuticals, I would note that in 2001, 142 countries, including \nthe United States, adopted the Doha Declaration, an agreement that \nprovided that trade obligations should be interpreted and implemented \nin ways that protect public health. In August 2002, Congress passed the \nTrade Promotion Authority Act which applied Doha to U.S. trade \nnegotiations. Despite this commitment, the administration has promoted \nprovisions within trade agreements, including DR-CAFTA, that will \nsignificantly impede the ability of developing countries to obtain \naccess to inexpensive, life-saving medications. Contrary to the \nprinciples of Doha, these agreements place the interests of large \nmultinational drug companies over the ability of developing countries \nto safeguard public health.\n  The DR-CAFTA agreement negotiated by the President represents a \nmissed opportunity in many respects, both for the DR-CAFTA nations and \nfor the U.S. For the DR-CAFTA nations, it is a missed opportunity to \nensure that the benefits of trade flow to all of their citizens and not \njust wealthy elites. This agreement will not promote democracy and \nstability in these nations. A stronger agreement would instead have \nbolstered the political and economic stability in these nations, \nthrough fair apportionment of benefits. In some of the DR-CAFTA \nnations, the agreement has proved to be quite polarizing and a better \nagreement could have gained broader public support.\n  For the United States, DR-CAFTA was a missed opportunity to \nreconstitute the bipartisan consensus in support of international \ntrade. Rather than consult widely and develop a consensus, the \nadministration has decided to go for a narrow victory with disturbing \nimplications for the possibility of bipartisan trade agreements in the \nfuture. In a time when Americans are facing increasing economic \nanxiety, trade is often viewed with suspicion. An administration which \nfails to consult and pushes for trade agreements which are unable to \nget bipartisan support undermines public support for international \ntrade as a tool for economic development and greater prosperity. Even \nif the administration is successful in gaining passage of DR-CAFTA, I \nfear that this victory will be hollow as the anxiety over international \ntrade continues to grow. In the end, the administration's strategy to \nignore consultation and consensus in its trade policy may do more harm \nfor the cause of international trade than the purported benefits of \nthis agreement.\n  While it is inevitable that some will benefit more than others from \nopen markets, we have a responsibility to ensure that the basic rules \nof the game are fair. In previous trade agreements, this balance was \nachieved. And I voted for those agreements. DR-CAFTA fails this test.\n  This is a sad day for supporters of free and fair rules-based trade. \nOur relationship with our Central American neighbors is a critical one. \nThe right CAFTA deal would strengthen ties between the United States \nand these nations. I urge the administration to reopen the CAFTA \nnegotiations and re-establish the broad, bipartisan coalition for \ntrade.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to \nthe Central American Free Trade Agreement, CAFTA. The United States \nCongress has been waiting for over a year to consider this agreement \nwhich was signed on May 28, 2004, because of the contentious nature of \nmany of the agreement's provisions. It is those provisions that I rise \ntoday to address.\n  Ethanol is an incredibly important industry in my home State of South \nDakota. It is imperative for facilitating additional market \nopportunities for producers in the State and adding value to \nagricultural commodities. CAFTA maintains the ethanol provisions \ncontained in the Caribbean Basin Initiative, CBI, which allows CBI \ncountries to export up to 7 percent of the U.S. ethanol market duty-\nfree containing no local feedstocks. Under these provisions, I am \nconcerned that Central American countries may function as conduits for \nSouth American ethanol. El Salvador and Costa Rica, in particular, are \ngranted generous carve-outs from the total ethanol allotments under \nCAFTA. El Salvador will eventually be allowed .7 percent of the U.S. \nmarket, and Costa Rica will be allowed twice what they are currently \nimporting into the U.S. under CAFTA.\n\n[[Page S7732]]\n\n  I have worked tirelessly with my Senate colleagues to ensure an eight \nbillion gallon Renewable Fuels Standard, RFS, in the Senate version of \nthe Energy bill. As our United States ethanol market increases, so to, \nunder this agreement, does the quantity of the market afforded to CAFTA \ncountries--or afforded to ethanol en route to the U.S. through CAFTA \ncountries for a quick and easy reprieve from tariffs. Foreign producers \nof ethanol will find the U.S. even more attractive with an 8 billion \ngallon RFS, and I am concerned for the impact that this, and future \ntrade agreements, will have on the ethanol industry. I simply cannot \nsupport an agreement that may undermine one of the most important \nindustries in my home state, and set a dangerous precedent for future \nagreements of this nature. Specifically, producers have expressed \nconcerns for the pending Free Trade Area of the Americas, and the \nimpact that CAFTA will have on this potentially detrimental agreement.\n  The sugar provisions are troubling as well, and have been a marked \npoint of contention causing controversy among agriculture groups. I \ncontinue to hear from producers in my home State who are concerned with \nthe potential impact of displaced sugar acres from this agreement, as \nthe treatment of sugar will impact numerous commodities in South \nDakota. Producers are concerned that displaced sugar acres will lead to \nincreased corn and soybean acres, depressing commodity prices for corn \nand soybeans. Parts of this agreement are still being negotiated, \nspecifically with respect to the sugar compensation mechanism to ensure \nwe have not imported more than 1.5 million tons of sugar, and I fail to \nsee how we can adopt an agreement with so many outstanding questions.\n  Secretary Johanns indicated that a few possible compensation \nmechanisms existed for the sugar industry, which the sugar industry has \nthoroughly rejected. The Secretary actually proposed purchasing sugar \nthat would otherwise surpass the trigger limit and use that sugar for \nnonfood items, specifically ethanol production. Using foreign sugar to \nproduce ethanol is an incredible, and outrageous proposal. It will only \nfunction to displace a hard-earned market for domestic corn producers. \nInstead of offering a reasonable solution to the sugar industry, the \nadministration is now persisting to sacrifice domestic commodities to \nplacate opposition to this incredibly flawed agreement. Alternatively, \nU.S. agricultural commodities may be offered up as compensation for \nundesired sugar from CAFTA countries. And both of these proposed \ncompensation mechanisms are temporary, through the life of the Farm \nbill only. The administration is persisting with this Band-aid \napproach, while offering no real or meaningful solutions.\n  CAFTA fails to address key labor issues and environmental standards. \nUnder CAFTA, countries are not obligated to uphold International Labor \nOrganization, ILO, laws and the agreement fails to include enforceable \nlabor standards. The agreement states that countries should ``strive \nto'' ensure their labor laws are comparable to international labor \nlaws, but includes no enforcement mechanisms. This effectively renders \nthe aforementioned laws meaningless. The agreement speaks to the \nenforcement of domestic labor laws--the enforcement of domestic labor \nlaws, however, that are held to no particular standard. Aside from an \nethical and moral dilemma, this agreement also functions to highlight \nan economic dilemma. The lack of labor standards will arguably present \na competitive advantage over U.S. companies that are observing labor \nstandards and ensuring, quite simply, the humane treatment of their \nemployees.\n  Myriad reports exist that detail the harsh and unforgiving conditions \nworkers are subjected to in countries with lax, or nonexistent, labor \nstandards. According to ILO estimates, 17 million children between the \nages of 5 to 14 are part of the working population in Central American \ncountries. These children all too often miss out on any type of formal \nschooling because they are responsible for earning a meager salary, \njust a few dollars, to contribute to their family's income. These dire \neconomic circumstances only function to illustrate the weakened labor \nstandards that CAFTA will, effectively, endorse and sanction. \nInternational human rights organizations have repeatedly criticized \nlabor standards in CAFTA countries, and this agreement does nothing to \nremedy this. Additionally, these circumstances underscore an inability \non the part of CAFTA countries to purchase a substantive amount of \nAmerican commodities.\n  Additionally, the environmental standards in CAFTA are troubling. \nCountries will be deterred from instituting meaningful environmental \nregulations when they may be held accountable for any inconveniences \nthat foreign investors experience. International tribunals will enable \nforeign investors to challenge meaningful environmental regulations and \nrules that were instituted to preserve the environment. Foreign \ninvestors may expect and seek monetary compensation.\n  I voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, \nbecause I was concerned for the detrimental impacts on our rural \ncommunities and for the preservation of rural America. I continue to \nhear from producers in South Dakota who are concerned for the impacts \nof NAFTA on our economy, and I am concerned for the proposed expansion \nof this model under CAFTA. Producers are simply tired of seeing the \nunrecognized trade benefits promised under these trade agreements.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, today, I proudly announce my support for \nS. 1307, a bill implementing the Dominican Republic-Central America-\nUnited States Free Trade Agreement, or CAFTA. There is much in CAFTA \nthat helps Washington State.\n  I generally support trade agreements such as CAFTA because I believe \nthat free trade is the best way to raise the standard of living for all \nAmericans and for all people in other countries with which we trade. I \nbelieve that once other nations have access to our goods, culture and \nideas, we will find that the world will adopt the best attributes of \nAmerica, including our values.\n  The alternative to supporting CAFTA is unworkable. If CAFTA fails, \nthe Nation's efforts to negotiate future trade agreements will be badly \ndamaged. Congress has to pass CAFTA because it offer benefits to all \nCAFTA signatories, and because in light of the broader trade context \nour negotiators would suffer a setback if CAFTA does not pass.\n  Washington State has historically benefited from liberalizing trade \nlaws. For example, in the first year following the United States-Chile \nFree Trade Agreement, Washington State exports to Chile more than \ndoubled. And since NAFTA passed in 1993 Washington exports to Canada \nand Mexico have increased by 130 percent.\n  CAFTA promises to confer some of the same benefits on Washingtonians. \nCAFTA makes all U.S. exports to the CAFTA countries duty free in 10 \nyears, and most of these tariffs are eliminated immediately. U.S. \nexports to these countries are often subject to tariffs, and CAFTA \nbrings us closer to trade parity. In particular, Washington State's \npear, cherry, apple and potato growers will see most tariffs on their \ncrops immediately reduced to zero as soon as CAFTA is implemented. \nThese farmers have low enough profit margins without having to contend \nwith high tariffs on their goods, and tariffs place our farmers at a \ncompetitive disadvantage with farmers in other countries that are not \nsubject to high tariffs. Our farmers need and deserve better conditions \nfor selling their goods to the seven CAFTA countries.\n  In total, Washington State exported $113 million worth of goods to \nCAFTA countries in 2004, including oil and coal exports, crops, \ncomputers and electronics, processed foods, machinery manufactures and \npaper, and Washington's trade relationship with CAFTA countries \nincreased by 251 percent from 2000 to 2004. These goods are heavily \ntariffed under current international trade laws with the CAFTA \ncountries.\n  But under CAFTA, Washington's apple and pear growers will see duties \nthat are currently up to 25 percent on their goods reduced to zero, and \nour grape growers will see 20 percent tariffs zeroed out. Tariffs on \nWashington's raspberry growers will be phased out over 5 to 15 years, \ndepending on the CAFTA country, and our dairy farmers, some of whose \nproducts are subject to 60 percent tariffs, will see those tariffs \nphased out over 20 years. The Washington beef industry will see 30 \npercent\n\n[[Page S7733]]\n\ntariffs immediately eliminated on some of their products, and other \nbeef product tariffs will be phased out over 10 years. Wheat and barley \nduties are zeroed out immediately, and potato growers will see some \ntariffs immediately eliminated and most others phased out over 15 \nyears.\n  Washington State is likely to see its exports to CAFTA countries \ndramatically increase over time, once CAFTA is enacted. For example, \nNorthwest Washington is likely to see its agricultural exports to CAFTA \ncountries increase as CAFTA is gradually implemented up until 2024, \nfrom $2.1 million to $3.8 million, and Central Washington is likely to \nsee agricultural products shoot up from $14.5 million to $22.4 million \nduring the same 20-year stretch. These heavy increases mean more jobs \nfor Washingtonians, at a time when the State is just now turning things \naround economically.\n  Nationally, CAFTA is also important. CAFTA countries make up the \ntenth largest export partner for American goods, making that region a \nlarger trading partner for the U.S. than Australia, Brazil or India.\n  While I support CAFTA, I acknowledge that it could do more to protect \nlabor rights in the CAFTA countries, it could be better on the \nenvironment and it could better take account of human rights in those \nnations. Therefore, CAFTA should not be seen in a vacuum. CAFTA is \nmerely one part of what must be a larger strategy for addressing our \nworkers' needs in a rapidly evolving world economy, and for addressing \nthe economic and political problems of our neighbors to the South.\n  I firmly believe that in the long run, encouraging export-led growth \nin developing countries will help raise incomes, tighten labor markets, \nand improve job standards in those countries. Opening markets will \ndrive political changes too. Open markets and democracy are the two \nprevailing political ideas of the present, and they will become even \nmore prevalent in the future. America has to remain the leader in \nexporting these powerful ideas to the entire world, and CAFTA is one \nmore step we can take to accomplish this.\n  I also strongly believe that our trade policy should couple trade \nliberalization with worker retraining and other creative, proactive and \nresponsive forms of labor assistance. Globalization will happen no \nmatter what. So we need to be prepared for these changes, and help \nassure that America's working families do not take the brunt of them.\n\n  That is why I am working with my colleagues to fully implement \nimprovements to the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program, TAA. TAA \nprovides workers with access to retraining programs, income support, \nand other benefits when they lose their jobs due to trade. And TAA \nworks--the Government Accountability Office reports that after TAA was \nlast modified, most workers are enrolling in training services sooner, \nfrom 107 days in Fiscal Year 2002 to 38 days in Fiscal Year 2003.\n  TAA must be expanded. We should raise the cap on TAA funds, since 35 \nStates in Fiscal Year 2004 did not have sufficient funds to cover funds \nthose States obligated and paid to TAA-eligible workers. After Trade \nPromotion Authority passed, we doubled the TAA program to help cushion \ndifficult transitions of workers whose jobs are lost because of trade. \nWe should plan ahead and increase TAA again, to coincide with enactment \nof CAFTA.\n\n  TAA and similar programs must also work better. We must plan ahead \nfor changes in our economy--these changes are inevitable, and our long-\nterm plan at training our workers to be prepared for these changes will \ndetermine whether America competes in the global market.\n  The 21st century marketplace is dynamic, and public policy must also \nbe flexible if we are to best take advantage of these changes. As our \neconomy continues to shift from a predominantly manufacturing base to a \nheavy service sector economy, government programs such as TAA must \ncontinue to reflect these changes.\n  Specifically, I support proposals such as the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance Equity for Service Workers Act, which would enhance TAA by \nextending the program to service sector and secondary service workers. \nCurrently only manufacturing workers qualify for these benefits. \nIncluding service sector workers merely reflects the realities of our \neconomy--America will lose somewhere between 500,000 and 3 million \nservice sector jobs to other countries in the next 10 years. I want to \nemphasize that these are not net job losses, but they will result in \npeople being displaced. People with service sector jobs have families \nin need just as sure as manufacturing workers do. They should share in \nthe TAA program.\n  We can also close loopholes that make it difficult for some older \nworkers to participate in an add-on to TAA that was meant specifically \nfor them. Now that we have identified these loopholes, it is good \ngovernment to close them. Our older workforce, some of whom are not the \nideal candidates for longer training courses, will benefit from closing \nthese loopholes and once this is done they will be placed in new jobs \nmore quickly.\n  Those concerns, especially about the need to make preparing our \nworkforce for the global economy a higher priority, can be addressed by \nCongress and the administration in the coming months, and I will work \nto achieve these goals moving forward. I ask unanimous consent that a \nletter from Ambassador Portman be printed in the Record.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, though we have much to do to make \nopening markets fairer to all those affected, CAFTA is good for \nWashingtonians, especially our farmers, it is good for America, and in \nthe long run it will be good for the people living in CAFTA countries \ntoo. I will vote for CAFTA and continue to work to maximize what \nWashingtonians get out of globalization, while also working to minimize \nthe negative side effects that sometimes result from it. Aggressively \nbalancing the impact of opening markets is the track we must all \naccept. America's economic future hangs in the balance.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, the United States \n           Trade Representative,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 28, 2005.\n      Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington DC.\n       Dear Jeff: As the Congress considers the Central America-\n     Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR), you have \n     raised concerns about ongoing efforts to improve enforcement \n     of labor laws and to monitor progress in this regard in the \n     CAFTA-DR signatory countries. As you know, Congress \n     appropriated $20 million in FY05 specifically for projects to \n     improve labor and environmental law enforcement in these \n     countries.\n       The recent House Appropriations Committee mark-up of the \n     FY06 Foreign Operations appropriations bill increases this \n     commitment for the next fiscal year, with $40 million \n     earmarked for labor and environmental enforcement capacity-\n     building in the CAFTA-DR signatory countries. The \n     Administration is willing to support this level of funding in \n     the FY06 Senate appropriations bill.\n       Furthermore, because we are willing to make a longer-term \n     commitment to improve labor and environmental law enforcement \n     in the CAFTA-DR countries, the Administration is willing to \n     propose and support this same level of labor/environment \n     capacity-building assistance for the next three fiscal years, \n     FY07 through FY09.\n       More specifically, you have suggested the assistance of the \n     International Labor Organization (ILO) in monitoring and \n     verifying progress in the Central American and Dominican \n     governments' efforts to improve labor law enforcement and \n     working conditions.\n       We are willing to implement your idea. Your proposal, as I \n     understand it, is that the ILO would make a transparent \n     public report of its findings every six months. The \n     Administration has now consulted with the ILO and determined \n     that this function would require additional funding to the \n     ILO of approximately $3 million annually. The Administration \n     is willing to devote approxiniately $3 million of the $20 \n     million in FY05 labor enforcement assistance monies to \n     support and fund this ILO monitoring initiative. To ensure \n     that this monitoring continues, the Administration is willing \n     to continue a funding commitment to ILO monitoring for the \n     next three fiscal years, FY07 through FY09.\n       The Administration also shares your goal of ensuring that \n     we pair expanded trade opportunities with economic \n     development assistance designed to ease the transition to \n     free trade, especially for rural farmers in our CAFTA-DR \n     partners. On June 13, 2005, the U.S. Millennium Challenge \n     Corporation (MCC) signed a $215 million compact with Honduras \n     targeted specifically at rural development and \n     infrastructure, and on the\n\n[[Page S7734]]\n\n     same day the MCC announced a $175 million compact with \n     Nicaragua that will be signed shortly.\n       As Secretary Rice and I have already communicated to you, \n     we are willing to give high priority to negotiating compacts \n     with El Salvador, Guatemala; and the Dominican Republic when \n     those countries become eligible for MCC assistance under \n     higher per capita income caps next year. I anticipate that \n     such compacts would provide substantial U.S. economic \n     assistance for rural development in these countries.\n       In addition, the administration has worked with the Inter-\n     American Development Bank (IDB) to provide new assistance, \n     including $10 million in new grants announced by the IDB \n     earlier this month for rural development and institution \n     building. I hope you will join me and officials from the IDB, \n     World Bank, and other institutions next month for an \n     international donors conference to discuss other ways we can \n     direct development assistance toward meeting the needs of \n     rural populations.\n       To address your specific concern about the period before \n     MCC compacts might be negotiated with El Salvador, Guatemala, \n     and the Dominican Republic, the administration is willing to \n     support additional spending for rural development assistance \n     of $10 million per year for each of those countries starting \n     in FY07 for a total of five years, or until the signing of an \n     MCC compact with such country, whichever comes first. This \n     amounts to a $150 million commitment in transitional rural \n     assistance for these countries over five years.\n       These monies will provide transition assistance to rural \n     farmers in these three countries for a defined period, while \n     preserving a very strong incentive for candidate countries to \n     meet the statutory criteria to receive what would likely be \n     much higher levels of economic assistance under an MCC \n     compact. Since the implementation of CAFTA-DR requires steps \n     which reinforce the statutory criteria for funding under the \n     MCC law, I believe that implementation of the agreement will \n     assist these three countries to move quickly toward \n     qualifying for a successful MCC compact with the United \n     States.\n       Furthermore, because many of the agreement's requirements \n     for agriculture liberalization in the CAFTA-DR countries for \n     sensitive commodities--such as dairy, poultry, and rice--will \n     not fully occur until ten, fifteen, or even twenty years \n     after CAFTA's implementation date, I am confident that this \n     transitional mechanism provides ample time for adjustment in \n     the rural economies of these nations.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Rob Portman.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to express my \nobjections to the U.S. Central American Free Trade Agreement, CAFTA. I \nhave spent a considerable amount of time reviewing the contents of the \nagreement and there remain outstanding questions regarding labor and \nagriculture. Until these questions are satisfactorily answered, I am \nopposed to the agreement.\n  Since June of 1998, Pennsylvania has lost 199,600 manufacturing jobs. \nNationwide nearly 900,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost. These \nstatistics are staggering. Unfortunately, this trade agreement would \nadversely affect this job loss in the United States; especially in \nPennsylvania. As I reviewed the agreement, I noticed the establishment \nof a new legal regime that increases safeguards for multinational \ninvestment through changes in tariff rates, rules of origin, and quota \nphase-outs, which would allow corporations in Central America to sell a \nproduct at a cheaper price. In order to compete under these conditions, \nmany U.S. corporations would have to shut down their operations, export \ntheir jobs, and leave skilled workers jobless. This agreement would \naggravate the problem.\n  In addition to job loss, this agreement fails to enhance workers' \nrights. Over the course of the last 5 years, Congress has worked to \nestablish a standard within trade agreements that protects workers' \nrights. In 2001, when Congress adopted the Jordanian Trade Agreement, \nlabor provisions were included in the body of the agreement. These \nlabor provisions were made subject to sanctions through the dispute \nresolution process. Unfortunately, this agreement only strives to \nenforce workers' rights but does not offer provisions for Central \nAmericans to unionize, collectively bargain, and secure the right to \nstrike.\n  Currently, the six CAFTA nations are subject to the Generalized \nSystem of Preferences, GSP, and the Caribbean Basin Initiative, CBI, \nwhich condition market access with respect to the International Labor \nOrganization, ILO, standards. Linking market access to labor \nprotections has been responsible for many significant labor reforms in \nCentral America in the last 20 years. However, if enacted, CAFTA does \nnot mandate that the labor laws of the Central American countries \ncomply with the International Labor Organization, ILO, core standards, \nwhich include freedom of association, the right to organize and bargain \ncollectively, and the freedom from child labor, forced labor, and \ndiscrimination.\n  Ultimately, CAFTA would create downward pressure on wages because it \nwould force our American workers to compete with Central American \nworkers who are working for lower wages. This would allow foreign based \ncompanies to expand while leaving America more dependent on imports \nfrom abroad, which in turn would lessen the demand for domestic \nproduction and create even greater economic instability.\n  Finally, CAFTA's impact on agriculture is problemsome. CAFTA will not \nopen new markets for American agriculture goods. The U.S. is already \nthe CAFTA regions largest trading partner. In many cases, our farm \nexports to the six CAFTA nations face tariffs that are low or \nnonexistent and dominate their agricultural markets in several \ncommodities. The International Trade Commission has indicated that \nthere would be little gain for agriculture. For example, currently, the \nU.S. supplies 94 percent of all grain into the region.\n  I urge my colleagues to carefully examine this trade agreement. As a \nnation, we cannot continue to allow the erosion of our manufacturing \nbase. Equally, CAFTA should continue to meet the labor standards \ncreated in previous trade agreements, which it must before I will \nconsider supporting it. For these reasons I am voting no.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, free trade--when done correctly--can be an \nimportant tool in building consumer demand for U.S. products worldwide, \nencouraging investment and growth in developing markets, and forging \nnew alliances. Today, Congress is considering an agreement to expand \ntrade with Central America and the Dominican Republic.\n  Delaware is already heavily engaged in trade with Central American \ncountries, with $25 million in exports in 2004. In fact, a large amount \nof the fruit imported through the Port of Wilmington by Chiquita and \nDole come from Central America. However, while 75 percent of Central \nAmerican products enter the United States tariff free, almost all U.S. \ngoods continue to face tariffs in Central America. The Dominican \nRepublic-Central America Free Trade Agreement, or DR-CAFTA, will level \nthe playing field for U.S. workers and businesses that rely on exports \nto Central America and the Dominican Republic by providing immediate, \nduty-free access for more than 80 percent of U.S. consumer and \nindustrial goods.\n  For Delaware, this will lift tariffs on the fabrics supplied by \ncompanies like Invista to sewing operations in Central America, making \ntextiles in the Americas more competitive with China. Delaware's \npoultry producers will finally gain access to Central American markets \nunder DR-CAFTA. When the agreement goes into effect, some U.S. chicken \nproducts will be given immediate duty-free access, and that access will \nexpand annually until duties are eliminated.\n  Free-trade agreements with developing countries also offer an \nopportunity to encourage reform. Certain reforms were accomplished in \nDR-CAFTA, such as competitive bidding for government contracts and \nprotection of copyrights, patents and trademarks--very important to \nDelaware companies such as AstraZeneca and Dupont.\n  However, we have not used the opportunity provided by the negotiation \nof this agreement to make as much progress as we should have, \nparticularly in improving conditions for workers and protecting the \nenvironment. Steady progress was made in the 1990s in the way these \nimportant issues were addressed. By the time the Jordan Free Trade \nAgreement was adopted in 2001, labor and environment provisions were \nall subject to sanctions through the agreement's dispute resolution \nprocess. This was an important advancement, not just for workers in \ndeveloping nations but also for competing workers and businesses in the \nUnited States. The agreements Congress has considered since 2001 have \nretreated from this\n\n[[Page S7735]]\n\nstrong enforcement standard, and this has unnecessarily weakened the \nbipartisan support for free trade that we have built over the years.\n  While I am pleased that the administration has agreed to support an \nincrease in funding to support efforts to improve labor and environment \nconditions in Central America, I am aware of no reason to back off of \nthe strong enforcement of labor and environmental obligations that we \nhave included in several agreements. Let me be clear. The \nadministration must include a greater level of enforcement of labor and \nenvironment standards in those trade agreements currently being \nnegotiated in order to be assured of garnering my support in the \nfuture. It is particularly important that we enforce the obligation not \nto backslide or repeal current labor and environmental laws and \nregulations.\n  I will be watching the negotiations of the Andean and Thailand trade \nagreements closely. If this administration is serious about getting \nthose approved, they will listen to the concerns that have been \nexpressed in the debate over DR-CAFTA, consult with Democrat and \nRepublican Senators during the course of those negotiations and send \nthe Senate free trade agreements with stronger enforcement of labor and \nenvironmental standards. In the months and years ahead.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, after serious deliberation, I will be \nvoting against the United States-Dominican Republic Central American \nFree Trade Agreement, or CAFTA. While I support the principle of free \ntrade, free trade must also be fair. I have supported our trade \nagreements with Australia, Jordan, and Morocco because these agreements \nreduce or eliminate barriers to American exports while preserving and \nprotecting important labor, environmental and security interests around \nthe globe.\n  A trade agreement between the United States and Central America with \nthe same safeguards has the potential to serve as an important tool for \npromoting development and advancing meaningful socioeconomic reform in \nthe region. That said, the agreement before us takes a significant step \nback from previous agreements with respect to both labor and \nenvironmental protections, and will only exacerbate the outsourcing of \nAmerican jobs and aggravate an already dangerous world trade imbalance. \nAmerican workers justifiably feel insecure in today's economy, and the \noutsourcing of American jobs at home is a major reason. The increasing \ntrade deficit puts an exclamation point on their concerns.\n  I would like to understand how this agreement is not just another in \na long line of bad trade agreements that exacerbate our trade problems. \nBefore we rush forward with policies that on the surface are failing, I \nwould like some assurances that this won't be just another punch to the \nstomach of American industry and American workers. What we have been \ndoing obviously has not been working. Why do we continue down this \nmisguided path? The American trade deficit over the past ten years \ndemonstrates we're on the wrong track.\n  At a more parochial level, since NAFTA was implemented in 1994, New \nJersey has lost 130,000 manufacturing jobs--46,000 as a direct result \nof NAFTA. New Jersey was once a center for manufacturing. In 1996, \nAllied Signal in Eatontown sent 230 jobs to Mexico, and required the \nlaid off workers to train their Mexican replacements. American Standard \nin Piscataway and Hamilton sent 495 jobs to Mexico. Patterson's textile \nindustry disappeared. I could go on and on about town after town in New \nJersey that lost jobs after NAFTA--from Millville to Elizabeth, from \nWoodbridge to Pennsauken. Another bad trade agreement is the last thing \nNew Jersey needs.\n  It is clear this is part of the Bush administration's misguided \nstrategy with respect to U.S. trade policy. The Bush administration has \nmade CAFTA, not China, is its No. 1 trade priority. Yet trade with \nCentral American countries represents only 1.5 percent of U.S. trade. \nThe Gross Metropolitan Product, GMP, of the city of Newark is $103 \nbillion, larger than the GDP of all of these countries combined, $85.2 \nbillion. Compare that with the fact that, just last year, the United \nStates ran a $162 billion trade deficit with China. Our trade deficit \nalone with China is nearly double the GDP of the entire Central \nAmerican trade region. This is a much more pressing issue for our \neconomic security, and we should be focusing our attention on where the \nrisks to imbalances are. Where is the pressure for currency adjustment \nwith China or the protection of intellectual property rights?\n  But this administration insists we first take up CAFTA, and so I feel \ncompelled to discuss my opposition to this agreement. Free trade \nagreements must protect the rights of workers, both at home and abroad. \nWhen NAFTA was passed by Congress more than eleven years ago, there was \ngreat hope that the agreement would create thousands of new jobs in \nAmerica and promote labor rights abroad.\n  Yet, as we stand here 11 years later, we know that the U.S. \nDepartment of Labor has certified more than 525,000 workers for NAFTA \ntrade adjustment assistance because their jobs were lost due to NAFTA \nimports or shifts in production to Canada or Mexico under NAFTA. Those \nsame numbers reveal that, through 2002, more than 46,000 New Jersey \nworkers had similarly lost their jobs. And the numbers are actually \nmore serious, because since 2002, the Department of Labor has refused \nto release these sobering statistics--some estimates suggest it is \ncloser to one million jobs lost.\n  The U.S. International Trade Commission, ITC, predicts that CAFTA \nwill actually increase the U.S. trade deficit with Central America \nbecause American companies will relocate their workforces and export \ntheir products back to the United States, just as companies did under \nNAFTA. This can continue to decimate communities across the country, as \nlocal plants shut down and the jobs moved overseas. NAFTA established \nthe Trade Adjustment Assistance program, TAA, to help thousands of \nmanufacturing workers receive retraining, keep their health insurance, \nand make a new start. But service sector jobs were left out. During the \npast several years, nearly half a million service jobs have moved \noffshore to other--mostly low-wage--countries. Senator Wyden's \nbipartisan amendment to extend TAA to service employees was accepted by \nthe Finance Committee. Yet, when President Bush sent the CAFTA \nlegislation to Congress, this amendment had been stripped from the \nbill. This amendment was sensible, it was fair, and it should have been \nincluded in this legislation.\n  For all of the harm CAFTA would cause U.S. workers, I am equally as \nconcerned about the harm the agreement could do to the rights and \nprotections of workers in Central America. A fair trade agreement must \nrequire each nation to improve domestic labor laws to meet basic \nworkers' rights. And it should discourage our trading partners from \nweakening or eliminating entirely their labor laws in order to gain an \nunfair trade advantage. But CAFTA does neither. CAFTA's lone \nenforceable workers' rights provision requires only that these \ncountries enforce their own labor laws--laws that our own State \nDepartment has said fail to meet recognized international standards. \nThis not the standard for commercial or investment standards. This \nfailure to include an enforceable requirement that labor laws meet \nbasic international standards represents a significant step backwards \nfrom the labor rights provisions of our agreement with Jordan, a \ncountry with significantly stronger labor protections. In our shared \ngoal at improving labor standards around the world, trade agreements \nlike CAFTA should be both the carrot and the stick. CAFTA is neither.\n  CAFTA proponents have argued that this agreement is the principle \nmeans to lift Central America out of poverty and promote these shared \nprinciples. But this agreement will not do that, and the consequences \nof NAFTA are evidence of why. Since NAFTA was implemented more than \neleven years ago, real wages in Mexico have fallen, the number of \npeople in poverty has grown, and the number of people illegally \nmigrating to the United States to seek work has doubled.\n  NAFTA's liberalization in the agriculture sector displaced more than \n1.7 million rural small farmers, overwhelming the 800,000 number of new \njobs created in the export processing sectors. Rather than learn from \nthese sobering failings by negotiating a trade\n\n[[Page S7736]]\n\nagreement that creates good jobs, guarantees worker rights, and lays \nthe groundwork for a strong middle class, the Administration has cloned \nNAFTA. Unfortunately, the results are likely to be the same.\n  What is also likely to be the same is the devastating impact on the \nenvironment that CAFTA is likely have on Central America. Central \nAmerica is one of the most biologically diverse areas of the world. The \nregion faces daunting environmental challenges that threaten its \npotential for sustainable development. Yet CAFTA would undermine hard-\nwon environmental protections by allowing foreign investors to \nchallenge environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries, \nincluding the U.S., that are parties to the agreement.\n  We have not learned the lessons of the past. This is another bad \ntrade agreement that fails to address the real economic issues our \nnation faces today. We should be addressing our trade imbalance. We \nshould be promoting job growth here in the United States, instead of \nfurther encouraging companies to move jobs elsewhere. I oppose CAFTA \nbecause it fails to preserve worker rights, protect the environment, or \npromote economic development at home and abroad. It is wrong for New \nJersey, and it is wrong for America.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, more than 20 years ago President Reagan \nmade a commitment to help the countries of Central America by providing \nthem with unilateral access to the U.S. market. Through preference \nprograms such as the Generalized System of Preference, GSP, and the \nCaribbean Basin Initiative, Congress and various administrations have \nsought to help our southern neighbors by promoting development and \nencouraging the building of democratic societies.\n  The Caribbean Basin Initiative has provided critical economic aid to \nthe fledgling democracies of Central America, and in the past 20 years, \nchaos has been replaced by commerce.\n  Since 1985, exports from the region to the United States have \nquadrupled; and today, the agreement that we are taking up seeks to \nprovide reciprocal access for our domestic producers.\n  Today, 80 percent of goods and services and 99 percent of \nagricultural products from the CAFTA-DR countries already enter the \nU.S. duty free. In contrast, our domestic producers face steep \ntariffs--which are essentially foreign taxes--into the region. Under \nCAFTA-DR, many of those tariffs would go to zero.\n  It is estimated that if approved, CAFTA-DR would result in \napproximately $1 billion in annual savings on tariffs for U.S. \nproducers.\n  Under CAFTA-DR, Oregon apple and pear growers, who currently face \ntariffs as high as 25 percent into the region, will benefit from \nimmediate duty elimination on fresh apples and pears.\n  Oregon potato producers benefit from duty elimination on certain \npotato products, including french fries, which will immediately become \nduty-free in most DR-CAFTA countries.\n  With $104 million in export sales and total cash receipts of $155 \nmillion, Oregon's wheat producers will benefit from the immediate \nelimination of tariffs on wheat and barley in all six countries. An \nAmerican Farm Bureau analysis shows that U.S. agriculture may gain $1.5 \nbillion in increased exports each year when the agreement is fully \nimplemented.\n  Oregon retailers, including Nike and Columbia Sportswear, would \nbenefit from greater market access and increased sourcing options.\n  Intel, another major employer in my state, stands to benefit from \nthis agreement. The CAFTA-DR countries combine to rank as Oregon's 10th \nlargest export market. According to the Office of Trade and Economic \nAnalysis, 94 percent of Oregon's exports to the region in 2003 were \nhigh-tech products. For the 15,500 Intel employees in Oregon, CAFTA-DR \nis critical for future growth in the region.\n  This agreement is about leveling the playing field for our domestic \nproducers. The CAFTA-DR countries already have access to our market; \nthis agreement gives our growers and manufactures a chance to thrive in \nDR-CAFTA markets.\n  In recent weeks, this agreement has been endorsed by the Oregonian, \nthe New York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, the \nLos Angeles Times, and USA Today.\n  I understand that there are those who are not entirely happy with \nthis agreement, including some in my own State. However, I come from a \nState in which one in four jobs is tied to exports. This agreement is \nabout increasing export opportunities for producers in my State and \naround the country.\n  A recent editorial in the Oregonian said this about the agreement:\n\n       It is disturbing to see Oregon and national leaders back \n     away from the principle that free and fair trade is good for \n     the United States and the rest of the world. People are \n     better off in an integrated global economy where they have \n     the opportunity to sell their goods, services, and skills \n     around the world.\n\n  As a businessman, I have seen firsthand the remarkable ability that \ntrade has to raise the standard of living both domestically and around \nthe world. I am hopeful that by passing this agreement, we will be able \nto create new growth opportunities for U.S. and Central American \nproducers, and we will be able to show that America truly is a leader \nin furthering free and fair trade.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I want, first to compliment the subcommittee \nchairman of the Energy and Water Appropriations bill, Senator Peter \nDomenici, and the ranking member, Senator Harry Reid, for the \noutstanding job they have done in putting together this bill. The well-\nbeing of the Nation depends greatly upon adequate investments in the \nmany programs and activities contained in this bill.\n  Through this measure, we are supporting the backbone of our Nation's \nwater transportation and flood protection programs through the Army \nCorps of Engineers; the irrigation water supply systems for the western \nStates through the Bureau of Reclamation; the protection of our \nNation's nuclear weapons stockpile; the advancement of science programs \nto help ensure that the United States remains a leader in the \ninternational scientific community; a number of independent agencies \nand commissions, including the Appalachian Regional Commission, the \nDenali Commission, and the Delta Regional Authority; and now, due to \nthe restructuring of subcommittee jurisdictions, the entire Department \nof Energy, DOE.\n  As part of that restructuring, the Energy and Water Subcommittee was \ncharged with oversight and appropriations responsibilities for the \nfossil energy research and development, R, within the Department of \nEnergy. Senator Domenici and I have long worked on these programs, and \nI thank him and Senator Reid and their staffs for their hard work, \ndiligence, and support for fossil energy research in this bill.\n  Through the Fossil Energy R programs, DOE supports research \ninvolving economically and environmentally sound use of our Nation's \ndomestically produced fossil energy resources. It forges partnerships \nbetween Government and industry to accelerate the development, \ndemonstration, and deployment of advanced technologies that show \npromise in helping to ensure cleaner, more reliable, and more \naffordable energy, now and in the future.\n  While the subcommittee did not hold a fiscal year 2006 budget hearing \non the fossil energy R programs this spring, I appreciate Senator \nDomenici's commitment to hold annual oversight hearings on the fossil \nenergy programs beginning next year. I look forward to participating in \nthese hearings as our fossil energy resources will continue to be \nimportant to this Nation.\n  I would also like to mention that the clean coal program, which falls \nunder the fossil energy portfolio, has been critical to the development \nof cleaner, low-carbon fossil energy technologies.\n  I created the Clean Coal Technology program in 1985, and I am very \nproud to report that after five solicitations, 32 projects have been \ncompleted, with a combined value of $3.7 billion Government/industry \ninvestments to develop advanced technologies that are resulting in \ncleaner, more efficient, and more cost-effective power generation.\n\n  The subsequent Clean Coal Power Initiative, started by President Bush \nin 2000, was to be a $2 billion demonstration program over 10 years, \nconsisting of four rounds of solicitations. The administration's fiscal \nyear 2006 budget request of $50 million falls woefully short of being \nable to keep the CCPI on a 2-year solicitation schedule. However, I am \nvery appreciative of the additional $50 million that was provided\n\n[[Page S7737]]\n\nby Senators Domenici and Reid, at my request. This funding will help to \npave the way for a third CCPI solicitation in the near future.\n  If we ever hope to increase our energy security, reduce our \ndependence on foreign energy resources, and develop fossil energy \ntechnologies that allow us to burn coal with little to no pollution, we \nmust adequately invest in these critical programs. There are no better \nchampions for energy research than Senator Domenici, Senator Reid, and \nme. We have been able not only to authorize initiatives so critical to \nAmerica's energy independence, but we also have been able to direct \nresources to those important efforts and keep them adequately funded \nfor at least another year.\n  On Tuesday, June 28, 2005, the Senate passed a bipartisan Energy \nbill, and I was happy to support that bill. It is generally a positive \nbill, but it is also very much of a business-as-usual approach toward \nenergy policy. This bill simply provides authorization for new and \nexisting programs related to energy policy. Despite the fact that the \nadministration is strongly pressing for an Energy bill, I have to \nwonder if the necessary funding to support this legislation will ever \nemerge in subsequent administration budgets.\n  Certainly, the administration's track record on funding other \nimportant measures like No Child Left Behind makes one wonder if energy \nfunding will face continued shortfalls despite the prized rhetoric and \nRose Garden ceremonies. Due to very constrained budget allocations, the \nAppropriations Committee is likely to find it extremely difficult to \nmaintain funding for current energy programs, to say nothing of adding \nfunding for the new or expanded energy programs in an Energy bill.\n  At least for the next fiscal year, the Senate's mark for the fossil \nenergy programs will keep these programs moving in the right direction, \ndespite the administration's budget cuts. Again, I thank the chairman \nand the ranking member of the Energy and Water Subcommittee and their \nstaff, Scott O'Malia, Roger Cockrell, Emily Brunini, Drew Willison, and \nNancy Olkewicz, for their extraordinary efforts in this regard and for \nproducing a bill that I believe we can all support.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose CAFTA for the reasons I \nstated earlier. It seems logical to say that if we want to expand our \nexport markets, we should be negotiating with countries who have a more \nsizable market for our goods and greater buying power to purchase our \ngoods. However, these CAFTA countries account for only 1.5 percent of \nU.S. exports.\n  Illinois is an agriculture State. I have supported prior trade \nagreements because of the benefit they have provided to agriculture. \nHowever, estimates that passage of CAFTA will produce sizable trade \ngains for U.S. farmers are overly optimistic. CAFTA countries have a \ncombined population of approximately 31 million people who generally \nhave limited incomes with which to purchase agriculture products. In \nfact, the market is only worth $1.6 billion in annual agriculture \nproducts.\n  According to the most recent data, the U.S. supplied 94 percent of \nall grains imported into the six CAFTA countries. This domination means \nthere is little room for further upward growth in grain exports to \nCAFTA nations.\n  I believe in international trade, provided it is fair trade and can \nexpand our economy and create jobs. But I have concluded that this \ntrade agreement will not do that. It is merely another product of this \nadministration's failed trade strategy--a strategy that has victimized \nAmerican manufacturers while costing millions of American workers their \njobs. The administration is so wedded to the notion that all is well \nthat it cannot hear the cries of those who would be harmed by this \ntrade agreement. The failure to take sufficient and educated steps to \nstrengthen America's future in this trade agreement is why I am \nopposing CAFTA.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, not that long ago, for the average \nAmerican, our world was not a threatening place. Not long ago, there \nwas little reason for the average American to feel anxious about the \nfuture. The United States was the only superpower; our economy was \nenjoying record growth and job creation.\n  Those things are no longer true. The rise of terrorism, the war in \nIraq, international economic competition from new sources like China \nand India, as well as increased economic insecurity here at home--\ntogether these forces have cost us a lot of our optimism, a lot of our \nself-confidence.\n  We are a people whose birthright is a belief in a better future, a \nbelief in our ability to control our own fate, at home and abroad. That \nis our national character. But these days, our character is being \ntested.\n  Even in the best of times, trade legislation has been a touchy \nsubject. These days, it can be among the most contentious issues we \nconfront. Our trade deals carry the freight of our insecurities, \neconomic and otherwise.\n  They carry our worries about our place in international competition, \nabout job security, about losing our grip on our standard of living. \nThere are real reasons that Americans are worried these days. Studies \nby the Federal Reserve and others confirm that income mobility--the \nopportunity for children to do better in life than their parents is \ndeclining, approaching the levels of more static, developing economies.\n  Without poring over statistics, Americans can see that happening. The \nreality of self-determination, the fact of social mobility, has been \nthe foundation of our optimism. When the facts change, when the pace of \nmobility slows, it shows. Instead of a generation or two between \npoverty and a solid middle class living, today it can take five or six \ngenerations.\n  We have yet to produce one single new job since this administration \ncame into office. Not one. Whomever you blame or however you explain \nit, that is a fact that registers in the lives of Americans. Not since \nthe Great Depression has it taken so long to replace lost jobs.\n  That is why long-term unemployment--over half a year looking for a \njob--is the lot of over a million and a half Americans.\n  These conditions keep wages low, falling behind the cost of living. \nReal wages are falling at a rate we haven't seen in 14 years.\n  Into these tough times comes the word that 2 billion new workers, in \nChina and India, to take the two biggest examples, are now competing \nwith Americans for new jobs created in the global economy.\n  These workers are highly motivated--the poverty they are rising from, \nthe pace of growth they can see in their cities, is a powerful \nincentive. Their governments are increasingly sophisticated about \nattracting investment and expertise from here and around the world to \nfuel their national economic strategies.\n  With these troubling trends, Americans are in no mood to accept text \nbook platitudes about the benefits of free trade. They want to see some \nof the gains come home.\n  I am personally convinced that trade is in fact not only ultimately \ngood for us, but inevitable. Standing at our shores, commanding the \ntides of trade to retreat, is not a plan for our Nation's economic \nfuture.\n  We fought and won a Cold War in the last century a war against a \ntotalitarian economic ideology, to protect and project American values \nof political and economic freedom in the world.\n  Now is not the time to doubt those values. They are still the right \nvalues for us, and the right values for the citizens of other nations. \nFree men and women, freely exchanging goods and ideas, innovating, \ncreating. That is the world we fought for, that is the evidence of our \nsuccess.\n  And what is the alternative? Do we expect to close our ports to \nproducts Americans want to buy? Can we expect to successfully block \nAmerican companies from seeking profitable investments overseas?\n  In today's world, American leadership is a reality. We cannot lead \nthe world in the search for security but at the same time retreat \neconomically. Trade can help cement peaceful ties, raise living \nstandards, give desperate people hope and put idle hands to work. Trade \nmust be part of our security strategy, or that strategy will not \nsucceed.\n  If there is to be a better world ahead of us, wealthier, healthier, \nfreer--and I\n\n[[Page S7738]]\n\nam certain that there is--then expanding international trade will be \npart of it. I don't think you can envision that world without expanding \ntrade ties, expanding economic integration.\n  But there is no free lunch. This world comes at a cost. It comes at \nthe cost of predictability, at the cost of stability. The economist \nJoseph Schumpeter called capitalism a process of creative destruction. \nAnd that it is.\n  The telephone replaced the telegraph, the automobile replaced the \nhorse, supermarkets replaced mom-and-pop grocery stores. Our farms are \nmechanized; our manufacturing is robotized; our information \nis computerized. With every new idea, with every new invention, an old \nproduct, an old technology, and the jobs they sustained, are left \nbehind.\n\n  Our Nation has become wealthy riding the waves of innovation, \nopportunity, efficiency, and economic growth. That, in part, is the \nAmerican way.\n  But another part of the American way is our shared commitment to each \nother. With every wave of change, from agrarian nation to manufacturing \npower, to the world's richest economy, we have created the institutions \nto cope with the human costs of economic change. Child labor laws, \nminimum wage, the 40-hour workweek, these are evidence of our values. \nAnd we have Social Security, Medicare, unemployment insurance--all ways \nto share the costs and spread the burdens of a churning economy.\n  Most fundamentally, we have established the rights of working men and \nwomen to bargain collectively for their wages and working conditions: \nthese things are also the American way.\n  When it is done right, trade makes us more efficient and more \nproductive. With the economic gains from trade we can afford to take \ncare of those whose jobs are lost as the new ones are created.\n  There is a human logic to this, a logic that says the men and women, \nand their families and communities, who are displaced by economic \nchange are not to blame for their fate. They should not shoulder alone \nthe costs of change while others reap the benefits.\n  There is an economic logic, as well--by compensating some for bearing \nthe cost of change, we keep innovation and opportunity expanding for \neveryone.\n  And finally there is a political logic. When we all know that we are \nnot alone, that there are resources we can draw on in tough times, we \ndon't have to fight change. Without that assurance, in our open \npolitical system, those who bear the cost of change and innovation \nwill--understandably--resist it.\n  If trade is ultimately good for our economy as a whole, we must make \nsure that it is good for American workers and their families, too.\n  This trade deal does not do that, and that is why I cannot support \nit.\n  I said 2 years ago that I was concerned about the lack of effective \nenforcement provisions for the labor standards in the Chile and \nSingapore trade deals, and the precedent that might set for the CAFTA \nnegotiations. What we now call the ``Jordan standard,'' that treats \nlabor provisions on the same terms as intellectual property and \ncommercial provisions, allows for effective enforcement when a party \nfails to live up to its labor rights commitments. That effective \nenforcement standard is part of the Jordan Free Trade Agreement, now in \neffect.\n  But instead of building on that success, CAFTA comes to us today \nwithout that effective means of enforcement.\n  At a time when the political support for trade is shaky at best, with \nAmerican families justifiably anxious about the volatility and \ninsecurity just below the surface of our economy, why would we roll \nback the standards for labor protections in our trade deals?\n  It just doesn't make any sense.\n  I notice that there is a lot of new language in this trade agreement \nabout labor rights in the countries of Central America and the \nDominican Republic. That shows that our negotiators are getting the \nmessage about how important those provisions are to the political \nsupport we need for trade.\n  But instead of providing labor standards with the same level of \neffective enforcement that American businesses will get for their \nconcerns, this deal leaves labor a second-class citizen.\n  But it is not just the specific terms of this trade deal that concern \nme today. If we are going to compete in today's global economy, we need \na plan to protect American living standards and a plan to keep our \nNation the most competitive on Earth.\n  We need a good defense, but we need a good offense, too.\n  We need a strong trade adjustment assistance program, and we need the \nwill to enforce it. We need to make sure that health insurance, \npensions, and other basic benefits are protected and portable in a \nchanging world.\n  I think we should consider a real wage insurance policy that \naddresses not just the jobs lost by trade--in reality, trade is a small \npart of the churning in our economy--but any job loss that could put a \nfamily's standard of living at risk.\n  If we do it right--and right now we just have a small pilot program \nout there--wage insurance could provide real help to families in \ntransition from one job to another and keep our labor markets open and \ndynamic.\n  But important as those kinds of protections can be, they are just \nplaying defense. Right now, I don't see a plan for an offense, a plan \nfor us to take on the rising competition from around the world, a plan \nto make American working men and women the winners.\n  That is going to take investments in education, in research, and in \nnew technologies. That is going to take a commitment to making our \nworkforce the most productive in the world, giving them the tools and \nthe skills they need to compete. That is going to take a plan to create \na new generation of good-paying jobs.\n  On the education front, Bill Gates has told us that our high school \ngraduates are not up to the standards his company needs. Newt Gingrich \nhas called the administration's lack of investment in basic research, \nand I quote, ``unilateral disarmament'' in the face of international \ncompetition. Those are not partisan attacks. Those are warnings we \ncannot ignore.\n  Because we don't have an adequate defense for the families who are \naffected by economic change, because we don't have an effective offense \nto win in a globalizing economy, I cannot lend my support to this trade \ndeal. It sends the wrong message, it sets the wrong example.\n  The CAFTA countries themselves are no more than 1 percent of our \ntrade. In many ways, they are not the issue here. I believe it will be \ngood for our country if these nations can enter our markets. It will \nmake those economies stronger, make them better neighbors, and open \nmarkets for the products made by American workers.\n  But only if the deal is done right. Only if we have the protections \nin place that can truly lift human rights, labor, and environmental \nstandards there, and build the protections for American workers and \nproducers here.\n  So I will vote against CAFTA not because I oppose trade but because I \nsupport smart trade, trade that works for American families, trade that \nis good for both sides.\n  I am afraid that more trade agreements along these lines will weaken \ndomestic support for expanding trade. We need the full, informed \nconsent of American citizens for trade, we need a trade agenda \nAmericans can support, and we need to a plan to defend our standard of \nliving here and to compete to win in the global economy.\n  We need to win the support of American working families for expanded \ntrade, and restore their faith in our ability to win. Until then, trade \ndeals like this one will just add to their worries.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I have spent many hours examining and \ndiscussing the agreement before us today.\n  As my colleagues know, my vote has never been a rubberstamp for trade \nagreements.\n  I take my responsibility to examine these agreements very seriously. \nMy constituents deserve no less. In the past, I have supported trade \nagreements, and I have opposed trade agreements, as their merits \ndemanded.\n  After long and careful thought, I have decided that I will support \nthe agreement with Central America which is before the Senate today.\n  This agreement is not perfect--far from it.\n  The phaseout times on many of the agricultural products are too long. \nWe should not be waiting for 10, 15, sometimes 20 years for duty-free \naccess to\n\n[[Page S7739]]\n\nsell our farm products in these countries. It is my understanding that \nthe protection of one particular American product was largely \nresponsible for the negotiating situation that led to the long tariff \nelimination schedules for so many of our farming products.\n  If not for the fact that, almost without exception, the Central \nAmerican countries have enjoyed duty-free access to our markets for \ntheir agricultural exports for years, these long tariff phaseout \nschedules might well have forced me to oppose this agreement.\n  The truth is, due to existing trade relationships, the various \nparties did not start out this trade negotiation on similar footings: \nWe paid to export to them and they did not pay to export to us.\n  While this agreement absolutely does not even this relationship as \nquickly and fairly as I would like, it does eventually get the job \ndone. While our farmers are often forced to wait far too long for duty-\nfree acess, that duty-free access does eventually go into place. The \nopportunity for new export markets for our farmers will be--\nultimately--beneficial to the folks in Kentucky, particularly the rural \nparts of my State.\n  While I have concerns about other parts of the agreement, \nparticularly some textile issues, there are also aspects of the \nagreement which are especially good for Kentucky.\n  Important to my State of Kentucky is the treatment of the exportation \nof tobacco products under the agreement. I was particularly pleased to \nsee that the report of the Agricultural Technical Advisory Committee \nfor Cotton, Peanuts, Planting Seeds and Tobacco, which included a \nmember of the Kentucky Farm Bureau, found the agreement to be fair \nregarding tobacco trade.\n  I was also pleased to see that this agreement immediately eliminates \ntariffs on bourbon and whiskeys exported from America. Furthermore, \nagreement for the recognition of ``bourbon'' as an exclusively \nKentucky-made product is important to an industry employing over 30,000 \nKentuckians.\n  I also want to bring the attention of my colleagues to the fact that \nthis agreement, while obviously primarily a trade agreement, also \nrepresents an opportunity for us to show our support to a region that \nhas come a long way in the area of democracy.\n  Not so long ago, most of us here will remember, democracy was not \nassured in this part of the world. In Central America--our own \nbackyard--communism was a threat. The United States has worked hard \nover the years and we have seen the menace of communism recede and the \ndemocracies and economies of El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua and \nHonduras begin to flourish.\n  We must not lose track of the message that the approval of this \nagreement will send to these new democracies on our doorstep. Without \nthis agreement, the democracies we have helped build in Central America \nwill be less prosperous in the increasingly competitive global \nmarketplace. We must allow these fledgling democracies the access they \nneed to compete with the overwhelming wave of Chinese imports.\n  It is the development of strong trade in goods and services that will \nhelp these countries to oppose a return to corrupt regimes that promote \ntrade in illegal drugs.\n  We in this body have done so much to foster democracy and economic \nstability in Central America. The approval of DR-CAFTA is another \nchance for us to show our support of these democratic governments.\n  I have come to believe after long and careful examination, that this \nagreement is good for the United States and for the future of Central \nAmerica. I urge my colleagues to support the agreement before us today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order----\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am proud to present to the Senate the \nAppropriations Committee's recommendations for fiscal year 2006 \nLegislative Branch appropriations, H.R. 2985. I would like to thank \nSenator Durbin, ranking member of the subcommittee, for his full \ncooperation in crafting the legislation. Under our recommendation, \nfunding for the legislative branch would total $3.83 billion in budget \nauthority and $3.84 billion in outlays. This is $230 million above the \nFY05 enacted level and a reduction of $194 million below the request. \nWhile there are very few programmatic increases in the bill, funding is \nsufficient to maintain current operations in all agencies. Significant \nincreases above the fiscal year 2005 budget are recommended in only a \nfew areas, such as funding to complete the Capitol Visitor Center.\n\n  Highlights of the bill include funding of $264.6 million for the \nCapitol Police, which will enable the Capitol Police to maintain its \ncurrent staffing level of 1,592 police officers and ensure appropriate \nlevels of security for the Capitol complex.\n  The recommendation also includes $427 million for the Architect of \nthe Capitol, including $42 million for Capitol Visitor Center \nconstruction and $2.3 million for initial operational costs of the CVC. \nThe Architect believes this amount will be sufficient to complete the \nCVC construction.\n  Also within the AOC budget is storage modules for the Library of \nCongress at Ft. Meade, totaling $40.7 million. While this is an \nexpensive project, it is critically needed to take care of burgeoning \nstorage requirements at the Library.\n  For the Library of Congress, funding would total $580 million, \nincluding funding for the Library's highest priorities such as the new \nNational Audio-Visual Conservation Center and Congressional Research \nService enhancements. A total of $9.8 million would be included for the \nBooks for the Blind digital talking book, as a ``downpayment'' on the \n$75 million effort to replace the current cassette playback system with \ndigital ``flash memory'' technology.\n  Funding for the GPO would total $126.9 million, including $5 million \nto retrain staff for the new digital environment; the Government \nAccountability Office would receive $484 million, and the Open World \nLeadership Program would be funded at the budget request level of $14 \nmillion.\n  Funding and language pertaining only to the House remains as passed \nby the House, pursuant to the normal protocol of comity between the two \nbodies.\n  This is a non-controversial and lean bill that meets the most \nimportant needs of the Congress and its support agencies, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support the bill.\n  Before closing, I would like to thank the staff who have been \ninvolved in this bill. Senator Durbin's staff, Nancy Olkewicz, Drew \nWillison and Pat Souders, and my own staff, Lance Landry, Carrie \nApostolou, and Christen Taylor.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for taking the time \nto engage in a colloquy to discuss a program funded in the Legislative \nBranch appropriations measure that is important to many Nevada \neducators.\n  In this bill, the Library of Congress is slated to receive $4 million \nfor continued development of the Adventure of the American Mind \nprogram. AAM facilitates the incorporation of digital collections into \nschool curricula. AAM provides teacher training so they can learn how \nto use primary resources in their classroom instruction. I think it is \nimportant to give educators and students--regardless of where they \nlive--access to what the Librarian of Congress, Dr. James Billington, \ncalls ``the world's largest repository of knowledge.'' I commend the \nchairman for his support for AAM.\n\n[[Page S7749]]\n\n  I know that he is aware of two Nevadans who have performed extensive \nwork to develop AAM. I am proud of my constituents. George and Carolyn \nBreaz of Las Vegas have traveled all over the country to train teachers \nin the five States that participate in the AAM Consortium. I believe it \nis through an oversight that my State of Nevada was not included as a \nmember of the consortium. It was perhaps my staff's oversight for not \ncommunicating my support for Nevada's participation to the previous \nchairman, Senator Campbell, during the expansion of this AAM \nconsortium.\n  I think that participation in AAM should be based on merit. I am not \nasking for special treatment for Nevada. Some states may get special \ntreatment. I don't know. I do know that Mr. and Mrs. Breaz have worked \nhard to get this program to where it is today, and I believe that \ntaxpayers have a right to expect that technical experts are developing \nAAM. The Breazes were quite devastated when they were not invited to \nparticipate in the AAM consortium, particularly given the amount of \nwork they devoted for the past 5 years.\n  It is my understanding that the chairman and his staff will advocate \nNevada's participation in this important project, whether it is through \na legislative or administrative solution, prior to the Legislative \nBranch appropriations bill becoming law. Is this correct?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Yes, that's correct.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Thank you for your support and for your personal \ncommitment to be as helpful as possible. I appreciate very much your \nassistance and the hard work of your staff.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I first congratulate Chairman Allard for \nsuccessfully crafting his first Legislative branch appropriations bill. \nIt has been a pleasure working through this process with him and I \nthank him for his leadership. He has done an exceptional job.\n  The Fiscal Year 2006 Legislative branch appropriations bill we are \nconsidering today is comprehensive, thorough, and fair. I want to thank \nChairman Cochran for providing us with an allocation which has allowed \nus to adequately fund the agencies that support the Legislative branch, \nsuch as the Capitol Police, the Government Accountability Office, the \nLibrary of Congress, and the Architect of the Capitol.\n  The bill we are presenting today provides funding to support the \nCapitol Police at the current staff level of 1,592 officers and 411 \ncivilian staff, along with anticipated cost-of-living adjustments and \nestimated overtime requirements. The bill also provides funding for 14 \nnew officers for the Capitol Visitor Center. I believe it is critical \nthat we provide adequate funding to support the men and women who put \ntheir lives on the line to protect us every day. Our bill does that.\n  The House Legislative branch bill made some painfully deep cuts to \nsome of our support agencies, particularly the Capitol Police, so we \nwill have a real challenge to face during conference.\n  This bill provides funding to the Architect of the Capitol to \ncomplete construction of the Capitol Visitor Center. I thank Chairman \nAllard for his diligence in holding monthly hearings to monitor the \nprogress of the CVC. These hearings have been very useful and \ninformative to the members of the subcommittee and have allowed us to \nmake the best of a very challenging situation.\n  I thank Chairman Allard for including funding for several projects \nwhich are very important to the State of Illinois--the Abraham Lincoln \nBicentennial Commission and the Adventures of the American Mind. I am \nalso happy to note that a legislative provision is included in this \nbill which provides permanent authorization for a program within the \nLibrary of Congress, the Digital Collections into School Curricula Act \nof 2005, which is patterned after the Adventures of the American Mind \nprogram.\n  Finally, I thank Carrie Apostolou, Fred Pagan, and Christen Taylor of \nthe majority staff, and Terry Sauvain, Drew Willison, and Nancy \nOlkewicz of the minority staff for their help on this bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this amendment No. 1082 provides $800,000 \nfor the NFB-NEWSLINE Service in the Books for the Blind and Physically \nHandicapped program in the Library of Congress as a provision of H.R. \n2985, the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2006.\n  The NFB-NEWSLINE service is a telephone-based electronic audio \nnewspaper service developed by the National Foundation of the Blind, \nNFB. The Service ensures that newspapers are directly accessible to \nblind readers at the same time when print publications are released.\n  In 1931, Congress established a national Books for the Blind program \nwithin the Nation's premier library, the Library of Congress, to be \nadministered by the National Library Service for the Blind and \nPhysically Handicapped, NLS. The Books for the Blind program continues \nto be the principal source of Braille and audio books and magazines for \nblind adults. At present, NFB-NEWSLINE offers over 150 newspapers and \nmagazines daily.\n  The ultimate goal of the Service is to ensure that blind-patrons have \nthe same opportunity for access to daily newspapers as sighted-patrons. \nThe following statistics support the need: Approximately 57,000 blind \nAmericans are enrolled in elementary, secondary or post-secondary \neducation programs. NFB-NEWSLINE helps them be more informed about \ncurrent events. Approximately 300,000 blind Americans are of working \nage. NFB-NEWSLINE supports them in numerous employment activities. \nApproximately 700,000 blind Americans are seniors, age 65 and older. \nNFB-NEWSLINE helps them keep up with current events in their community.\n  In 2001, Congress first appropriated funding to establish the NFB-\nNEWSLINE service in the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act. \nCongress subsequently appropriated funds in two Legislative Branch \nappropriations bills to pay the telecommunications costs for the \nelectronic service. The annual telecommunications costs, including \ninflation adjustments, are approximately $850,000.\n  Telecommunications service is the only cost for which a regular and \ncontinuing appropriation is needed from the Federal Government. Ongoing \noperation of the Service is paid for by State sponsors, including \npublic libraries and rehabilitation agencies, to help defray the \ntelecommunications costs associated with the dissemination of audio \ninformation to eligible individuals.\n  Many of you know that equal access for persons with disabilities has \nlong been a personal and family goal. My sister is an American with a \ndisability. She is a member of the National Foundation of the Blind.\n  The current appropriation will be expended at the end of 2005, making \nit essential to provide funding in fiscal year 2006. The funding level \nof $800,000 will ensure that the Service continues in fiscal year 2006 \nand that all persons with disabilities will continue to have equal \naccess to information.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The committee-reported amendments are agreed \nto.\n  The Lott-Dodd amendment No. 1082 is agreed to.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1082\n\n    (Purpose: To provide funds for the Librarian of Congress to pay \n  telecommunications costs for rapid dissemination of periodicals and \ndaily newspapers available to blind and physically handicapped readers)\n\n       On page 60, line 10, after ``expended'' insert ``and of \n     which $800,000 shall be available to the Librarian of \n     Congress to pay telecommunications costs for eligible readers \n     to have interstate toll free access to electronic editions of \n     periodicals and newspapers, disseminated in specialized audio \n     and electronic text formats from a multi-State nonprofit \n     source which obtains content from publishers for free \n     distribution to blind and physically handicapped readers in a \n     minimum of 20 States.''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am proud to present to the Senate the \nAppropriations Committee's recommendations for fiscal year 2006 \nLegislative Branch appropriations, H.R. 2985. I would like to thank \nSenator Durbin, ranking member of the subcommittee, for his full \ncooperation in crafting the legislation. Under our recommendation, \nfunding for the legislative branch would total $3.83 billion in budget \nauthority and $3.84 billion in outlays. This is $230 million above the \nFY05 enacted level and a reduction of $194 million below the request. \nWhile there are very few programmatic increases in the bill, funding is \nsufficient to maintain current operations in all agencies. Significant \nincreases above the fiscal year 2005 budget are recommended in only a \nfew areas, such as funding to complete the Capitol Visitor Center.\n\n  Highlights of the bill include funding of $264.6 million for the \nCapitol Police, which will enable the Capitol Police to maintain its \ncurrent staffing level of 1,592 police officers and ensure appropriate \nlevels of security for the Capitol complex.\n  The recommendation also includes $427 million for the Architect of \nthe Capitol, including $42 million for Capitol Visitor Center \nconstruction and $2.3 million for initial operational costs of the CVC. \nThe Architect believes this amount will be sufficient to complete the \nCVC construction.\n  Also within the AOC budget is storage modules for the Library of \nCongress at Ft. Meade, totaling $40.7 million. While this is an \nexpensive project, it is critically needed to take care of burgeoning \nstorage requirements at the Library.\n  For the Library of Congress, funding would total $580 million, \nincluding funding for the Library's highest priorities such as the new \nNational Audio-Visual Conservation Center and Congressional Research \nService enhancements. A total of $9.8 million would be included for the \nBooks for the Blind digital talking book, as a ``downpayment'' on the \n$75 million effort to replace the current cassette playback system with \ndigital ``flash memory'' technology.\n  Funding for the GPO would total $126.9 million, including $5 million \nto retrain staff for the new digital environment; the Government \nAccountability Office would receive $484 million, and the Open World \nLeadership Program would be funded at the budget request level of $14 \nmillion.\n  Funding and language pertaining only to the House remains as passed \nby the House, pursuant to the normal protocol of comity between the two \nbodies.\n  This is a non-controversial and lean bill that meets the most \nimportant needs of the Congress and its support agencies, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support the bill.\n  Before closing, I would like to thank the staff who have been \ninvolved in this bill. Senator Durbin's staff, Nancy Olkewicz, Drew \nWillison and Pat Souders, and my own staff, Lance Landry, Carrie \nApostolou, and Christen Taylor.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for taking the time \nto engage in a colloquy to discuss a program funded in the Legislative \nBranch appropriations measure that is important to many Nevada \neducators.\n  In this bill, the Library of Congress is slated to receive $4 million \nfor continued development of the Adventure of the American Mind \nprogram. AAM facilitates the incorporation of digital collections into \nschool curricula. AAM provides teacher training so they can learn how \nto use primary resources in their classroom instruction. I think it is \nimportant to give educators and students--regardless of where they \nlive--access to what the Librarian of Congress, Dr. James Billington, \ncalls ``the world's largest repository of knowledge.'' I commend the \nchairman for his support for AAM.\n\n[[Page S7749]]\n\n  I know that he is aware of two Nevadans who have performed extensive \nwork to develop AAM. I am proud of my constituents. George and Carolyn \nBreaz of Las Vegas have traveled all over the country to train teachers \nin the five States that participate in the AAM Consortium. I believe it \nis through an oversight that my State of Nevada was not included as a \nmember of the consortium. It was perhaps my staff's oversight for not \ncommunicating my support for Nevada's participation to the previous \nchairman, Senator Campbell, during the expansion of this AAM \nconsortium.\n  I think that participation in AAM should be based on merit. I am not \nasking for special treatment for Nevada. Some states may get special \ntreatment. I don't know. I do know that Mr. and Mrs. Breaz have worked \nhard to get this program to where it is today, and I believe that \ntaxpayers have a right to expect that technical experts are developing \nAAM. The Breazes were quite devastated when they were not invited to \nparticipate in the AAM consortium, particularly given the amount of \nwork they devoted for the past 5 years.\n  It is my understanding that the chairman and his staff will advocate \nNevada's participation in this important project, whether it is through \na legislative or administrative solution, prior to the Legislative \nBranch appropriations bill becoming law. Is this correct?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Yes, that's correct.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Thank you for your support and for your personal \ncommitment to be as helpful as possible. I appreciate very much your \nassistance and the hard work of your staff.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I first congratulate Chairman Allard for \nsuccessfully crafting his first Legislative branch appropriations bill. \nIt has been a pleasure working through this process with him and I \nthank him for his leadership. He has done an exceptional job.\n  The Fiscal Year 2006 Legislative branch appropriations bill we are \nconsidering today is comprehensive, thorough, and fair. I want to thank \nChairman Cochran for providing us with an allocation which has allowed \nus to adequately fund the agencies that support the Legislative branch, \nsuch as the Capitol Police, the Government Accountability Office, the \nLibrary of Congress, and the Architect of the Capitol.\n  The bill we are presenting today provides funding to support the \nCapitol Police at the current staff level of 1,592 officers and 411 \ncivilian staff, along with anticipated cost-of-living adjustments and \nestimated overtime requirements. The bill also provides funding for 14 \nnew officers for the Capitol Visitor Center. I believe it is critical \nthat we provide adequate funding to support the men and women who put \ntheir lives on the line to protect us every day. Our bill does that.\n  The House Legislative branch bill made some painfully deep cuts to \nsome of our support agencies, particularly the Capitol Police, so we \nwill have a real challenge to face during conference.\n  This bill provides funding to the Architect of the Capitol to \ncomplete construction of the Capitol Visitor Center. I thank Chairman \nAllard for his diligence in holding monthly hearings to monitor the \nprogress of the CVC. These hearings have been very useful and \ninformative to the members of the subcommittee and have allowed us to \nmake the best of a very challenging situation.\n  I thank Chairman Allard for including funding for several projects \nwhich are very important to the State of Illinois--the Abraham Lincoln \nBicentennial Commission and the Adventures of the American Mind. I am \nalso happy to note that a legislative provision is included in this \nbill which provides permanent authorization for a program within the \nLibrary of Congress, the Digital Collections into School Curricula Act \nof 2005, which is patterned after the Adventures of the American Mind \nprogram.\n  Finally, I thank Carrie Apostolou, Fred Pagan, and Christen Taylor of \nthe majority staff, and Terry Sauvain, Drew Willison, and Nancy \nOlkewicz of the minority staff for their help on this bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this amendment No. 1082 provides $800,000 \nfor the NFB-NEWSLINE Service in the Books for the Blind and Physically \nHandicapped program in the Library of Congress as a provision of H.R. \n2985, the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2006.\n  The NFB-NEWSLINE service is a telephone-based electronic audio \nnewspaper service developed by the National Foundation of the Blind, \nNFB. The Service ensures that newspapers are directly accessible to \nblind readers at the same time when print publications are released.\n  In 1931, Congress established a national Books for the Blind program \nwithin the Nation's premier library, the Library of Congress, to be \nadministered by the National Library Service for the Blind and \nPhysically Handicapped, NLS. The Books for the Blind program continues \nto be the principal source of Braille and audio books and magazines for \nblind adults. At present, NFB-NEWSLINE offers over 150 newspapers and \nmagazines daily.\n  The ultimate goal of the Service is to ensure that blind-patrons have \nthe same opportunity for access to daily newspapers as sighted-patrons. \nThe following statistics support the need: Approximately 57,000 blind \nAmericans are enrolled in elementary, secondary or post-secondary \neducation programs. NFB-NEWSLINE helps them be more informed about \ncurrent events. Approximately 300,000 blind Americans are of working \nage. NFB-NEWSLINE supports them in numerous employment activities. \nApproximately 700,000 blind Americans are seniors, age 65 and older. \nNFB-NEWSLINE helps them keep up with current events in their community.\n  In 2001, Congress first appropriated funding to establish the NFB-\nNEWSLINE service in the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act. \nCongress subsequently appropriated funds in two Legislative Branch \nappropriations bills to pay the telecommunications costs for the \nelectronic service. The annual telecommunications costs, including \ninflation adjustments, are approximately $850,000.\n  Telecommunications service is the only cost for which a regular and \ncontinuing appropriation is needed from the Federal Government. Ongoing \noperation of the Service is paid for by State sponsors, including \npublic libraries and rehabilitation agencies, to help defray the \ntelecommunications costs associated with the dissemination of audio \ninformation to eligible individuals.\n  Many of you know that equal access for persons with disabilities has \nlong been a personal and family goal. My sister is an American with a \ndisability. She is a member of the National Foundation of the Blind.\n  The current appropriation will be expended at the end of 2005, making \nit essential to provide funding in fiscal year 2006. The funding level \nof $800,000 will ensure that the Service continues in fiscal year 2006 \nand that all persons with disabilities will continue to have equal \naccess to information.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The committee-reported amendments are agreed \nto.\n  The Lott-Dodd amendment No. 1082 is agreed to.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1082\n\n    (Purpose: To provide funds for the Librarian of Congress to pay \n  telecommunications costs for rapid dissemination of periodicals and \ndaily newspapers available to blind and physically handicapped readers)\n\n       On page 60, line 10, after ``expended'' insert ``and of \n     which $800,000 shall be available to the Librarian of \n     Congress to pay telecommunications costs for eligible readers \n     to have interstate toll free access to electronic editions of \n     periodicals and newspapers, disseminated in specialized audio \n     and electronic text formats from a multi-State nonprofit \n     source which obtains content from publishers for free \n     distribution to blind and physically handicapped readers in a \n     minimum of 20 States.''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill is read a third time and passed. The \nmotion to reconsider is laid upon the table. The Senate insists on its \namendments and requests a conference with the House, and the Chair \nappoints the following conferees: Senators Allard, DeWine, Cochran, \nStevens, Durbin, Johnson, and Byrd.\n  (The bill will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n\n[[Page S7750]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7750-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7750-S7766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n DOMINICAN REPUBLIC-CENTRAL AMERICA-UNITED STATES FREE TRADE AGREEMENT \n                     IMPLEMENTATION ACT--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nAlabama is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I congratulate my colleague Senator \nAllard on his ability to move that legislation so rapidly. It makes you \nwonder maybe if we could do more things around here that way.\n  My colleague from North Dakota raises a concern about trade deficits. \nThis is something I have worried about, too. A lot of people seem less \nconcerned than we, but it does bother me.\n  There is some good news out there. We are getting jobs outsourced to \nour country. Alabama just had a number of good news items. Our \nMercedes, Daimler-Chrysler plant has doubled its employees to 4,000. \nHonda just doubled its plant in Alabama to 4,000. Hyundai, a South \nKorean company, just rolled out its first new automobile in a plant \nthat will have 4,000 employees and 7,000 employed by suppliers who \nprovide parts and components. Toyota has some 600 in the state as well. \nAustal, an Australian company, is building ships in Alabama. I don't \nknow exactly how trade works. I am not able to comprehend it all. \nSometimes it works good for you, and sometimes it doesn't.\n  I am not religious about free trade. I think there are some people \nwho have it in their heads that if we have free trade, there will be \npeace in the world and cancer will be cured and there will be no \nproblems left. That is not exactly so.\n  But trade is good. The more we trade, the better we get along, the \nmore prosperity that appears to exist. In my home State, unemployment \ncontinues to fall and is now below 4.5 percent. It has been falling \nregularly. I am not able to explain exactly why, because we are losing \ntextile jobs. But high-paid automotive jobs are coming in large \nnumbers. That is playing a good part in our advancement.\n  I have been concerned about this CAFTA agreement. I had not made up \nmy mind about how to vote on it. I have voted for some trade agreements \nand against other trade agreements. I think we should look at these \nagreements and see if it is a good deal or not. I had a particular \nconcern on the question of socks. Fort Payne, Alabama, is known as the \nsock capital of the world. It is also the hometown of the great singing \ngroup, Alabama. There are many wonderful people there that are \nconcerned about CAFTA. I spoke with one of them today about his \nconcerns.\n  I also met with Secretary of Commerce Gutierrez and spoke with Trade \nRepresentative Portman today to discuss my concerns with them. I now \nfeel much better about our ability to address them. They have indicated \nto me they understand the problem. They are concerned about it, and the \nAdministration will look for meaningful opportunities to be helpful in \nways that can make a difference for our sock industry. I feel a lot \nbetter about that question.\n  Looking at the matter as a whole, this is not a large agreement. \nThere exists about a $31 billion trade relationship between the United \nStates and the six CAFTA countries. That is, in the scheme of things, \nnot large. We have an almost balanced trade relationship with these \ncountries now. Without this agreement, when we ship domestically \nmanufactured goods to these countries, they face a much higher tariff \nthan when those countries ship goods to us. So if we execute this trade \nagreement, clearly more barriers will go down in those countries than \nin the United States. The experts tell us that under these \ncircumstances, we should certainly move to a trade surplus with these \ncountries. That is good. If we are concerned about a trade deficit, we \nought to vote for things that might help us go to a trade surplus.\n  The picture worldwide, however, is not so good. Looking at our trade \nwith the United Kingdom, Germany, and France, one sees a $140 billion \ntrade relationship. And we have a $65 billion trade deficit with those \ncountries. Look at China. We have a $231 billion trade relationship \nwith that country including a $160 billion trade deficit. Look at \nMexico and Canada, the NAFTA countries. We have a $266 billion trade \nrelationship with Mexico and a $445 billion trade relationship with \nCanada--$711 billion with just those two countries--with a trade \ndeficit of $110 billion.\n  The CAFTA nations are small countries by comparison. They want to \nprogress. They are young democracies. They are our neighbors south of \nus--many virtually directly south of my hometown of Mobile, Alabama. \nAnd they are good people. They have been friends to the United States. \nAny trade deficit is a concern, I acknowledge, but I would also point \nout that the proposed agreement with these countries would likely \nconvert it into a surplus.\n  As you look at trade and the relationships we have with these \ncountries, it is also important that we look at our national security \ninterests.\n  First, I believe this trade agreement will move us into an enhanced \ntrade relationship with these six countries. That enhanced trade \nrelationship will move us from a deficit to a surplus, and it will \nincrease trade between our countries, and that will be good for all of \nus. I am convinced it is good economics.\n  Second, and very importantly, these are our allies and friends. Let \nme ask you: how have they proven their friendship? I point out that \nevery one of these six countries supported our efforts in Iraq. Four of \nthem sent troops to Iraq. Four of these countries we are seeking to \nhave a level trade agreement with have actually sent troops to Iraq. Is \nthat true with Mexico, France, Canada, Germany, or China? I submit to \nyou that it is not. These CAFTA countries are our friends and neighbors \nwith whom we have a balanced trade relationship. If we pass this bill, \nwe can even move to a surplus.\n  Mr. President, I think it makes good economic sense. It makes good \nsense in terms of national security. Let me just say one other thing, \nquite frankly. One reason our trading relationship has not been as \nproductive with Mexico and other Latin American countries as some had \npredicted, I think, is because of the incredible surge of imports from \nChina. China got out ahead and they are moving forward and they are \nvery aggressive. We ought to take what steps we can, without \nhesitation, in my view, to make ourselves, our neighbors, our friends, \nand our allies more able to compete on a level playing field with \nChina. Why would that not be a good thing? I think it would be a good \nthing.\n  Mr. President, there are a number of considerations that I have \nevaluated as I have considered this trade agreement. I am convinced \nthat compared to most of them, if not all of them, this is probably the \nmost worthwhile trade agreement we have had presented to us. I think we \nought to ratify it and establish a closer bond and partnership with \nthese countries, our friends and neighbors. It will be good for our \neconomy and our national security.\n  I yield back such time as I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana for \nmaking the time available. I will be brief. In addition to what I said \nearlier today, I want to reference representations that have been made \nsince then. It is hard for anyone listening, and even for a Member \nwatching these proceedings, to separate the facts from all of the \nclaims and descriptions that are being presented.\n  Unfortunately, in complicated issues like this, even experts can \nreach different conclusions. So it is not surprising that Senators can \nreach different conclusions--often from different information or \ndifferent interests from the people we represent. I find it less \nunderstandable or acceptable when I hear mischaracterizations of the \nexpressed positions of other affected Americans. If somebody here or \nanybody else chooses to try to convince people that what is not good \nfor them is what they should believe is good for them, I will disagree, \nbut I won't object to that undertaking.\n  I do object, however, when the actual statements or the official \npositions by individuals or organizations are not accurately \nrepresented, especially ones being made as currently as today or \nyesterday. So I want the official public record of this debate to \nrecord accurately the positions on DR-CAFTA that have been taken by the \nAmerican\n\n[[Page S7751]]\n\nsugar industry in general and Minnesota's sugar beet farmers and \nworkers in particular.\n  A public statement issued today by the Red River Valley Sugarbeet \nGrowers Association and major Minnesota sugar beet cooperatives on \nbehalf of the State of Minnesota's sugar industry stated in part:\n\n     . . . and we remain convinced that a vote for CAFTA, based on \n     a short-term fix, places Minnesota's 20,000 sugarbeet farmers \n     and workers at risk.\n       Plain and simple: No deal was brokered that addresses our \n     concerns with CAFTA. And there appears to be no interest by \n     the U.S. Department of Agriculture or the U.S. Trade \n     Representative's office to find a long-term comprehensive \n     solution.\n       Our jobs, farms, factories, and way of life are on the \n     line. It's our livelihoods that hang in the balance of the \n     CAFTA vote, and we know what's best for us.\n\n       The administration's proposal to ``fix sugar'' is \n     unsustainable. It will not protect our jobs or Minnesota's \n     rural economy because CAFTA is a permanent trade agreement.\n       The men and women of Minnesota's sugar industry remain \n     adamantly opposed to CAFTA.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full statements by \nthe Minnesota organizations, plus the American Crystal Sugar Company \nletter and the American Sugar Alliance release be printed in the Record \nat the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, plain and simple, the Bush administration \nis trying to make temporary side deals that run contrary to the actual \nDR-CAFTA treaty to get the votes necessary to pass it. With the sugar \nindustry, the Secretary of Agriculture just yesterday announced his own \nfarm program, with no congressional hearings or review, to be paid for \nwith tax dollars, at his entire and sole discretion. It is, frankly, \nsuch an ill-considered, ill-designed, uneconomical and improper program \nthat if any member of the Senate Agriculture Committee on which I serve \nintroduced it, I think we would be run out of the room. If any Member \non the floor introduced it, I think it would be defeated overwhelmingly \nby a vote. Yet it is supposed to be sweetening this agreement and \nmaking it palatable to pass tonight. The Secretary will buy U.S. sugar \nand convert it to ethanol for no good reason, or economical reason, \nexcept to get this agreement passed in the Senate.\n  To their credit, the Minnesota sugar beet farmers, workers, and \nindustry leaders are not buying this boondoggle. They know it is a bad \ndeal for them. It is a bad deal for the U.S. agricultural economy, the \nethanol industry, and the American taxpayers. It is claimed to be for \nthem, but they don't want it. It is claimed to be good for them, but \nthey know it is not. It shows, however, an administration that is so \ndetermined, and perhaps desperate, to get what it wants--even though it \nis not what is best for America--that they will make the agreement even \nworse, at American taxpayer expense, with these kinds of side \nagreements and deals that should be rejected by the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             CAFTA Vote Critical to Sugar Industry's Future\n\n       In response to the upcoming U.S. Senate vote on the Central \n     America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), the Minnesota sugar \n     industry release the following statement (supported American \n     Crystal, Minn-Dak Farmers Cooperative, Red River Valley \n     Sugarbeet Growers Association and Southern Minnesota Beet \n     Sugar Cooperative):\n       ``The sugar industry has said throughout the debate on \n     CAFTA that the agreement presents our industry with short-\n     term and long-term problems. In the last few days an effort \n     was made to provide a short-term fix. Friends do sometimes \n     disagree, and we remain convinced that a vote for CAFTA, \n     based on a short-term fix, places Minnesota's 20,000 \n     sugarbeet farmers and workers at risk.\n       ``Plain and simple: No deal was brokered that addresses our \n     concerns with CAFTA. And, there appears to be no interest by \n     the U.S. Department of Agriculture or the U.S. Trade \n     Representative's office to find a long-term comprehensive \n     solution.\n       ``Our jobs, farms, factories, and way of life are on the \n     line.

We will continue to send the \n     message to Minnesota's lawmakers to vote against it.''\n       The Senate is expected to vote today. A House vote is \n     likely to occur before August.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    June 30, 2005.\n     Hon. Mark Dayton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dayton: Thank you for your strong support of \n     the Minnesota sugarbeet industry. Your understanding of the \n     threat to the sugar industry from regional and bilateral \n     trade agreements like CAFTA is sincerely appreciated.\n       Despite rumors and conjecture that recent discussions \n     between some Members of Congress and the Administration have \n     resolved the sugar industry's concern over the CAFTA, \n     American Crystal Sugar Company remains firmly opposed to the \n     trade agreement. We respectfully ask that you maintain your \n     strong opposition.\n       Sincerely,\n\n                                                  Kevin Price,\n\n                                   Director of Government Affairs,\n     American Crystal Sugar Company.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 Last-Ditch Efforts for Sugar Deal Fail\n\n       Washington.--Sugar industry leaders remained steadfast in \n     their opposition yesterday to the Central America Free Trade \n     Agreement (CAFTA). They rejected a repackaged, short-term \n     offer from Administration officials, who are seeking to drum \n     up last-minute support for the controversial trade deal, \n     which faces stiff opposition in Congress.\n       ``There is no deal, and it's obvious that there will be no \n     deal,'' said Terry Jones, a Wyoming sugarbeet farmer and \n     president of the American Sugarbeet Growers Association. ``We \n     have said all along that we need a long-term solution to our \n     problems with CAFTA and other trade agreements. What we were \n     presented yesterday was virtually the same short-term \n     proposal we'd already rejected.''\n       Once again, the Administration presented a concept to pay \n     foreign countries not to send America unneeded sugar for two \n     years. The only difference to the proposal was the promise to \n     perform a study to examine the viability of a sugar ethanol \n     program.\n       The Administration said this was the final offer and that \n     conversations would not continue. A reasonable and \n     comprehensive plan presented by sugar producers two weeks ago \n     was rejected by the Administration.\n       ``We are very appreciative of the members of Congress who \n     have spent so much of their time and energy looking for a \n     comprehensive solution to our CAFTA concerns,'' said Fritz \n     Stein, a Florida cane grower for the Sugar Cane Growers \n     Cooperative of Florida. ``We hope they understand why sugar \n     farmers oppose this deal. And, we hope they'll cast an \n     emphatic NO when they vote on CAFTA.''\n       ``A farmer-owned factory in Oregon recently stopped \n     processing sugarbeets because of unneeded imports to the U.S. \n     market,'' said beet farmer Perry Meuleman, who is also \n     president of the Idaho Sugarbeet Growers Association. ``This \n     same scene is playing out across the country, people are \n     losing jobs, and CAFTA on top of NAFTA, just exacerbates the \n     problem. It's time for Congress to open its eyes to the pain \n     trade agreements are causing and put a stop to it.''\n       The American Sugar Alliance vowed to work night and day to \n     defeat the trade pact.\n       Religious groups; numerous states government; trade unions; \n     small businesses; national farm associations; various textile \n     interests; environmental groups; and Latin American human \n     rights organizations are just a few of the groups that join \n     sugar farmers in calling for the swift and sound defeat of \n     CAFTA.--American Sugar Alliance, June 29, 2005.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nHampshire is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, in discussing this trade bill earlier \ntoday, and throughout the day, I think a lot of mention has been made \nof specific firms--firms that over the past number of years have been \naffected by international trade. There was a list on the floor that \nincluded companies such as Levi's and Fruit of the Loom. That is a \nfact. These companies have been affected. They are eligible for the \nTrade Adjustment and Assistance Program, and that is one of the \nchallenges of the job that we do as elected representatives. We see \nfirms in States grow, but we also see them have to deal with challenges \nof competition, both domestic and international competition.\n  In New Hampshire, my home State, we have had an electronics firm that \nsaw its plastic molding jobs go to Mexico. But even more recently, we \nhave seen a firm that did meat processing lose 500 or 600 jobs to some \nMidwestern States. So we see competition not just from overseas but \ndomestically as well.\n  At the same time, we cannot lose sight of the jobs that are created. \nOver the past year, I think 2.5 million jobs have been created in the \nUnited States. Over the last decade, it is a significantly greater \nnumber than that. It\n\n[[Page S7752]]\n\nhas been in areas like software, pharmaceuticals, and financial \nservices--significant, value-added, high-paying jobs.\n  That brings me back to the very basic question of why we even trade \nin the first place. We trade, and I support expanding opportunities for \ntrade and knocking down barriers to trade because it creates \nopportunities for consumers. It gives our consumers in America the \nopportunity and the freedom to buy the products they want, to purchase \nthe goods and services that they want to choose. It gives them access \nto products and services that they would not otherwise have. It is good \nfor American consumers, and it is good for our economy. It gives firms, \nlarge and small, in a similar way access to cheaper, affordable goods \nand services, and trade allows American individuals, American companies \nto focus on what we do best, thereby improving our productivity here at \nhome.\n\n  We want trade to be fair. Everyone talks about fair trade. If we look \nat the tariffs that exist today--this is a small card that was prepared \nby the chairman of the Finance Committee, but it highlights what we pay \nnow in tariffs of products coming into the United States: 10 percent, \n16 percent, 11 percent, 12 percent on products such as petroleum or \nchemicals, metals and metal products, motor vehicles and parts. We pay \n10, 12 or 15 percent in tariffs, and the countries that are affected by \nthis agreement today pay zero. We pay 10 or 12 percent, they pay zero. \nWhat this trade agreement will do is knock that tariff that U.S. \ncompanies and consumers pay down to zero on all the products I just \nmentioned. That is why this is a step in the right direction. That is \nwhy an agreement such as this that lowers tariffs benefits consumers, \ncreates a stronger global economy, but perhaps most important of all is \ngood and right for the U.S. economy.\n  I am very pleased to support S. 1307. I know it is very difficult for \nthe chairman and the ranking member of the Finance Committee to move \nsomething like this through their committee, but I appreciate their \nwork and congratulate them for their work and urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I believe the previous order had the \nSenator from Nevada going next.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senator from \nNevada is not here.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the next speaker be the Senator \nfrom North Dakota and as soon as the Senator from Nevada arrives, he \nfollows the Senator from North Dakota, if he is here on time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would sooner follow the Senator from Nevada by the \naccepted order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator restate what he said?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we have an order that is established. My \nunderstanding is that the Senator from Nevada is to speak next; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada sleeps on his rights \nif he is not here.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if you might want to further \ndisclose what ``sleeping on one's rights'' means? Ignore the question. \nWe will all assume the Senator from Nevada is awake, just not here.\n  I heard the discussions tonight about Central America. Earlier this \nevening, I heard about the need to help Central America. I have \ntraveled to, I think, all the countries involved. I have a great \naffection for the people of Central America. I also have great \naffection for a Central America that I would define--North Dakota, \nSouth Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa. We call that central America. I am very \ninterested in Central America south of our border but most especially \nhere. The question is, Will this advance the interests of Central \nAmerica and America?\n  My colleague just described how this provides new opportunities. It \nis interesting, I have been here through all of the trade agreements, I \nbelieve, all the recent trade agreements in the last 15 years or so. I \ndon't know that there are any new speeches, and that perhaps includes \nmine. They just dust off the old speeches: This means new opportunity. \nYou show them it did not mean new opportunity, it meant less \nopportunity. They say: No, no, you don't understand, this means new \nopportunity. It is like a script--a bad script, to be sure, but a \nscript. So away we go again.\n  I fear I know the results of the debate tonight. I have great respect \nfor the Senate. The vote we will commence following all of the speakers \nI assume will provide, once again, a victory for the President's \nefforts to get this CAFTA agreement passed. The reason I know that is \nlikely to be the case is because I have sat here and counted the number \nof times I heard my colleagues stand up and say: They promised, they \npromised, they promised me this, they promised me that, they promised \nme the other thing.\n  I am thinking we do not learn about promises, either. None of these \npromises mean a thing, not a whit. We heard them all, we have seen them \nall, and as soon as the vote is taken tonight, I say to those with \ntheir blue suits and their pride having extracted these wonderful \npromises, go to the front steps of the White House and then just speak \ninto the wind and understand that you did not get anything. What you \ngot was a vote. You were persuaded to vote for a trade agreement that \nis exactly as it is written. Side agreements mean nothing; promises \nmean nothing. They got your vote, they got the trade agreement, and it \nis one more chapter in a book of failed strategies. That is what \nhappens.\n\n  I will remain hopeful, however, that one day sufficient numbers of \nthis Congress and this Senate will decide that we are moving down the \nwrong road, we ought to turn around and change direction, and move in a \nway that expands opportunity for this country, cares a little bit about \nAmerican jobs, sets up competition--yes, a competition with others that \nincludes conditions that will raise others up rather than push us down. \nThat will one day, in my judgment, be something the American people \nwill demand of the Congress.\n  Apparently, not sufficient of them do so now, State after State, as \nrepresented by the votes that will be cast here later. But one day it \nwill happen. If it is too late, at some point the strength will be \nsapped from this country, and we will not long remain a world economic \npower unless we have a strong, growing, vibrant manufacturing base. We \nlost half of that manufacturing base in the last 25 years. We are \nlosing more of it as we speak. We face other challenges.\n  I just described this, which encapsulates a lot of the debate here: \n``China now wants to buy the ninth largest oil company in the U.S.'' \nThis encapsulates a whole series of issues about which we talked. I \nthink one day soon the American people will say to the Congress: You \nhave to wake up. You cannot be passing trade agreements that pull the \nrug out from under this country. Trade agreements must be mutually \nbeneficial, and I have not yet seen one in the last two decades.\n  So, Mr. President, I am going to vote no. I hope as many of my \ncolleagues who can will vote no. I hope one day soon those of us who \nfeel as I do will prevail. Apparently, tonight will not be the night.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields back the remainder of his \ntime. Under the previous order, the Senator from Montana is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this has been a long debate, and \ngenerally, in most respects, the statements have been a little bit one-\nsided: CAFTA is great, it is going to help; or CAFTA is a terrible \nidea; it will send us down the drain. I am hopeful because I sensed \nthat in the last 2 to 3 hours, the statements have been a little more \ntoward the center, trying to figure out realistically what is \nhappening, what is going on here.\n  I think it is true, we all know in this competitive world that trade \nis important, it is essential. Companies have to trade, people have to \ntrade both ways. If we do not, we are going to lose out big time. That \nis clear. There is not much doubt about that. But it is also true--and \nthis has not been sufficiently addressed, certainly not in this debate \nand certainly not in the country, is\n\n[[Page S7753]]\n\nhow we address the dislocations that happen on account of trade because \nso many people lose jobs through no fault of their own.\n  They work at a company, they work at a plant, say a manufacturing job \nat a plant, and the company seeking lower wages or lower health care \ncosts goes overseas, maybe seeking software development, R \ninvestment, and an American loses his job. This might be a 20-year-old, \nit might be a 50-year-old, who loses his or her job. It is not the \nfault of the employee. It is because of the system. It is because the \nworld is changing so dramatically. We have not begun at all to address \nwhat we should do about that.\n  We do have trade adjustment assistance. Trade adjustment assistance \ntoday applies only to persons who lose manufacturing jobs. It does help \npeople who lose manufacturing jobs get some assistance, get some \ntraining, get some health care benefits, but it ought to be easier to \nget, and it ought to cover more workers, including service workers.\n  What we care about is training people, finding ways for them to get \njobs that make a difference, to help them feel good about themselves \nwithout big dislocations in their families.\n  I might say we also are not addressing the larger trend that is \ncoming. We have lost, say, 3 million manufacturing jobs in America over \n2, 3, or 4 years. They are gone. We have also picked up a good number \nof jobs. But what is the area in which we have picked up a lot of jobs? \nLately, in the last couple of years, it is because of 9/11. It is \nhomeland security jobs. It is national defense jobs.\n  Clearly we need those jobs. But it makes one wonder a little bit, \nfirst, if there were no 9/11, sounds like there would be a huge net \nloss of jobs. We would not have the homeland security jobs we now have.\n  To make matters more, if not alarming, at least serious, is that \nalthough we have lost about 3 million manufacturing jobs, we picked up \nmaybe roughly the same in the homeland security jobs, the next wave is \ngoing to be much greater and it is going to make the loss of \nmanufacturing jobs pale in comparison. Our economy is creating and \ndestroying jobs at a faster and faster rate. The total number of jobs \nmay not be decreasing, but the rate of churn in the economy is getting \nfaster and faster, especially with service jobs. This country is not \nready for that. We have no paradigm, no structure, to deal with it. The \ndays when you could work single job for 30 years without updating your \nskills are over. We need to be more prepared, have more educated \nworkers, and more adjustment assistance.\n  Knowledge is not perfect. A little bit of knowledge is a dangerous \nthing. A book that I started to read is a good book that most Americans \nshould read, called ``The World Is Flat,'' by Thomas Friedman. If one \nreads that, they get a sense of how much technology, communications \ntechnologies, moves things from bottom up instead of top down. In the \neconomic world, nothing is sacred anymore. It is such a free-for-all. \nIt is the wild west in a certain sense. I do not think we are ready for \nthat.\n  So this debate has been helpful. It helps bring out some of the \nprovisions of CAFTA, what it does and does not do, but it does not \naddress the fundamentals. It does not address the basic problems we \nshould be addressing. I am quite hopeful that sooner rather than later \nwe are going to begin to address and we are going to hear Senators give \nspeeches on what needs to be done. After that, there will be some \nproposals and debates on those and I am very hopeful that will happen \nsooner rather than later.\n  With respect to the more narrow issue of CAFTA, it is my belief, \nfrankly, that regrettably the administration did not work with Congress \nas much as it should have. If it started earlier, we could very well \nhave had a big vote for CAFTA, especially with respect to sugar. The \nadministration came to Senators with the sugar concerns, beet sugar, \ncane sugar, very late in the game. In fact, there are negotiations \ngoing on right now. It is only because they realized they do not have \nthe votes, especially in the House, at least not yet. The same is true \nwith the labor provisions, no real negotiations, no real discussion \nthere. That is unfortunate because we are one of the two bodies trying \nto find ways to get trade agreements.\n  I must say, however, that is not true about environmental issues. \nAbout a year or so ago, I realized that on CAFTA, environmental issues \nwere going to be a big problem so I asked Ambassador Zoellick if he \ncould come over to my office and talk about it, and he did. I must say \nI appreciate the way Ambassador Zoellick, over a period of about a \nyear, dealt with the environmental issues so that would be much less of \nan issue in this agreement.\n  There has been a lot of talk about trade fatigue. Maybe the people of \nour country, Members of Congress, are beginning to wonder, gee, do \nthese agreements mean much. I think that is an appropriate question. \nThere is trade fatigue. One is because we are not enforcing our current \ntrade agreements as we should. If we were to start to enforce our trade \nagreements, I think Americans would start to think, hey, maybe our \nGovernment is doing something to help us out.\n  My final two points are this: We speak about job loss and we speak \nabout job gain. More importantly, there is a lot of talk about the \neconomy is doing better. It masks the real problems that are going on, \nand that is the tyranny of averages. Average numbers do not mean much \nof anything. Why? Because we are such a disparate country. Some people \nhave certain kinds of jobs. Some people have a lot of income, some \npeople do not. That is not the question, what is the average GDP in the \neconomy and all of that.\n  It helps a little bit, but we are representing people. There are \nemployees. They are the people who work and an awful lot of people are \ngetting hurt these days. A lot of people are doing very well. Bigger \ncompanies do very well, but a lot of people are not doing well, and a \nlot of people who work for big companies are not doing well.\n  I urge us to remember who we work for. We work for the people. They \nare the ones who elect or unelect us. I urge us to remember that point.\n  Finally, I will end where I began, namely, I am quite hopeful. I \nsense in this agreement, this debate, that people are starting to \nrealize what the real issues are and beginning to realize that maybe \nthe administration could have done a better job in talking to the \nCongress about the provisions that are in this agreement so that the \nCongress and the administration can work these out in subsequent trade \nagreements so we do not have quite the same problems we have tonight. \nAt least I hope so. I am hopeful that will happen.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Iowa is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I hope I can say the Senate is going to \npass S. 1307. I think we will do that. I am going to work the floor to \nmake sure that happens. We have had an awful lot of support expressed \nfor the bill today, and so I look forward to an announcement of a \nmajority vote.\n  I think history will record this important legislation as a positive \nstep in the development of democracy and prosperity in the CAFTA \ncountries that has developed over the last 20 years, greatly expanding \nthat. I am also confident that our leadership in passing CAFTA will be \nrewarded through benefits our Nation enjoys under this trade agreement, \nand more importantly, in the broader picture, advancing our overall \ntrade agenda, particularly with the Doha round of negotiations going on \nthroughout the course of 2005.\n  I also want to take a moment to compliment Senator Coleman of \nMinnesota. Senator Coleman has worked hard to create export \nopportunities for his farmers and manufacturers while looking after the \ninterests of his sugar farmers, who Senator Coleman clearly cares \ndeeply about.\n  Senator Coleman worked to get his sugar farmers disaster assistance a \ncouple years ago when they were originally ineligible. And now, Senator \nColeman has secured a commitment from this administration that the \nsugar import cap established in the farm bill will not be substantively \nviolated as long as this farm bill is in place.\n  I want to compliment him on his commitment and dedication to his \nconstituents. I appreciate his efforts to\n\n[[Page S7754]]\n\nfind a long-term solution to this complex issue.\n  I am ready to yield back the balance of time and proceed to a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has yielded back the remainder of \nhis time.\n  Under the previous order, the minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, of all the trade agreements this body has \nconsidered since I have been here, I would like to be able to support \nthis one. I think it is remarkable how the CAFTA countries have turned \nfrom pasts of violence and instability to hopeful democracies. The \ninitial economic and political reforms made by these countries are an \nimportant sign of progress.\n  Unfortunately, this trade agreement is seriously flawed. And, more \nimportantly, it is symptomatic of the Bush administration's rudderless \ntrade and economic policy.\n  The CAFTA countries account for less than 1.5 percent of total U.S. \ntrade. The combined economic size of the CAFTA countries is smaller \nthan each of the top 25 metropolitan areas in America. Yet, the Bush \nadministration has made CAFTA its number one trade priority this year. \nI don't know if the President even has any trade policies other than \nCAFTA.\n  I know that President Bush has no policy for dealing with the U.S. \ntrade deficit, which set a record last year of over $600 billion and is \non pace to surpass $700 billion this year.\n  Economists have warned that our trade deficit is unsustainable and \ncould threaten the U.S. and global economies. If anyone tells you that \nCAFTA will help reduce the deficit, they are confused or are being \nmisleading. The CAFTA countries account for just 0.3 percent of the \nU.S. trade deficit. They are barely a molecule of water in the \nproverbial drop in the bucket. Instead of coming up with a policy for \naddressing the deficit, the administration sits in denial. The Treasury \nSecretary even likes to say our enormous trade deficit is a sign of \nU.S. economic strength.\n  In order to fund the enormous U.S. deficit, the Nation has to borrow \nfrom foreign governments. The Bush administration has managed to \naccumulate more foreign-owned debt in 4 years--$921 billion--than the \nU.S. accumulated in the first 220 years of its existence.\n  I do not consider that a sign of strength; I consider it a cause for \nconcern. If the Bush administration does not acknowledge something is a \nproblem, how can you come up with a policy to fix it?\n  The Bush administration at least concedes that China is a problem. \nThe U.S. trade deficit with China was over $160 billion last year--more \nthan ten times the size of total U.S. exports to the CAFTA countries. \nWe had a $36 billion trade deficit with China just in advanced \ntechnology products--more than twice the total U.S. exports to CAFTA.\n  Yet the Bush administration's only policy seems to be empty rhetoric. \nIt has no strategy to ensure that China ends its currency manipulation. \nIt has no strategy to reduce China's 90 percent piracy rates. It has no \nstrategy for ensuring China complies with all its WTO obligations. It \nhas no strategy for responding to China's industrial policies in areas \ncritical to the U.S. economy, like high-tech goods, automobiles, \nsoftware, and energy.\n  Except for an occasional rhetorical oar splashing around the water, \nU.S. trade policy toward China is totally adrift.\n  The administration likes to note that the U.S. exports more to the \nCAFTA countries than to Russia, India, and Indonesia combined, as if \nthat is a great selling point for CAFTA.\n  But, that statistic is really an indictment of the administration's \ntrade policy. The economies of those three countries are more than 25 \ntimes the size of the CAFTA countries. Why do we export so little to \nthose three countries?\n  If the U.S. exported as much to Russia, India, and Indonesia as it \ndoes to the CAFTA countries--relative to the size of their GDPs, the \nU.S. would gain about $360 billion in exports--120 times the benefit \ntouted for CAFTA. Why are we focusing on CAFTA and not focusing on \nopening these and other markets that would make a much bigger \ndifference for the U.S. economy?\n  The Bush administration likes to negotiate new trade agreements, but \nit never gets around to enforcing the ones we already have. President \nClinton brought an average of 11 cases in the WTO each year to open \nforeign markets. The Bush administration brought 12 WTO cases total in \n4 years.\n  Once again, this administration has no policy for doing the things \nthat really matter for the U.S. economy. But it has given us CAFTA and \nall its flaws.\n  There are always winners and losers in trade agreements. The rich few \nin these countries will be the winners, while the poor majority will be \nthe losers. The CAFTA countries already have some of the highest levels \nof income inequality in the world. The CAFTA agreement will exacerbate \nthese problems rather than help them.\n  Democrats called for rules to help out the ``little guy'' in the \nCAFTA countries--stronger labor provisions and significant \ninvestments--but the Bush administration rejected them. The CAFTA \ncountries have serious worker rights abuses. The U.S. Department of \nState, the International Labor Organization, and numerous independent \nhuman rights groups have all catalogued these abuses extensively. El \nSalvador's independent government-appointed Human Rights Ombudsman put \nit well. As reported by the Washington Post last year, she ``said both \ngovernment and industry have `an explicit intent to destroy unions.' ''\n  CAFTA does not require that these countries' labor laws meet basic \ninternationally accepted standards. The CAFTA countries may weaken \ntheir labor laws at will. If one of the CAFTA countries allowed child \nlabor, blacklisting, or intimidation of workers, it would all be OK \nunder CAFTA.\n  Anyone who buys Bush administration claims that it sincerely wants to \ntry to improve worker rights in the region, I have some ocean front \nproperty in my home State to sell you. The Bush administration has \nconsistently sought major cuts in U.S. funds to the programs that \nimprove worker rights overseas. This administration simply does not \ncare about the issue.\n  As I said, it is inevitable that trade has winners and losers. The \nBush administration has ignored those who are hurt by expanded trade \nhere at home, however.\n  Democrats succeeded in getting an amendment added to CAFTA to provide \ntraining and assistance for more U.S. workers injured by trade. The \nBush administration stripped this provision out of the legislation.\n  Because of CAFTA's flaws, leading groups of Latinos have announced \ntheir opposition or raised serious concerns about it--including the \nCongressional Hispanic Caucus and Central American bishops. These \ngroups worry that CAFTA will hurt poor Latinos in Central America and \nhere at home.\n  This administration's trade policy--when it has one--is the wrong \npolicy for America. We should demand that the administration re-\nnegotiate CAFTA and come back with a better agreement that makes sense \nfor America and the region. More importantly, we should demand that the \nadministration develop a comprehensive trade policy that addresses the \ncritical issues, including the trade deficit, the emergence of China, \nand tough enforcement of U.S. rights under trade agreements, that \nreflect the priorities of the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the majority leader \nis recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Senate will shortly vote on CAFTA--the \nCentral American Free Trade Agreement.\n  This agreement will eliminate most trade barriers between the United \nStates, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and \nthe Dominican Republic.\n  Over the last half century, the United States has led the way to \nopening new markets and encouraging free trade around the globe. These \nefforts have had tremendous success.\n  Everyday, American consumers and businesses benefit from the \ncompetition and choice that trade expansion brings. As we promote free \nand fair trade agreements, we create economic opportunity and build \nrelationships that will continue to grow for years to come.\n  Under the agreement, six CAFTA countries will allow 80 percent our \nexports to enter their countries duty-free.\n  As a result, CAFTA will create our second largest export market in \nLatin America, behind only Mexico.\n\n[[Page S7755]]\n\n  This agreement is a huge opportunity for both sellers and buyers, for \nall people who make transactions happen. It's like opening a huge new \nstore for American businesses--where we get the same price for our \ngoods but--because we pay fewer tariffs--our customers pay less.\n  This is a win-win.\n  CAFTA will open the doors to 44 million new consumers of American \ngoods. And more sales to Central America means more jobs here at home.\n  With this agreement, over 27,000 new jobs will be created in its \nfirst year of implementation--over 500 of which will be in Tennessee. \nAnd 9 years after implementation, thanks to CAFTA over 137,000 \nAmericans--including over 2,000 Tennesseans--will have the benefit of a \nnew job.\n  CAFTA means jobs. American jobs. Tennessee jobs. It means more \nprosperity in our pockets.\n  Even more, CAFTA will allow our Nation to strengthen its bonds with \ncountries in the region. A stronger relationship will allow us to more \neffectively work together to fight the war on terror and enhance the \nsocial stability of these nations.\n  We can also make positive strides in combating the trafficking of \nillegal drugs. And, as a result, reduce the supply of drugs on our \nNation's streets and in our neighborhoods.\n  Furthermore, strengthening our mutual economic interests will \nstrengthen our national security.\n  Twenty years ago, only two of the CAFTA nations--Costa Rica and the \nUnited States--were established democracies. Today, all seven can be \ncounted among the free nations of the world.\n  CAFTA will bolster democracy in Central America and provide a model \nfor freedom seekers around the world.\n  We simply cannot leave the United States on the sidelines as other \nnations rush to embrace free trade. We have an opportunity to act with \nCAFTA.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this agreement. A vote for CAFTA is a \nvote for America's farmers and manufacturers. It is a vote for more \njobs for hardworking Americans. It is a vote for stable democracies and \nthe spread of freedom to all corners of our globe.\n  CAFTA will move America forward. It will move all the Americas \nforward.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Senate has just passed S.1307, the \nDominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement \nImplementation Act. I am confident that history will record this moment \nas an important positive step in the development of democracy and \nprosperity in the CAFTA countries. And I am also confident that our \nleadership in passing CAFTA will be rewarded, through the benefits we \nwill enjoy under this trade agreement and in terms of advancing our \noverall trade agenda.\n  First and foremost, today's vote reflects the leadership of President \nGeorge W. Bush to advance the national economic and security interests \nof this country. This agreement is another important piece of the \nPresident's overall agenda to increase market access opportunities for \nAmerica's farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and service providers. By \npassing CAFTA we also strengthen our position in the ongoing Doha \nDevelopment Agenda negotiations of the World Trade Organization. I hope \nour Trade Representative, Ambassador Portman, will build upon the \nmomentum created today to press for meaningful progress in the Doha \nRound negotiations.\n  I want to thank the members of the Administration who delivered the \ncomprehensive CAFTA agreement. At the top of that list is our former \nTrade Representative, Ambassador Zoellick, who managed to negotiate \nsuch a carefully balanced agreement without taking anything off the \ntable. I firmly believe that the guiding principle for all our trade \nnegotiations must be to deliver comprehensive agreements that do not \ntake anything off the table. I expect our trade negotiators to continue \ndelivering comprehensive agreements like CAFTA. Supporting Ambassador \nZoellick closely were Ambassador Allen Johnson, our chief agriculture \nnegotiator, and Regina Vargo, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for \nthe Americas. Of course, I am grateful too for the diligence with which \nAmbassador Portman has focused on CAFTA since taking over as our Trade \nRepresentative.\n  Today's successful outcome would not have been possible without the \nhard work and sustained effort of a number of dedicated professionals. \nI want to take this opportunity to thank them for their efforts. From \nthe White House Office of Legislative Affairs, I want to thank Mike \nSmythers, Special Assistant to the President for Senate Affairs. I also \nwant to thank Matt Niemeyer, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for \nCongressional Affairs. The long hours they put in to address Senate \nconcerns and to maintain an open dialogue with Members and staff are \nvery much appreciated. And supporting Mr. Niemeyer in those efforts was \nJennifer Mulveny, Deputy Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for \nCongressional Affairs. David Oliver, of the Office of General Counsel \nat USTR, also provided significant legal and technical support both \nduring and after the negotiations were completed.\n  I want to commend my colleague on the Finance Committee, the ranking \nmember, Senator Baucus. Although we did not agree in our views on \nCAFTA, we maintained our positive working relationship throughout the \nprocess. I hope the folks at home will take note. People may think \nWashington is mired in partisan bickering, but I think we on the \nFinance Committee have demonstrated our ability to disagree and still \nmaintain respect for each other and for committee process. I am \ngrateful to Senator Baucus, and very proud of our committee.\n  My diligent staff on the Finance Committee has worked very hard to \nmake today's vote possible. First and foremost, my chief counsel and \nstaff director, Kolan Davis, deserves recognition. His skills in \nmanaging my lengthy legislative agenda are key to my success. The chief \ninternational trade counsel to the committee, Everett Eissenstat, also \ndeserves special mention. Without Everett's tireless dedication to \npassing CAFTA, I really do not think we would be in this position \ntoday. I am also grateful for the strong support the rest of my trade \nstaff provided. David Johanson and Stephen Schaefer, international \ntrade counselors to the committee, were instrumental in providing legal \nadvice and technical support, as were Tiffany McCullen Atwell, \ninternational trade policy advisor, Claudia Bridgeford, international \ntrade policy assistant, and Russell Ugone, who is on detail to my staff \nfrom the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection in the Department of \nHomeland Security. And I want to note my gratitude for the many efforts \nof Zach Paulsen, former International trade policy assistant to the \ncommittee.\n  Senator Baucus' staff also deserves recognition for their \nprofessionalism and flexibility in helping to move the legislative \nprocess forward. I am grateful to Russ Sullivan, Democratic staff \ndirector, and Bill Dauster, deputy staff director, for their \naccommodation and dedication to the committee. I also appreciate the \nefforts of Brian Pomper, chief international trade counsel to\n\n[[Page S7766]]\n\nSenator Baucus, and the other members of the Democratic trade staff: \nShara Aranoff, Demetrios Marantis, Anya Landau, Janis Lazda, and \nChelsea Thomas.\n  Finally, I want to identify two people for special recognition. The \nfirst is Polly Craighill, senior counsel in the Senate's Office of \nLegislative Counsel. Her dedication to the Senate is profound. The \nFinance Committee benefits greatly from Ms. Craighill's expertise in \nlegislative drafting, her tireless efforts, and her constructive \nperfectionism. Today's vote is in no small part a testament to her \nskills. I also want to extend my deep gratitude to Jeanne Grimmett, \nlegislative attorney in the American Law Division of the Congressional \nResearch Service. My staff and I repeatedly called upon Ms. Grimmett to \nprepare legal research and memoranda in connection with our development \nof this legislation, and her timely support was instrumental to our \nsuccess today. I am very grateful.\n  I look forward to the enactment of this legislation and hope that \nPresident Bush will sign it into law very soon.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7766-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              SENATOR BURR RECEIVES THE GOLDEN GAVEL AWARD\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge an important feat of \none of our Members. At 10 o'clock this evening, the distinguished \nPresiding Officer, the Senator from North Carolina, Mr. Burr, reached \nhis 100th hour of presiding. I should clarify that it is 100 hours \nsince the beginning of this year. I know sometimes it has probably felt \nlike he has presided 100 hours in a week.\n  The reason this is important, according to the Senate Historian, is \nthis is the fastest time in reaching the 100- hour mark since presiding \nrecords have been kept.\n  (Applause.)\n  Senator Burr will be the first Senator in the 109th Congress to \nreceive the Golden Gavel Award. Most Members recognize that sitting in \nthat chair is the best way to learn Senate procedure. He has done so \nwith distinction and honor. He has done so with a firm but fair gavel. \nIn addition to his regular presiding times, he has been here on many \nMondays and Fridays, when a lot of us are at home and elsewhere. We \nthank him for that. We owe a debt of gratitude to him for doing that, \nand we thank him and congratulate him on this outstanding achievement.\n  (Applause.)\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I may comment. The reason I like Senator \nBurr so much is because he pays attention while he presides.

Mr. President, Members have been asking about the schedule \nfor tonight. We are proceeding to the Energy and Water appropriations \nbill. The chairman and ranking member will begin shortly. I do not \nbelieve we have many amendments to the bill. We will finish the bill \ntonight. I know the Senator from California will have an amendment, and \nit will require some debate and a vote.\n  We can begin that amendment--or I will leave it to the chair and \nranking member at this time. But the plans will be to have further \nrollcall votes, and we will complete the bill tonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am wondering, while the manager and \neverybody else is on the floor--we know we have at least one amendment \nthat will take some debate. I am wondering if everybody wants a vote on \nfinal passage.\n  We can do that. It will take a while to get through all this. There \nare no surprises. It has been around for a while. I am going to be \nhere, anyway, so it does not matter to me. I am wondering if we need to \nhave a rollcall vote on final passage.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the minority leader will yield, I was told there is a \nwhole stack of amendments going to be considered. I am sure some will \nrequire rollcall votes.\n  Mr. REID. We will certainly keep that in mind, but we also have an \nopportunity when the conference report comes back to take a look at it \nagain if someone needs a recorded vote. As we always do, we will work \nwith the Senator from Arizona, and if there are questions, of course, \nwe will be ready to have a rollcall vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before the Senator from Arizona leaves, \nbefore we started, we were aware of only one person--until the Senator \nfrom Arizona spoke, and we understand Senator McCain is going to see \nwhat he wants to do--who wanted a rollcall vote. Now we will look for \nany others and will be glad to work with the Senator's people. If he \nwill tell us now, we will share anything he would like as soon as \npossible.\n  For the information of the Senate, Senator Feinstein--permit me to \neditorialize a minute--has offered this amendment, or something like \nit, a couple times. We have voted on it, but she wants substantial \ntime, and certainly that is her privilege. We will not take much time \nin opposition.\n  For the benefit of our colleagues, how long does the Senator from \nCalifornia intend to take?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will take 15 minutes, Senator Kennedy 30 minutes, \nSenator Levin 15 minutes, and Senator Clinton 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that be the order of \nthose in support of the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There will be no others?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. On our side, unless somebody else wants time--on this \namendment, do you want time?\n  Mr. WARNER. On Feinstein.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. In opposition?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, that is 15 minutes in opposition, plus 5 \nminutes for me. There will be 20 minutes in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before we proceed, I say through the Chair \nto the distinguished Senator from Arizona, this is one of the smallest \nmanagers' packages I have ever seen. I think we have eight or nine \nitems in it, and they are ready for review right now.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, for the benefit of the Senator from \nNevada, there is a large stack of amendments my staff has just been \nhanded. Here we are at 10:15 at night, and we have never laid eyes on \nthem before. I say again to my colleagues, plan on rollcall votes.\n  Mr. REID. We do not have a large stack of amendments.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It is eight items. We will give them all to the Senator \nfrom Arizona. We have given them to him already.\n  Mr. REID. This is one of the smallest managers' packages I have ever \ndealt with.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to bring the Energy \nand Water bill for fiscal year 2006 to the floor for consideration. \nThanks to Chairman Cochran and his ranking member, Senator Robert Byrd, \nthe subcommittee allocation is $31.2 billion, an amount that is $1.5 \nbillion over the President's request.\n  Chairman Cochran has been generous to this subcommittee, and I am \ncommitted to supporting priorities that have been neglected or \nunderfunded in past budgets.\n  There are two priorities within this bill, and they are water and \nscience.\n  The first priority is water. As all the Members know, the request cut \nwater projects below the current year level.\n  In addition, the budget has imposed an OMB-originated formula to \nestablish priorities among water projects. I don't believe the OMB \nformula is fair, and we have ignored it for purposes of identifying \nworthy Corps projects in this bill.\n  I would also like to point out that there is an extensive discussion \nin the report regarding this committee's support of the Corps' ability \nto reprogram funds and utilize continuing contracts as an effective \ntool to manage the over 2,200 Corps projects and studies. The House has \nproposed to eliminate the Corps reprogramming authority and restrict \nits ability to focus resources on critical construction priorities.\n  Each construction project is different with numerous challenges, \nincluding weather, water flows and construction logistics, including \nmanpower and materials, that may cause significant delays. On the other \nhand, some projects are able to accelerate their schedule. Using the \nreprogramming authority the Corps is able to keep accelerated projects \non track by reprioritizing funds from delayed projects.\n  I have been contacted by many Members and heard from numerous \ncommunities who oppose the House language. I share their concerns and \nbelieve the House proposal is unworkable and would eliminate the Corps' \nability to prioritize work. These reforms are in the best interest of \nthe Corps or taxpayers.\n  The subcommittee has also provided funds to offset the $521 million \nin unfunded legislative assumptions included in the budget request \nassociated with the management of the Power Marketing Administration.\n  The second priority in this bill is science. Funding for both the \nboth Office of Science and the Stockpile Stewardship R accounts \nwithin NNSA received increases.\n  The budget request reduced the Office of Science funding by $136 \nmillion. This mark restores the cut and more, providing an increase of \n$240 million above the request.\n  I am also concerned about the funding reductions to the science-based \nstockpile steward ship accounts. I have attempted to restore this \nscientific capability that is essential to the certification of our \nnuclear deterrent without the validation of underground testing.\n  For the benefit of the Senate, I will review the highlights of this \nbill.\n  The mark provides $5.29 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers which \nis $966 million above the budget request.\n  We have included new construction projects and initiated new study \nstarts.\n  This bill ignores the OMB-developed formulation for the Corps as it \nwould negatively impact rural projects and projects that have already \nbegun construction.\n  This mark also ignores the administration's decision not to fund \nbeach renourishment. These projects are very important to many \ncommunities and likewise members of the Senate.\n  For the Bureau of Reclamation, this bill provides just over $1.08 \nbillion, an increase of $130 million above the President's request. \nThis project support water projects in 17 Western States and provides \n$60 million for Animas La Plata, an increase of $8 million over the \nreuestst. The committee provides full funding for Cal Fed of $37 \nmillion, and provides the current year funding for Water 2025.\n  For the Department of Energy, the mark provides $25.04 billion.\n\n[[Page S7780]]\n\n  For nuclear weapons activities of the National Nuclear Security \nAdministration), NNSA, the bill provides $6.55 billion, which is $76 \nmillion under the President's request.\n  This decrease is a result of the $222 million transfer of cleanup \noperations out of the NNSA to the Office of Environmental Management \nand a reduction in the NIF construction program.\n  The committee mark increases are targeted to the science-based \nStockpile Stewardship Program. Funding for the science, engineering and \nadvanced computing campaigns are up $164 million.\n  For nuclear nonproliferation activities the Senate bill provides $1.7 \nbillion, which is $91.8 million above the request and $236 million \nabove the current year level.\n  I think it is also important to mention that this subcommittee mark \nfully funds the plutonium disposition program, including $362.5 million \nfor the construction of both the Pit  Disassembly facility and well as \nMixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility in South Carolina.\n\n  This facility is our only pathway to permanently eliminate excessive \nand dangerous plutonium supplies. The NNSA spends tens of millions of \ndollars to protect this material that will not be necessary if we are \nable to turn plutonium into commercial nuclear fuel. It is our Nation's \nbest opportunity to undertake reprocessing.\n  The administration is making good headway in negotiations with the \nRussians, which I believe warrants full funding of this critical \nproject.\n  For the Yucca Mountain project, the Senate bill provides $577 \nmillion, which is consistent with current year funding and $65 million \nbelow the President's request.\n  This mark does not take a position on developing an interim storage \nfacility. While I personally believe that a central interim storage \nfacility makes sense, this bill is not the proper vehicle to have this \ndebate.\n  For the Energy Supply and Conservation Programs the subcommittee mark \nprovides $1.9 billion, an increase of $195 million above the request.\n  For nuclear energy R, the bill provides $499.9 million, which is \n$60 million above the President's request and $64 million over the \ncurrent year levels.\n  Also, Nuclear Power 2010, $76 million, an increase of $20 million and \nAdvanced Fuel Concepts Initiative, $85 million is provided, an increase \nof $15 million.\n  For the Office of Science, the bill provides $3.7 billion, an \nincrease of $240 million above the request and $102 million above the \ncurrent year level. We have provided $100 million to ensure that DOE \nfacilities operate at 100 percent capacity. A $40 million increase has \nbeen provided to accelerate the four planned facilities under the \nGenomes to Life program. And $30 million is provided to establish a \nnanotechnology transfer account.\n  For independent agencies, the mark provides: $67 million for the \nDenali Commission; $65.5 million for the Appalachian Regional \nCommission; $12 million for the Delta Regional Authority, an increase \nof $6 million over the President's request; and $734 million for the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission, an increase of $41 million over the \ncurrent year level.\n  Mr. President, to reiterate, I suggest there are many here worried \nabout water projects and the Corps of Engineers. This is the bill for \nall American water projects, the Corps, the Bureau of Land Management, \nand any others. This bill funds that at a level of $1.8 billion. That \nis $130 million more than the President and $63 million more than \ncurrent level.\n  This bill covers the Department of Energy. It covers all of the \nstockpile stewardship activities. It covers nonproliferation \nactivities. That is one for which the President has asked for \nsubstantial money.\n  Renewable R is in this bill with very substantial funding. There is \nnuclear research and development and, most importantly, we have \nsubstantially increased basic science research. This bill and this \nDepartment does a little more than one-third of the entire Nation's \nbasic science funding. We thought this was a year to increase it, not \ndecrease it. We have been told this is a time to increase it because we \nhave increased funding for health sciences over the past 10 to 12 years \nbut not basic science. We found money from other places to increase \nthat.\n  This bill also includes money for nuclear waste disposal. That has \nbeen very difficult. It also has Yucca Mountain and has the cleanup. It \nalso has three or four independent agencies.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise in support of the fiscal year 2006 \nEnergy and Water Appropriations Act as reported by the Committee on \nAppropriations on June 14, 2006.\n  This is a good bill, one that is fair to all of our Members and one \nthat I am pleased to support. There is always more that can be done, \nbut, given fiscal realities, this is a great effort. Chairman Domenici \ndeserves enormous credit for putting together such a comprehensive and \nfar-reaching bill.\n  My staff tells me that we have added nearly $1.5 billion to this \nbill. I find that figure to be misleading. The vast majority of the \ndollars we have added to this bill have been used to undo budget \ngimmicks that were, as usual, submitted with the administration's \nrequest and that Congress has wisely chosen to reject.\n  More importantly, this bill corrects oversights and large-scale \nneglect on the part of the administration, particularly in regards to \nthe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n  When the administration sends up a budget that not only deletes the \npriorities of Congress, but also deletes their own priorities of just a \nfew months ago, something is wrong.\n  Fully 65 percent of the funds added to this bill have been spent \nwithin the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, mostly to try to restore cuts \nthat would halt construction on hundreds of projects nationwide. Many \nof the construction projects slated for termination are in their final \nyear of construction.\n  Only OMB could dream up a budget request that would forego tens of \nmillions of dollars in future economic benefits to save a couple of \nbucks this year.\n  Chairman Domenici and I have heard our colleagues with unmistakable \nclarity:\n  Our Members want flood control projects to protect their citizens.\n  Our Members want navigation projects to allow goods and services to \nmore easily get into the international marketplace.\n  Our Members want rural water projects that will allow rural Americans \nto have access to the same safe drinking water that our citizens in \ncities and suburbs take for granted.\n  We have heard our colleagues, and we have acted. My only regret is \nthat we could not do more.\n  I am also delighted with the emphasis that Chairman Domenici has \nplaced on science in this bill.\n  The Energy and Water bill contains one of the largest pots of funding \nfor long-term research and development in the physical sciences to be \nfound anywhere in our Federal Government. In fiscal year 2006, we will \ninvest over $3.7 billion in DOE's Office of Science, $240 million more \nthan the request.\n  The administration's request reduced user time on national science \nfacilities to as few as zero to 5 weeks in many cases.\n  That is ridiculous. Year after year Congress shells out tens if not \nhundreds of millions of dollars to build world class scientific user \nfacilities, such as the Spallation Neutron Source and others, and then \nthe administration does not even bother to fund their operation. It \njust strikes me as amazingly short-sighted and disappointing.\n  However, I am very pleased that we have been able to restore optimum \noperations at all of these facilities nationwide without harming any of \nthe other base programs.\n  Our bill also provides impressive funding for research and \ndevelopment in renewable energy, fossil energy, and nuclear energy. All \nin all, this is a balanced bill that will help us improve our Nation's \nenergy future on many different fronts. As we all know, Chairman \nDomenici was able to send a comprehensive energy bill into conference \nearlier this week and that is a huge accomplishment. However, it is in \nthis bill, the Energy and Water Appropriations Act, that the actual \nfunding for energy research and development can be found. \nAuthorizations are nice, but appropriated dollars are better.\n  As always, I would like to take a moment before wrapping up to thank \nthe Energy and Water Subcommittee staff\n\n[[Page S7781]]\n\nfor their fine work on this bill. First, Chairman Domenici hired a new \nclerk this year, Scott O'Malia. As always, the transition between \nclerks has been seamless. Also thanks to Emily Brunini who joined the \nsubcommittee last year from Chairman Cochran's staff.\n  Roger Cockrell has had the unenviable task of working on water for \nboth the majority and minority this year and has done an outstanding \njob for all 100 Members. I look forward to him returning to my staff \nnext year.\n  Finally, thanks to Drew Willison and Nancy Olkewicz of my staff. They \nboth do a great job for me on this bill, and Nancy also works for \nSenator Durbin on the legislative branch bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1085\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Kennedy, \nFeingold, Dorgan, Levin, Wyden, Clinton, Mikulski, Lautenberg, Boxer, \nReed, Harkin, and Biden, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself, \n     Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Levin, Mr. Wyden, \n     Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \n     Reed, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Biden, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1085.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for the Robust Nuclear Earth \n   Penetrator and utilize the amount of funds otherwise available to \n                       reduce the National debt)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) Prohibition on Use of Funds for Robust Nuclear \n     Earth Penetrator.--None of the funds appropriated or \n     otherwise made available by this Act may be used for any \n     purpose related to the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator \n     (RNEP).\n       (b) Utilization of Amount for Reduction of Public Debt.--Of \n     the amounts appropriated by this Act, an amount equal to the \n     amount of funds covered by the prohibition in subsection (a) \n     shall not be obligated or expended, but shall be utilized \n     instead solely for purposes of the reduction of the public \n     debt.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I was 13 years old when I saw this \npicture. When we discuss nuclear weapons, this is the picture I \nremember. The only country on Earth that has ever used nuclear weapons \nis our own. It has been debated ever since whether this was positive \nbecause it saved American troops and ended the war or whether it has \nlaunched our country and other countries into a race which well could \nprove disastrous for all of us.\n  This is a photograph of Hiroshima after the nuclear bomb was dropped \non the city on August 6, 1945. Mr. President, 80,000 people died from \nthe initial blast and 60,000 people died from radiation poisoning, for \na total of 140,000 people dead. And that bomb was 15 kilotons.\n  The second photograph is of Nagasaki after August 9, 1945. \nApproximately 75,000 of the city's 240,000 residents were killed \ninstantly. In total, approximately 100,000 people died in the blast.\n  I rise today once again to address a critical issue that is related \nto the security of the American people and our nuclear proliferation \nefforts: the renewed push by this administration to reopen the nuclear \ndoor, including funding for a 100-kiloton nuclear bunker buster.\n  I have argued this on the Senate floor before, that such actions, \ncombined with the policy of unilateralism and preemption, run counter \nto our values and nonproliferation efforts and put U.S. national \nsecurity interests and American lives at risk. Therefore, those of us \nwho are cosponsors of this amendment wish to delete the $4 million, for \nthe study and development of the robust nuclear earth penetrator. The \namendment redirects the funds for debt reduction.\n  The time has come for this Senate, like the House has done in this \nbill, to send a clear and unambiguous message to the White House and \nthe Pentagon: We will not support funding for programs to develop new \nnuclear weapons.\n  Congress made a strong statement last year in deleting funding for \nthe development of this nuclear bunker buster by eliminating $27.5 \nmillion for the bunker buster, $9 million for the advanced concepts \ninitiative, which included the study of the development of low-yield \nweapons. This action was due in no small part to the leadership of \nRepresentative David Hobson, chairman of the House Appropriations \nEnergy Committee. The House took a strong position of opposition and \nthey are to be commended.\n  In fact, the House removed new nuclear weapons from all bills, \nincluding the Fiscal Year 2006 Defense authorization bill, the Fiscal \nYear 2006 Defense appropriations bill, and the 2006 Energy \nappropriations bill. This was a consequential victory for those of us \nwho believe the United States sends the wrong signal to the rest of the \nworld by reopening the nuclear door and beginning the testing and \ndevelopment of a new generation of nuclear weapons. That is why I was \nso disappointed to learn that the administration requested funds this \nyear to resume the nuclear earth penetrator study.\n  As a matter of fact, this year Secretary Rumsfeld asked the \nDepartment of Energy to place the $4 million in the energy budget and \n$4.5 million in the defense budget, thereby splitting the amount \nrequested for the bunker buster. He hoped to weaken opposition and \nsplit the budget between two Departments so that if it could not get \nfunding in one, he could get it in the other. The House had the \nforesight to reject this idea and has reasserted its determination not \nto move forward with the bunker buster study.\n  During its markup on the 2006 Defense authorization bill, the House \nArmed Services Committee eliminated all the Department of Energy \nfunding for the RNEP, and transferred the $4 million to the Air Force \nbudget for work on a conventional nonnuclear version of the bunker \nbuster. The House Armed Services Committee member, Silvestre Reyes, \nstated: The committee took the ``N,'' or ``nuclear,'' out of the RNEP \nprogram.\n  Following the Armed Services Committee action, Chairman Hobson and \nRepresentative Ellen Tauscher led the effort to eliminate the \nDepartment of Energy funding of $4 million for the bunker buster in its \nmarkup in the 2006 Energy and Water appropriations bill. That bill also \neliminated funding for the modern pit facility and banned site \nselection for the facility in 2006.\n  Finally, the House 2006 Defense appropriations bill limits research \nfor a bunker buster to a conventional program. These three actions by \nauthorizers and appropriators, Republicans and Democrats alike, have \ndealt another blow to the administration's plans to develop new nuclear \nweapons and reinforced the clear intent of Congress that we should not \ngo down that path because it will only encourage the very proliferation \nwe are trying to prevent.\n  Why should the Senate continue to fund programs that are rapidly \nlosing support in the House and the administration? Now the Senate has \nan opportunity to follow the House's lead. Senator Kennedy and I and \nothers have come to the floor to offer this amendment to do just that.\n  During previous debates on this issue, we have argued that according \nto the laws of physics, it is simply not possible for a missile casing \non a nuclear warhead to survive a thrust into the earth to take out a \nhard and deeply buried military target without spewing millions of tons \nof cubic feet of radiation into the atmosphere. Consider this: A 1-\nkiloton nuclear weapon detonated 25 to 50 feet underground would dig a \ncrater the size of Ground Zero in New York and eject 1 million cubic \nfeet of radioactive debris into the air.\n  Given the insurmountable physics problems associated with burrowing a \nwarhead deep into the earth, one would need a weapon with more than 100 \nkilotons of yield to destroy an underground target at a depth of 1,000 \nfeet.\n  Now let me explain. The maximum feasible depth of a bunker buster is \n35 feet. At that depth, a 100-kiloton bunker buster would scatter 100 \nmillion cubic feet of radioactive debris into the atmosphere. There is \nno known missile casing that can survive a 1,000-foot thrust into the \nEarth and avoid overwhelming and catastrophic consequences. That is a \nfact. There is not a single scientist who will say that.\n\n[[Page S7782]]\n\nThe head of the National Nuclear Security Administration agrees.\n  At the March 2, 2005, House Armed Services Strategic Forces \nSubcommittee, Congresswoman Ellen Tauscher asked Ambassador Linton \nBrooks, the following question:\n\n       I just want to know is there any way a [robust nuclear \n     earth penetrator] of any size that we would drop would not \n     produce a huge amount of radioactive debris?\n\n  The Ambassador replied:\n\n       No, there is not.\n\n  When Congresswoman Tauscher asked him how deep he thought a bunker \nbuster could go, he answered:\n\n       . . . a couple of tens of meters, maybe. I mean certainly--\n     I must apologize for my lack of precision if we in the \n     administration have suggested that it was possible to have a \n     bomb that penetrated far enough to trap all fallout. I don't \n     believe that--I don't believe the law of physics will ever \n     let that be true.\n\n  Here is the head of the National Nuclear Security Administration \nsaying there is no way one can drive a missile casing deep enough to \nprevent radioactive spewing.\n  Let me just show what this means. For a 100-kiloton weapon, one would \nhave to drive it 800 feet deep into the earth to contain the nuclear \nfallout. One can only drive it a small distance: 35 feet. So the result \nis 1.5 million tons of radioactivity. If it is 5 kilotons, one would \nhave to drive it 320 feet. One could only drive it 35 feet. The spewing \nof radioactive debris is 200,000 tons. If it is 1 kiloton, one would \nhave to drive it 220 feet. One could only drive it 35 feet and the \nradioactivity is 60,000 tons. If it is .2 kilotons, one would have to \ndrive it 120 feet. One can only drive it 35 feet, and the radioactive \nspewing is 25,000 tons.\n  This is not from me. This is the National Academy of Sciences, \nnuclear scientists, physicists, the head of the National Nuclear \nSecurity Administration. There is widespread agreement about this. So \nwhy are we doing it?\n  On April 27, the National Academies of Sciences study commissioned by \nCongress to study the anticipated health and environmental effects of \nthe Nuclear Earth Penetrator Weapon found that current experience and \nempirical predictions indicate that the Earth-penetrating weapons \ncannot penetrate to depths required for total containment of the \neffects of a nuclear explosion. It would take a 300-kiloton weapon at a \npenetration of 3 meters, or 10 feet, to destroy hard and deeply buried \ntargets at 200 meters, or 656 feet.\n  To destroy a hard and deeply buried target at 300 meters you would \nneed a 1-megaton weapon--not kiloton, megaton. The number of casualties \nfrom an Earth penetrator weapon detonated at a few meters depth is, for \nall practical purposes, equal to that of a surface burst of the same \nweapon yield.\n  That is what the National Academies of Sciences studies say. For \nattacks near or in densely populated areas, using Nuclear Earth \nPenetrator Weapons on hard and deeply buried targets, the number of \ncasualties can range from thousands to more than a million, depending \nprimarily on weapon yield.\n  The bottom line is that a bunker buster cannot penetrate into the \nEarth deeply enough to avoid massive casualties and the spewing of \nmillions of cubic feet of radioactive materials into the atmosphere. It \nwould result in the death of up to a million people or more if used in \na densely populated area.\n  This chart shows that. The source is the National Resources Defense \nCouncil and the EPA. What it shows is the predicted radioactive fallout \nfrom a B61-11 300-kiloton explosion in West Pyongyang, North Korea, \nusing historical weather data for the month of May.\n  Here is the blast, here is Seoul, here is the radioactive fallout.\n  Why are we doing this? It makes no sense.\n  I think this is the strongest evidence to date that we should not \nmove forward with this study and that we should put a stop to it once \nand for all. In reality, this has never been about a study. It has been \nabout the intent of this administration to develop new nuclear weapons. \nWhile the administration is silent this year on how much it plans to \nspend on the program in the future, last year's budget request totaled \n$485 million on the robust nuclear earth penetrator over 5 years. This \n5-year figure was omitted this year.\n  Let's look, for a brief moment, at the policies underlying this \nrequest, for they, too, have not been changed. The 2002 Nuclear Posture \nReview places nuclear weapons----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I yield myself another 5 minutes.\n  The 2002 Nuclear Posture Review places nuclear weapons as part of the \nstrategic triad. Therefore, the aim is to blur the distinction between \nconventional and nuclear weapons. This makes them easier to use.\n  National Security Directive 17 indicates that the United States would \nengage in a first use of nuclear weapons--a historic statement in \nitself. We have never had a first-use policy. We have always had \nstrategic ambiguity, but we have never before said we would ever \ncountenance a first use of nuclear weapons. In Security Directive 17 it \nis said in response to a chemical or biological attack--and seven \nnations are actually named--we would consider a nuclear response. In \nessence, these policies encourage other nations, and they have \nencouraged North Korea and they have encouraged Iran--those are two of \nthe nations suggested--to develop their own nuclear weapons, thereby \nputting American lives and our own national security interests at risk.\n  We are telling the world, when it comes to nuclear weapons: Do as we \nsay, not as we do. I object to that policy. It is hypocrisy.\n  There are alternatives. I have just been briefed by Northrop Grumman \non a program they are working on with Boeing to develop a conventional \nbunker buster, the Massive Ordnance Penetrator, which is designed to go \ndeeper than any nuclear bunker buster and take out 25 percent of \nunderground and deeply buried targets. This 30,000-pound weapon, 20 \nfeet in length, with 6,000 pounds of high explosives, will be delivered \nfrom a B-2 or a B-52 bomber. It can burrow 60 meters into the ground \nthrough 5,000 psi of reinforced concrete. It will burrow 8 meters into \nthe ground through 10,000 psi reinforced concrete.\n  We have already spent $6 million on this program, and design and \nground testing are scheduled to be completed next year.\n  We should focus on conventional programs. The House has said this. \nThe Senate should concur.\n  We have a solemn obligation to spend our resources in the most \neffective manner and to make this country safer and more secure. That \nis why I am so concerned about this administration's decision to come \nback to Congress and request additional funds for new nuclear weapons.\n  I would like to give my kudos and congratulations to the House of \nRepresentatives. They truly have their heads on straight. I am \ndelighted that they have eliminated the authorization and the funding \nfor this entire program in the 2006 appropriation. I urge us to do the \nsame on just one part of this, which is the nuclear bunker buster, $4 \nmillion.\n  I yield 15 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kennedy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator. I think I had consent for a half-\nhour. I do not expect to use it all.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The Senator is right. I change that to a half-hour.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. First, I commend my friend and colleague, Senator \nFeinstein, for her attention to this issue. She has long been an \nadvocate for sensible and responsible nuclear arms policy. Again, this \nevening, she is leading the way in the Senate. All of us are grateful \nfor her leadership. I welcome the opportunity to join with her in \noffering this amendment.\n  It is intended to reverse a reckless proposal by the Bush \nadministration to develop a new generation of nuclear weapons.\n  We do not ``provide for the common defense,'' as called for in our \nConstitution, by launching a new nuclear arms race and making the world \nmore dangerous, but that is precisely what the administration plans to \ndo.\n  President Bush and Secretary Rumsfeld want to develop a new tactical \nnuclear weapon called the robust nuclear earth penetrator, and their \nhope is that these bunker busters can crash deep into the Earth and \ndestroy bunkers and weapons caches. They hold the dangerous and \nmisguided belief that our Nation's interests and values are served by \ndeveloping what they consider a more easily usable nuclear bomb.\n\n[[Page S7783]]\n\n  I think most Americans believe that is wrong. Our challenge in \naddressing nuclear nonproliferation issues is not that there are too \nfew nuclear weapons in the world but that there are too many; not that \nthey are too difficult to use but that they are too easy to use.\n  North Korea has them and is rattling its nuclear saber every day. \nIran is moving forward on the development of nuclear capability. We all \nhope and pray that al-Qaida and other terrorist groups never ever get \ntheir hands on a nuclear weapon.\n  So why on Earth, in this dangerous nuclear world, with the specter of \na nuclear cloud at the hands of terrorists and rogue states, should the \nUnited States be adding more nuclear weapons to the global arsenal? \nWhat moral authority do we have to ask others to give up their nukes if \nwe are determined to develop a new generation of nuclear weapons of our \nown?\n  For the past 2 years, Congress has raised major doubts about the \nprogram and significantly cut back on its funding. But the \nadministration still presses forward for more work on these robust \nnuclear earth penetrators. Last year, the administration requested $15 \nmillion for it and Congress reluctantly provided half that amount. For \n2005, they requested another $27 million and submitted a 5-year request \nfor nearly $500 million. But cooler heads prevailed, and the House \nAppropriations Committee rejected the request. As the committee report \nstated,\n\n       The Committee continues to oppose the diversion of \n     resources and intellectual capital away from the most serious \n     issues that confront the management of the nation's nuclear \n     deterrent . . . The Committee remains unconvinced by the \n     Department's superficial assurance that the RNEP activity is \n     only a study . . . The Committee notes that the management \n     direction for the fiscal year 2004 sent to the directors of \n     the weapons design laboratories left little doubt that the \n     objective of the program was to advance the most extreme new \n     nuclear weapon goals irrespective of any reservations \n     expressed by Congress.\n\n  This year, nothing has changed. The FY06 budget request from the \nPresident includes $4 million for the Department of Energy to study the \nbunker buster and $4.5 million to the Department of Defense for the \nsame purpose. Thankfully our colleagues in the House were wiser and \ndecided to eliminate its funding.\n  The administration obviously is still committed to this reckless \napproach. Secretary Rumsfeld made his position clear in January, when \nhe wrote to Secretary Abraham:\n\n       I think we should request funds in FY06 and FY07 to \n     complete the RNEP study . . . You can count on my support for \n     your efforts to revitalize the nuclear weapons infrastructure \n     and to complete the RNEP study.\n\n  The fiscal year 2006 budget requests funds only to complete the \nfeasibility study for these new nuclear weapons. But we already know \nwhat the next step is. In the budget they sent us last year, the \nadministration stated in plain language that they intend to develop it.\n  Ambassador Linton Brooks, the head of the National Nuclear Security \nAdministration, claims those future budget projections are merely \nplaceholders, ``in the event the President decides to proceed with \ndevelopment and Congress approves.'' But their fiscal year 2005 budget \nclearly shows the administration's unmistakable intention to develop, \nand ultimately produce, this weapon.\n  The Bush administration would like us to believe that this is a \nclean, surgical nuclear weapon. They say it will burrow into \nunderground targets and destroy them with no adverse consequences for \nthe environment. They can believe all they want, but the science says \ntheir claims are false.\n  The National Academy of Sciences confirms exactly what most of us \nthought--that these nuclear weapons, like other nuclear bombs, result \nin catastrophic nuclear fallout. The fallout can poison tens of \nmillions of people and create radioactive lands for years and years to \ncome.\n  The study goes on to say, ``Current experience and empirical \npredictions indicate that earth-penetrator weapons cannot penetrate to \ndepths required for total containment of the effects of a nuclear \nexplosion. . . .\n  To be fully contained, a 300 kiloton weapon would have to be \ndetonated at the bottom of a carefully stemmed emplacement hole about \n800 meters deep. Because the practical penetration depth for an earth \npenetrating weapon is a few meters--a small fraction of the depth for \nthe full containment--there will be blast, thermal, initial nuclear \nradiation, and fallout effects from use of an EPW.\n  This chart simulates the likely nuclear fallout from a one megaton \nbunker-buster detonated at a hypothetical underground target 20 \nkilometers east of an Iranian air force base in Dezful. This model uses \nthe same simulation program as the Pentagon's Defense Threat Reduction \nAgency. During summer months, the nuclear fallout is predicted to \ntravel 150 to 200 miles, across Iraq and Saudi Arabia. The radiation \ncould kill up to 650,000 people.\n  Even the person in charge of the program, Linton Brooks, conceded at \na House Armed Services Committee Hearing on March 2 that the robust \nnuclear earth penetrator could not be used without significant nuclear \nfallout. He stated:\n\n       I really must apologize for my lack of precision if we in \n     the Administration have suggested that it was possible to \n     have a bomb that penetrated far enough to trap all fallout. I \n     don't believe that--I don't believe the laws of physics will \n     ever let that be true.\n\n  This chart depicts a 400 kiloton bunkerbuster hitting underground \nfacilities at North Korea's Air Base at Nuchon-ni. Fallout from this \nexplosion would blow southeast across the DMZ towards Seoul. This \nattack could kill over 4 million people.\n  Even if the United States were willing to accept the catastrophic \ndamage a nuclear explosion would cause, the bunkerbuster would still \nnot be able to destroy all of the buried bunkers the intelligence \ncommunity has identified.\n  So we would have a new bomb that can kill and poison tens of millions \nof civilians, spread fallout for more than a thousand miles, make their \nlands radioactive, but still not destroy its target.\n  The huge, one megaton weapon that the administration is contemplating \ncannot reach deeper than 400 meters. All an adversary would have to do \nis bury its bunker below that depth.\n  Bunkerbusters also require pinpoint accuracy to hit deeply-buried, \nhardened bunkers. This requires precise intelligence on the location of \nthe target. As the National Academy Study emphasized, an attack by a \nnuclear weapon would be effective in destroying weapon or weapons \nmaterials, including nuclear materials and chemical or biological \nagents, only if it's detonated in the actual chamber where the weapons \nor materials are located. Even more disturbing, if the bomb is even \nslightly off target, the detonation may cause the spread of such deadly \nchemicals and germs, in addition to the radioactive fallout.\n  As we know from the Iraq experience, our intelligence isn't always \naccurate. In fact, the Bush administration told us there were weapons \nof mass destruction and there and we had to send in troops to take them \nout. If we had robust nuclear earth penetrators at the time, what if \nthis White House had used them against suspected chemical or biological \nbunkers--which turned out not to exist? Charles Duelfer, the head of \nthe Iraqi Survey Group, shows us how dangerous this approach could have \nbeen when he told the Senate Armed Services Committee last October \nthat, we were almost all wrong on Iraq. Despite the administration's \nclaims, Mr. Duelfer's Comprehensive Report on Iraq's WMD stated, \n``There are no credible indications that Baghdad resumed production of \nchemical weapons.\n  The intelligence community still faces many challenges in getting its \nintelligence right. In their report in March for the President's \nCommission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States \nRegarding Weapons of Mass Destruction, Laurence Silberman and Chuck \nRobb found that The flaws we found in the Intelligence Community's Iraq \nperformance are still all too common. In some cases, it knows less now \nthan it did five or ten years ago.\n  How can we contemplate using a weapon of this destructive power, if \nour intelligence can't guarantee where an underground target really is?\n  Finally, if it were clear that this weapon is needed to protect our \ntroops, then I believe many more in Congress would support it. But \nthat's not the case. At the House Armed Services\n\n[[Page S7784]]\n\nCommittee hearing in March, program chief Linton Brooks once again was \nasked if there was a military requirement for the bunker buster. He \nstated categorically, No, there is not.\n  Robert Peurifoy, the retired Vice President of Sandia National \nLaboratory, one of our premier nuclear weapons labs, had this to say: \nIf you can find somebody in a uniform in the Defense Department who can \ntalk about the need for nuclear bunker busters without laughing, I'll \nbuy him a cup of coffee. It's outlandish. It's stupid. It is an effort \nto maintain a payroll at the weapons labs.\n  The administration's effort to build a new class of nuclear weapon is \nonly further evidence of their reckless nuclear policy. This action \ncontradicts the spirit of our obligations under the nonproliferation \ntreaty to disarm our stockpiles.\n  It demonstrates the administration's contempt for the nuclear \nnonproliferation treaty, the foundation of all current global nuclear \narms control. The nonproliferation treaty, signed in 1968, has long \nstood for the fundamental principle that the world will be safer if \nnuclear proliferation does not extend the five nations that nations lan \npossessed nuclear weapons at the does not extend beyond the five \nnations that possessed nuclear weapons at that time--the United States, \nGreat Britain, the Soviet Union, China, and France. It reflected the \nworldwide consensus that the greater the number of nations with nuclear \nweapons, the greater the risk of nuclear war.\n  The Bush administration's policy jeopardizes the entire structure of \nnuclear arms control so carefully negotiated by world leaders over the \npast half century, starting with the Eisenhower administration. This is \njust another example of the administration's Do as I say, not as I do \npolicy.\n  How can we ask Iran and North Korea to halt their nuclear research, \nwhen we fail to halt our own? By proceeding with the Robust Nuclear \nEarth penetrator, we are headed in the wrong direction. Our efforts \nwill only encourage other nations to follow our example and produce \nnuclear weapons of their own.\n  We have studied this issue long enough. It is ridiculous for the \nadministration to try to keep this program going, and it could be \nsuicidal for the Nation and for our troops. If we need this kind of \nweapons system, we ought to follow the conventional weapons research \nthat is being undertaken and not support this proposal. I hope the \nSenate will reject it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the time back to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts. I thought the remarks were excellent. I think they were \nreally right on. The tragedy of this is that people do not listen. I \nhope, Senator Kennedy, your words were heard.\n  Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Michigan, Mr. \nLevin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senators from California and \nMassachusetts and others who have come to the floor at this late hour \nto argue and debate an issue which is so critical to the security of \nthis Nation.\n  We will be a lot less secure if we go down this nuclear road. We know \nother countries are going down the nuclear road. We know we are even \nthreatening those countries--such as Iran and North Korea--that we will \nnot let them go down that road. We are even holding out the prospect \nthat they would be the subject of military attacks if they go down the \nnuclear road.\n  But at the same time we are doing this, that we are telling the \nworld, we are telling Iran, we are telling North Korea, ``Do not walk \ndown that nuclear road,'' the administration is proposing to take \nanother step down our nuclear road. It is a decision which, if upheld \nby this body, will make us less secure. It will make it more likely \nthat North Korea and Iran will say to us, and say to the world: The \nUnited States threatens us if we go to nuclear weapons, but they \nthemselves are relying more and more and more on nuclear weapons.\n  The administration has asked for $4 million to restart the \nfeasibility study for the robust nuclear earth penetrator. I emphasize \n``restart'' because we ended this mistake in fiscal year 2004. We \nshould not restart this. We did not need it in 2005. We do not need it \nin 2006.\n  The $4 million that the Department of Energy seeks for fiscal year \n2006 will not finish the study. An additional $14 million will still be \nneeded in fiscal year 2007, just to finish the RNEP study.\n  What is it that the Department of Energy wants to study? What is the \nweapon they want to study? What is the RNEP appropriation for? It is to \nlook at modification of a nuclear bomb called the B83. That is what is \nbeing looked at as a possible earth-penetrating weapon, the RNEP. The \nB83 is a large nuclear bomb. It is huge. It has a maximum yield on the \norder of 1 megaton. And 1 megaton is the equivalent of 71 Hiroshima \nbombs.\n  So the weapon they are looking at, or want to look at, to modify for \nthis function, is a bomb that has the power, the yield, as they call \nit, of 71 Hiroshima bombs. The goal of that feasibility study is to \nincrease the penetrating capability of the B83. The yield, the power, \nof the B83, would stay the same. That is not being reduced. So the idea \nis to see whether or not that B83--that bomb with the power of 71 \nHiroshimas--can be made to penetrate the earth.\n  According to the report of the National Academy of Sciences, it will \nnot be possible, no matter how good the design. The deepest that an \nRNEP could ever penetrate is about 12 feet. And when an RNEP detonates \nat 12 feet, 12 feet in the earth, it will generate, according to the \nNational Academy of Sciences, more fallout than if it were exploded in \nthe air. So if we go down this road, we will be looking at a weapon \nwhich cannot penetrate deeper than 12 feet in the earth and will have \ngreater fallout than if it were exploded in the air, according to the \nNational Academy of Sciences.\n  We talk about collateral damage as though it is some kind of a cold \nterm. This is damage which is so massive. We think of a weapon 71 times \nthe size of Hiroshima, with more fallout than if it were exploded in \nthe air, which--no matter what its design; even if this study is \nsuccessful--cannot penetrate more than about 12 feet in the ground, and \nwe are telling the rest of the world, ``Do not go down that nuclear \nroad,'' when we ourselves are thinking--thinking--about designing a \nweapon which has that kind of a power and that kind of a fallout.\n\n  It is not the hundreds of millions of dollars which this would cost \nto implement, assuming this study is completed, it is the absurdity, it \nis the utter nonsense, it is the danger to U.S. security that would be \ncreated if we take this step down the road, telling the world: Do not \ndo what we urge you to do because we are not doing it ourselves. That \nis the message. We can tell the world, Do not do it, do not go nuclear, \nbut what they are going to say to us is: Hey, you are going nuclear \nfurther than you already are. You are modifying weapons to try to make \nthem ``usable'' against deeply buried targets. And you are telling us \nand the rest of the world we should not go nuclear when you are looking \nfor more and more uses for nuclear weapons?\n  We asked the National Academy of Sciences to look at this program. We \nasked them how much yield would an RNEP have to have to hold a deeply \nburied target at risk, and what would the effects be of using an RNEP? \nSo the Academy reviewed the universe of hard and deeply buried targets \nand found you would have to have a huge yield to have any effect on \ndeeply buried targets. What the Academy concluded was that yields in \nthe range of several hundreds of kilotons to a megaton are needed to \neffectively hold hard and deeply buried targets at risk.\n  This report was issued this year, in April of 2005. What it said is \nthat to be effective against a target 1,000 feet deep, an RNEP would \nhave to have a yield of 1 megaton.\n  There are 10,000 hard and deeply buried targets in the world, about \n10,000. According to the National Academy of Sciences, 2,000,--2,000--\nof those targets would have some strategic significance. But the \nAcademy finds that on the order of only about 100 deeply buried targets \nwould be potential targets for RNEP. And many others--many others--\nwould be too deep to even reach with a 1-megaton yield such as RNEP \nhas.\n\n[[Page S7785]]\n\n  So what this study would have us do is spend more millions, take us \ndown a road which endangers us because of the message it sends to \ncountries that are contemplating nuclear weapons. It endangers our \nsecurity to study a weapon that cannot succeed in achieving its goal of \nhitting many deeply buried targets. And it would have an extensive \nfallout because of its huge size, 71 times the size of Hiroshima.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. My distinguished colleague on the Armed Services \nCommittee is fully aware that we have worked on this matter for several \nyears. There is an existing law that we passed on our bill. But the \nsimple, basic, elementary thing here is we are talking about a study. \nAnd our distinguished colleagues from California, Massachusetts, and \nyourself make allegations of a lot of facts. What is the harm in \ngetting the study? The study may confirm the very facts, and then the \nSenate is well informed. And the Congress must pass on any dollars \nbefore this thing proceeds to a full test situation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators are advised to ask their \nquestions through the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am sorry, I did not hear the ruling of \nthe Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators are advised to address their \nquestions through the Chair, not directly from Senator to Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Presiding Officer is most correct. I extend my \napologies to the Presiding Officer of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I asked if the Senator would yield for a question. I \nthought I said that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. WARNER. Why not have the study so the Senate and the Congress can \nall be well informed? And it will either verify or there will be a \ndenial of the assertions made by our three colleagues who are in \nopposition, and possibly a fourth.\n  It is interesting. We modified one of the weapons during the Clinton \nadministration, and it was approved by that administration. But it was \nlater determined that that weapon could not effectively deal with a \nhardened silo. I ask my good friend the question.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from Virginia for the question. First of \nall, it is not three Senators who are making these assertions. It is \nthe National Academy of Sciences which has made these assertions we are \nquoting. That is No. 1. No. 2, the message which is being sent by going \ndown this road endangers the security of the United States. We are \ntelling other countries--North Korea, Iran--do not go nuclear. That is \nour message. It is a very clear message. The President is even \nthreatening military action. He is saying he is going to have to put \nthat option on the table if they go nuclear. Then at the same time the \nadministration wants to restart a program, the program in this case \nbeing a study of a deeply penetrating nuclear weapon that has 70 times \nthe power of Hiroshima in order to get to deeply buried targets. There \nare 10,000 of those targets, according to the National Academy of \nSciences, and perhaps 100 of them would be held at risk by this weapon.\n  So the idea that we are taking another step--you call it a study, but \nit is a step down the road, because the purpose of the study is to at \nleast consider doing something. What we are saying, what the National \nAcademy of Sciences has said, is this cannot accomplish its purpose. It \nwill have a huge fallout. And what we are saying is the possibility \nthat you could ever consider doing this is so far outweighed by the \ndanger to us, by the message which is being sent to the world, that we \nare walking down a road we are telling others do not walk. That is the \ndanger.\n  Mr. WARNER. In reply to my colleague, I refer to a letter from the \nSecretary of State a year ago: Dear Mr. Chairman--addressed to me--I am \nwriting to express support for the President's 2004 budget request to \nfund the feasibility and cost study for the robust nuclear earth \npenetrator and to repeal the legislation that prohibits the United \nStates from conducting research and development on low-yield nuclear \nweapons. I do not believe that these legislative steps will complicate \nour ongoing efforts with North Korea. And he goes on to explain the \nNorth Koreans will not be in any way deterred by this action of the \nUnited States to have a study.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would expect the administration would say something like \nthat. But common sense tells us otherwise. Common sense tells you that \nif you are sitting down with people, in this case the Europeans, \ntelling them we have to try to persuade Iran, don't go down that road, \nwith the Japanese and the Russians and the Chinese sitting down with \nthe North Koreans, do not go down that road, each of us has some \nexperience as human beings. It seems to me it is absolute common sense \nthat we will be confronted by those countries saying: You are lecturing \nus, threatening us, when you yourself are now looking at the \npossibility of redesigning a weapon 70 times the size of Hiroshima so \nthat you can more deeply penetrate into the ground. It undermines our \nposition. It weakens our position. It seems to me that means it weakens \nour security.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I could only say to my distinguished \ncolleague, the Secretary of Defense Colin Powell, a man who has been \nheld in high esteem by this body, disagrees respectfully with my good \ncolleague from Michigan. But the effect of denying a study on this is \nsimply saying to the world, where there are countries proceeding with \nnuclear programs, you can go deep. There is no deterrence on the \nhorizon. It is off limits, and you can do as you wish and go deep, and \nyou can then conceal your programs from the eyes of the world and there \nis no deterrence for them to go deep.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 1088 through 1096, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so that I may offer a managers' amendment which \nhas been cleared on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I send to the desk a series of amendments, all of which \nhave been approved on both sides, some of which are technical, some are \notherwise, but there are no objections.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, there is a desire for back and forth. \nThat is perfectly fine with me. I think the Senator from Arizona wanted \nto say something, and then if we could go to the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this debate has been held before, as has been \nnoted. About a year ago, a similar amendment was defeated by a vote of \n55 to 42 in this body. I urge my colleagues to defeat the amendment \nthis year as well. The question has been asked about whether we would \nbe going down a road that we would be taking a step toward something--I \nam not exactly sure--if we were to conduct this study. As my colleague, \nthe distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee has noted, \nthis is not the testing of a weapon or even the design of a weapon. \nThis is merely to study the feasibility.\n  I want to make the point clear, to study the feasibility of what? To \nstudy the feasibility of taking an existing warhead and simply \nproviding a different kind of casing for it and a different kind of \nfuse which would enable it to penetrate deep into the earth and \npotentially take out something that a potential enemy would have very \ndeep underground.\n  The deterrent effect of this is obvious. A country that might wish us \nharm, such as North Korea, for example, that thinks it can bury \nsomething deep within the ground because we have no way of getting to \nit, would no longer be able to pursue that course of action if they \nunderstood that we had this kind of a weapon.\n  It is precisely the point that Secretary Rumsfeld made when he said:\n\n       Countries all across the globe are putting things \n     underground. And we have no capability, conventional or \n     nuclear, to deal with the issue of deep penetrator.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       The idea of proceeding with this study is just imminently \n     sensible. And anyone would look back five years from now, if \n     we failed to take a responsible step like that, and feel we'd \n     made a mistake.\n\n  General Cartwright, Commander of U.S. Strategic Command, stated \nbefore the Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic Forces:\n\n       We're going to have to have multiple ways by which we can \n     hold [hard and deeply buried targets] at risk. . . . The \n     robust nuclear earth penetrator is one of several \n     capabilities and I think will be necessary.\n\n  The point is deterrence. Because we are already a nuclear power under \nthe Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, we are entitled to have nuclear \nwarheads and weapons. We have them. We are not developing any new ones. \nWe would be taking something out of the inventory and putting it into a \nform which a potential enemy would have to believe could be used \nagainst them. It might just prevent some of our potential enemies from \ngoing deep, as Senator Warner has said--from deeply burying things into \nthe ground with the belief and hope that we would never be able to get \nto it. That is what this study is for. I remind my colleagues that only \nif the feasibility study demonstrates that it can work, and only if the \nNuclear Weapons Council approves its development, and only if Congress \nauthorizes its development could it ever proceed.\n  So Congress still has at least two opportunities to determine whether \nor not to proceed with something that has never even been studied. My \ncolleagues seem very certain about the consequences of one of these \nweapons. They have never even been designed, let alone tested. I think \nit is a little premature to suggest, with great certainty, exactly what \nwould happen if one of these weapons were ever used. Again, the point \nis to have the deterrence, not to use the weapons. We have not used \nanything in our nuclear stockpile. Yet it has provided a great \ndeterrence for this country because an enemy cannot know we will not \nuse it if they ever act against us.\n  Again, it simply modifies a Clinton administration design of a \nprevious warhead, which was determined could not penetrate the kind of \nrock, for example, that we believe some of our potential adversaries \nhave. That is why this study to try to find a way, if we could, to be \nable to penetrate that rock and send a signal to those countries that \nthey ought not try to go deep with their nuclear programs.\n  Again, there is nothing violative of the nonproliferation treaty \nbecause we already have the weapon. We would simply be taking an \nexisting warhead and determining whether or not it could be used for \nthis purpose.\n  I remind my colleagues, as I said, we already voted on this before. \nWe have defeated this amendment in the past. The Secretary of State, \nthe Secretary of Defense, and the general in command of the U.S. \nStrategic Forces all have asked that we proceed to fund the $4 million \nfor this study. As Senator Warner pointed out, what could be wrong with \na study to simply determine whether something like this is feasible?\n  It seems to me that since our military leaders have requested it, \nsince the President requested it, it is up to Congress to fulfill our \nobligation to provide the resources necessary for the study. As \nSecretary Rumsfeld said, if we don't do it and one of our adversaries \nhas something deeply buried that we would like to get to and we cannot \ndo it because we don't have this, we would ask ourselves someday why we \nwere not willing to provide this funding for a study.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. With regard to this feasibility study, the study is \nreally to determine the effect of the casing that we use on nuclear \nweapons--hardened casing--and how deeply that would penetrate. It is \nnot going to be a feasibility study in which a nuclear weapon would be \ndetonated; is that correct?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, that is exactly correct. There are no plans--\nnone--to test any kind of nuclear weapon. The study, as the Senator \nfrom Alabama has noted, is not to test any kind of nuclear weapon but \nsimply to determine whether or not a casing, and fuse, and the other \nelements of a weapon could be designed to include an existing \nnuclear warhead within it in order to have this kind of capability.\n\n  I believe my time is up. I inquire of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 14 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. I believe the agreement was that I had 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think there may well be----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The total time in opposition is 14 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before the Senator yields, it is somewhat \ndifficult for those who are just trying to grasp a short debate here \ntonight, which is really a repetition of 2 previous years of debates. \nLet us assure our colleagues that nothing in this entire test scenario \nwill involve any fissionable material whatsoever. As the distinguished \nSenator said, it would not involve a bomb. It didn't involve the use of \nany fissionable material whatsoever. It is simply a study.\n  It is important that the Congress be informed, and it is interesting \nthat the money for this was struck last year. But guess what. North \nKorea went out and proudly announced--once the money was knocked out of \nthe bill--we have a nuclear weapon. So I think it is very wise for this \nNation to have this. It does not involve the use of any fissionable \nmaterial.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I think Senator Clinton has asked for \n5 minutes, and I yield that time to the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am honored to join my colleagues from \nCalifornia, Massachusetts, Michigan, and elsewhere to oppose this \nfunding for the robust nuclear penetrator, the so-called nuclear bunker \nbuster. I thought this issue was closed at the end of last year. \nRegrettably, it is not.\n  This program has been the subject of debate and discussion for \nseveral years.\n\n[[Page S7788]]\n\nI think it is important to look at the funding request because it tells \na slightly different story about what the intentions are behind this \nprogram.\n  In its fiscal year 2003 budget request, the Department of Energy \nsought $15 million to fund the first year of what was to be a 3-year, \n$45 million study to determine the feasibility of using one of two \nexisting large nuclear weapons as a robust nuclear earth penetrator. In \nfiscal year 2003, $15 million was authorized and appropriated for this, \nbut the DOE was not to begin work until it submitted a report setting \nforth the requirements for the penetrator and the target types that the \nnuclear penetrator was designed to hold at risk. DOE submitted the \nreport in April 2003, the funds were released, and the work began.\n  In its fiscal year 2004 budget request, DOE again sought $15 million \nfor the penetrator, but only $7.5 million was appropriated.\n  In the fiscal 2005 budget request, DOE sought $27.5 million for the \nRNEP. For the first time, however, DOE included the robust nuclear \nearth penetrator in its 5-year budget report. The cost of the \nfeasibility study had increased dramatically, from $45 million to $145 \nmillion. Moreover, the DOE determined that the feasibility would take 5 \nyears rather than 3 to complete.\n  Most significantly, the DOE 5-year budget plan also included $484.7 \nmillion to complete the engineering and design phases. Based on this \ncost progression, the nuclear penetrator would cost in excess of $1 \nbillion to produce.\n  Finally, Congress had enough of this, although the administration \npersisted in pursuing the nuclear penetrator, and in its fiscal 2006 \nbudget requested $4 million to restart the feasibility study. An \nadditional $14 million would be needed in fiscal 2007 to complete the \nfeasibility study.\n  We have heard that the robust nuclear penetrator is a concept to \nmodify an existing large yield nuclear weapon to be an earth penetrator \nthat would penetrate hard rock. But we also now know more than we knew \na couple of years ago. The administration told us a couple years ago \nabout what the effect of this would be, how far into the earth it could \npenetrate--12 feet or so, according to the National Academy of \nSciences. What would be the collateral damage? Maybe up to a million \ncasualties.\n  The funding requests would lead to the development of a weapon that \nwould have devastating impacts.\n  I conclude by pointing out that before Operation Iraqi Freedom \nstarted, Iraq was one of the countries used as an example of a \npotential enemy with a hard and deeply buried WMD storage and \nmanufacturing areas. It was the principal justification for the \ndevelopment of this bunker buster. I believe this body needs to once \nagain join the House in saying that to create a weapon--which, believe \nme, this may not be just a research and report; the DOE budget figures \ndemonstrate they clearly have much more in mind in the administration \nthat would be used in a first strike offensive manner--would require \nconfidence in the accuracy of intelligence that at this time we simply \ndo not have.\n  I hope this amendment will be successful this year based on the \nadditional information, particularly with respect to the National \nAcademy of Sciences' analysis which demonstrates the devastating effect \nsuch a weapon could have with very little intelligence available to \nguide the use of it.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York for \nthose comments. She put all of this in both a practical and fiscal \nperspective. I also thank the Senator from Michigan because he was \nright on. Do what we say, don't do what we do to every other nation. \nThe nonproliferation treaty does not matter. It is just a terribly \narrogant position for the United States to take and I think a morally \nwrong one.\n  How much time do I have, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 13 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield 5 minutes to the junior Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to stop and think hard \nabout this, not just be swayed by the fact the Pentagon is asking for \nit, not just be swayed by the fact our great friend, the distinguished \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, is arguing in favor of it. \nBut I ask my colleagues to stop and think about this for a minute: Do \nwe have a bunker buster with a nuclear warhead today? The answer is no, \nwe do not. So if we are going to study the--whatever you want to call \nit--the modification, creation, it is the creation of a weapon we do \nnot have today.\n  By any definition anywhere in the world, any leader in any country \nlooking at us sees that as a new weapon, as a new weapon capacity. I do \nnot remember everything from nuclear, chemical, biological warfare \nschool, but that is one of the things the Navy did for me. I will tell \nyou, a nuclear weapon that goes 10 or 12 feet into the ground with 70 \ntimes the capacity of Hiroshima is a weapon that is going to have \nunbelievable consequences to civilian populations all over the world.\n  This is a study of the absurd. There are two outcomes to this study: \nEither you find it does not work and you don't use it, or you find that \nit does and then you have to confront the choice, would you ever use \nit. With the thousands of warheads we still have, with the deterrent we \nstill have, do we need to go seeking yet another kind of nuclear weapon \nto send some kind of deterrent threat? It just does not make sense \nagainst any measurement of what we need to defend ourselves and provide \nfor the security of the United States.\n  Should we look at other forms of deep penetrating bunker busting? \nSure, that would make more sense, far more sense than the notion of the \nUnited States using a nuclear weapon for the purpose of bunker busting, \nespecially when you consider that tactically, if you were going to use \nit, you would probably try to use it in a selective way that takes out \na few bunkers, and you wind up with a nuclear weapon usage that only \ninvites more consequences with nuclear weapons. It is not usable.\n  That is the conclusion the National Academy of Sciences came to, and \nfor the Senate to casually dismiss our own National Academy of Sciences \nand pretend we have to study something that has already been studied is \nreally a study of the absurd in itself. It is a study in a waste of \nmoney, especially at a time when the resources of this country are \nalready taxed.\n  I do not know any person you talk to who has dealt with proliferation \nissues over a long period of time who is not sensitive to the fact that \nif we go ahead and study this new kind of weapon, we invite any other \ncountry that views us as a threat to do the same. If you look at every \nstage of the arms race, from the late 1940s all the way through every \nweapon that was designed, each stage of it was driven by one nation or \nthe other--usually the United States, incidentally--being the first to \ndevelop a particular new technology.\n  You can go right back through every stage of nuclear development, \nfrom the first bombs to the hydrogen to the silent submarines to the \nMIRVing and all the way through until the modern times. I think it was \nonly on two occasions that the Soviet Union, in fact, was first in the \ndevelopment of a particular weapon.\n  This is the United States leading down the road, sending a signal to \nthe world that we are trying to develop a new nuclear weapon that we do \nnot have today. It is just a matter of common sense that has an impact \non people throughout the world.\n  By every test, by what it does to proliferation efforts, by what it \ndoes with respect to common sense and the possibility of it being used, \nby what it does with respect to the dismissal of the National Academy \nof Sciences and the studies already done, by what it does with respect \nto a test of common sense as to its usage at 71 Hiroshimas and the \nimplications of the fallout and what is dismissed as collateral damage, \nthe vast implications of nuclear fallout that would come from that, \nthis is a study truly that we do not need to undertake that has \ndramatic negative consequences.\n  I hope colleagues will make a commonsense assessment with respect to \nthis new weapon.\n\n[[Page S7789]]\n\n  I yield back to the Senator from California the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. He has made \nsome excellent points. I very much appreciate them.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Has time expired on the Feinstein amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has not.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time do the proponents have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 12 minutes in opposition and 7 \nminutes for the Senator from California.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask the Senator from California, in the interest of \nmoving along, would she like to shorten her time if we shorten ours? We \nhave 12 minutes, and the Senator from California has 7.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. What would the Senator from New Mexico propose?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I propose we have 5 minutes and Senator Feinstein have \n2.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Make it 5 and 5.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Five and 5? We have 12, and the Senator from California \nhas 5. I will take it: 5 and 5; is that all right?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Five and 5.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Five and 5. Without using this time on this unanimous \nconsent request, I ask we move off this amendment for the purpose of \noffering two amendments that are going to be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1097\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send to the desk on behalf of Senators \nAllard and Salazar an amendment relating to the purchase of mineral \nrights at Rocky Flats technical site. I note the presence of both \nSenators from Colorado, and I say to them that I am pleased to accept \nthe amendment. It has been cleared on both sides. I appreciate their \nwork. We will do everything we can to keep it in conference.\n  I send the amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Mr. Allard \n     and Mr. Salazar, proposes an amendment numbered 1097.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To set aside certain amounts for the purchase of mineral \n        rights at the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site)\n\n       At the end of title _ , add the following:\n       Sec. ___. Of amounts appropriated to the Secretary of \n     Energy for the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site for \n     fiscal year 2006, the Secretary may provide no more than \n     $10,000,000 for the purchase of mineral rights at the Rocky \n     Flats Environmental Technology Site.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1097) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The second amendment I referred to will be offered by \nthe Senator from Colorado and withdrawn--no, it will not be withdrawn. \nIt will be offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I have a rather lengthy statement on this amendment. \nThere is still some time, I understand, on the Robust Nuclear Earth \nPenetrator; is that correct?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Five minutes on our side.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1084, As Modified\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk and that \namendment is amendment No. 1084.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Allard], for himself and Mr. \n     Salazar, proposes an amendment numbered 1084, as modified.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. This amendment should read sponsored by both Allard and \nSalazar. Here is a corrected amendment. I will send that to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment at the desk appears to be the \nsame amendment that was just adopted.\n  Mr. ALLARD. The only difference would be that the listing of the \nsponsors on there should list Allard and Salazar. Otherwise there is no \ndifference. Maybe we are okay to move forward. Is that correct, Mr. \nPresident?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the previous amendment that was adopted, \nI ask consent that Senator Salazar be deemed an original cosponsor when \nit was entered as if it were there.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That takes care of that one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, amendment 1084, as \nmodified, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1084), as modified, was agreed to, as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To set aside certain amounts to provide regular and early \n    retirement benefits to workers at the Rocky Flats Environmental \n                            Technology Site)\n\n       At the end of title _ , add the following:\n       Sec. ___. Of amounts appropriated to the Secretary of \n     Energy for the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site for \n     fiscal year 2006, the Secretary may provide not more than \n     $15,000,000 to provide regular and early retirement benefits \n     to workers at the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  The Chair would note that amendment 1084, as modified, has been \nagreed to. It reflects the additional cosponsors.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment and \nmake a few comments, if I might.\n  I have had faith in the workers of Rocky Flats and I am pleased to \nsay that Kaiser-Hill and the workers at Rocky Flats have not \ndisappointed me. In fact, it appears that Kaiser-Hill and the workers \nat Rocky Flats are far exceeding their cleanup commitments at Rocky \nFlats in the State of Colorado. I cannot express the full extent of how \nproud I am of their achievements.\n  Listen to some of their accomplishments. All weapons-grade plutonium \nwas removed in 2003; more than 1,400 contaminated glove boxes and \nhundreds of process tanks have been removed; more than 400,000 cubic \nmeters of low-level radioactive waste have been removed; 650 of the 802 \nfacilities have been demolished; all 4 uranium production facilities \nhave been demolished; all 5 plutonium production facilities have been \ndemolished or will be within the next 3 months; 310 of 360 sites of \nsoil contamination have been remediated, and the last shipment of \ntransuranic waste was shipped this last April.\n  It now appears the cleanup of Rocky Flats will be completed as early \nas October, a full year ahead of schedule, and save the American \ntaxpayer billions upon billions of dollars of what was envisioned when \nwe first started talking about cleanup at Rocky Flats.\n  One can appreciate the magnitude of this accomplishment only when \nthey realize that within 6 years Rocky Flats will have been transformed \nfrom one of the most dangerous places on Earth to a beautiful and safe \nnatural wildlife refuge. Yet the cleanup contractor could not have \nachieved this demanding goal as established by the Department of Energy \nwithout the hard work and determination of the Rocky Flats workers. \nMost of these workers had to literally develop an entire new skill set. \nThey went from manufacturing plutonium pits to dismantling glove boxes. \nThey tore down buildings while wearing stiff environmental protection \nsuits. They cleaned up rooms that were so contaminated that they were \nforced to use the highest level of respiratory protection available. \nPerhaps more importantly, these workers were extraordinarily productive \neven though they knew they were essentially working themselves out of a \njob.\n  With the completion of the cleanup and closure of Rocky Flats, they \nknew they would have to find employment elsewhere. There was no \nguarantee that their next job would pay as much or provide the same \nlevel of benefits. Despite knowing that they were going to lose their \njobs, the workers of Rocky Flats remained highly motivated and totally \ncommitted to their cleanup mission. They believed in what they were \ndoing and worked hard to clean up the facility as quickly and safely as \npossible.\n\n[[Page S7790]]\n\n  They achieved more in less time and with less money than anyone \ndreamed possible. I am proud of the workers at Rocky Flats. I believe \nthey have once again earned our Nation's sincere appreciation and \nrespect. Given the sacrifice and dedication demonstrated by these \nworkers, one would think the Department of Energy would do everything \nit could do to ensure that these workers received the compensation and \nbenefits they have earned. One would think assisting those workers who \nlose their retirement benefits because of the early completion of the \ncleanup would be a top priority for the Department. After all, these \nworkers saved the Department billions upon billions of cleanup costs.\n  Last year, it became clear to the Department of Energy and to me that \nthe cleanup at Rocky Flats would be completed much earlier than anyone \nexpected. The workers were supportive of early closure but were \nconcerned that some of their colleagues would lose retirement benefits \nbecause of early closure. I shared their concern and requested in last \nyear's defense authorization bill that the Department of Energy provide \nCongress with a report on the number of workers who would not receive \nretirement benefits and the cost of providing these benefits.\n  After a lengthy delay, the Department of Energy reported that about \n29 workers would not receive pension and/or lifetime medical benefits \nbecause of early closure. The cost of providing benefits to those \nworkers was just over $12 million.\n  To my dismay, I discovered the Department of Energy's report was \nwoefully incomplete. I was subsequently informed that at least another \n50 workers would have qualified for retirement benefits had the \nDepartment of Energy bothered to include those workers who already had \nbeen laid off because of the accelerated closure schedule.\n  This means as many as 75 workers at Rocky Flats will lose their \npensions, medical benefits, or in some cases both because they worked \nfaster, less expensively and achieved more than they were supposed to.\n  They not only worked themselves out of a job, but they also worked \nthemselves out of retirement benefits and medical care.\n  I find the Department of Energy's refusal to pay these benefits to be \noutrageous and shameful.\n  Many of the workers at Rocky Flats have served our Nation for over 2 \ndecades. They have risked their lives day in and day out, first by \nbuilding nuclear weapon components and then by cleaning up some of the \nmost contaminated buildings in the world. All they have asked for in \nreturn is to be treated with fairness and honesty.\n  To my disappointment and to the disappointment of the workers at \nRocky Flats, the Department of Energy cannot seem to keep its end of \nthe bargain. The Department seems to think that the only thing these \nworkers deserve is a shove out the door.\n  These workers would have received their retirement benefits had the \ncleanup continued to 2035 as originally predicted. These workers would \nhave received their retirement benefits had the cleanup continued to \n2007 as the site contract specifies. But by accelerating the cleanup by \nover a year and saving the American taxpayer hundreds of millions of \ndollars, these workers are left without the retirement benefits they \ndeserve and have earned.\n  The Department's refusal to provide these benefits has ramifications \nfar beyond Rocky Flats. Because Rocky Flats is the first major DOE \nclean-site, workers at other sites around the country are watching to \nsee how the Department of Energy treats the workers at Rocky Flats. \nUnfortunately, they have seen how the Department of Energy has failed \nto step up and provide retirement benefits to those who have earned it.\n  The workers at other sites now have no incentive to accelerate clean-\nup. Why should they? The Department of Energy has not lifted a finger \nto help the workers at Rocky Flats. It would be foolish for workers at \nother sites think the Department of Energy would act fairly with them.\n  To me, the Department's decision is a penny wise and a pound foolish. \nBy refusing to provide these benefits, the Department saves money in \nthe short term. Yet, by discouraging the workers from supporting \nacceleration, the Department is going to cost the American taxpayer \nhundreds of millions in additional funding in the long run.\n  I believe Congress needs to correct the Department's mistake before \nit is too late.\n  Today, I offer an amendment that will provide the benefits to those \nworkers who would have lost their retirement benefits because of early \nclosure. This amendment is designed to provide retirement benefits to \nonly those who would have received retirement benefits had the site \nremained open until December 15, 2005, the date of site cleanup \ncontract.\n  To be clear, this funding is not an additional bonus for a job well-\ndone. Nor is it a going away present for two decades of service. These \nretirement benefits are what these workers have already earned--nothing \nmore, nothing else.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. These workers have \nearned these benefits, and it is up to this body to see that they \nreceive them. Let us not let the bureaucrats in the Department of \nEnergy tarnish the credibility of the Federal Government. It is time \nfor this body to correct this mistake before the Department's \nfoolishness costs the American taxpayer even more money in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I will be very short. I want to first \ncongratulate my good friend from Colorado, Senator Allard, for the \nsponsorship of these amendments which are important for Rocky Flats and \nfor the cleanup of our DOE facilities. I think we have a great facility \nand a model in the State of Colorado that is applicable to other \nDepartment of Energy sites and in the end we are going to be able to \nprovide some cost savings to our whole DOE cleanup challenge in this \ncountry.\n  The legislation in front of us in the form of the modified amendments \nwould do two things: One, it would help all of the employees who have \nbeen laid off at Rocky Flats because of the closure of that plant and \nthe surplus funds would therefore go for a very good purpose to help \nwith the retirement of the employees who have worked at Rocky Flats for \na very long time.\n  The second amendment deals with the mineral rights, which is all part \nof completing the stewardship process at the DOE facility, which will \nbe one of the first ones cleaned up in the Nation. So I applaud my \nfriend from Colorado for helping in this effort and for having worked \non it for such a long time. I also want to state my appreciation to the \nminority leader, Senator Reid, for his work on this effort as well as \nto the chairman, Senator Pete Domenici, and Senator Warner for his \ngreat assistance in this effort as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, there is no time agreement on the \namendment, but I did understand we were going to accept it. I didn't \nthink we were going to have any time. I ask the Senator, could we \nproceed to adopt the amendment, if the Senator from New Mexico is \nwilling to do that?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Yes, that will be fine.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are willing to accept the last amendment that was \noffered by the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair notes the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Colorado has already been adopted as modified.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, you understand this is a \ndifficult amendment. We have had objection from the Armed Services \nauthorizing committee. We take it to conference willingly, with the \nclear understanding we are going to work on it with the Secretary of \nEnergy, and Defense, and with you and the Armed Services Committee, and \ndo the best we can as we complete the matter in conference.\n  Mr. ALLARD. That is my understanding. I thank the chairman of the \nEnergy and Water Committee and I thank the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1098\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have an amendment on behalf of Senator Lindsey Graham \nthat has been cleared on both sides. I send it to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report the \namendment.\n\n[[Page S7791]]\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Mr. Graham, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1098.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To make the Savannah River National Laboratory eligible for \n         laboratory directed research and development funding)\n\n       On page 105, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       Sec. 3___. Notwithstanding Department of Energy order \n     413.2A, dated January 8, 2001, beginning in fiscal year 2006 \n     and thereafter, the Savannah River National Laboratory may be \n     eligible for laboratory directed research and development \n     funding.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, without objection the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1098) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1085\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand we are now back on the \nFeinstein amendment and there is 5 minutes on each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. May I tell Senators, if nothing else breaks here, there \nare no other amendments. We will vote on this. Senator Coburn has one \nand he will withdraw it. Can the Senator wait until Senator Feinstein \nfinishes and then he will be recognized?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I think we have had a good discussion. \nI was somewhat interested in the comment that: We have done this \nbefore, why should we do it again?\n  Probably this is one of the most important issues we have to deal \nwith because it will affect, I believe, my family's lifetime and my \ngrandchildren's lifetime. I think if we have learned anything, it is \nthat human nature is better off without nuclear weapons.\n  In this case, I would like to sum up with one of the conclusions of \nthe National Academy of Sciences' recent reports. It is conclusion No. \n3: Current experience and empirical predictions indicate that earth \npenetrator weapons cannot penetrate to depths required for total \ncontainment of the effects of a nuclear explosion.\n  That is not my view. That is the view of the National Academy of \nSciences. To my knowledge it has been backed up by everybody. So why \ndoes the administration persist?\n  The one bright light in this is the House of Representatives. They \nhave removed the money from all programs, from time to test readiness, \nincreasing it from 3 years to 18 months; money for the 400 new \nplutonium pits; and money for the robust nuclear earth penetrator.\n  This year the administration did not come back and request the so-\ncalled advanced weapons concepts, which is essentially low-yield \ntactical nuclear weapons. It has been stated here, and I believe it has \nbeen stated correctly, that you cannot have a policy which says, ``Do \nas we say but don't do as we do.''\n  I do not believe we can have a policy that puts at risk hundreds of \nthousands, and, yes, even millions of lives. And I do not believe we \ncan develop a weapon and then say: Well, this is just to protect us. It \nwill never be used. I do not believe that.\n  I truly believe the documents coming out of this administration, from \nthe Nuclear Posture Review to the National Security Directive No. 17, \nclearly indicate that it is the goal of this administration to build a \nnew generation of nuclear weapons. For those of us who do not believe \nthat is the way to go, they must vote. To those of us who are not on \nthis side, I want to say we will be back, and back, and back. So get \nused to hearing from us because it is not going to end here.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senator wants 2 minutes, and then I \nwill wrap it up.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will just take 1 minute. The point I want \nto make is to correct something that was incorrectly noted before. It \nwas stated this will be a brand new weapon. The truth is that this \nweapon was already developed during the Clinton administration. Using \nthe current B61, which is a nuclear warhead, the B61 mod 11 was \ndeveloped as an earth penetrator weapon. But it was determined by \nfeasibility studies that it did not have sufficient capability to \npenetrate and thus provide a deterrent. The B61-11 is not sufficiently \nhardened to penetrate certain target geologies. So the feasibility \nstudy is designed to determine whether a more robust outer casing, \nwhich still protects the internal components of the warhead, could be \ndeveloped for the B83 warhead.\n  That is all it is, is to determine whether an existing warhead could \nbe used with a different casing to penetrate, and thus replace a weapon \nthat is already in our inventory.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment before us.\n  The bill before us includes an appropriation of $4 million to \ncontinue an Air Force-led feasibility study on the robust nuclear earth \npenetrator--RNEP. This is not a new issue for the Congress to consider. \nIn both the defense authorization and energy and water appropriations \nbills the last 2 years, amendments have been offered to cut all funding \nfor the robust nuclear earth penetrator. These amendments have been \ndefeated on multiple occasions.\n  The purpose of the RNEP feasibility study is to determine if an \nexisting nuclear weapon can be modified to penetrate into hard rock in \norder to destroy a deeply buried target that could be hiding weapons of \nmass destruction or command and control assets. The Department of \nEnergy has modified nuclear weapons in the past to modernize their \nsafety, security, and reliability aspects. We have also modified \nexisting nuclear weapons to meet new military requirements. Under the \nClinton administration, we modified the B-61 so that it could penetrate \nfrozen soils.\n  The RNEP feasibility study is narrowly focused on determining whether \nthe B-83 warhead can be modified to penetrate hard rock or reinforced, \nunderground facilities. Funding research on options--both nuclear and \nconventional--for attacking such targets is a responsible step for our \ncountry to take.\n  As many as 70 nations are developing or have built hardened and \ndeeply buried targets to protect command and communications, and \nweapons of mass destruction production and storage assets. Of that \nnumber, a number of nations have facilities that are sufficiently hard \nand deep enough that we cannot destroy most of them with conventional \nweapons. Some of them are so sophisticated that they are beyond the \ncurrent U.S. nuclear weapons capabilities. I believe it is prudent and \nimperative that we fund this study on potential capabilities to address \nthis growing category of threat.\n  Should the Department of Energy determine, through this study, that \nthe robust nuclear penetrator can meet the requirement to hold a \nhardened and deeply buried target at risk, the department still could \nnot proceed to full-scale weapon development, production, or deployment \nwithout an authorization and appropriation from Congress. Let me repeat \nthat: the Department of Energy cannot go beyond this study without the \nexpressed authorization and appropriation from Congress.\n  We should allow our weapons experts to determine if the robust \nnuclear earth penetrator could destroy hardened and deeply buried \ntargets. Then Congress would have the information it would need to \ndecide whether or not development of such a weapon is appropriate and \nnecessary to maintain our nation's security.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment before us.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am hearing talk about a new nuclear weapon. I wish \nthose who were talking about a new nuclear weapon were reading the \ncurrent evaluations and studies about the future of nuclear weapons. \nYou sure are not talking about this. If ever there were going to be new \nnuclear weapons, they would be little nuclear weapons. They would not \nbe blockbusters. Whole\n\n[[Page S7792]]\n\nstudies are looking at whether all the countries with big nuclear \nweapons are going to have a whole new generation someday of smaller \nones, less in size, where the world can have far fewer.\n  That is not the subject tonight because this weapon is not a new \nnuclear weapon. First of all, this is a bill, appropriations, that says \nthe Congress is approving to build a new nuclear weapon for the \nastronomical sum of money of $4 million. I don't know what you could \nbuild for $4 million. It says ``a study.'' And then it determines what \nthe study is.\n  I don't know, I have never heard so much said about so little. That \nsounds like something somebody said about something else in history, so \nI don't want to demean it because we are just talking about an issue on \nthe floor of the Senate. But if you want to give a speech of \nsignificance about nuclear weapons and put maps up showing the \ndevastation of the two that were used, we ought to have a big debate. \nMaybe some think that was a mistake. But the truth is, none of that has \nanything to do with this amendment. The United States of America, \nthrough its experts, says we should have a study.\n  This Senator said to them, tell me how much money you need for a \nstudy--not 10 years from now to build something. What do you need for a \nstudy? They said: $4 million. That is what is in this bill. That is \nall. No more, no less. That is what the amendment is about.\n  I hope we will once again say let's let our country do this kind of \nresearch.\n  I yield any time I might have.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no time.\n  Mr. KERRY. The Senator yielded some back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has about 50 \nseconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am glad to yield that.\n  Mr. KERRY. Two questions. No. 1, is it not true there is $14 million \nnot just $4 million; $14 million for the next year? And, second, do we \nhave a bunker busting nuclear weapon today? The answer to that is no. \nIf we do not have it, don't you agree, if we are studying the creation \nof one, that is a new nuclear weapon? It is a weapon we do not have in \nthe arsenal today.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me say in the appropriations in this bill for the \nfiscal year we are appropriating, it is $4 million. There is no \nappropriation for the following year or the following year or the \nfollowing year. So I do not know what that will be.\n  But I tell you, you have to come back for another appropriation, so \nthat is for sure. That is the situation.\n  With reference to whether we have this in our arsenal, I think the \ndistinguished Senator from the State of Arizona answered that question \nwith reference to the instrument that will deliver a weapon, if we ever \ndo the research to know whether we need it. Am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor. We don't need any additional time. \nHave you had the yeas and nays?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 2 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes, there is only $4 million in this budget and \nthere is $4.5 million in defense. It is a different strategy this year. \nThe money was split.\n  Last year the request was for $27.5 million and a 5-year projection \nof $486 million. That is fact.\n\n  Now, their projection over 5 years is not this year in the budget so \nit is a little tricky because they have split it up and they have \noperated it into two budgets. The House removed all of the money. The \nHouse removed the authorization.\n  Clearly, there are people on this Hill who believe it is a mistake. \nLast year, the money was removed. So this year is a slightly different \napproach by the administration.\n  What we are saying is, it is a new weapon. If you do not have it \ntoday, and you might have it tomorrow, it is a new weapon. What we are \nsaying is, there is not one physicist who will say that a casing can be \nbuilt to drive a weapon deep enough into the Earth with enough \nexplosive power that will take out a bunker and not spew radiation that \ncan kill hundreds of thousands and, yes, even millions of people. We \nurge a ``yes'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am trying to get us finished so we will have two \nvotes back to back, one on this amendment and one on final passage.\n  Senator Coburn wants to take a few minutes. He wants to offer an \namendment.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1086 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I will call up amendment 1086 and then I \nwill withdraw it by unanimous consent. It is important that Members \nrecognize what is written in the report language in this bill. I will \nread a portion of one sentence and talk about it: Congressionally \ndirected projects. The committee recommends including the following \ncongressionally directed projects. The committee has provided \nsufficient funding to cover the cost of these additions so as not to \nimpact research.\n  That is the key question. By the misstatement of the committee \nitself, these projects are not essential. Yet, there is $87 million in \nprojects to 30 States averaging less than $1 million a project. These \nare for biomass, biodiesel, hydrogen, solar, and other forms of energy.\n  It is going to pass, there is no question. I can't stop it, but I \nthink the American people ought to go online and look at this. There \nare two problems. No. 1, it is not essential and we will spend $544 \nbillion we do not have this year; No. 2, by having this many projects \nat such low value, we do not get our money's worth because we spend a \nton of money in administrative and overhead costs for these small \nprojects. If we are going to spend this money, it ought to be 3 or 6 \nprojects, not the 30-some projects that are in there.\n  I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1086) is withdrawn.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1095, as Modified\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask amendment 1095 be modified as \nstated in the instruction which I am going to send to the desk. There \nis an error. This corrects the error. I ask consent that be done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment will be so modified.\n  The modification is as follows:\n\n       (Purpose: Making technical corrections for NNSA security)\n\n       ``Strike everything after ``buses;'' on page 90, line 14, \n     through page 92, line 25 and insert the following:''.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask consent that Senator John McCain be recognized \nnow for 10 minutes to speak on the bill, or whatever he desires; when \nhe has completed, we proceed to the Feinstein amendment; then we \nproceed to final passage and there will be 10 minutes on the Feinstein \namendment on the rollcall, after which we proceed to rollcall on final \npassage.\n  Mr. REID. I ask it be modified to have the second vote also 10 \nminutes. We have a lot of work to do after that vote is over.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. What is the agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona will have 10 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  Mr. REID. I have no objection.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The rest of the request was that subsequent \nvotes would be 10 minutes each and there would be a 10-minute vote on \nthe Feinstein amendment and a 10-minute vote on final passage.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask it be in order to ask for the yeas and nays on \nfinal passage at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is in order. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I believe the hour now is 5 minutes to \nmidnight\n\n[[Page S7793]]\n\nas I note from the clock. We are now completing consideration of an \nappropriations bill that entails $31.2 billion of the taxpayers' money. \nWe began consideration of this around 10:30, I think. So, between the \nhours of 10:30 p.m. and midnight we have now thoroughly scrutinized the \nexpenditure of $31.2 billion of taxpayer money, which also happens to \nbe $1.5 billion over the request. I am sure all of my colleagues feel \nwe have thoroughly examined a $31.2 billion expenditure of their money.\n  This system we are under now is broken. We shouldn't be, on a night \nbefore we are--we all know we are going into a recess--considering a \nbill of this magnitude in an hour and a half at a very late hour. I \ncertainly do not quarrel with any of my colleagues who did not have an \nopportunity to examine the bill and the report language.\n  It really rolls out the pork barrel. It has $1.5 billion for \nunrequested earmarks with more than $1.3 billion going to 618 Army \nCorps of Engineers projects, 618 projects that the Corps has not \nidentified as priorities for fiscal year 2006. I don't know how we can \njustify providing more than $1 billion for low priority, nonessential \nwater projects and, at the same time, pat ourselves on the back for a \nvery stringent budget that we passed which caused many Americans to \nmake sacrifices in very important programs because we could not afford \nthem.\n  So we are adding $1 billion for low priority, nonessential water \nprojects. Certainly when it comes to funding the pet water projects, \nbudget deficit and national priorities flow out of the minds of our \nappropriators.\n  We just found out that we had about $1 billion or $1.5 billion or $2 \nbillion shortfall in funding for our veterans and their health care, \nbut we can afford more than $1 billion for nonessential projects. One \nof them, $145 million for additional Army Corps projects in \nMississippi. The banks of the Yazoo River Basin overflow with $113.3 \nmillion and the Yazoo pumps are humming right along with $25 million. \nThe Yazoo pumps is the controversial project that I spoke about in the \nSenate more than 2 years ago. The bill brings the total appropriated to \nthe pumps since fiscal year 2003 to $59 million. The project was \nopposed by the EPA. It was opposed by the Fish and Wildlife Service \nbecause it will drain and damage 200,000 acres of public and private \nwetlands in the heart of the Mississippi flyway for no important public \npurpose. Residential flooding problems were addressed decades ago by \nthe Federal construction of the Yazoo backwater levy.\n  We have $90 million for the central and south Florida and the \nKissimmee River; $67 million for Alaska projects, including $15 million \nfor the Nome and Unalaska Harbor improvements. With these improvements \nAlaska residents will continue to enjoy a great deal of the taxpayers' \ndollars; $30 million for the American River watershed in California, \nand the list goes on.\n  I will turn, instead, to some of the authorizations in this \nappropriations bill. It is a violation of Senate rules to authorize on \nan appropriations bill. That rule continues to be violated in an \negregious fashion. Directing or authorizing policy is a function \nreserved for the authorizing committee. With an appropriations bill \nfull of authorizations that modify existing law and policy and \nsignificantly run up the tab for the taxpayers, these authorizing \nprovisions belong in the water resources development legislation. And \nthat is where some of them were taken from and placed into this bill. \nOthers were newly created for the purpose of authorizing projects and \nappropriating funds for them.\n\n  Some examples:\n  An authorization to increase the funding of the Marmet Lock, Kanawha \nRiver, West Virginia, by more than $128 million--not authorized.\n  An authorization for the construction of a project on the Lower Mud \nRiver, West Virginia, in accordance with a draft Corps report--a draft \nCorps report; not a final report, a draft Corps report--and a 75-\npercent Federal cost share of $34,125,000.\n  If a 75/25 Federal cost share seems generous, well, my friends, there \nis a provision in this bill that goes even further, to strike the \nrequired cost-sharing provisions secured by President Reagan in the \nWater Resources Development Act of 1986. The Yazoo Basin Headwater \nImprovement, Mississippi, is authorized to include the design and \nconstruction at full Federal expense such measures as determined by the \nCorps to be ``advisable''--take note of the word ``advisable''--not \ntechnically feasible or economically beneficial--for the entire Yazoo \nRiver and more than 27 tributaries and watersheds. There is no way of \ntelling how much advisable measures might end up costing the taxpayers.\n  Authorization to increase the cost ceiling of the Central New Mexico \nArmy Corps project by $25 million.\n  Authorization for the Corps of Engineers to remove the sunken vessel \nState of Pennsylvania from the Christina River in Delaware with funding \nof $275,000. I guess when $175,000 was earmarked for this project in \nthe Emergency Supplemental Act of 2005, no one appreciated that the \nCorps did not have the authority to address this ``emergency'' as well \nas not knowing the cost.\n  Authorization for $10 million for the Army Corps projects in Alpine, \nCA.\n  Language reauthorizing the Water 2025 grant program and making it \npermanent.\n  Language deauthorizing a portion of an Army Corps project in Tacoma, \nWA. I have cosponsored the Corps of Engineers Modernization and \nImprovement Act of 2005 with Senator Feingold for the purpose of making \neffective and responsible changes in the Army Corps water projects \nprogram through a deliberative process.\n  I encourage my colleagues to look at page 123 of the committee \nreport. Under the heading of Congressionally Directed Projects, as my \ncolleague from Oklahoma has just pointed out, you will find a list of \n47 projects totaling $60.75 million that the committee states are not \nessential.\n  I quote:\n\n       The Committee has provided sufficient funding to cover the \n     cost of these additions so as not to impact essential \n     research.\n\n  So, therefore, it must be nonessential. And there is only one thing \nin common with all of these projects: They are earmarked for a specific \nlocation or institute of higher learning. There is not a one that is \njust for a general purpose.\n  Well, we are spending $87 million--oh, additionally, beginning on \npage 126 of the report, there are eight more Congressionally Directed \nProjects totaling over $26 million that, again, the committee describes \nas nonessential.\n  Why are we spending over $87 million on research that is not \nessential? We have a $365 billion deficit. We are in a war. I do not \nthink it is in keeping with the priorities we need to establish if we \nare going to address the budget deficit nor our priorities of winning \nthe war on terror and taking care of the men and women in the military.\n  I hope that at some point in time we can restore the authorization \nprocess which then would precede the appropriations process. I would \nhope we would at some time consider enforcing the rule of the Senate \nagainst authorizing on an appropriations bill.\n  I do not think there is any doubt that with us considering a bill at \n10:30 p.m. until midnight, for $31.5 billion, it is not the way the \nAmerican taxpayers want us to do business. Therefore, I will oppose \npassage of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1085\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to the Feinstein amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I believe from our side--and Senator \nReid is here--there is no further business to bring before the Senate \non this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, am I correct in understanding this is a 10-\nminute rollcall vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1085. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President I rise today with my colleague \nfrom Florida, Senator Mel Martinez, to talk about the biggest ecosystem \nrestoration project in our country's history, the restoration of \nAmerica's Everglades. The chairman and ranking member of the Energy and \nWater Subcommittee have supported the Everglades, and I appreciate \ntheir dedication to this worthwhile endeavor.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, Senator Nelson and I stand united to \ncontinue the bipartisan tradition of support for this project. I, too, \ncommend the chairman and ranking member for their support of Everglades \nrestoration.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, even before the Congress passed \nthe Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, CERP, in 2000, the \ncountry had begun some important projects that set the stage for CERP. \nOne of those projects is the Modified Waters Delivery Project. The goal \nof the Modified Waters Delivery Project, authorized by the Everglades \nNational Park Protection and Expansion Act of 1989, is to increase \nwater deliveries to Everglades National Park, to improve the natural \nhabitat and, to the extent possible, restore the natural hydrological \nconditions within the park. To do this, however, we must undo the work \nof the Army Corps of Engineers in the 1940s and 1950s which resulted in \nthe Central and Southern Florida Project, C Project. The C \nProject created 1,000 miles of canals, 720 miles of levees, and more \nthan 200 water control structures to alter water flow in the \nEverglades, control flooding, open land for agriculture and provide \nwater supplies to urban areas.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, CERP provides that the Modified Waters \nDelivery Project must be completed before several CERP projects \ninvolving waters flows on the east side of the Everglades National Park \ncan receive appropriations. For that reason, it is imperative that we \ncontinue to receive funding for the Modified Waters Delivery Project \nand that the project be completed as soon as possible.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President we realize that for the first \ntime the administration's budget included funding for the Modified \nWaters Delivery Project in the Energy and Water Appropriations bill. \nPrior to this year, it had been funded solely through the Interior \nAppropriations bill. The House Energy and Water Subcommittee included \nfunding for the Modified Waters Delivery Project. No matter which bill \nit receives funding through, it is imperative that it receive the \nfunding needed to complete it.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President I say to my colleagues from Florida, I know \nhow important restoring America's Everglades is to the United States \nand to the State of Florida, and I appreciate the efforts of Senator \nNelson and Senator Martinez to keep this project on track. I agree that \nfunding for the Modified Waters Delivery Project is essential to \nrestoring the Everglades and I know that it is the administration and \nnot the elected representatives of the State of Florida that have \nchanged how funding for this project has been allocated. With this in \nmind, I continue to believe this project should be funded through the \nInterior Committee, but I will work to ensure that all facets of the \nEverglades Project receives appropriate funding when our bill goes to \nconference.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President I wholeheartedly thank Senator \nReid for his work on behalf of the Everglades and look forward to \nworking with him and Chairman Domenici on Everglades restoration in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I too commend Senator Reid for his \nefforts and look forward to working with him and Chairman Domenici to \ncontinue to make progress on restoring America's Everglades.\n\n\n                       Independent Oil Producers\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. The independent producers of oil and gas are a backbone \nof our domestic supply of energy. The independent producers have made \nclear the high value they place on research performed at the Tulsa \noffice of the Strategic Center for Natural Gas and Oil at National \nEnergy Technology Laboratory.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am aware of the concern expressed by numerous \nproducers and Senators about Department of Energy plans to close such \noil and gas research facilities.\n  I understand that according to Energy Information Administration \ndata, fossil fuels provide over 80 percent of U.S. energy supply, and \noil and natural gas will continue to provide 65 percent of domestic \nenergy needs for 20 to 25 years in the future.\n  I understand the argument that is thus fitting that the National \nEnergy Technology Laboratory devote a significant portion of its \nresearch to fossil fuels and oil and gas technology research and \ndevelopment.\n  I understand that independent oil and natural gas producers--small-\nbusiness owners--drill 85 percent of the wells in the U.S. and provide \n75 percent of America's natural gas supply. Independents produce 60 \npercent of the crude oil in the lower 48 States.\n  I understand that a 2003 National Petroleum Council study stated: \n``Eighty percent of domestic natural gas production in 10 years will be \nfrom wells yet to be drilled. . . . Small, independent producers will \ndrill most of these wells.''\n  I understand the argument that such independent producers have \ncomparatively limited capacity for research and development of new oil \nand gas technologies.\n  I understand the argument that is thus fitting that the National \nEnergy Technology Laboratory utilize its research capacity to assist \nthese independent oil and gas producers by performing the all important \noil and gas research and development function.\n  I understand that the bulk of the independent oil and gas production \nin United States is performed in the west.\n  I understand that many of the independent oil and gas companies are \nheadquartered in the west.\n  I understand the argument that it is thus appropriate to have a \nsignificant and even proportionate share of the research of the \nNational Energy Technology Laboratory performed in the west, at such \nfacilities as the Tulsa office.\n  It is my hope that the Department of Energy will not perform \norganizational or staffing realignments in such a way as to reduce or \nclose the Tulsa office of the National Energy Technology Laboratory.\n  Mr. REID. I concur in these understandings.\n\n\n                             JEFFERSON LAB\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I respectfully request if the chairman, Senator Domenici,\n\n[[Page S7795]]\n\nwould engage in a colloquy regarding the Jefferson Lab in Virginia with \nthe Senators from Virginia?\n  First, I would like to compliment the chairman of the Energy & Water \nSubcommittee, and the ranking member, Senator Reid, for an excellent \njob in preparing a good and balanced appropriations bill for \nconsideration by the Senate. I particularly want to compliment the \nchairman and ranking member for providing increases for the Office of \nScience and for the several important programs within the Office of \nScience, including Nuclear Physics. I know the chairman is well \nacquainted with Jefferson Lab in Newport News, VA, which is one of our \nworld-class basic research laboratories. My colleague from Virginia, \nSenator Allen, and I are both proud of the excellent scientific \nprograms at Jefferson Lab, which is a credit to the commonwea1th of \nVirginia and to the Nation. The increase in funding provided by the \nsubcommittee for nuclear physics will permit Jefferson Lab to increase \nits operational time so the Nation's return on this investment will be \nenhanced.\n  In the 10 years since commissioning, Jefferson Lab has made \ngroundbreaking discoveries on several scientific fronts. An important \nnext step to insure we maintain the pace of scientific discovery, as \nrecommended by the Department's November 2003 report, is to upgrade the \nenergy of the Jefferson Lab electron beam. This will enormously expand \nthe scientific discovery potential of the lab, as well as leverage \nfuture technological advances.\n  Senator Allen and I wrote to the subcommittee suggesting that \nlanguage be included in the committee report urging that the Department \nproceed with the project engineering and design for this energy \nupgrade.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I appreciate the Senators from Virginia and their \ninterest in this important matter and I agree with the importance of \nthe 12GeV Upgrade at the Jefferson Lab. With the funds available to the \nsubcommittee, we made recommendations to give priority to increasing \noperational time for all of our existing labs as opposed to spending \nthese resources on capital expansions. I recognize, however, that with \nregard to Jefferson Lab we are soon at a scientific turning point when \nthe increased energy will be critical to maintaining the pace of \ndiscovery. If it would be satisfactory to the two Virginia Senators, I \nwould like to explore this matter further to see if it can be addressed \nin the fiscal year Conference and by the Department in their fiscal \nyear budget proposal.\n  Mr. REID. I also thank the Virginia Senators for their support of the \nEnergy & Water bill and for their strong support for programs that \nadvance science. I will join with Senator Domenici in an effort to \naccommodate the matter that has been brought to our attention.\n  Mr. ALLEN. want to add my voice in thanking the chairman, Senator \nDomenici and the ranking member, Senator Reid, for their commitment to \nhelp us keep Jefferson Lab at the forefront of scientific discovery. We \nappreciate their continued interest and look forward to working with \nthem.\n\n\n                       ALTAIR AND WMU PARTNERSHIP\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, the senior Senator from Michigan and I \nwould like to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished ranking \nmember of the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee regarding \nthe partnership between Western Michigan University and Altair on the \ndevelopment of nanosensors for chemical and radiological warfare \nagents.\n  Senator Reid, is it your understanding that $1 million of the funding \nprovided to Altair Nanosensor in this bill will be utilized for the \ncontinued partnership between Altair Nanosensor and Western Michigan \nUniversity for the development of nanosensors for chemical and \nradiological warfare agents?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, the Senator has my assurance that it is the \ncommittee's intent that $1 million of the funds provided to Altair \nNanomaterials should be used for the ongoing partnership with Western \nMichigan University.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Reid for his support of \nthis important research and join with my colleague from Michigan in \nsupporting this project.\n  As the ranking member knows, Western Michigan University, Altair \nNanomaterials and the University of Nevada, Reno have had a successful \npartnership to build on their unique strengths to develop nanomaterials \nand nanosensors for chemical and radiological warfare agents.\n  We also thank him for his support of this partnership and work on \nthis important legislation.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member for his \nsupport of this partnership and my colleague for joining me in this \ncolloquy.\n\n\n        department of energy--state energy conservation program\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. I would like to engage the chairman of the subcommittee, \nSenator Domenici, in a brief colloquy on the subject of the State \nTechnologies Advancement Collaborative, commonly called STAC, a program \nin the energy efficiency portion of the Department of Energy \nappropriation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would be pleased to enter into a colloquy with the \nSenator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye, a member of the subcommittee.\n  Mr. INOUYE. The STAC program is a collaboration among two State \norganizations and the Department of Energy, initiated by an agreement \namong the parties in November of 2003. The program was to be a 5-year \npilot of a joint planning process between the States and the \nDepartment, resulting in projects that were multistate collaborations \nacross the country, of interest to both States and the Federal \nGovernment, and cost-shared by the State at no less than 50 percent To \ndate the program has had two competitive solicitations for projects, \nresulting in almost $24 million in buildings, industry, transportation, \ndistributed generation and fossil energy activities, with over $12 \nmillion of that amount being provided by the States. These projects \ninvolve 36 different States.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. As you know, the comprehensive energy legislation that \nthe Senate recently passed authorizes this program.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I am aware that the energy legislation does that, and I \nthank the chairman for including such support in the Energy bill. \nDespite the support of Congress for this program in the past, and in \nthe Energy bill, no funds are provided for the program in the Energy \nand Water appropriation now before us. This highly leveraged, \nefficiently managed program, with wide participation from the States, \nwill not continue, even with the language included in the Energy bill, \nwithout strong support from the appropriations process. Would the \nchairman consider including such support for the program in the \nconference agreement on the Energy and Water appropriations bill by \ndirecting the Department to provide funds out of its regular programs \nat the level no less than the level Congress supported in the fiscal \nyear 2005 appropriation for the program?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to assure the Senator from Hawaii that I \nwill work with him to ensure that this program will be considered in \nconference.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the chairman for his consideration and for his \nsupport of programs important to the States.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to engage in colloquy with the \ndistinguished chairman and ranking member of the Energy and Water \nDevelopment Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations. I commend \nthem for putting together a bill that provides critical support to our \nNation's waterways while promoting energy conservation and protecting \nour environment.\n  One of the important programs funded by this legislation is the \nDepartment of Energy's Weatherization Assistance Program, WAP, which \npromotes energy conservation and reduces utility bills for low-income \nAmericans by supporting home weatherization. I want to share with the \nchairman and ranking member my concern with language on page 122 of the \ncommittee report that calls for the consolidation of six DOE regional \noffices that are used by the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable \nEnergy to reach out to State and local weatherization programs.\n  State energy officials, as well as nonprofit organizations, involved \nin weatherization across the country have expressed concern that the \nproposed consolidation would reduce the effectiveness of the WAP and \nthe State Energy\n\n[[Page S7796]]\n\nProgram. DOE Regional Office Weatherization Project Managers currently \nreview and approve State plans and determine whether all requirements \nof WAP have been met. They provide day-to-day oversight of grants, \nincluding monitoring performance by the States against their plans, and \nthey provide technical assistance to DOE Headquarters and the States \nwith regard to special projects, regional training and technical \nassistance, and resolution of issues among States and local service \nproviders.\n  I share the concerns of weatherization program managers and state \nenergy officers across the country that it would be unwise to remove \nthis valuable network of DOE personnel that has served the regions so \nwell. At the same time, I recognize the subcommittee leadership's \ndesire to develop a cost effective outreach plan that will maintain the \nlevel of service we enjoy today and have a minimal impact on DOE's \ndedicated public servants. I hope the Chairman and ranking member can \nwork with me as the Energy and Water Appropriations bill moves to \nconference to preserve the important role of regional DOE staff in a \nvariety of programs, including the Weatherization Assistance Program \nand the State Energy Program.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I appreciate the concerns the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island has raised and assure the Senator that I will work to \nfind a solution that does not diminish services and recognizes the \nconcerns of State and local weatherization program managers.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I second what the chairman has just stated \nand commit to work with the Senator from Rhode Island during conference \nto address his concerns. I am confident we can find a way to continue \nto support local and State weatherization efforts and the State energy \noffices that have depended on the guidance provided by DOE regional \noffices.\n\n\n             REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OF ENERGY FUTURES MARKETS\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss regulatory \noversight of energy futures markets. Would the distinguished chairman \nof Agriculture Committee engage me and the Senator from California, \nMrs. Feinstein, in a colloquy on this subject?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I would be pleased to enter into such a colloquy.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Senators Feinstein, Levin, and I have raised serious \nconcern about off exchange futures transactions in energy commodities \nunder the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. In \nthe wake of the Western energy crisis, we believe that there needs to \nbe adequate Federal authority over these energy markets and that they \nbe more transparent in order to prevent fraud and manipulation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. It is our understanding that the Agriculture \nCommittee is considering a CFTC proposal to clarify that its antifraud \nauthority in the Commodity Exchange Act clearly covers principal-to-\nprincipal off exchange transactions and a second CFTC proposal to \nclarify its existing authority to bring civil and administrative \nactions, including false reporting cases. We would also hope that the \ncommittee would add language to clarify that exempt energy transactions \nare subject to the CFTC's antimanipulation and false reporting \nauthorities.\n  It is our hope that the Agriculture Committee will include these \nproposals in legislation when reauthorizing the CFTC this year. \nHowever, should the committee report a mark that does not include \nsimilar provisions when placed on the Senate Calendar, we would like \nassurances from the chairman of the Agriculture Committee that we will \nhave the ability to offer an amendment to address these issues when \nthis bill is considered by the full Senate.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I am willing to consider your proposals as part of the \nreauthorization of the Commodity Exchange Act. In addition, you have my \nassurance that I will work with the leadership to accommodate the \nSenators' desire to address these issues when this matter comes before \nthe full Senate.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, our water resources contribute mightily to \nour Nation's economic at environmental well-being.\n  Ports and waterways are integral to our national transportation \nsystem that contribute $718 billion to the Nation's gross domestic \nproduct while ensuring domestic and international trade opportunities \nand safe, low-cost and eco-friendly transportation of import products.\n  While some consider it an anachronism in the age of e-commerce, the \nsystem remains vital to a broad swath of the economy, carrying \neverything from consumer goods, steel, coal, fertilizer, salt, sand, \ngravel, cement, petroleum and chemicals, to the wax for coating milk \ncartons.\n  The U.S. maritime transportation system moves more than 60 percent of \nthe Nation's grain exports and 95 percent of the Nation's imports. We \ncannot be competitive in world trade if we don't maintain efficient and \nreliable transportation.\n  Much of the infrastructure was built early in the last century. It's \nshowing the effects of time and, according to some, of neglect. Old \nequipment takes longer to repair, and it's more vulnerable to nature's \nextremes.\n  Earlier this year, unusually heavy winter rains swelled rivers and \ncaused a series of accidents, including one on the Ohio River in which \na towboat pushing six barges sank after passing through a lock near \nIndustry, PA.\n  After the accidents, General Electric Co.'s plastics division had to \nhalt chemical operations at a plant in Washington, WV, because barges \ncarrying butadiene, a key raw material, couldn't get through. The GE \nplant, which makes plastic used in phones and laptops, continued other \nproduction processes during the disruption.\n  Consol Energy Inc., based in Pittsburgh, moves about a third of the \n68 million tons of coal it produces each year by water, with most of \nthat going directly to power plants. After the recent accidents, the \ncompany told customers it was invoking the force majeure clause in its \ncontracts, which indicates it won't be able to fulfill its obligations \nbecause of circumstances beyond its control.\n  Costs associated with problems on the waterway network, which carries \nabout 13 percent of U.S. intercity freight annually, can be hard to \nmeasure. Towboat companies say it costs them hundreds of dollars an \nhour to have their vessels sitting idle with barges that can't move.\n  I was recently told about a port on the Texas coast where bauxite is \nshipped in to the local aluminum plant. Dredging of this port has not \nbeen a priority for the administration due to their budgetary criteria \nso it has not been dredged on a regular basis. For every inch that the \nships have to be light loaded to enter the port, it costs the shipper \n$180,000. In other words, for every foot of authorized depth not \nprovided here it cost the shipper nearly $2.2 million dollars. If one \nassumes at least one shipment per week, lack of dredging costs the \nshipper more than $100 million annually. Ultimately this cost is passed \non to you and me in the form of higher prices.\n  The routine inspection of a lock in Greenup, KY, in September 2003 \nwas supposed to close the facility for 3 weeks. When the inspectors \nfound bad decay, the shutdown stretched to 2 months. Companies could \ncontinue using a much smaller auxiliary lock at that location to keep \nmoving some goods, but that meant major delays. The U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers, which oversees and maintains the waterways, studied that \nclosure and found the cost of delays to towing companies alone totaled \nabout $14 million.\n  Big companies like U.S. Steel Corp., DuPont Co. and Archer-Daniels-\nMidland Co. make extensive use of the inland waterway system, and \nusually don't have easy alternatives. The rail- and truck-freight \nsystems, which carry about 45 percent and 33 percent, respectively, of \nU.S. intercity freight, are near capacity and much more costly. Moving \nmaterials by barge is about a tenth the cost of using trucks, and two-\nthirds that of rail.\n  Many of the facilities are at the fatigue point now, where they need \nmajor rehabilitation.\n  Each year, the U.S. spends about $500 million on operations and \nmaintenance, including dredging channels of the inland waterway system. \nThe budget for maintenance has held roughly steady in inflation-\nadjusted dollars for three decades. The fact that the system has held \ntogether as well as it has is a\n\n[[Page S7797]]\n\ntribute to the foresight and ingenuity of those that made the \ninvestments in these structures.\n  Ports are our gateways to international trade, and their channels \nmust be enhanced and maintained to accommodate the new generations of \nships sailing to our shores.\n  Our flood damage reduction program saves lives and prevents almost $8 \nin damages for each dollar spent.\n  Corps hydropower facilities supply 24 percent the hydropower \ngenerated in the United States.\n  Shore protection projects provide safety from hurricanes and other \nstorm events for transportation, petroleum and agriculture \ninfrastructure around our coastal waterways and deltas as well as \nrecreational benefits, returning $4 in benefits for each dollar \ninvested.\n  Projects for water supply, irrigation, recreation and wildlife \nhabitat provide innumerable benefits.\n  Investing in water resources sustains economic growth and the \nAmerican worker, directly eases growing congestion on our Nation's \nroads and railroads and provides a finer quality of life.\n  Recently, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave the Nation's \nwater a ``D-''--their lowest grade--because of their steadily \ndeteriorating condition and reliability.\n  Our Nation simply cannot afford for this trend to continue. The \nadministration, whether Republican or Democrat, has consistently \nrefused to provide the resources necessary to reverse the decline in \nour infrastructure.\n  For fiscal year 2006, the Senate has asserted leadership in reversing \nthis trend. The Senate Bill provides $5.3 billion for the Corps of \nEngineers.\n  The Senate has included $180 million for the Corps' general \ninvestigations program. This account funds nearly all studies that the \nCorps undertakes to determine the technical adequacy, environmental \nsustainability and economic viability of water resource solutions. The \nfunding will provide the Corps with a robust national program as \nopposed to the paltry $95 million proposed in the administration's \nfiscal year 2006 budget request.\n  The Senate bill includes $2.087 billion for the Corps' construction \naccount. This account provides funding for construction of the water \nresource solutions authorized by the Congress. The Senate has provided \nnearly $450 million more than the administration's fiscal year 2006 \nrequest. These additional funds will allow the Corps to make \nsubstantial progress on projects recommended by the budget as well as \nall of the ongoing projects that the administration chose not to fund.\n  The Senate bill includes $2.1 billion for the operations and \nmaintenance account. This is about $121 million more that the \nPresident's fiscal year 2006 budget request and will allow the Corps to \nrestore routine levels of services at Corps' facilities and provide \ndredging for projects that the administration has designated as low \nuse.\n  The Senate bill rejects the budget proposals from the administration \nconcerning multiple year contracting and direct funding of hydropower \nmaintenance by the Power Marketing Administrations.\n  The Senate bill also recommends that the administration and the Corps \ngo back to the drawing board on the process that they use to determine \nwhich projects should be budgeted. The current process introduces too \nmuch uncertainty into the project development process.\n  The administration needs to honor the commitments that they have made \nto local sponsors. The sponsors need the certainty that if they get \ntheir funding for these projects, the Federal Government will meet \ntheir commitments.\n  Finally, the Senate bill reaffirms the need for the Corps to be able \nto manage their program in an effective and efficient manner. The \nability to reprogram project funds and the use of continuing contracts \nare a necessary part of this overall management strategy.\n  The Senate has produced a balanced and fair bill for the Corps.\n  Thank you Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendments and third reading of the bill. The amendments were ordered \nto be engrossed and the bill to be read a third time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. McConnell.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate \nreceives from the House the emergency supplemental bill for veterans \nhealth care, the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; that if \nthe bill is less than $1.5 billion, all after the enacting clause be \nstricken and the text of the amendment as authorized earlier today by \nthe Appropriations Committee to include the full $1.5 billion as passed \nby the Senate yesterday by a vote of 96 to 0 be agreed to; that the \nbill as amended be read a third time and passed and motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S7798]]\n\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me take \na moment to review where we are. On Wednesday afternoon, on a \nbipartisan unanimous basis, we passed the Santorum amendment to address \nthe funding shortfall, the surprise funding shortfall, of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. Based on the very best information we \nhad 48 hours ago, the amendment was passed at an appropriated $1.5 \nbillion to address the critical health care needs at the Department \nthat had been underfunded as a result of some erroneous calculations of \nthe use and need by our veterans. This money is available to be spent \nin this fiscal year as well as the next.\n  In the interim, the administration, working aggressively, refined \nthat estimate for the Department in this fiscal year, fiscal year 2005, \nand this morning or about 12 hours ago, Thursday morning, informed the \nHouse of Representatives that it would be best to appropriate $975 \nmillion for these veterans' health care needs for this fiscal year now \non an emergency basis.\n  Tonight, not too long ago, the House passed that request, which was \none of the quickest actions on a spending need since the Budget Act \nbecame law now 30 years ago. However, and this is important, the \nadministration has not yet been able to adequately define and hone the \nspecific estimate of the extra need for the year 2006.\n  I have been informed that this work for ensuring an accurate report \nfor Congress for money in fiscal year 2006 is ongoing right now by the \nDepartment and by OMB, the Office of Management and Budget. Therefore, \nit is my expectation that within the next few weeks the administration \nwill give us, will transmit a budget amendment to Congress, which will \naccurately detail the precise amount of money that the administration \nneeds, or believes that they need, for funding these veterans' health \ncare needs for fiscal year 2006. That request, I understand, is likely \nto be large and could be even larger than what we approved now on \nWednesday.\n  Once we have that information in hand and know that it is accurate, \nwe can call up the House bill which contains funding for this fiscal \nyear and then add that necessary funding for the next fiscal year and \nthen send it back to the House. That would be a very quick course of \naction. Or we could take that accurate number, once determined, and in \nconference with the House, adjust the amendment that we passed \nyesterday. Finally, we could take that accurate number, incorporate it \ninto the appropriate subcommittee fiscal year 2006 legislation.\n  I mention these options--and there may be even other options as \nwell--to cure the problem. I look forward to working with the \ndistinguished chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee to ensure \nthat the administration gives us accurate information for next year, as \nwell as the appropriations subcommittee chairman, as well as the \nleadership of the House and the administration.\n  So before the Chair asks again if there are any objections to the \nunanimous consent, let me just turn to the chairman of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee to see if there is a comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first let me say that I am surprised that \nthe distinguished majority leader is surprised at what the Veterans' \nAdministration and the administration has talked about today of what \nthey need. We have been, for months, talking about the shortfall with \nthe Veterans' Administration, months--not weeks, not days but months. \nWe have had three votes, two in committee and two on the Senate floor, \nwhere we, the minority, have begged for more money for our veterans.\n  It seems somewhat unusual to me that approximately 24 hours ago, the \nSenate unanimously passed a $1.5 billion supplemental for veterans for \nhealth care. We just did it. The House Republicans have again \nshortchanged our veterans by reducing this number by over $500 million. \nWe will insist on a right to amend the bill to bring it to the full \n$1.5 billion mark. This is the same amendment which the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, on a bipartisan basis, unanimously authorized \nthe chairman and ranking member to offer to the House supplemental, \nshould it arrive here below the $1.5 billion mark. This is the real \nworld we are in.\n  Now, I also say this: We are depending on the Office of Management \nand Budget and the Veterans' Administration at this late hour? Would it \nnot be terrible, would it not be awful, if the veterans got a little \ntoo much money? What is this, some game that we are playing? We are \nplaying with the lives of people.\n  In Las Vegas, we have people waiting as long as 11 months to get into \na hospital to have some of the radiology work done. We learned \nyesterday that they are literally borrowing from Peter to pay Paul, \nthey are robbing the capital accounts with the Veterans' \nAdministration.\n  As we speak, we have about 140,000 troops in Iraq. They are being \nworked back all the time, and these people who come home need help, in \naddition to World War II veterans who need help.\n  Why don't we have the House Republicans meet their responsibilities? \nAnd why at this late hour are we trying to protect the White House when \nthis body voted by a unanimous vote, everybody in the Senate voted for \nthis? Yet we had a unanimous vote in the Appropriations Committee \nauthorizing the chairman and ranking member to do the exact thing that \nI have asked to do.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Through the Chair, I would like to ask the Senator from \nNevada a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend. The unanimous \nconsent request is pending. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, at this late hour it is interesting to me \nthat, having had the House and the Senate speak in two different voices \non the same issue in less than 24 hours, we would stand here and \ndetermine exactly the right thing to do.\n  The $1.5 billion that we voted on yesterday is a figure I and my \nstaff came up with. I happen to be the Republican chairman of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee. But, having said that, the ranking \nDemocrat Member, Danny Akaka, agreed with that. Senator Patty Murray \nhad been out front on it early on. I told her at the time I didn't know \nif our figures were right, and if we were wrong we would correct them.\n  We can point a lot of fingers, but here are some realities. We have \nincreased the veterans budget nearly 10 percent every year for the last \n4. I said on the floor yesterday and I will say it again tonight, \nbecause it cannot be disputed, whether it was a Democratic President or \nwhether it was a Republican President, the fact is they almost always \nunderfunded veterans. It was the Congress in a bipartisan vote that \nfunded it accurately and adequately. For those percentages of increase \nover the last several years, Democrats and Republicans alike stood \ntogether to do it and we produced a high-quality health care system.\n  No veteran who is qualified today is being denied. No veteran \ntonight, with the now shortfall, is being denied. The reason they are \nnot being denied is quite simple. We are borrowing interagency accounts \nto address the immediate shortfalls. And as we do that at the \nadministration level, the Congress, the Senate, the House, are seeking \nto replenish those funds.\n  There is a difference of opinion here, not between Democrats and \nRepublicans, but between the Congress and the administration. We are \nworking that out.\n  I hope, and many of my colleagues on the other side agree, that when \nwe return from the July 4 break, with a request of OMB to have those \nfigures accurate, we can address this in an accurate way. I believe we \nare right. I believe the $1.5 billion is an accurate figure. But we \nagreed in a bipartisan way to say that those moneys shall be spent in \n2005 and 2006, that there would be carryover money passing through in a \nseamless way from those two fiscal years.\n  If we do what the minority leader, the Democratic leader asks that we \ndo\n\n[[Page S7799]]\n\ntonight, it is a political expression. It is not something that will \nbecome a functional, operative bill.\n  The House is out. We are about to go out. There will be no \nconference. We will be back to visit this again a week from now. The \nreason we will be back a week from now with or without action on the \nfloor of the Senate tonight is we do not have answers to this problem. \nWe are asking for those answers because this time I have told the \nSecretary, I have told OMB, and as chairman of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee--Senator Hutchison is chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee and made it very clear, and my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle are backing us on this--we will get the right figures and \nwe will do it right.\n  Now, with the new progressions, now with the growth rates understood, \nnow with the incoming out of Iraq and Afghanistan and those numbers \nclearly understandable, we will serve them as we have been serving them \nand no veteran so qualified will be denied.\n  That is what this Congress has done responsibly year after year and \nthat is what this Congress will do. The Senate has acted. But in this \nhour there is nothing we can do, nor in this instance should do. In \nthat time, no veteran will be denied service.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is interesting to hear the description given by the \nSenator who is the chairman of the veterans' committee. It is also \ninteresting to put it in the context of where we have come over the \nlast few days.\n  The amendment on the floor just a few days ago when the shortfall was \nnoted on a bipartisan basis from Senator Murray was an amendment less \nthan the one adopted. It was $1.4 billion. The Senator, the chairman of \nthe committee, as well as others, came together on a bipartisan basis \nand said, That is not enough. That is not enough, $1.4 billion will not \nmeet the shortfall. By our best estimate, they said 24 hours ago or \nwhenever we debated it, we need more, we need $1.5 billion. And we \nacceded to your knowledge of the agency and your knowledge of its need \nand came together on a bipartisan basis--I believe the vote was 96 to \nnothing--and said that is exactly what we will do, $1.5 billion.\n\n  Then while we barely finished this work, the House came back and said \nno, the figure is $975 million or whatever number they came up with, \ndramatically less than what we had approved.\n  It strikes me as interesting that we are going to back off of our \nbest estimate and say let's err on the side of less money for the \nVeterans' Administration. Why wouldn't the Senate be holding fast to \nits position? Why wouldn't the Senate be holding fast to its position \nand say we believe $1.5 billion is the right number still, as we \nbelieved 24 hours ago when we voted on it? Why do we want to back off \nat this point and say it must be that much less?\n  It strikes me, unless there has been a dramatic infusion of new \ninformation and knowledge, that we are acceding to the House of \nRepresentatives because they have decided to go home.\n  Mr. REID. Regular order, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Regular order has been called for. Is there \nobjection?\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Reserving the right to object, and I will be brief, just \nlistening to the conversation, I ask the minority leader's unanimous \nconsent agreement be modified to simply clear the House legislation for \n975, and that the House bill be considered read three times, passed, \nand the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so modify his request?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, with all due respect to the distinguished \nmajority leader, my friend, I will not agree to the modification. I am \nstanding on the unanimous consent request I offered a few minutes ago.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FRIST. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the original request by the \nminority leader for the unanimous consent.\n  Mr. FRIST. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, for the short term, we have a problem that \nwe will resolve when we return a week from now. By then I hope we have \naccurate figures, so that we can do as I think the Senate wants to do, \nand as the unanimous consent of the Senate expressed the other evening. \nAt this late hour, all we could do is make a political expression. We \ncould not resolve an issue. I think we are all intent on resolving a \nvery important issue for the sake of our veterans. We hope to have \nthose numbers, and I think we will. Those requests have gone to OMB, to \nsee what their figures are, as I work with the Veterans' \nAdministration, as appropriators do to make sure we have those accurate \nfigures. I think all of us this time want to get it right. I know this \nSenator does.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7799-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO BERNARD A. ``TONY'' GOETZ\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nKentuckian who has spent much of his life dedicated to improving access \nto healthcare and educational opportunities for the people of the \nCommonwealth. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring \nOwensboro native, Mr. Bernard A. ``Tony'' Goetz, as he prepares to \nbegin a new chapter in his life--retirement.\n  I have had the pleasure of working with Tony on several different \noccasions, particularly through his tenure at the University of \nKentucky where he served as Associate Dean of the College of Medicine \nand later as Director of Government Relations. In addition, Tony \ndedicated more than half of his professional career to developing an \neffective alumni affairs program at UK. He also helped establish the UK \nCenter for Rural Health, create the UK Area Health Education System and \nlaunch the McDowell Cancer Network, which later became the Kentucky \nCommunity Cancer Program.\n  Tony's background in healthcare education and advocacy dates back to \n1965, when he first served as executive director of the Owensboro \nCouncil for Retarded Children. He then served as executive director of \nthe Blue Grass Association for Mental Retardation. In his next two \njobs, Tony served as chief executive officer of the Bluegrass Regional \nHealth Planning Council, Inc. and the East Kentucky Health Systems \nAgency, Inc.\n  Continuing his pattern of selfless service, Tony most recently worked \nin the Office of the Governor in Frankfort, KY. For the past two \nsessions, he has served as liaison between the Governor and the \nKentucky General Assembly, combining his legendary affable nature with \nencyclopedic command of details he helped the Commonwealth move forward \non a number of legislative fronts. Though his employers and \nresponsibilities have changed over the years, it is obvious that Tony \nwas instrumental and effective at every position he held. He balanced \nmany duties and he performed each of them with tremendous skill. I ask \nmy colleagues in the Senate to join me in honoring Tony Goetz for his \ndedicated service. I wish him well in retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7799-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7799-S7800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  EULOGY TO FORMER SENATOR JAMES EXON\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the eulogy \ngiven by former Senator Bob Kerrey at the funeral of our late \ncolleague, Jim Exon, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S7800]]\n\n\n\n                      Eulogy for Senator Jim Exon\n\n                            (By Bob Kerrey)\n\n       To Governor Dave Heineman--I thank you for the wisdom and \n     the generosity to allow these services to be conducted in the \n     rotunda of this capitol that Jim Exon loved so much. It is a \n     precedent worthy of the risk.\n       To the family of Senator Jim Exon--I pray your pain will \n     pass and become a loving memory. I hope you will always feel \n     pride to have known this great man so well.\n       To his friends, both in attendance and not--let us count \n     our blessings that we were so fortunate that he cared for us.\n       To his colleagues who have left their work in the Senate to \n     travel to Nebraska to pay tribute to one of their own: \n     Senators Hagel and Nelson, Leader Reid, Senators Bingaman, \n     Levin and Akaka--thank you for honoring Jim in this way.\n       To the lawyers present--I apologize for I must begin my \n     eulogy to Jim Exon with a lawyer joke. It is, I assure you, \n     the least offensive one he ever told me. A doctor, a teacher, \n     and a lawyer are killed in an automobile accident and find \n     themselves at the gates of heaven at precisely the same time. \n     Saint Peter is in an unusually good mood and asks them each a \n     very easy question: how much is 2 plus 2? In turn the doctor \n     and the teacher give the correct answer and are granted entry \n     through the pearly gates. The lawyer hesitates, pulls Saint \n     Peter aside and whispers: ``What do you want it to be?''\n       This was a question Jim Exon never asked. He always added \n     up the numbers and gave them to you straight whether or not \n     you liked the answer.\n       He was born on August 9, 1921. It was a bad day for his St. \n     Louis Cardinals; they lost to the Brooklyn Dodgers 8 to 7.\n       Each of us is influenced--though by no means limited--by \n     the circumstances of our births. Jim Exon was born the same \n     year that Adolf Hitler became Chairman of the Nazi Party. In \n     that year the United States officially ended World War I and \n     signed a peace treaty with Germany. Radicals Sacco and \n     Venzetti were found guilty of murder by a Massachusetts \n     judge. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was dedicated by \n     President Harding at Arlington Cemetery on November 11, \n     Armistice Day. In South Dakota, where Jim was born, \n     scientists held a conference that summer to discuss the \n     unrealized potential of electricity.\n       He was eight years old when the stock market crashed and \n     the Depression officially began. He was witness to the dust \n     storms and the terrible consequence of the loss of that top \n     soil. He came of age when the possibility of an economic \n     revolution was real, when the New Deal became a salvation and \n     a political way of life for many who believed that FDR had \n     saved their lives.\n       He was a teenager when the lights came on in two-thirds of \n     Nebraska thanks to rural electrification. He remembered the \n     enactment of Social Security legislation and the hope which \n     the WPA and the CCC gave to grown men and women who had given \n     up.\n       He was twenty years old when Japan invaded Pearl Harbor. In \n     a single day the naive innocence which had propelled our \n     twenty year disarmament came to a sudden and terrible end. \n     The United States had steadfastly stayed out of the war \n     trying at all cost to avoid this conflict. Thus it was that \n     he came of age at a time when losing our freedoms was not \n     political rhetoric but a real possibility. He knew the \n     terrible price of weakness and isolation.\n       Both of these big events--the Depression and the Second \n     World War--defined Jim Exon. They explained a lot about who \n     he was, why he took the political and economic positions that \n     he did, and why he always seemed so grateful to be alive and \n     an American. It explains why he didn't complain, why he \n     seemed to take whatever came his way in stride, and why he \n     talked little about the hardships he had so obviously \n     endured. Most of all it explains his values: a lifetime \n     commitment to Pat, his children and his community, and his \n     unrelenting desire to make life a little better for everyone.\n       The events of Jim Exon's youth explain a lot about Jim \n     Exon, the man. But one thing remains a mystery to me: Where \n     did that laugh come from? I have never heard anything quite \n     like it. It was more like a duck call than a laugh. But, like \n     so many other things about Jim Exon (his pipe, his short \n     sleeve shirts, his big ears) his laugh added to his \n     authenticity. He was a man who never caused you to wonder: \n     what's he thinking? What you saw was what you got with Jim \n     Exon. Except that some people saw this large, big wristed son \n     of the high plains and concluded that he was a rube who \n     could be easily fooled. The thing is Jim Exon could tell \n     when someone was underestimating him and he'd turn it into \n     his advantage--either for fun or the benefit of \n     Nebraskans.\n       He came to New York City once to visit a number of people, \n     including the New Deal economist Eliot Janeway. Arriving in \n     Mr. Janeway's plush offices Governor Exon saw from the look \n     on the receptionist's face that she was a little taken aback \n     by his look. So, after asking directions to and using the \n     bathroom, he returned to comment to a startled receptionist \n     how wonderful it was to find a place with indoor plumbing.\n       ``That's something we don't have back in Nebraska. And what \n     are those white porcelain bowls hanging on the walls?''\n       After she explained their function and he exclaimed that he \n     was going to have one installed in the Governor's mansion \n     when he returned to Lincoln, she realized she was being put-\n     on.\n       Basin Electric in Wyoming was not so lucky. As Governor, \n     Jim had persuaded his friend Attorney General Paul Douglas to \n     bring a lawsuit against the State of Wyoming over a water \n     dispute involving Wyoming's decision to grant a permit to \n     Basin Electric for a new power plant. Negotiating in private \n     Governor Exon emerged with an agreement which created the \n     Sandhill Crane Trust on the Platte River near Grand Island. \n     The net for Nebraska has been hundreds of millions of tourism \n     dollars and sufficient stream flow to guarantee the \n     preservation of an ancient wild bird flyway.\n       This conservation ethic produced a locally famous encounter \n     at Valentine High School shortly after I arrived in the \n     Senate. Senator Exon had introduced legislation to designate \n     a portion of the Niobrara River as ``scenic,'' which would \n     limit development--something that Cherry County residents are \n     not known for favoring. I suggested to Jim that we schedule a \n     town hall meeting in the high school and invite opponents and \n     supporters to give us their views.\n       Needless to say few of the latter showed up. In fact we \n     were welcomed at the door of the school by two cowboys on \n     horseback who turned their horses as we approached. In doing \n     so we were able to see hand painted signs they had hung \n     from their saddles. One said Senator Exon; the other said \n     Senator Kerrey. Both had arrows pointed down at the \n     horses' rear ends.\n       A humbling moment.\n       As humbling as when he and I first met in 1982. As a \n     relatively unknown candidate for Governor, I wanted to get a \n     photograph of Senator Exon and myself to include in my \n     campaign brochures. Upon meeting him I was surprised how tall \n     he was and even more so when the film was developed. I looked \n     like a small imitation of the real thing standing next to \n     him. In order to use the image I chose to turn the negative \n     slightly when it was printed making us appear a little closer \n     in stature.\n       Truth is I had to do a lot of that during my sixteen years \n     in elected politics when standing next to him.\n       What impressed me most about Jim Exon was that he never let \n     his size or his power inflate his personal opinion of \n     himself. Remarkably and gratefully he never lost his \n     humility. He never stopped typing notes to Lenny in the \n     cloakroom about some baseball detail that only he knew. He \n     never stopped returning the calls of friends who had helped \n     him get started or he knew along the way. He began and ended \n     the same.\n       He made friends with rich and poor alike, with the powerful \n     and the powerless. He could count half a dozen Presidents he \n     had met, including President Bill Clinton with whom he was \n     especially close. They were all the same to him--just another \n     human being with a range of strengths and weaknesses.\n       He left behind a big and lasting legacy. Balanced budgets, \n     stronger defense, land conserved, rural communities \n     healthier, better schools and jobs, and a more just America. \n     Beyond those accomplishments was something more important. To \n     all of us who met him, knew him, respected and loved him, he \n     was like Jimmy Stewart in ``It's A Wonderful Life.'' Our \n     lives and the places we call home would not have been the \n     same without him. Governor, Senator, Big Jim, J.J. Exon died \n     on Friday at 8:30 p.m. on June 10, 2005, after the \n     Cardinals had secured a 7 to 1 victory over the New York \n     Yankees. For him a perfect ending to his life on this \n     earth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7800-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7800-S7801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, yesterday I voted for both of the amendments \noffered by Senators Burns and Boxer in relation to studies that test \npesticides on humans. I believe that they are both partially right. We \nshould not cut off vital products from the market that are needed and \nused in our homes, businesses, and farms. Using the best available \nscientific data is essential in assuring the public that these valuable \nproducts are safe and also readily available. Senator Burns's amendment \nwould support a thorough review of human dosing studies to make sure \nthat they comport with certain conditions and would report back to the \nauthorizing committees as well as the Appropriations Committee.\n  At the same time, the EPA should establish strong scientific and \nethical standards on studies that expose people, especially young \nchildren, to various pesticides, fungicides, and other toxins that are \nused in commerce. I am concerned that the now-halted study on small \nchildren from Jacksonville, FL is an irresponsible example of how to \nconduct such reviews. Strong standards should apply both to the \nagency's own studies as well as to third-party studies. Important \nquestions have been raised about the protocols and guidelines of \ncertain studies, and therefore it is only prudent to step back for a \nyear to scrutinize that process. For this reason, I voted for the Boxer \namendment.\n  I hope that the study required by the Burns amendment will be carried \nout\n\n[[Page S7801]]\n\nin a timely and responsible way and provide the necessary information \nso that approach decisions can be made about the Environmental \nProtection Agency's rule-making standards applying to the studies human \ndosing and their toxic effects.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7801-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RETIREMENT OF ROBERT ABBEY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today on the occasion of his \nretirement, to honor the 27 years of public service of Robert V. Abbey \nof Reno, NV. Bob hails originally from Mississippi. He was born in \nClarksdale and earned his Bachelors Degree in Resource Management at \nthe University of Southern Mississippi. Over the past 8 years, I am \nproud to say he has become a Nevadan.\n  Bob began his public service working for the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers. Later he moved to the Bureau of Land Management where he has \ndistinguished himself as a dedicated land manager, visionary leader, \nand exceptional citizen.\n  Bob's early career at BLM included tours of duty as a budget analyst \nin Washington D.C.; assistant district manager in Yuma, AZ, district \nmanager in Jackson, MS; and associate and acting state director in \nColorado. Since the fall of 1997, Bob has served as the Nevada State \ndirector of the BLM. His job may very well be the toughest in Nevada \nand perhaps in the ranks of the BLM; in any case, it is among the most \nimportant for both.\n  Although his address has changed many times during his career, his \ncommitment to public lands and public service has never wavered. The \nWest and Nevada are better for it.\n  Today, Bob Abbey leads a staff of 750 employees who manage 48 million \nacres of public land in Nevada. He has led the Nevada BLM during an \nexciting and historic time. Increased public land use, record \npopulation growth, evolving management mandates and shrinking budgets \nrepresent just a few of the challenges facing the Nevada BLM. Bob Abbey \nhas handled every difficulty with grace and vision.\n  During his tenure, Bob directed the implementation of the Southern \nNevada Public Lands Management Act. This is no small task given that \nClark County, NV leads the Nation in sustained growth and development \nand ever increasing recreational use of public lands.\n  Bob and his staff also helped me and the other members of the Nevada \nCongressional Delegation in the development of the Clark and Lincoln \nCounty land bills. These bills were among the most significant public \nlands legislation in the 107th and 108th Congresses, respectively, and \nBob's leadership helped make them possible.\n  Bob's motto that we have more in common than our differences has set \nthe tone for the best working relationships between Federal land \nmanagers and Nevadans in my memory. He has inspired his employees to \nsolve problems, take pride in their work, and serve the public with \ndistinction. The results serve as testament to his character, courage, \nand conviction.\n  At the end of next week, Bob Abbey will retire from Federal service \nwith a remarkable record of achievements. But perhaps his greatest \ncontribution as a land manager will come to fruition while he is \nenjoying his retirement with his wife Linda.\n  After wildfires devastated vast swaths of rangeland in Nevada and \nother Western States in 1999 and 2000, Bob played a key role in \ncrafting a blueprint for rangeland and ecosystem restoration in the \nWest. The so-called Great Basin Restoration Initiative is a grand \nvision and roadmap for healing the landscape in Nevada. Unfortunately, \nto date, the BLM and Department of Interior have yet to match Bob's \nvision with appropriate funding. It is my hope that this is a temporary \ndelay and that one day soon, a thriving Great Basin ecosystem will \nserve as the enduring legacy of Bob Abbey's public service.\n  Although I regret that Bob Abbey is retiring, I know I speak for \nthousands of Nevadans when I thank him for his exemplary public service \nand wish him well with his future endeavors. We know Bob has made \nNevada and our Nation a better place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7801-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO CARLOS A. GARCIA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I say \nfarewell to one of Clark County's most effective and innovative \nsuperintendents, Carlos A. Garcia.\n  I have worked with Carlos for several years and have had the pleasure \nof seeing first-hand his work as superintendent of Clark County \nschools, the fifth largest school district in the Nation.\n  I believe that one of the reasons he has acclimated so well to Clark \nCounty, and Las Vegas in particular, is because he grew up in Los \nAngeles. After graduating from high school in L.A., he earned \nbachelor's and master's degrees from Claremont College and an \nadministrative credential in educational administration from California \nState University.\n  He developed experience as a teacher and principal in California. \nAfter several years, including serving as principal at a National Blue \nRibbon School, he eventually became the superintendent of the Fresno \nUnified School District. When Carlos Garcia arrived in Clark County, he \nbegan to reorganize. He divided the county into regions; he began to \naddress achievements and accountability; and he championed the cause of \neducating Nevada's young people to parents, teachers, business leaders \nand lawmakers.\n  It has been my pleasure to participate in different events and \ndiscussions with Carlos. We sat around a table with the other 16 \nsuperintendents in Nevada to discuss the No Child Left Behind Act. As a \nresult of his organization and participation, I was able to come back \nto Washington with a clear idea of what Nevada's school districts \nneeded. His leadership of the superintendents was impressive, and the \nmutual respect was apparent.\n  Together, Carlos and I welcomed 60 new teachers from the Teach for \nAmerica program. As a result of this venture, I am a cosponsor of \nlegislation that will ensure that recruiting, training, and supporting \nthis teacher corps will be supported by the Congress. When it comes to \nour school children and teachers, he always has a plan and always looks \ntoward the future.\n  Now, Carlos has a new future to plan: his own. I am sorry that I \ncannot be there to shake his hand. Thank you, Carlos, for being \ndedicated to providing the children of Clark County with a first-rate \npublic education. All the best to you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7801-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7801-S7802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    POTENTIAL SUPREME COURT VACANCY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as the Senate prepares to adjourn for the \nJuly 4 recess, one of the most noteworthy developments is an event that \nhas not occurred. Despite widespread speculation, there have been no \nannounced retirements from the United States Supreme Court.\n  We are all aware that Chief Justice Rehnquist has faced health \nchallenges. I am impressed with his courage and fortitude.\n  Many feared he would not be able to attend the January inauguration \nto administer the oath of office to President Bush. But there he was, \nbraving the cold to perform his constitutional duty. Many thought he \nwould retire from the Court long before the end of the Supreme Court \nterm. But there he was last Monday, presiding over the Court's final \nsession, and announcing an important First Amendment decision in which \nhe had authored the majority opinion.\n  I was not a member of the Senate when William Rehnquist was nominated \nas an Associate Justice in 1971 or when he was promoted to be Chief \nJustice in 1986. He was not unanimously confirmed to either position. \nBut the Chief Justice has won many new admirers in the Senate in recent \nyears. We appreciate the dignity and clarity with which he has led the \nFederal judiciary for almost 20 years. I know I speak for all of my \ncolleagues in commending Chief Justice Rehnquist for his tremendous \nservice to the Court and to the country. I hope he stays on the bench \nfor years to come.\n  Whenever the Chief Justice or any of the Associate Justices decide to \nretire, I hope and expect that the President will take seriously the \n``Advice'' part of ``Advice and Consent.'' This is not just about the \nSupreme Court. The President should seek the advice of the Senate \nregarding all nominees. But consultation regarding a Supreme Court \nvacancy is especially important.\n\n[[Page S7802]]\n\n  The Court is of paramount importance in the life of the Nation. These \njustices deal with complex legal issues that affect the lives of all \nAmericans. It is the final guardian of our rights and liberties.\n  There is a long tradition of Presidents consulting with the Senate \nbefore a Supreme Court nomination occurs.\n  In 1869, President Grant appointed Edwin Stanton to the Supreme Court \nin response to a petition from Senators and House members.\n  In 1932, President Hoover gave Senator William Borah a list of the \ncandidates he was considering to replace Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. \nBorah persuaded Hoover to move the name that was on the bottom of the \nlist to the top. That candidate, Benjamin Cardozo, was confirmed \nunanimously.\n  In his autobiography, Senator Hatch takes credit for convincing \nPresident Clinton not to send the Senate potentially controversial \nnominees and instead to nominate individuals with broad bipartisan \nsupport. Both of President Clinton's nominees, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and \nStephen Breyer, were easily confirmed with Senator Hatch's support.\n  Last week, 44 Senators sent President Bush a letter urging him to use \nthe advice and consent process to unite the country behind a consensus \nnominee. This built on the bipartisan agreement that averted the \nnuclear option earlier this year. At least two of the signers of that \nagreement, Senators Nelson of Nebraska and Salazar of Colorado have \nseparately written to the President to urge consultation. A third \nsigner, Senator Pryor, spoke about the importance of consultation on \nthe Senate floor last week.\n  Consultation with the Senate is not an end in itself. The purpose of \nconsultation is to help the President arrive at a consensus choice for \nthe Court, a nominee like Sandra Day O'Connor who will bring the \ncountry together, not tear it apart.\n  Meaningful consultation will ensure judges who are fair and \nindependent and who are committed to protecting individual rights and \nfreedoms.\n  Meaningful consultation will ensure that the President's judicial \nnominees are highly qualified men and women whose views are within the \nbroad constitutional mainstream.\n  And meaningful consultation will help us avoid a divisive episode \nlike we saw over the nuclear option. There are too many important \nissues facing this country to waste the Senate's time fighting over \nradical extremist judges.\n  I recently had the opportunity to meet with the White House Counsel, \nHarriet Miers. Ms. Miers made clear that the White House is not yet \nprepared to engage in formal consultation with us regarding a possible \nSupreme Court vacancy because there have been no announced retirements \nfrom the Court. I respect that position.\n  When a vacancy does arise, the President should obtain the views of \nSenate Democrats about individuals under consideration for appointment \nto the Court, consistent with the advice and consent clause of the \nConstitution.\n  Let me be clear: real consultation does not consist of the White \nHouse asking Senators for the names of individuals we think should be \nconsidered for appointment to the Court. I am happy to provide such \nnames, but that is not enough. Meaningful consultation under the advice \nand consent clause means that the President presents the names of \nindividuals he is seriously considering and seeks our views on those \ncandidates.\n  And of course the nomination of a candidate is just the beginning of \nthe Senate process. There will be comprehensive hearings in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, and a thorough debate in the full Senate. Any \nadvice that Senators provide to the President in advance of a \nnomination is of course subject to review in light of information that \ncomes out during the confirmation process.\n  As the President considers the range of individuals who might be \nconsidered for the Court, I hope he will not limit his search to \nsitting Federal judges. History demonstrates the value of considering \nindividuals who have achieved prominence in civic life outside of the \njudiciary. In this century, such diverse figures as former President \nWilliam Howard Taft, Alabama Senator Hugo Black, and California \nGovernor Earl Warren have served with distinction on the Court.\n  The Senate may be especially fertile ground for finding a Supreme \nCourt justice. Including Justice Black, some 14 Senators in American \nhistory have served on the Court. A current or former Senator would \nbring an important perspective to the Court's understanding of \nlegislative history, and the need to strike a balance between the will \nof the majority and the rights of the minority in our society.\n  I have discussed publicly a number of current Senators who I believe \nare worthy of the President's consideration. Each of these Senators \npossesses relevant legal experience and enjoys the respect and \nadmiration of fellow Senators.\n  Above all, I urge the President to work with the Senate at the \nappropriate time to identify a consensus nominee who can unite the \ncountry. With our country at war and our economy facing challenges, we \ndon't have time for controversial, confrontational judicial \nnominations. We need cooperation and consensus.\n  Our Founding Fathers were brilliant to give the executive and the \nlegislative branch shared responsibility for choosing members of the \njudicial branch. When properly executed, this division of labor ensures \nthat our judges will be independent, and our rights will be protected.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7802-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7802-S7803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  HONORING MERITORIOUS UNIT COMMENDATION TO PORTSMOUTH NAVAL SHIPYARD\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the best naval \nnuclear shipyard in America, the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, \nME\n  Today, RADM Anthony W. Lengerich visited the shipyard to celebrate \nthe Meritorious Unit Commendation presented to Naval Shipyard \nPortsmouth by Chief of Naval Operations Vernon E. Clark on May 12, \n2005.\n  The Commendation in part reads as follows:\n\n       The personnel of Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and tenant \n     activities consistently and superbly performed their mission \n     while establishing a phenomenal record of cost, schedule, \n     quality, and safety performance. The Shipyard embraced the \n     One-Shipyard Initiative and is leading the transformation of \n     our Navy's nuclear ship maintenance base through innovation . \n     . . Portsmouth Naval Shipyard personnel established new \n     performance levels for submarine maintenance, modernization, \n     and overhaul work . . . The Shipyard completed six major \n     submarine availabilities . . . (and) reduced injuries by more \n     than 50 percent . . . Naval Shipyard Portsmouth's \n     extraordinary performance is translating into increased U.S. \n     Submarine Fleet readiness. By their unrelenting \n     determination, perseverance, and steadfast devotion to duty, \n     the officers, enlisted personnel, and civilian employees of \n     Naval Shipyard Portsmouth reflected credit upon themselves \n     and upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval \n     Service.\n\n  Today, at the ceremony marking this exceptional recognition, Admiral \nLengerich told the men and women of Portsmouth Naval Shipyard:\n\n       The Navy and the country need you to continue doing what \n     has earned you your reputation for professionalism and \n     patriotism. I'm talking about your work ethic, your \n     enthusiasm, your attention to detail, your willingness to \n     apply diligence in everything you do.\n\n  Those of us in the Maine and New Hampshire delegations couldn't agree \nmore.\n  This is a shipyard that delivered six ships in a row a collective 60 \nweeks early, that saves $82 million over the Navy's other shipyards for \neach submarine refueling, and $26 million for each major overhaul, that \nis the Navy's only ``Star'' Site for safety, that exports its \ninnovation and best practices to other shipyards.\n  Portsmouth Naval Shipyard has been in existence for 205 years. And \nwhile much has changed over the past two centuries, what has not \nchanged is the shipyard workers' commitment to excellence, and the \nsense of each and every person there that they are contributing their \nown chapter to the remarkable story of Portsmouth--and to them we \nextend our most profound appreciation.\n  From its earliest days, producing wooden ``ships of the line'' to its \ntime as a Navy command during the War of 1812 to its production of 133 \nsubmarines, including a record 31 in 1944, the yard has not only been a \nfixture on the New England seacoast, it has been\n\n[[Page S7803]]\n\na bulwark against the shifting threats to our nation and world across \nthe span of two entire centuries.\n  The yard was there when the British were our enemy. This yard was \nthere during the darkest hours of World War Two. The yard was there \nwhen the Soviet threat in the heart of Europe fueled the cold war. And \nit has more recently borne witness to both the fall of the Berlin Wall \nand the end of the Soviet empire.\n  Today, the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard remains as critical today as it \nwas 205 years ago.\n  Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote, ``For what avail the plough or sail, \nor land or life if freedom fail?\n  This shipyard, this monument to American ingenuity, this testament to \nthe American worker has for 205 years helped ensure that freedom will \nnot fail. May this crown jewel of the Navy continue to exemplify \nMaine's motto, ``Dirigo''--``I Lead''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7803-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7803-S7804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, President Bush's address to the Nation \nTuesday night on the war in Iraq was more of the same we have been \nhearing for so long.\n  We all agree that our men and women in uniform are serving with great \nskill, dedication, and courage under enormously difficult circumstances \nin Iraq. The policy of our Government must be worthy of their \nsacrifice, but unfortunately, it is not, and the American people know \nit.\n  The President chose to wrap himself in the tragedy of September 11. \nHe spoke explicitly of the tragedy five times, and he invoked the \ndanger of Osama bin Laden twice. He spoke about terrorists 26 times, \nand he spoke of terror an additional 9 times, but the American people \nknow that the war in Iraq had nothing to do with September 11.\n  Even after 9/11, it is wrong for this President or any President to \nshoot first and ask questions later, to rush to war and ignore serious \ndoubts by experienced military officers and experienced officials in \nthe State Department and the CIA about the justification for the war \nand the strategy for waging it.\n  We all know that Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator. We have known \nit for more than 20 years. We are proud, very proud, of our troops for \ntheir extraordinary and swift success in removing Saddam from power.\n  But as we also now know beyond doubt, Saddam did not pose the kind of \nimmediate threat to our national security that could possibly justify a \nunilateral, preventive war without the broad support of the \ninternational community. There was no reason whatever to go to war when \nwe did, in the way we did, and for the false reasons we were given.\n  The administration's insistence that Saddam could provide nuclear \nmaterial, or even nuclear weapons, to al-qaida has been exposed as an \nempty threat. It should have never been used by President Bush to \njustify an ideological war that America never should have fought.\n  Saddam had no nuclear weapons. In fact, not only were there no \nnuclear weapons, there were no chemical or biological weapons either, \nno weapons of mass destruction of any kind.\n  Nor was there any persuasive link between al-qaida and Saddam and the \n9/11 attacks. A 9/11 Commission Staff Statement put it plainly:\n\n       Two senior bin Laden associates have adamantly denied that \n     any ties existed between al-qaida and Iraq. We have no \n     credible evidence that Iraq and al-qaida cooperated on \n     attacks against the United States.\n\n  The 9/11 Commission Report stated clearly that there was no \n``operational'' connection between Saddam and al-qaida.\n  Nonetheless, President Bush continues to cling to the fiction that \nthere was a relationship between Saddam and al-qaida.\n  That is the same logic President Bush keeps using today in his \nrepeated stubborn insistence that we are making progress in Iraq, and \nthat we and the world are safer because Saddam is gone.\n  In fact, the war with Iraq has made us less safe. It has created a \nbreeding ground for terrorists that did not previously exist. It has \ncreated a powerful recruitment tool for al-qaida, and made it harder--\nmuch harder--to win the real war on terrorism--the war against al-\nqaida.\n  Our soldiers in Iraq need more than assurances of progress from the \nPresident. They need more than a public relations campaign. They need \nan effective plan to end the violence, bring peace and stability to \nIraq, and return home with dignity and honor.\n  The President did not level with our troops and the American people \nand offer an effective strategy for success.\n  The President spoke about the importance of training the Iraqi \nsecurity forces, but failed to outline a clear strategy to accelerate \ntheir training and improve their capability.\n  The training of the Iraqi security forces continues to falter. The \nadministration still has not given the American people a straight \nanswer about how many Iraqi security forces are adequately trained and \nequipped. In the words of the Government Accountability Office:\n\n       U.S. government agencies do not report reliable data on the \n     extent to which Iraqi security forces are trained and \n     equipped.\n  The President spoke about the importance of our reconstruction \neffort, but he failed to outline a clear strategy to create jobs and \nhope for the Iraqi people, and neutralize the temptation to join the \ninsurgents. As of June 15, the administration only spent $6 billion--\none-third--of the $18 billion Congress provided last summer for \nreconstruction. Of the money we do spend, it is far from clear how much \nis actually creating jobs and improving the quality of life. We need \ngreater focus on small projects to create jobs for Iraqis, not huge \ngrants to multinational corporations that create profits for corporate \nexecutives instead of stability for the Iraqi people.\n  The President spoke about the importance of the international \ncommunity in Iraq, but he failed to suggest a clear strategy to bring \nin additional foreign troops to help us get the job done in Iraq.\n  If NATO is willing to send additional troops to help secure Iraq's \nborders, the President should ask them to do so. He did not.\n  If the United Nations is willing to send a force to help secure \nIraq's borders, the President should ask the U.N. to do so. He did not.\n  Nor did the President offer any strategy to prevent further \nreductions in the forces of the international coalition. A year ago, we \nhad 34 coalition partners in Iraq. Nine of those partners have pulled \nout. Today, we have just 25. American forces still make up nearly 85 \npercent of the troops fighting in Iraq. By the end of the year, five \nmore countries among the largest contributors of troops are scheduled \nto pull out. The President said nothing about how he intends to prevent \nmore troops in the coalition from pulling out.\n  The President spoke about the hard work of our troops, he urged \nAmericans to send them letters and raise flags in their honor, but he \ndid not assure them that they will have the equipment they need to \nfight the war.\n  More than 400 of our troops in Iraq have died in military vehicles \nhit by roadside bombs, grenades, and other so-called improvised \nexplosive devices. Yet troops don't have the protective equipment they \nneed. The Marines are still waiting for the 495 armored humvees they \nordered last year.\n  The American people rightly believe we are bogged down in Iraq and \nthat the President has no realistic strategy for success. A quagmire by \nany other name is still a quagmire. The dictionary defines a quagmire \nas ``a complex or precarious position where disengagement is \ndifficult.'' That is precisely what we have in Iraq--not because of the \nhard work and dedication of our military, but because of the persistent \nmistakes made by the President and his national security team.\n  No one has been more responsible for those mistakes than Secretary of \nDefense Rumsfeld. He has been consistently wrong about Iraq.\n  He was wrong about weapons of mass destruction.\n  He was wrong about the number of troops we would need in Iraq.\n  He was wrong to keep calling the insurgents deadenders.\n  He was wrong to send our service men and women into battle month \nafter month without proper armor.\n  He was wrong to exaggerate our success in training Iraqi security \nforces.\n  A single word spoke volumes at the Senate Armed Services Committee\n\n[[Page S7804]]\n\nhearing on Iraq on June 23. Secretary Rumsfeld's prepared testimony \ncontained these words:\n\n       In every war, there are individuals who commit wrongdoing. \n     And there are mistakes, setbacks, and hardships.\n\n  He repeated those words to the committee with a notable exception. He \nleft out the word ``mistake.''\n  Accepting the resignation of Donald Rumsfeld is the most important \nfirst step the President can take toward a new and more successful \npolicy in Iraq.\n  Reality is difficult to swallow. Facts, as John Adams once said, are \nstubborn things. President Bush should face the facts and accept them.\n  I say this with deep sorrow and regret for our service men and women, \ntheir families, and friends. They deserve better and they deserve it \nnow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7804-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, the .50 caliber sniper rifle is employed by \nmilitaries around the world because of its powerful and destructive \ncapabilities. Fifty caliber sniper rifles in the hands of terrorists \npose a significant threat to our homeland security. Unfortunately we \nhave not done enough to help keep terrorists from acquiring these \ndangerous weapons.\n  Published reports indicate that .50 caliber sniper rifles are capable \nof accurately hitting a target more than 1,500-yards away with a bullet \nmeasuring a half-inch in diameter. In addition, these thumb-size \nbullets come in armor-piercing, incendiary, and explosive varieties \nthat can easily punch through aircraft fuselages, fuel tanks, and \nengines.\n  One leading manufacturer of the .50 caliber sniper rifle, Barrett \nFirearms, posts a variety of news and magazine articles to promote the \ncapabilities of its product on its website. One such article, titled \n``Practical to Tactical'' originally appeared in the April 2004 issue \nof American Rifleman, a publication of the National Rifle Association. \nThe article details how Ronnie Barrett, founder of Barrett Firearms, \noriginally designed his .50 caliber rifle to be a ``long-range target \ngun'' but was later able to sell it to the U.S. military for use during \nthe first Iraq war to ``destroy hard targets, such as radar sites, \nbunkers, and light armored vehicles.'' The U.S. military has also used \nthe Barrett .50 caliber sniper rifle during the current war in Iraq. \nAccording to the article, a U.S. Army report regarding operations in \nIraq said: ``The Barrett .50-cal Sniper Rifle may have been the most \nuseful piece of equipment in\n\n[[Page S7805]]\n\nthe urban fight'' and ``was used to engage both vehicular and personnel \ntargets out to 1,400 meters.'' It continued, ``Soldiers not only \nappreciated the range and accuracy but also the target effect. Leaders \nand scouts viewed the effect of the .50-cal. round as a combat \nmultiplier due to the psychological impact on other combatants that \nviewed the destruction of the target.''\n  Fifty caliber sniper rifles are sold not only to military buyers, \nthey are also available to private individuals in the United States. \nUnder current law, .50 caliber sniper rifles nearly identical to those \ndescribed in the Army's report can be purchased by private individuals \nwith only minimal Federal regulation. In fact, these dangerous weapons \nare treated the same as other long rifles including shotguns, hunting \nrifles, and smaller target rifles.\n  I am a cosponsor of the Fifty-Caliber Sniper Weapon Regulation Act \nintroduced by Senator Feinstein, D-CA. This bill would reclassify .50 \ncaliber rifles under the National Firearms Act, NFA, treating them the \nsame as other high powered or especially lethal firearms like machine \nguns and sawed off shotguns. Among other things, reclassification of \n.50 caliber sniper rifles under the NFA would subject them to new \nregistration requirements. Future transfers or sales of .50 caliber \nsniper rifles would have to be conducted through a licensed dealer with \nan accompanying background check. In addition, the rifle being sold \nwould have to be registered with Federal authorities.\n  Adoption of the common sense Fifty-Caliber Sniper Weapon Regulation \nAct would help to ensure that these dangerous weapons are not obtained \nby terrorists and used against innocent Americans. We can, and must, do \nmore to help keep military style firearms out of the hands of potential \nterrorists.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7805-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RURAL WATER SUPPLY ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. BURNS.

President, I rise today to speak to the ever worsening \ncrisis of cost, coverage, and confidence in our health insurance \nsystem, but, more importantly, to outline what I believe to be several \npositive steps we can take in the near term toward relieving an impasse \nthat has long stalled progress toward relief.\n  As I speak today. we are nearing almost 5 years of double-digit \ngrowth in health insurance premiums--increases that have repeatedly \nexceeded more than five times the rate of inflation. Since 2000, for \nexample, group premiums for family coverage have grown nearly 60 \npercent, compared to an underlying inflation rate of 9.7 percent over \nthe same period.\n  Not surprisingly, those hardest hit are America's small businesses \nand those individuals outside of employer-provided insurance. These are \nthe ones with the least market leverage and the weakest ability to pool \nrisk. Already, among the very smallest of our businesses, those with \nfewer than 10 employees, only 52 percent offer coverage to their \nemployees.\n  Mr. President, I am a realist. The most fundamental drivers of health \ncare costs are ones that defy near-term solutions. These drivers \ninclude advances in costly medical treatments, Americans' continuing \nappetite for such treatments, lack of transparency in pricing, and an \nantiquated third-party payment system that insulates consumers from \nseeing the true cost of care they receive.\n  To take just one example, I--like many of my colleagues--would \nstrongly support shifting much of our current tax subsidy of health \ninsurance away from the employer and toward the individual. However, I \nfully recognize that any change on such a scale is, at best, years \naway.\n  And yet, like most Members in this body, I am hearing an ever growing \nchorus of concern from my constituents about health insurance--and most \nespecially from small businesses.\n  America's families and small businesses don't want us to wait for the \nperfect solution or the perfect moment. They need real help, and they \nneed it now.\n  Recognizing this increasing concern, and as the new Chairman of the \nSenate's Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, I have made \nit a priority in recent months to seek the counsel of stakeholders, \ncitizens, experts, and fellow Members of Congress on how we might come \ntogether on a package of insurance reforms we can realistically hope to \nenact in this Congress.\n  The most visible proposal now on the table--at least for the small \ngroup market--is the approach known as association health plans, or \nAHPs. Under this proposal, which was introduced in this Congress by \nSenators Snowe and Talent, qualifying trade associations would be \npermitted to band together their members for purposes of offering \nhealth coverage.\n  Association health plans hold significant promise--particularly in \nthe pooling of risk, economies of scale, and market clout they could \nlend to thousands of small businesses.\n  At the same time, however, the AHP bills in their current form may \nalso go too far in allowing some association plans to play by a \nseparate set of rules than those governing the rest of the small group \ninsurance marketplace, thereby tempting adverse selection and market \ndisruption. Another concern is the fact that the current AHP proposals \nwould shift primary oversight over many association plans away from \nStates and move it to the Federal Government.\n  Regrettably, debate over these AHP pros and cons has hardened into a \npolitical and stakeholder stalemate--a stalemate that has helped block \nconstructive action on new insurance reform for nearly a decade.\n  It is time we reached an end to this impasse.\n  Toward this end, I appreciate the hard work of Senators Snowe and \nTalent and other AHP proponents in working with me on possible \ncompromise approaches. And similarly, I am encouraged by what appears \nto be a growing pragmatic spirit amng traditional AHP critics such as \ninsurers and State regulators.\n  Meanwhile, other of my colleagues, such as Senator DeMint and \nSenators\n\n[[Page S7806]]\n\nDurbin and Lincoln, have also come forward with serious contributions \nto the discussion.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues of both parties, as well \nas with key stakeholders, in putting forward a full proposal for \nconsideration by the HELP Committee and by the Senate.\n  However, as we move forward with this process, I want to pause today \nto identify certain foundation principles and reform components I \nbelieve should guide the direction we pursue:\n  No. 1, association-based plans should have the opportunity to harness \nthe advantage of independent pooling and play a commercially meaningful \nrole in the coverage marketplace--and if that puts market pressure on \ninsurers, so much the better. At the same time, however, the coverage \nprovided to association members should be subject to underlying \nregulatory and consumer protection requirements substantially \ncomparable to those applicable to all entities offering similar \ncoverage. In short, associations deserve a real seat at the coverage \ntable, but that table should not have a substantial tilt one way or the \nother.\n  No. 2, the current hodgepodge of varying state health insurance \nregulation should be streamlined, thereby easing administrative and \nregulatory costs, and facilitating a larger number of plans in more \nstates. Such ``harmonization'' was among the options put forward last \nyear by the Senate's Republican Task Force on Health Care Costs and the \nUninsured. Under such an approach, states would be encouraged or \nrequired to adopt common sets of rules in targeted areas of health \ninsurance regulation, such as rating and underwriting, though State \noversight and enforcement authority would remain.\n  No. 3, individuals and businesses should have the opportunity to \npurchase lower-cost plans free or largely free of state benefit \nmandates. Though most purchasers will likely choose fuller coverage, it \nis important to assure that lower-cost alternatives exist as a \nsafeguard for those who are struggling at the margin. Not everyone \nneeds or wants the same degree of coverage, and where possible, our \ninsurance laws should accommodate this reality.\n  No. 4, primary responsibility for most insurance oversight and \nconsumer protection should remain with the state insurance \ncommissions--including the right to assess health plans, including \nassociation plans. Although some degree of new Federal involvement will \nlikely be necessary, it should be kept to a minimum. Though far from \nperfect, our State insurance commissions are much closer to the real \nproblems confronted by purchasers of insurance in their communities \nthan would be a federal agency in Washington.\n  No. 5, the focus of our immediate effort should be on policies that \ndo not require significant Federal outlays. Many laudable proposals \nhave been put forward by the President and others for tax-based and \nother financial assistance for the purchase of insurance, and many of \nthese should be pursued with vigor. We should not, however, allow the \nfiscal challenge of enacting such policies to sidetrack our efforts to \nadvance less costly improvements.\n  I am open to suggestions, and I am open to compromise--but I am not \nopen to continued inaction.\n  My intention is for these principles to serve as a foundation for the \nswift finalization and passage of a health insurance reform package \nthat will deliver real relief to America's small businesses and \nstruggling families.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary overview of these principles \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Foundation Principles\n\n                        Health Insurance Reform\n\n                           Senator Mike Enzi\n\n\n u.s. senate health, education, labor, and pensions committee june 2005\n\n       Meaningful role for associations, but on a level playing \n     field: Association-based plans should have the opportunity to \n     harness the advantage of independent pooling and play a \n     commercially meaningful role in the coverage marketplace, but \n     provided that the coverage offered to association members is \n     subject to underlying regulatory and consumer protection \n     requirements substantially comparable to those applicable to \n     all entities offering similar coverage.\n       Associations deserve a real seat at the coverage table, but \n     that table should not have a substantial tilt one way or the \n     other.\n       Streamlining of regulations: The current hodgepodge of \n     varying state health insurance regulation should be \n     streamlined, thereby easing administrative and regulatory \n     costs, and facilitating a larger number of plans in more \n     states.\n       Under such an approach, states would be encouraged or \n     required to adopt common sets of rules in targeted areas of \n     health insurance regulation, such as rating and underwriting, \n     though state oversight and enforcement authority would \n     remain.\n       A version of such ``harmonization'' was among the options \n     put forward last year by the Senate's Republican Task Force \n     on Health Care Costs and the Uninsured.\n       Access to reduced-cost options: Individuals and businesses \n     should have the opportunity to purchase lower-cost coverage \n     free or largely free of state benefit mandates.\n       Though most purchasers will likely choose fuller coverage, \n     it is important to assure that lower-cost alternatives exist \n     as a safeguard for those who are struggling at the margin.\n       Not everyone needs or wants the same degree of coverage, \n     and where possible, our insurance laws should accommodate \n     this reality.\n       Strong state-based consumer protection and oversight: \n     Primary responsibility for most insurance oversight and \n     consumer protection should remain with the states--including \n     the right to assess health plans, including association \n     plans.\n       Although some new federal involvement may be needed, it \n     should be kept to a minimum.\n       Though far from perfect, our state insurance commissions \n     are much closer to the real problems confronted by purchasers \n     of insurance in their communities than would be a federal \n     agency in Washington.\n       Budget neutrality: The focus of our immediate effort should \n     be on policies that do not require significant federal \n     outlays.\n       Many laudable proposals have been put forward by the \n     President and others for tax-based and other financial \n     assistance for the purchase of insurance, and many of these \n     should be pursued with vigor.\n       We should not, however, allow the fiscal challenge of \n     enacting such policies to sidetrack our efforts to advance \n     less costly improvements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7806-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7806-S7807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THERE HE GOES AGAIN . . .\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. As my good friend and fellow Hall of Famer Yogi Berra \nonce said, ``Its deja vu all over again.'' Once again, Chairman \nGreenspan and the Federal Open Market Committee, FOMC, are taking us \ndown an economic path that is fraught with peril by unnecessarily \nraising interest rates.\n  Surveys show that Americans are much more worried about filling their \ngas tank than fitting into their swimsuit this summer, which may be a \nfirst. But nonetheless, despite record high energy prices, the Chairman \nGreenspan continues to raise rates. He is fighting an inflationary \nboogeyman that does not exist. Meanwhile, there is a very good chance \nhis policies will lead us into the third recession of his tenure and \nAmerican workers will suffer from his antics.\n  This reminds me of the summer of 2000, when all signals pointed \ntoward a recession, but Chairman Greenspan refused to cut interest \nrates. When he finally did cut rates on January 3, 2001, in an \nemergency meeting after refusing to cut at the FOMC's regularly \nscheduled on December 19, 2000, the damage was done. And the recession \nthat was greatly exacerbated by September 11 was already underway.\n  I am very concerned with the Federal Reserve's continued raising of \ninterest rates. The Federal Reserve, it seems to me, continues to fix \nan economy that just is not broken. It is almost as if the Federal \nReserve is frightened by success. They are once again throwing a wet \nblanket on an inflationary fire that does not exist.\n  As I have said before, I do not believe the Federal Reserve's \neconomic models are factoring in the impact of new technologies on the \neconomy. They do not account for our increase in productivity. I also \ndo not believe they take into account the psychological effects of \nhigher energy prices. Chairman Greenspan, probably doesn't have to fill \nup his own car very often, but families all over Kentucky and across \nthe United States are feeling the sting of record gas prices, and it \ntroubles them greatly.\n  We are coming to a crucial point in our economy, a point where it can \nnot sustain higher and higher interest rates. As our interest rates \nrise like helium, our economy will suffer, housing starts will be down, \nand we will lose\n\n[[Page S7807]]\n\nthe economic momentum we have enjoyed. Apparently Chairman Greenspan \nwants to do to the housing market what he did to the stock market, and \nonce again the average American on Main Street USA will suffer.\n  Sometimes, I feel like a voice crying out in the wilderness, but \nsomebody has to tell Alan Greenspan and the FOMC that prosperity is not \nthe enemy. I hope it will not take another recession for Chairman \nGreenspan to learn that lesson. The American people have already \nlearned those lessons during his tenure in very painful ways.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7807-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN MEMORY OF MARCIA LIEBERMAN\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to speak in memory of Marcia \nLieberman, who passed away on June 26 at the age of 90.\n  Marcia was the mother of my dear friend and our colleague, Joe \nLieberman, with whom I have had the pleasure of serving in this body \nfor 16 years. She was born in 1914, lived through the Depression, and \nran her husbands business when he left to serve in World War II. She \nwas active in senior centers and Connecticut Jewish groups. She \ncampaigned with her son many times and served as his liaison to \nseniors. Her commitment to her community was constant and selfless. But \nbiographical information alone cannot adequately describe this \nremarkable woman. Her legacy is an entire life lived well, a long \nstring of simple moments of kindness and love.\n  It is possible to get a glimpse of that character in the anecdotes \nthat have been told about her--the care packages to reporters, the \nquips to Larry King, and the matchmaking services offered to a \ntraveling reporter. But it is more clearly illuminated in the warm \nmemories of those of us who knew her, which were echoed in the \nbeautiful eulogies that Senator Lieberman and his children gave on \nTuesday of this week at her funeral service.\n  As they so eloquently said, and as all her friends knew, Marcia \nstrongly believed in the importance of family and was openly warm and \ncaring with everyone she met. During Marcia's funeral service, the \nrabbi asked how many people in the audience believed they were her \nfriend. Everyone raised their hand. He then asked who believed they \nwere one of her best friends. Again, everyone raised their hand. She \nhad an uncanny ability to make people feel close to her. This quality, \namong others, put people at ease and gave them confidence in \nthemselves.\n  Marcias loving nature often took the form of great strength and \ncourage. She insisted that the members of her family take care of each \nother and live ethically. She was witty and saw the joy and humor in \nlife until the very end. Even in the last few weeks of her life, she \nmaintained her well-known strength and resilience, which helped her \nfamily through this difficult time.\n  She was a beautiful person, whose humor, kindness, and love were \ninfectious for those who met her. She will be dearly missed.\n  I offer my deepest condolences to Joe, his sisters Rietta and Ellen, \nthe whole Lieberman family, and to the countless others whose lives \nwere enriched by Marcia Lieberman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7807-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I applaud my colleagues for coming together \nin a bi-partisan manner to fix the budget shortfall at the VA. I \nproudly cosponsored the amendment and believe it was the best thing and \nthe right thing to do. The amendment will provide $1.5 billion in badly \nneeded funds. Although the VA could limp along until fiscal year 2006, \nit would have to do so by raiding other accounts and cutting back on \nother projects. This is simply unacceptable.\n  I am proud the Senate chose unity over division to make sure that the \nshortfall at the VA does not affect veterans. I applaud the Senate \nleadership, Republican and Democratic, for both decisive and effective \naction.\n  The importance of adequately funding the VA cannot be understated. \nAlong with our existing veterans, our men and women returning from \nOperation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom need a VA that \ncan support them and care for them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7807-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7807-S7809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONSULTATION ON JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week a number of Senators urged the \nPresident, if a vacancy were to arise on the Supreme Court, to consult \nwith Senators from both parties. I commend, in particular, Senator \nKennedy, a former Judiciary Committee chairman for his perspective on \nthis and thank him for his diligence in helping make this essential \npoint in his statements again this week.\n  Forty-four Senators sent the President a joint letter urging \nconsultation and a consensus nomination. In addition, I understand that \nSenators Nelson and Salazar have also urged consultation.\n  Likewise the 14 Senators in the bipartisan group that averted the \nnuclear option included strong language in their agreement urging \nbipartisan consultation by the President. They wrote:\n\n       We believe that, under Article II, Section 2, of the United \n     States Constitution, the word ``Advice'' speaks to \n     consultation between the Senate and the President with regard \n     to the use of the President's power to make nominations. We \n     encourage the Executive branch of government to consult with \n     members of the Senate, both Democratic and Republican, prior \n     to submitting a judicial nomination to the Senate for \n     consideration.\n       Such a return to the early practices of our government may \n     well serve to reduce the rancor that unfortunately \n     accompanies the advice and consent process in the Senate.\n       We firmly believe this agreement is consistent with the \n     traditions of the United States Senate that we as Senators \n     seek to uphold.\n\n  I agree. Bipartisan consultation is consistent with the traditions of \nthe Senate and would return us to practices that have served the \ncountry well. They are right to urge greater consultation on judicial \nnominations.\n  Last week some on the other side of the aisle criticized me for \noffering to help the President should a Supreme Court vacancy arise. At \nthe time, I said I stood ready to work with President Bush to help him \nselect a nominee to the Supreme Court who can unite Americans. In spite \nof the unfair criticism, I reiterate today my willingness to help. I \nhave urged consultation and cooperation for 4 our years and have \ncontinued to reach out over these last few weeks to the President. I \nhope that if a vacancy does arise the President will finally turn away \nfrom his past practices, consult with us and work with us.\n  I am troubled by the divisive battle lines being drawn by some right-\nwing groups that have launched attack ads in recent weeks. They attack \nDemocratic Senators generally and individually in advance of a vacancy \nor a nomination. The other side has established a new low by going \n``negative'' in advance and being critical in anticipation of a fight \nthat I and others here in the Senate are working to avoid. The partisan \nactivists supporting the White House have boasted for weeks about their \nwar chest of upwards of $20 million to be used to crush any opposition \nto this White House's selection. They have now chosen to fire a nasty \npreemptive strike in what they intend to make all-out partisan \npolitical warfare.\n\n  If the White House intends to follow that plan, it will be most \nunfortunate, unwise and counterproductive. I have urged, Democrats have \nurged a better way. Although the landscape ahead is sown with the \npotential for controversy and contention should a vacancy arise on the \nSupreme Court, confrontation is unnecessary. Consensus should be our \nmutual goal.\n  I hope the President's objective will not follow the path he has \ntaken with so many divisive circuit court nominees and send the Senate \na Supreme Court nominee so polarizing that confirmation is eked out in \nthe narrowest of margins. This would come at a steep and gratuitous \nprice that the entire Nation would have to pay in needless division. It \nwould serve the country better to choose a qualified consensus \ncandidate who can be broadly supported by the public and by the Senate.\n  The process will begin with the President. He is the only participant \nin the process who can nominate candidates to fill Supreme Court \nvacancies. If there is a vacancy, the decisions made in the White House \nwill determine whether the nominee chosen will unite the Nation or will \ndivide the Nation.\n\n[[Page S7808]]\n\nThe power to avoid political warfare with regard to the Supreme Court \nis in the hands of the President. Senate Democrats are not spoiling for \na fight however much partisans on the other side may be. The person who \nwill decide whether there will be a divisive or unifying process and \nnomination is the President. If consensus is a goal, bipartisan \nconsultation will help achieve it. That is what the American people \nwant and what they deserve.\n  The Supreme Court should not be a wing of the Republican party, nor \nshould it be an arm of the Democrat party. If the rightwing activists \nconvince the President to choose a divisive nominee, they will not \nprevail without a difficult Senate battle. And if they do, what will \nthey have wrought? The American people will be the losers: The \nlegitimacy of the judiciary will have suffered a damaging blow from \nwhich it may not soon recover. Such a contest would itself confirm that \nthe Supreme Court is just another setting for partisan contests and \npartisan outcomes. People will perceive the Federal courts as places in \nwhich ``the fix is in.''\n  I take the President at his word. He made a public commitment at a \npress conference several weeks ago to consult with Democratic as well \nas Republican Senators should a Supreme Court vacancy arise. If there \nwere to be a vacancy, I look forward to consulting with the President.\n  Our Constitution establishes an independent Federal judiciary to be a \nbulwark of individual liberty against incursions or expansions of power \nby the political branches. That independence is what makes our \njudiciary the model for others around the world. That independence is \nat grave risk when a President seeks to pack the courts with activists \nfrom either side of the political spectrum. We need fair judges, not \nsure votes for a partisan agenda.\n  The American people will cheer if the President chooses someone who \nunifies the Nation. This is not the time and a vacancy on this Supreme \nCourt is not the setting in which to accentuate the political and \nideological division within our country. In our lifetimes, there has \nnever been a greater need for a unifying pick for the Supreme Court. At \na time when too many partisans seem fixated on devising strategies to \nforce the Senate to confirm the most extreme candidate with the least \nnumber of votes possible, Democratic Senators are urging cooperation \nand consultation to bring the country together. There is no more \nimportant opportunity than this to lead the Nation in a direction of \ncooperation and unity.\n  The independence of the Federal judiciary is critical to our American \nconcept of justice for all. We all want Justices who exhibit the kind \nof fidelity to the law that we all respect. We want them to have a \nstrong commitment to our shared constitutional values of individual \nliberties and equal protection. We expect them to have had a \ndemonstrated record of commitment to equal rights. There are many \nconservatives who can meet these criteria and who are not rigid \nideologues.\n  This is a difficult time for our country and we face many challenges. \nThe President addressed the Nation about the difficult situation in \nIraq just this week. We need to confront the truth about the situation \nin Iraq and develop a concrete strategy rather than the swaggering \nrhetoric we hear so much of lately. We need to do more about the rising \ngas prices and health care costs that burden so many Americans. We need \nto improve the economic prospects of Americans. We need to work \ntogether to defend against real threats, the proliferation of nuclear \nweapons, and disruption of critical food, water, energy and information \nservices. It is my hope that we can work together on many issues \nimportant to the American people, including maintaining a fair and \nindependent judiciary. I am confident that a smooth nomination and \nconfirmation process can be developed on a bipartisan basis if we work \ntogether. The American people we represent and serve are entitled to no \nless.\n  Justice Thomas remarked this past Tuesday on the ``winds of \ncontroversy swirling . . . about the imagined resignations'' from the \nSupreme Court. We were all reminded, again, this week of the humanity \nof the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court. He concluded \nthis year's term with dignity, humour and steadfastness. Despite the \nrampant speculation that continued this week, I know that the Chief \nJustice will retire when he decides that he should, not before. He has \nearned that right after serving on the Supreme Court for more than 30 \nyears, the last 19 as the Chief Justice. I have great respect and \naffection for him and he is in our prayers.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, in light of recent comments on the floor \nof this body concerning the possibility of a Supreme Court vacancy, I \nask unanimous consent that an op-ed that I published in National Review \nOnline on Monday, June 27, 2005, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the National Review Online, Jun. 27, 2005]\n\n                             R-E-S-P-E-C-T\n\n\n  For the law, for the Court, for the Constitution, for the nominee...\n\n                        (By Senator John Cornyn)\n\n       It wouldn't be summertime in Washington if speculation \n     weren't running rampant about the possibility of a retirement \n     announcement from the Supreme Court. But whatever the time \n     frame for a Supreme Court vacancy, the process for selecting \n     the next associate or chief justice should reflect the best \n     of the American judiciary--not the worst of American \n     politics. We deserve a Supreme Court nominee who reveres the \n     law--and a confirmation process that is civil, respectful, \n     and keeps politics out of the judiciary.\n       History affords us some important benchmarks for \n     determining whether the Senate has undertaken a confirmation \n     process worthy of the Court and of the American people. There \n     is a right way and a wrong way to debate the merits of a \n     Supreme Court nominee. The Senate's past record, \n     unfortunately, has been mixed.\n       Whoever the nominee is, the Senate should focus its \n     attention on judicial qualifications--not personal political \n     beliefs. Whoever the nominee is, the Senate should engage in \n     respectful and honest inquiry, not partisan personal attacks. \n     And whoever the nominee is, the Senate should apply the same \n     fair process that has existed for over two centuries: \n     confirmation or rejection by majority vote.\n       Whoever the nominee is, the Senate should focus its \n     attention on judicial qualifications--not personal political \n     beliefs. We should not be surprised if a person of the \n     stature and legal ability to be considered for appointment to \n     the Supreme Court has spent at least some time thinking, and \n     perhaps speaking and writing, about the important and \n     sensitive issues of the day. But a nominee should not be \n     punished simply for exercising his talents. After all, judges \n     swear an oath to obey and to apply the law--not their own \n     personal, political views.\n       When President Clinton nominated Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the \n     Court in 1993, senators knew that she was a brilliant jurist \n     with a strong record of service in the law. Senators also \n     knew she served as general counsel of the American Civil \n     Liberties Union--a liberal organization that has championed \n     the abolition of traditional marriage laws and attacked the \n     Pledge of Allegiance. And they knew she had previously \n     written that traditional marriage laws are unconstitutional; \n     that the Constitution guarantees a right to prostitution; \n     that the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Mother's Day, and Father's \n     Day are all discriminatory institutions; that courts should \n     force taxpayers to pay for abortions, against their will; and \n     that the age of consent for sexual activity should be lowered \n     to age 12. The Senate nevertheless confirmed her by a 96-3 \n     vote.\n       Similarly, Stephen Breyer (nominated in 1994 by President \n     Clinton) and Antonin Scalia (nominated in 1986 by President \n     Reagan) are brilliant jurists with strong records of \n     service. Breyer had previously served as chief counsel to \n     Senator Ted Kennedy on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and \n     his nomination to the Court was opposed by many \n     conservatives because of his alleged hostility to \n     religious liberty and private religious education, while \n     Scalia was known to hold strongly conservative views on a \n     number of topics. The Senate nevertheless confirmed them \n     by votes of 87-9 and 98-0, respectively.\n       The confirmation proceedings of Ginsburg, Breyer, and \n     Scalia provide a helpful model for future behavior. Each of \n     those nominees enjoyed exceptional legal credentials. Each \n     possessed strongly held personal political views. And each \n     commanded the support of a broad bipartisan majority of \n     senators.\n       Whoever the nominee is, the Senate should engage in \n     respectful and honest inquiry, not partisan personal attacks. \n     Any debate over the next nominee to the Supreme Court must be \n     conducted with respect and honesty. At a minimum, senators \n     can disagree without being disagreeable. At a minimum, \n     senators can debate the issues honestly, and refrain from \n     distorting and misrepresenting records and rulings.\n       Unfortunately, respect for nominees has not always been the \n     standard. Lewis Powell was accused of demonstrating \n     ``continued hostility to the law'' and waging a ``continual \n     war on the Constitution,'' and Senate witnesses warned that \n     his confirmation would mean that ``justice for women will be\n\n[[Page S7809]]\n\n     ignored.'' John Paul Stevens was charged with ``blatant \n     insensitivity to discrimination against women.'' Anthony \n     Kennedy was scrutinized for his ``history of pro bono work \n     for the Catholic Church'' and found to be ``a deeply \n     disturbing candidate for the United States Supreme Court.'' \n     And David Souter was described as ``almost Neanderthal,'' \n     ``biased,'' and ``inflammatory.'' One senator said Souter's \n     civil rights record was ``particularly troubling'' and \n     ``raised troubling questions about the depth of his \n     commitment to the role of the Supreme Court and Congress in \n     protecting individual rights and liberties under the \n     Constitution.'' That same senator condemned Souter for making \n     ``reactionary arguments'' and for being ``willing to defend \n     the indefensible,'' and predicted that if confirmed, Souter \n     would ``turn back the clock on the historic progress of \n     recent decades.'' At Senate hearings, witnesses cried that \n     ``I tremble for this country if you confirm David Souter,'' \n     warning that ''women's lives are at stake'' and even \n     predicting that ``women will die.''\n       The best apology for these ruthless and reckless attacks is \n     for them never to be repeated again. Unfortunately, the \n     record is not promising. Even before President Bush took \n     office in January 2001, the now-Senate Democrat Leader told \n     Fox News Sunday that ``we have a right to look at John \n     Ashcroft's religion,'' to determine whether there is \n     ``anything with his religious beliefs that would cause us to \n     vote against him.'' And over the last four years, this \n     president's judicial nominees have been labeled ``kooks,'' \n     ``Neanderthals,'' and ``turkeys.'' Respected public servants \n     and brilliant jurists have been called ``scary'' and \n     ``despicable.''\n       Unfortunately, honest debate about a nominee's record has \n     not always been the standard, either. Records and reputations \n     have been distorted beyond recognition. Rulings that stated \n     one thing have been characterized to say precisely the \n     opposite. For example, during the debate over the nomination \n     of my former Texas Supreme Court colleague, Justice Priscilla \n     Owen, I chronicled numerous examples of her previous rulings \n     that were blatantly misrepresented by partisan opponents \n     of her nomination.\n       Moreover, in recent weeks, we've begun to see a \n     particularly odd tactic take form. Some lower-court nominees \n     have been attacked for belonging to a movement that, to my \n     knowledge, does not even exist--the so-called ``Constitution \n     in Exile.'' What's more, opponents of this fictional movement \n     seem to talk out of both sides of their mouth. Senate \n     Democrats excoriated Justice Owen in part for her refusal to \n     adhere to an allegedly central tenet of the Constitution in \n     Exile--the nondelegation doctrine. And it was four Ninth \n     Circuit judges appointed by Presidents Clinton and Carter who \n     recently used another alleged doctrine of the Constitution in \n     Exile--the Commerce Clause--to strike down federal laws \n     prohibiting the use of marijuana and the possession of child \n     pornography. If a ``Constitution in Exile'' movement really \n     exists, its membership seems to include Senate Democrats and \n     Democrat-appointed federal judges.\n       Reasonable lawyers can and do often disagree with one \n     another in good faith. They do so respectfully and honestly--\n     without distortions and false charges of being ``out of the \n     mainstream.'' We should likewise demand that the Senate \n     restore respectful and honest standards of debate to the \n     confirmation process.\n       And whoever the nominee is, the Senate should apply the \n     same fair process that has existed for over two centuries--\n     and that is confirmation or rejection by majority vote. The \n     rules governing the judicial confirmation process should be \n     the same regardless of which party controls the White House \n     or the Senate. Since our nation's founding over two centuries \n     ago, the consistent Senate tradition and constitutional rule \n     for confirming judicial nominees--including nominees to the \n     Supreme Court--has been majority vote. (In the case of Abe \n     Fortas, his nomination to be chief justice was withdrawn, \n     after a procedural vote revealed that his nomination did not \n     command the support of a majority of senators.)\n       Indeed, throughout history the Senate has consistently \n     confirmed judges who enjoyed majority but not 60-vote \n     support--including Clinton appointees Richard Paez, William \n     Fletcher, and Susan Oki Mollway, and Carter appointees Abner \n     Mikva and L. T. Senter. Yet for the past two years, a \n     partisan minority of senators tried to impose a 60-vote \n     standard on the confirmation of President Bush's judicial \n     nominees. Thankfully, that effort was recently repudiated, \n     when the Senate restored Senate tradition by confirming a \n     number of this president's nominees by majority vote.\n       The effort to change our 200-year custom and tradition by \n     imposing a new and unprecedented supermajority requirement \n     for confirming judges is dangerous to the rule of law, \n     because it politicizes our judiciary and gives too much power \n     to special interest groups. As law professor Michael \n     Gerhardt, a top Democrat adviser on the confirmation process, \n     has written, ``the Constitution also establishes a \n     presumption of confirmation that works to the advantage of \n     the president and his nominees.'' According to Professor \n     Gerhardt, a supermajority rule for confirming judges ``is \n     problematic because it creates a presumption against \n     confirmation, shifts the balance of power to the Senate, and \n     enhances the power of the special interests.''\n       Senate Democrats have recently asked to be consulted about \n     any future Supreme Court nomination--even though the \n     Constitution provides for the advice and consent of the \n     Senate, not individual senators, and only with respect to the \n     appointment, not the nomination, of any federal judge. If \n     senators want such a special role in the Supreme Court \n     nomination process, the president should first insist on \n     their commitment to the three principles described above.\n       After years of unprecedented obstruction, and destructive \n     politics, we must restore dignity, honesty, respect, and \n     fairness to our Senate confirmation process. That is the only \n     way to keep politics out of the judiciary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7809-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JOAN PIERMARINI\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS.

Phelps\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to take a moment to remember \none of Colorado's fallen heroes: Army SFC Christopher W. Phelps. \nSergeant Phelps was killed last week in Baghdad, Iraq, while serving \nthis Nation. He was 39.\n  Sergeant Phelps was a native of Louisville, KY. He graduated Male \nHigh School in 1984 where he was a standout athlete, helping to lead \nthe Bulldogs to the State football playoffs. Sergeant Phelps went on to \nKentucky State and a junior college in Mississippi before he enlisted \nin the Army.\n  In the Army, Sergeant Phelps served in the first Gulf war, where he \ndrove a tank. This past spring, he was deployed to Iraq as a member of \nthe Third Armored Cavalry Regiment based out of Fort Carson in \nColorado. He enjoyed serving in the Army and was proud to be serving \nhis country so honorably. He was a natural leader, a trait reflected by \nthe nickname the members of his platoon gave him: ``Dad.''\n  While serving in Iraq, Sergeant Phelps was deeply moved by what he \nsaw. He wrote home of the terrible poverty he witnessed and how much \nwork was left to be done in Iraq. But Sergeant Phelps knew, as so all \nof our men and women in uniform, that our efforts were making Iraq a \nbetter place.\n  In his high school yearbook, an 18-year-old Christopher Phelps \nselected as a quote: ``Do all you can while you can before it is too \nlate.'' Sergeant Phelps embodied this sentiment in everything he did, \nfrom his days as a high school athlete to his exemplary service to our \nNation and to the cause of freedom.\n  SFC Christopher Phelps served this country with honor and distinction \nand we are all humbled by his sacrifice. To his wife, Bobbi, and his \ndaughters and son, my prayers are with you, as are those of an entire \nnation. Christopher's service to and sacrifice on behalf of this Nation \nwill never be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7809-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7809-S7810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DETENTION CENTER AT GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, at a Defense Department news briefing in \nDecember 2001, a reporter asked Secretary Rumsfeld why we should use \nGuantanamo Bay to hold detainees. Secretary Rumsfeld's answer was that \nhe ``would characterize Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as the least worst place \nwe could have selected.'' This was hardly a ringing endorsement. Now, \n4\\1/2\\ years later, the administration and its defenders have been \ntrying to change the subject from the legal morass that Guantanamo has \nbecome, and to argue that Guantanamo is like an island resort, with \ngreat food, top-notch medical care, and a view of the ocean.\n  These arguments are distractions from the real issue, which is the \nneedless way that the administration's unilateralism in its decisions \nabout Guantanamo have compromised American principles and ideals and \nweakened our moral leadership in the world. If the administration has \nimproved conditions at the prison, I am glad to\n\n[[Page S7810]]\n\nknow it. We may now run the most humane prison in the most scenic \nlocation in the world. But it is still a prison. Many prisoners have \nbeen kept in cells for more than 3 years without being charged and \nwithout a meaningful process to evaluate or challenge their detention. \nRegardless of how well the detainees are treated, it is not the \nAmerican way to detain them indefinitely without an adequate hearing. \nThese policies are not only beneath us, but they have radicalized an \nuntold number of Muslims around the world. Even Secretary Rumsfeld had \nto admit last year that he did not know whether we were ``capturing, \nkilling or dissuading more terrorists every day than the madrassas and \nradical clerics are recruiting, training and deploying against us.''\n  This is important because it is the ideals of the American people and \nof our great and good country, and our longstanding commitment to the \nrule of law, that are being compromised. These are not the policies of \na great nation like ours, and this is not the American system of \njustice that has been a beacon to the entire world. We need not trade \naway our values and the principles that have guided us in order to feel \nsafer or to be safer. And if we do that, we give those who would harm \nus a victory they could not win on any battlefield, and we cede \nleverage to them that they will never deserve.\n  Everyone in Congress agrees that we must capture and detain terrorist \nsuspects, but it can and should be done in accordance with the laws of \nwar and in a manner that upholds our commitment to the rule of law. In \nour recent hearing on detainees, Senator Graham, a former Air Force \nlawyer who still serves in the Reserves, said that once enemy combatant \nstatus has been conferred upon someone, ``it is almost impossible not \nto envision that some form of prosecution would follow.'' He continued, \n``We can do this and be a rule of law nation. We can prove to the world \nthat even among the worst people in the world, the rule of law is not \nan inconsistent concept.''\n  We know that some of the detainees have been wrongly detained. And \nmany suspect there are others who have not yet been released, against \nwhom the evidence is weak at best. In a January 8, 2005, New York Times \narticle, a senior American official claimed ``that the vast majority of \nthe 550 prisoners now held at the American detention center at \nGuantanamo no longer had any intelligence value and were no longer \nbeing regularly interrogated.'' The article also quotes a veteran \ninterrogator at Guantanamo who told the New York Times that it ``became \nclear over time that most of the detainees had little useful to say and \nthat they were just swept up during the Afghanistan war with little \nevidence they played any significant role.''\n  The administration says these detainees are the ``worst of the \nworst'' and pose a continuing threat to the safety of Americans. If \nthat is true, there must be at least basic evidence to support it. No \none advocates releasing terrorists. But it is the American way to \nprovide a fair process to ensure that the detainees at Guantanamo \nreally are a threat to our Nation. In a break with military tradition \nand regulations, the administration denied detainees even the limited \nprocess contemplated by Article 5 of the Third Geneva Convention, and \nestablished the Combatant Status Review Tribunal, CSRT, only after \nbeing rebuked by the Supreme Court in Rasul v. Bush. The CSRT affirmed \nthe ``enemy combatant'' status of the Guantanamo detainees based on \nsecret evidence to which the detainees were denied access, raising \nserious questions about the fairness of the process.\n  It is time for Congress to focus on the real issue, which is \ndefending American ideals and our commitment to the rule of law. The \nchicken at Guantanamo may be wonderful, but this matters little to \nAmerica's core values if we are imprisoning some people who may have \nbeen wrongly accused of supporting terrorism and who have no way to \nchallenge their detention.\n  The administration is trumpeting the humane treatment of detainees at \nGuantanamo as a diversion. Guantanamo is a symbol of the needless \nproblems created by the unilateral ways this administration has chosen \nto proceed since 9/11. It is being used to deflect attention from this \nadministration's deliberate rejection of the rule of law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7810-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           CBR YOUTH CONNECT\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks \nconcerning CBR Youth Connect.\n  ``Youth are our focus and our future, connecting is our job.'' This \nstatement represents the newly expanded vision of Colorado Boys Ranch, \nCBR, Youth Connect, a foundation with a 45-year history of helping \ntroubled young men become productive citizens in their communities and \nthroughout the world. CBR Youth Connect offers more than 200 applied \nlearning opportunities and nontraditional programs and therapies, each \none designed to help youth enhance their skills, attitudes, and \nrelations with others. Programs and services range from animal-assisted \nprograms to family therapy to an accredited school system. Each program \nand service offered by CBRYC is designed to contribute to a boy's \noverall treatment plan, helping him learn, grow, and develop as an \nindividual.\n  The roots for CBR Youth Connect were planted in 1958 when county \njudges, from various districts in the State of Colorado, envisioned a \nrural orphanage that would be an ideal setting for dependant and \nneglected boys. They found their setting in the agrarian community of \nLa Junta, located in Colorado's southeast corner. And with the \nadmittance of the first boys in 1961, the Colorado Boys Ranch was born.\n  From the moment of conception, the mission of the Colorado Boys Ranch \nhas been to do whatever is necessary to help each troubled boy. Over \nthe last 45 years, CBR has developed from a Colorado orphanage into a \nhighly accredited national mental health treatment and education \norganization serving youth with severe mental health needs. Due to the \nhard work and dedication of their highly experienced staff, CBR has \ngarnered various accomplishments, including a customer satisfaction \nrating of 96 percent from parents, youth, and referral services. CBR \nYouth Connect has recently been rated as ``one of the best in the \nnation'' by the rigorous Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health \nCare, and it features one of the largest, most comprehensive data bases \nin the Nation for analysis and research of adolescent mental health.\n  In 2003, with a decrease in public funding, the Colorado Boys Ranch \nBoard felt confident that the ranch could evolve into a new \norganizational structure. Recognizing the commitment of their dedicated \nstaff and CBR's extraordinary success rate, the board believed that \nthey could transform into an organization that would reach many more \nyouth, families, and advocates. Their new vision statement was based on \nthe notion that: ``Youth are our focus and our future, connecting is \nour job.'' Their goal is to connect youth and their families with \nknowledge, relationships, and resources; and out of this fresh outlook \ncame with it a new name: CBR Youth Connect.\n  Currently more than 120 youth, ages 10-21, from all ethnic, cultural, \ngeographic, and socioeconomic backgrounds are admitted to CBR Youth \nConnect each year. With the advent of their new organizational \nstructure and expanded vision, CBR Youth Connect hopes to expand their \nreach to troubled youth around the world with the hopes of becoming \nrecognized as the foremost leader in psychiatric residential treatment \nand education. To accomplish this goal, staff members are traveling to \ncountries around the world, providing the latest in research, \ntreatment, and education to help troubled youth and their families.\n  I salute CBR Youth Connect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7810-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7810-S7811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HONORING THE CAREER OF CHARLES W.

After 16 years serving the citizens of our \nState, Charlie Phillips is entering into a well-deserved retirement. \nOver the years, he has contributed to the safety and soundness of \nIndiana's banking industry, and I am honored to have the opportunity to\n\n[[Page S7811]]\n\nthank him for his leadership and commitment to the people of Indiana.\n  Charlie Phillips began his distinguished career in 1950 as an \nexaminer with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, FDIC, where he \ndedicated himself to banking and bank supervision. In 1958, Charlie \nPhillips moved to New Albany to work as president of Floyd County Bank. \nAs a leader in his community for more than 25 years, he helped acquire \nland to establish the Indiana University Southeast campus in New \nAlbany. For this achievement, Charlie Phillips was recognized with the \nChancellor's Medallion for Distinguished Service.\n  In 1989, after a brief retirement, Charlie agreed to become the \ndirector of the Department of Financial Institution for Indiana. I am \nproud to have been able to appoint him to that post. During his tenure \nas director, he served three other Governors besides myself.\n  As director, Charlie Phillips was responsible for promoting the \nmodernization of the Indiana Financial Institutions Act, which \naddressed corporate governance, interstate branching, and payday \nlending reform. His commitment to encouraging employees to pursue \ncontinued professional development is among one of his greatest \naccomplishments. As a result, one of his legacies will be a well-\ntrained staff, important to the health of Indiana's banking system and \neconomy.\n  The people of Indiana have benefited from Charlie's hard work and \ndedication. I am proud to have appointed him to a position that made \nuse of his many talents and to be able to honor him today. I wish him \nall the best in his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7811-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO ALBUQUERQUE VOCATIONAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I stand before you today to \nrecognize Albuquerque Vocational Technical Institute (TVI), a community \ncollege in New Mexico that is celebrating its 40th year of service to \nthe community.\n  Since TVI's humble beginnings in an old vacated school building \nserving only 150 students, the school has made a difference in the \nlives of hundreds of thousands of students and has grown to serve about \n27,000 students each year across four campuses. Considering the \nenriching education and workforce opportunities TVI provides it is no \nsurprise that TVI is a ``crown jewel'' of the city of Albuquerque.\n  In a community noted for cultural diversity, TVI is a model technical \neducation institution which provides high quality instruction and \ntraining in a variety of technical careers, trades, and professions. \nTVI delivers innovative, customized training and skill development to \ndevelop a highly skilled workforce for business, professional \norganizations, and government agencies. TVI wisely collaborates with \nbusiness and industry to ensure that their students, as future workers, \nmeet the demands of the high-tech 21 century workforce. TVI graduates \nprovide needed technical assistance and services to a variety of \nindustries including our National Labs. TVI's dedication to their \nstudents' professional growth has positively impacted the economic \ndevelopment of the community and of the State.\n  For its leadership in educational advancement and for its invaluable \ncontributions, I commend the students, the teachers, and the \nadministration of the Albuquerque Technical Vocational Institute for 40 \nyears of exceptional service to the community and to the State of New \nMexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7811-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HONORING THE CITIZENS OF DEXTER, NEW MEXICO\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \ncitizens of Dexter in the Pecos Valley of southeastern New Mexico, who \nwill soon be celebrating the centennial of their community.\n  In its early years, the settlement that would become Dexter was \nlocated near the large body of water known as Lake Van in Chaves \nCounty. With the rise of the railroad and the construction of an \nirrigation canal a few miles away, a new town was necessary. Three men \nselected the townsite, and the only married man of the bunch, Albert \nMacey, was given the privilege of choosing the name of the town. He \nchose the name Dexter in honor of his hometown of Dexter, IA.\n  Dexter served an important role as a railroad depot in its early \nyears. The depot contributed greatly to the economic and social life of \nthe town. Dexter also became part of the historic Ozark Trails highway \nsystem and still has remnants of this fabled roadway, now known as \nState Highway Two. Agriculture, with cotton and alfalfa being the chief \ncrops, has been and continues to be important for Dexter and the Pecos \nValley.\n  These days, Dexter is also known for its fish hatchery, where \nadvanced biological research takes place and endangered species are \nprotected and propagated. The Dexter National Fish Hatchery is \ncurrently working with 17 species of fish native to New Mexico and \nneighboring States. If something should happen to devastate an original \nfish species in the wild, the hatchery could use the fish it holds in \nrefuge to help replace the damaged population.\n  Given the long history of settlement in New Mexico, turning 100 \nbarely qualifies a town as middle aged. But Dexter and its 1,200 \nresidents have done a great deal in that short amount of time. I \ncongratulate the town of Dexter on its centennial and offer my best \nwishes for the next 100 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7811-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IN MEMORIAM TO ASSEMBLYMAN MIKE GORDON\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to honor \nthe memory of a most dedicated public servant, California Assemblyman \nMike Gordon. Assemblyman Gordon passed away on June 25, 2005. He was 47 \nyears old.\n  Assemblyman Gordon began his political career at the young age of 18 \nas a voter registration coordinator for Assembly Speaker Leo McCarthy \nand later joined the staff of Assemblyman Bruce Young (D-Downey). In \n1982, Gordon began his 3-year tenure as executive director of the \nCalifornia Democratic Party and in 1995 co-founded Gordon and \nSchwenkmeyer, Inc., a successful polling and fundraising firm that is \nstill operating today.\n  Mike Gordon was elected to the El Segundo City Council in 1996 and as \nthe city's mayor in 1998, 2000, and 2002. During this time, he focused \non revitalizing El Segundo's downtown and helped increase funding for \npolice, fire and recreation. As cofounder of the Los Angeles Air Force \nBase Alliance, he fought against the closure of the base and focused \nhis attention on finding a solution for regional air and road traffic. \nOf all his great work as councilman and mayor, Mike's focus on \neducation and funding for the El Segundo Unified School District made \nhim a hero in the community.\n  In 2004, Mike Gordon ran successfully for the 53rd California \nAssembly seat in the South Bay of Los Angeles County. Assemblyman \nGordon introduced 22 bills during his first 2 months in the assembly \nand was appointed chair of the Assembly Committee on Veterans Affairs \nand as the body's representative to California's Milton Marks Little \nHoover Commission. His strong leadership skills and passion for public \nservice were instrumental in his early success in the assembly.\n  Assemblyman Mike Gordon knew firsthand the concerns and needs of his \ncommunity and dedicated his life to serving the citizens of Southern \nCalifornia. He grew up in La Mirada, CA where he attended Neff High \nSchool and in 1979 graduated from California State University, \nFullerton with a bachelor's degree in political science.

Mr. President, today I rise to congratulate Miss \nKennedy Womack, a 10-year-old student of Russell-McDowell Intermediate \nSchool in Flatwoods, KY.\n  The Kentucky Association for Gifted Education in cooperation with the \nNational Association for Gifted Children\n\n[[Page S7812]]\n\nawarded Miss Womack the Nicholas Green Distinguished Student Award \nduring the KAGE 25th Annual Conference on February 8, 2005. The award \nis designed to recognize excellence in young children and is given to \none student per State each school year. Award recipients are between \nages 8 and 12 and have achieved excellence in one of the following \nareas of endeavor--leadership, visual/performing arts, and academic \nachievement. The student selected is one who makes a contribution to \nthe community at a level beyond what is expected of the student's age \ngroup.\n  While spending time with her grandfather who is the jailer for the \nGreenup County Detention Center, Miss Womack became aware of the needs \nof the inmates, as well as the children who come to visit them. She \nobserved inmates who needed to read or write to their families, but for \nsome reason they were not able to do so. Kennedy tried to find a way to \nhelp. Through various means, Kennedy has also tried to help the young \nchildren who come to visit their relatives. She hopes her efforts will \nhelp the children make wise choices and not follow a path of crime. \nChief Tomas E. Kelly, Ashland Chief of Police, says of Miss Womack, \n``Kennedy has a keen interest in bettering her community, stopping the \nchain of crime and being a young advocate for victims of crime, and \nclearly demonstrates her leadership traits and initiative while doing \nso.''\n  National recognition by this organization is truly an honor to \nGreenup County and the Commonwealth of Kentucky. I congratulate Miss \nWomack for her hard work and achievement. I encourage her to keep up \nthe hard work and commitment to improving her community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7812-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO JADA TRABUE, ASHLYN WILSON AND CHARLES CLARK\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Brandon Harvey of Breeding and \nCraig Peden of Henderson have just been named the top two honorees in \nKentucky by the 2005 Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program, an \nannual honor conferred on the most impressive student volunteers in \neach State, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.\n  Mr. Harvey, a senior at Adair County High School, is being recognized \nfor raising nearly $1,000 to purchase smoke detectors for the families \nof all 175 students at a local elementary school. Mr. Harvey organized \na special Fire Prevention Day at the school, during which he taught the \nstudents fire prevention and safety techniques and issued every child a \nsmoke detector.\n  Mr. Peden, an eighth grader at Henderson County North Middle School, \nis being recognized for leading an effort by his school's Junior \nOptimist Club to raise money to help support the operating budget of \nRiverview School, a preschool for special needs students. With Mr. \nPeden's help, Riverview School was able to pay off its mortgage, and \nnow Craig hopes to expand his efforts to directly benefit the \nhandicapped children at Riverview.\n  In light of numerous statistics that indicate Americans today are \nless involved in their communities than they once were, it is vital \nthat we encourage and support the kind of selfless contribution these \nyoung citizens have made. People of all ages need to think more about \nhow we, as individual citizens, can work together at the local level to \nensure the health and vitality of our towns and neighborhoods. Young \nvolunteers like Mr. Harvey and Mr. Peden are inspiring examples to all \nof us, and are among our brightest hopes for a better tomorrow.\n  The program that brought this young role model to our attention--the \nPrudential Spirit of Community Awards--was created in partnership with \nthe National Association of Secondary School Principals in 1995 to \nimpress upon all youth volunteers that their contributions are \ncritically important and highly valued. Since its inception, the \nprogram has become the Nation's largest youth recognition effort based \nsolely on community service, with more than 170,000 youngsters \nparticipating.\n  Mr. Harvey and Mr. Peden should be extremely proud to have been \nsingled out from such a large group of dedicated volunteers. I heartily \napplaud Mr. Harvey and Mr. Peden for their initiative in seeking to \nmake their communities a better place to live, and for the positive \nimpact they have had on the lives of others. They have demonstrated a \nlevel of commitment and accomplishment that is truly extraordinary in \ntoday's world, and deserve our sincere admiration and respect. Their \nactions show that young Americans can play important roles in our \ncommunities, and that America's community spirit continues to hold \ntremendous promise for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7812-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               IN RECOGNITION OF THE KENTUCKY COMMANDERY\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor a community \nin North Dakota that is celebrating its 100th anniversary. On July 1-3, \nthe residents of Mercer, ND, will celebrate their community's founding \nand history.\n  Mercer is a small town of 86 citizens in west-central North Dakota, \nencircled by rolling prairie and enchanting lakes. Despite its small \nsize, Mercer holds an important place in North Dakota's history, one \nthat long predates the establishment of the town. The community was at \nthe crossroads of major events that shaped the early Dakota experience. \nThe cultures of three Native American tribes converged here at \nProphet's Mountain, and their relics still dot the prairies. Early fur \ntraders traipsed the Coteau du Missouri, skirting Medicine Hill while \non expeditions between Canada and the Missouri River. Major wagon \ntrains, seeking an overland route to Montana gold fields, rutted its \nterrain. Trails traversed the community, some reaching as far north as \nCanada. At the close of the nineteenth century, lush rangeland at the \nfoot of Prophet's Mountain beckoned pioneer ranchers along the Missouri \nRiver bottomland. Among them was William Henry Harrison Mercer, who \ndrove his cattle herds to this area. The largest influx of new citizens \nthe community would ever witness--the homesteaders--then followed.\n  At the behest of the Northern Pacific Railway Company, the town of \nMercer was platted July 24, 1905. The first rail traffic arrived on \nNovember 7, and construction of a depot followed in 1907. Mercer \nTownship was organized in 1908, and three supervisors, a clerk, \ntreasurer, assessor, two justices, two constables, a road overseer and \na commission of conciliation were all elected.\n  Like many other plains country towns, Mercer has witnessed and \nwithstood major upheavals in its struggle to survive. Other than its \nfine citizens, Mercer's proudest asset has been Brush Lake. As early as \n1926, community leaders with vision established the Mercer-Brush Lake \nCommunity Association, an organization dedicated to the protection and \npreservation of a serene, natural recreational resource for the public \ngood. That association was reorganized in 1958 as the Brush Lake \nCommunity Association, with a membership spanning the entire region.\n  I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Mercer, ND, and its \nresidents on their first 100 years and in wishing them well through the \nnext century. By honoring Mercer and all the other historic small towns \nof North Dakota, we keep the pioneering frontier spirit alive for \nfuture generations. It is places such as Mercer that have helped to \nshape this country into what it is today, which is why this fine \ncommunity is deserving of our recognition.\n  Mercer has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7813-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               100TH ANNIVERSARY OF ROLETTE, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD.

A post office named after \nthe nearby Willow Creek, along with a junction on the Great Northern \nRailroad, fueled the city's growth, which peaked in 1970 with 704 \npeople. Rolette was named after the fur trader, Joseph Rolette, who \nlived from 1820 to 1871.\n  Located in the scenic Turtle Mountains, Rolette boasts exceptional \noutdoor activities. A healthy number of lakes sprinkle the region, \nwhich provide for fishing opportunities and an abundance of waterfowl \nfor hunters and birdwatchers in the fall. Many community members enjoy \nthe nearby golf course or the International Peace Gardens in the warmer \nmonths. Today, Rolette is home to two cafes, a clinic, a bank, and much \nmore.\n  In recognition of the community's centennial, eight murals were \npainted by local artisans on the exterior of the Rolette Mall. Five \nadditional murals recognizing the community's dedication to \nvolunteerism were recently completed. Rolette's lively centennial \ncelebration will include an all school reunion, a civic parade, dances, \nand an air and car show.\n  I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Rolette, ND, and its \nresidents on their first 100 years and in wishing them well through the \nnext century.

By honoring Grand Rapids and all the other historic \nsmall towns of North Dakota, we keep the pioneering tradition spirit \nalive for future generations. It is places such as Grand Rapids that \nhave helped to shape this country into what it is today, which is why \nGrand Rapids is deserving of our recognition.\n  Grand Rapids has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7814-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING WILLIAM ALLEN\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to honor a constituent of \nmine, William Allen, who was recently named the 2005 Citizen of the \nYear by the town of Montville, CT.\n  Mr. Allen is a lifelong resident of Montville, a town of about 18,000 \npeople located along the Thames River, between Norwich and New London \nin Southeastern Connecticut. He served his country in the U.S. Marines \nfrom 1961 to 1963 before receiving an honorable discharge. After he \nreturned home, he worked in construction for 6 years before starting \nhis own business, W.R. Allen and Co. Contracting, in 1969.\n  Today, in addition to the contracting firm, William Allen owns Allen \nCarpets, Hawthorne Woodworking Co., and Plumfire Mechanical and \nBathliners, all based in Montville.\n  As a good businessman, Mr. Allen could have gone anywhere and been a \nsuccess. But he chose to stay in the town where he was raised and make \nit a better place for all of its citizens.\n  William Allen's impact on Montville is not limited to his businesses. \nHe has been an active participant in numerous community organizations, \nincluding the Montville Youth Center, the Senior Citizen's Center, the \nMontville Little League, the Boy Scouts, and Montville's police and \nfire departments.\n  There are many committed citizens such as William Allen across our \nNation--people who work hard each and every day and then give of \nthemselves to their communities to improve the lives of others. I \nbelieve we would do well to recognize their achievements more often, \nand I applaud the Town of Montville for bestowing this well-deserved \nhonor on Mr. Allen.\n  Once again, I congratulate William Allen on this wonderful award, and \nI wish him, his wife Rosalyn, their children, and their grandchildren \nall the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7814-4", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7814-S7815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IN MEMORY OF FRANK MANCUSO\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to speak in memory of a \ndistinguished public servant and a dear friend, Frank Mancuso, who \npassed away on June 19 at the age of 82.\n  Frank was born in Italy, but he grew up and lived in and around \nHartford and Enfield, CT. Although he worked as a union leader and \nserved as a decorated member of the Army Air Corps in the campaign in \nthe Pacific during World War II, he was most well known to the citizens \nof Connecticut for his dedicated work in public office and the\n\n[[Page S7815]]\n\nhumanity with which he fulfilled his duties.\n  In 1963, with no prior political experience, Frank was elected as the \nfirst mayor of Enfield. Four years later, he rebounded from a short \npolitical setback to lead the reform ``Eight Slate.'' They campaigned \non the promise to build the schools and city infrastructure that \nEnfield needed not only to keep pace with its recent population \nexplosion, but also to ensure its continued growth in the future. Frank \nheld true to his campaign promises and served as mayor until he was \nselected in 1975 by Gov. Ella Grasso to be the State director of civil \npreparedness. The self-styled ``master of disaster'' worked under the \nsubsequent administrations of William O'Neill and Lowell Weicker, Jr.\n  Frank loved politics, but he was a pragmatic public servant who went \nout of his way to build a consensus when it was best for the community. \nHe was an upbeat and straight-shooting leader with a disarming sense of \nhumor. In the eyes of his colleagues, it was Frank's guidance that led \nEnfield to be named as one of the country's best small cities.\n  Frank, who was born in Italy in 1922, attributed his love of \ndemocracy to dark memories of Mussolini's fascist dictatorship. But it \nis clear that his service was equally motivated by a commitment to his \ncommunity. When Frank retired from statewide politics in 1992, he \nremained connected through activities such as chairing building \ncommittees at local schools in Enfield. A recent editorial in the \nHartford Courant rightly called him ``Enfield's Ambassador'' and the \ntown's ``chief cheerleader.''\n  The residents of Enfield honored Frank by naming a park after him, \nbut he has already left his mark throughout the town, which grew up \nunder his tireless leadership, and on his friends and colleagues, whom \nhe touched with his selflessness.\n  I offer my deepest condolences to Frank's children Donna, Douglas, \nand Francis, to the entire Mancuso family, to the people of Enfield, \nand to the countless others whose lives were enriched by Frank \nMancuso.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7815-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TO COMMEMORATE ARTESIA NEW MEXICO'S CENTENNIAL\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to recognize a \nunique community in my home State of New Mexico and some of its many \nproud accomplishments. 2005 marks a special year for the city of \nArtesia as it celebrates its centennial.\n  After two names ``Miller'' and ``Stegman,'' the citizens finally \ndecided on ``Artesia'' in 1903 after the discovery of several \nflourishing Artesian wells in the area, and in January of 1905 the \ncommunity of Artesia became an incorporated municipality. At the time, \nroughly 1,000 residents called Artesia home and these folks undertook a \ndaunting task to make it a growing, prosperous community. Over the 100 \nyears since its conception, Artesia and its citizens have seen many \nchanges. Artesia, once a sleepy farming and ranching town, now finds \nitself at the hub of southeast New Mexico's oil and gas industry.\n  Very few cities in my home State have replicated Artesia's drive for \nexcellence. The efficient use of the Pecos River Valley, and turning it \ninto one of the most admirable and profitable agricultural regions in \nthe State, is commendable. They have utilized the fertile Pecos soil to \nproduce some of the state's best alfalfa and corn, which in turn has \nallowed them to raise livestock that are the envy of many New Mexican \nproducers.\n  Artesia, in accord with its ambitious nature, has surpassed even its \nwell-deserved legacy as an oil, gas and agricultural force. When \nattempting to find a use in the late 1980s for a shuttered college \ncampus, the city leaders checked with me and our collaboration resulted \nin the city offering the space to the Federal Government. That offer \nbrought the establishment of the Federal Law Enforcement Training \nCenter that is today the Nation's training focal point for Federal \nsecurity personnel who protect our borders and Federal facilities. It \nhas been beneficial not only for the Federal Government and the \nAmerican people, but also Artesia's economic diversity.\n  Artesia's standard for excellence is also reflected in their \nextraordinarily successful school program. Students retain a sense of \npride, while teachers act as models for the rest of the State to \nfollow. No where else has a football team won twenty-four State titles, \nyet still preserve the highest regard for education. The quality of \nBulldog character is known, not only in the southeastern part of the \nState, but throughout the Land of Enchantment.\n  As I review the past 100 years, one thing becomes clear. Artesians \nare achievers. When problems or opportunities arise, Artesians roll up \ntheir sleeves and go to work to complete the task at hand. This is why \noil and gas was initially discovered and still flourishes in the Pecos \nValley. All the while, farming and ranching has persevered, and more \nrecently dairies and other additions to the economy have pushed it into \na constant position of expansion. Dedication to purpose and \nenthusiastic pursuit of success are ingrained in its citizens, young \nand old. It is no wonder Artesia has become known as ``The City of \nChampions.''\n  I consider myself fortunate to be the Senator from a State where hard \nwork and dedication still prevails, perfection is pursued, and its \ncitizens are not afraid to get their hands dirty. During this \ncentennial year, I am absolutely amazed at the large number of citizens \nthat are busy planning activities, contributing ideas and historical \nfacts, raising funds, and volunteering time and effort to conduct a \nfull year of activities with the expressed purpose of making 2005 a \ntruly memorable year for all of its citizens. As their United States \nSenator, I want to commend Artesia and its citizens for a job well done \nin making Artesia, New Mexico such a wonderful place to live and work \nover the past 100 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7815-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7815-S7816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               100TH ANNIVERSARY OF PRATT, WEST VIRGINIA\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a \ncommunity in West Virginia that will be celebrating its 100th \nanniversary. On July 12, the residents of Pratt will celebrate their \ncommunity's history and founding 100 years ago.\n  Pratt is a small town in southern West Virginia on a soft bend in the \nKanawha River, with a population of 551. Pratt has some of the \nqualities of a typical West Virginia coal camp--it is a small community \nwith hardworking people and a solid value base. But what separates \nPratt from most small coal towns is that it has been around longer and \nhas played an integral role in the labor movement.\n  Despite its small size, Pratt holds an important place in West \nVirginia's history. Originally named Clifton, then Dego, the town \nadopted the last name of Charles K. Pratt at the dawning of the \ntwentieth century. Pratt's New York company owned timber and mineral \nrights in the area. The town was incorporated on June 4, 1905.\n  Stately old homes are spread throughout the town, each adding to \nPratt's rich history. The town's lone church, Old Kanawha Baptist, is \nrecognized as the oldest functioning church in the Kanawha Valley. It \ncelebrated its 200th anniversary in 1993. In the local cemetery, \ngravestones date back as far as 1835. Many of Pratt's residents can \ntrace their ancestry to the town's pre-Civil War settlers.\n  In 1984 the town's cemetery and residential neighborhood overlooking \nthe Kanawha River were designated a historic district and placed on the \nNational Register of Historic Places. The Mother Jones prison site \nreceived historic designation in 1992.\n  The town of Pratt rose to national prominence during Wet Virginia's \nmine wars of 1912-1913. In 1912, United Mine Workers of America, UMWA, \nminers in nearby Paint Creek demanded wages equal to those of other \narea miners. They also insisted on the right to organize and an end to \nthe practice of using mine guards. When operators rejected the wage \nincrease, miners walked off the job, beginning one of the most violent \nstrikes in the Nation's history.\n  After the strike began, operators brought in mine guards to evict \nminers and their families from company houses. As the mine guards \ncontinued to intimidate workers, national labor leaders, including Mary \nHarris ``Mother'' Jones, arrived on the scene. A leader of the UMWA's \nefforts to organize the State, Jones was known for her\n\n[[Page S7816]]\n\nblistering verbal attacks on coal operators and politician. She \ncriticized the poor working conditions, meager safety provisions, and \nlong hours of the mines and called for change.\n  In 1913, Jones was placed under house arrest in Pratt for inciting a \nriot and was held there for 85 days. When news of her imprisonment \nspread across the country, Congress was forced to investigate the \nmatter.\n  Although the settlement of the strike failed to answer the miners' \nmain grievances, the Paint Creek strike produced a number of labor \nleaders who would play prominent roles in the years to come. Following \nthe strike, the coalfields were relatively peaceful for 6 years.\n  I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Pratt, WV, and its \nresidents on their first 100 years and in extending our best wishes for \ntheir next 100 years and beyond. We recognize Pratt's important \ncontributions to the labor movement. Through its challenges and \ntriumphs, Pratt has helped to move our Nation forward in labor \nrelations, which is one of the many reasons this fine community \ndeserves our recognition.\n  Pratt has a rich past and a promising future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7816-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CELEBRATING THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LINCOLN PRIMARY CARE CENTER\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nLincoln Primary Care Center, which has served the people of Lincoln \nCounty, WV, since 1975.\n  That year, the residents of Lincoln County opened a small, nonprofit \nhealth clinic in the storefront of a local grocery store. In 1977, the \nLincoln County Primary Care Center became the Nation's first federally \ndesignated Rural Health Care Clinic and, by May of 1991, had been given \nthe National Rural Healthcare Association Outstanding Rural Practice \nAward.\n  Today, the Lincoln Primary Care Center serves nearly 22,000 area \nresidents and reaches out, not only to the people of Lincoln County but \nalso to those in parts of Cabell and Wayne Counties. The center is now \nhoused within a 17,500 square-foot building that features 33 treatment \nrooms and offers a wide variety of medical services. This includes \ninitiatives within the Wellness Center, opened in 2004 to provide \nmembers of the community with valuable information regarding the \nprevention of chronic disease. This also includes healthy living \nprograms that benefit residents of all ages, the Senior Nutrition \nProgram, which serves free lunches to anyone over the age of 55, and \nthe exercise facility, which is used by at least 50 people each day.\n  As I have said before, West Virginia is a rural State and, in many \nareas, access to quality health care is problematic. This is especially \ntrue in the case of our seniors, who comprise nearly 15 percent of our \npopulation and have significant health care needs. That is why it is \ngood to know that the Lincoln Primary Care Center offers them high-\nquality, accessible care that addresses all aspects of wellness.\n  Indeed, it is clear that the Lincoln Primary Care Center plays an \nimportant role in the community it serves, and a number of West \nVirginians who visit the center have conveyed to me their appreciation \nfor it. Ms. Brenda Terry notes the great pleasure she receives from the \nuse of the center's exercise facility, and how glad she is to see so \nmany friends there. Also, Ms. Mary Richmond tells me that she is \nthankful for the paved walking track, and Ms. Donna Rush describes the \npleasant atmosphere enjoyed by those who live alone. Finally, Mr. John \nRush expresses his fondness for the new friendships that he has forged \nduring his time there.\n  With this praise in mind, I would like to commend the Lincoln Primary \nCare Center as it celebrates its 30th Anniversary and I would like to \nrecognize the dedicated service it provides to its community--service \nthat can serve as a model for rural health care delivery, now and in \nthe future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7816-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRIBUTE IN HONOR OF RADM EDWARD ``ANDY'' WILKINSON, RET.\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a great \npatriot, RADM Andy Wilkinson, on the occasion of his retirement. Andy \nhas led a life of great purpose, from his childhood days in Alabama to \na dedicated military career and his time in the private sector in \nHuntsville, AL. A native of Selma, Andy is of the generation of \nmilitary leaders in this Nation whose sacrifice and commitment \npreserved and protected our freedom from Vietnam on into the long \ndecades of confrontation with the former Soviet Union, and beyond.\n  He began his distinguished 34-year military career in 1955 when he \nwas commissioned as an ensign upon his graduation from the U.S. Naval \nAcademy. He also graduated from the Armed Forces Staff College, the \nNational War College, and he holds a Master's Degree in Engineering \nfrom the George Washington University. During his Naval career as a \npilot, he held six commands, four of which were in operational aviation \nunits, including command of Patrol Wings, U.S. Atlantic Fleet. Andy \nalso served on the staff of the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for \nAir and as Manager of the Anti-Submarine Warfare Systems Project Office \nin the Naval Material Command, supervising a budget of over $1 billion \nper year.\n  With an expertise in aviation, antisubmarine warfare, and mapping, \ncharting, and geodesy, MC, Andy served as the Director of the Defense \nMapping Agency, DMA. In this role, he was responsible to the Secretary \nof Defense for all service MC matters and managed the multi-billion-\ndollar DMA all digital modernization program. Andy has been awarded the \nDefense Distinguished Service Medal, the Defense Superior Service \nMedal, and two Legions of Merit Medals during his distinguished \nmilitary career.\n  In 1985, Andy joined the Intergraph Corporation as a senior \nrepresentative to the U.S. Government on relations with Congress and \nthe executive department. After being promoted to vice president in \n1987 and to executive vice president in 1994, Andy then served as \nDirector of U.S. Federal Sales and Marketing until 1999. He currently \nprovides leadership and expertise by overseeing all Government \nrelations and Federal solutions business planning.\n  During his career, Andy has shown continuous dedication and played a \nmajor role in several large contracts and programs that have helped to \nimprove government and the efficiency and effectiveness of a vast array \nof military programs. Andy was instrumental in the management and \ndevelopment of CAD-2 programs for the Naval Sea Systems Command, Naval \nAir Systems Command, and Naval Facilities Engineering Command, which \nprovide information technology support and integration in the Navy and \nFederal government. Also, Andy served a vital role in developing the \nDepot Maintenance Accounting and Production System for the Air Force \nMaterial Command, AFMC. By facilitating data exchange between legacy \nsystems, this program greatly enhanced AFMC's decisionmaking process \nand increased responsiveness to the warfighter and other support \npersonnel.\n  Finally, I should also say that Andy distinguished himself in yet \nanother way. He is one of those rare individuals whose word is his \nbond, and whose actions, both personal and professional, are based on a \nbedrock of integrity. He has earned the confidence and respect of \ncountless Members of Congress, Senators, and his colleagues.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in paying special tribute to Mr. Andy \nWilkinson. I thank him for his service, and I wish Andy and his wife \nSondra and their family the very best as they begin a new chapter in \ntheir lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7816-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7816-4", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7816-S7817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S7817]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7816-4", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7816-S7817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S7817]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7817-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  At 3:01 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 289.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to improve \ntransitional assistance provided for members of the armed forces being \ndischarged, released from active duty, or retired, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwill enhance and strengthen transition services that are provided to \nour military personnel.\n  As the Senate conducts its business today, thousands of our brave men \nand women in uniform are in harm's way in Iraq, Afghanistan, and \nelsewhere around the globe. These men and women serve with distinction \nand honor, and we owe them our heartfelt gratitude.\n  We also owe them our best effort to ensure that they receive the \nbenefits to which their service in our Armed Forces has entitled them. \nI have heard time and again from military personnel and veterans who \nare frustrated with the system by which they apply for benefits or \nappeal claims for benefits. I have long been concerned that\n\n[[Page S7823]]\n\ntens of thousands of our veterans are unaware of Federal health care \nand other benefits for which they may be eligible, and I have \nundertaken numerous legislative and oversight efforts to ensure that \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs makes outreach to our veterans and \ntheir families a priority.\n  While we should do more to support our veterans, we must also ensure \nthat the men and women who are currently serving in our Armed Forces \nreceive adequate pay and benefits, as well as services that help them \nto make the transition from active duty to civilian life. I am \nconcerned that we are not doing enough to support our men and women in \nuniform as they prepare to retire or otherwise separate from the \nservice or, in the case of members of our National Guard and Reserve, \nto demobilize from active duty assignments and return to their civilian \nlives while staying in the military or preparing to separate from the \nmilitary. We must ensure that their service and sacrifice, which is \nmuch lauded during times of conflict, is not forgotten once the battles \nhave ended and our troops have come home.\n  The bill that I am introducing today, the Veterans Enhanced \nTransition Services Act (VETS Act), will help to ensure that all \nmilitary personnel have access to the same transition services as they \nprepare to leave the military to reenter civilian life, or, in the case \nof members of the National Guard and Reserve, as they prepare to \ndemobilize from active duty assignments and return to their civilian \nlives and jobs or education while remaining in the military.\n  I have heard from a number of Wisconsinites and members of military \nand veterans service organizations that our men and women in uniform do \nnot all have access to the same transition counseling and medical \nservices as they are demobilizing from service in Iraq, Afghanistan, \nand elsewhere. I have long been concerned about reports of uneven \nprovision of services from base to base and from service to service. \nAll of our men and women in uniform have pledged to serve our country, \nand all of them, at the very least, deserve to have access to the same \nservices in return.\n  I introduced similar legislation during the 108th Congress, and I am \npleased that a provision that I authored which was based on that bill \nwas enacted as part of the fiscal year 2005 defense authorization bill.\n  In response to concerns I have heard from a number of my \nconstituents, my amendment, in part, directed the Secretaries of \nDefense and Labor to jointly explore ways in which DoD training and \ncertification standards could be coordinated with government and \nprivate sector training and certification standards for corresponding \ncivilian occupations. Such coordination could help military personnel \nwho wish to pursue civilian employment related to their military \nspecialties to make the transition from the military to comparable \ncivilian jobs. I look forward to reviewing this report.\n  In addition, this amendment required the Government Accountability \nOffice (GAO) to undertake a comprehensive analysis of existing \ntransition services for our military personnel that are administered by \nthe Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Labor and to make \nrecommendations to Congress on how these programs can be improved. My \namendment required GAO to focus on two issues: how to achieve the \nuniform provision of appropriate transition services to all military \npersonnel, and the role of post-deployment and pre-discharge health \nassessments as part of the larger transition program. GAO released its \nstudy ``Military and Veterans' Benefits: Enhanced Services Could \nImprove Transition Assistance for Reserves and National Guard'' in May \n2005, and it plans to release its study on health assessments in the \nnear future.\n  Just yesterday, GAO provided testimony on its transition services \nreport to the House Committee on Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on \nEconomic Opportunity. That hearing could not have been more timely. We \nowe it to our men and women in uniform to improve transition programs \nnow as we continue to welcome home thousands of military personnel who \nare serving our country in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. We should \nnot miss an opportunity to help the men and women who are currently \nserving our country.\n  My bill, which is consistent with GAO's recommendations on transition \nassistance, will help to ensure that all military personnel receive the \nsame services by making a number of improvements to the existing \nTransition Assistance Program/Disabled Transition Assistance Program \n(TAP/DTAP), by improving the process by which military personnel who \nare being demobilized or discharged receive medical examinations and \nmental health assessments, and by ensuring that military and veterans \nservice organizations and state departments of veterans affairs are \nable to play an active role in assisting military personnel with the \ndifficult decisions that are often involved in the process of \ndischarging or demobilizing.\n  Under current law, the Department of Defense, together with the \nDepartments of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Labor, provide pre-separation \ncounseling for military personnel who are preparing to leave the Armed \nForces. This counseling provides servicemembers with valuable \ninformation about benefits that they have earned through their service \nto our country such as education benefits through the GI Bill and \nhealth care and other benefits through the VA. Personnel also learn \nabout programs such as Troops to Teachers and have access to employment \nassistance for themselves and, where appropriate, their spouses.\n  My bill would ensure that National Guard and Reserve personnel who \nare on active duty are able to participate in this important counseling \nprior to being demobilized. In addition, my bill would require state-\nbased follow-up within 180 days of demobilization to give newly \ndemobilized personnel the opportunity to follow up on any questions or \nconcerns that they may have during a regular unit training period. \nCurrently, most of the responsibility for getting information about \nbenefits and programs falls on the military personnel. The Department \nof Defense should make every effort to ensure that all members \nparticipate in this important program, and that is what my bill would \ndo.\n  In its recent report on transition services, GAO found that \n``[d]uring their rapid demobilization, the Reserve and National Guard \nmembers may not receive all the information on possible benefits to \nwhich they are entitled. Notably, certain education benefits and \nmedical coverage require servicemembers to apply while they are still \non active duty. However, even after being briefed, some Reserve and \nNational Guard members were not aware of the time frames within which \nthey needed to act to secure certain benefits before returning home. In \naddition, most members of the Reserves and National Guard did not have \nthe opportunity to attend an employment workshop during \ndemobilization.''\n  In response to these findings, GAO recommended that ``DoD, in \nconjunction with DoL and the VA, determine what demobilizing Reserve \nand National Guard members need to make a smooth transition and explore \noptions to enhance their participation in TAP.'' GAO also recommended \nthat ``VA take steps to determine the level of participation in DTAP to \nensure those who may have especially complex needs are being served.''\n  In addition to ensuring that all discharging and demobilizing \nmilitary personnel are able to participate in TAP/DTAP, my bill would \nhelp to improve the uniformity of services provided to personnel by \ndirecting the Secretary of Defense to ensure that consistent transition \nbriefings occur across the services and at all demobilization/discharge \nlocations. In its report, GAO noted that ``[t]he delivery of TAP may \nvary in terms of the amount of personal attention participants receive, \nthe length of the components, and the instructional methods used.'' We \nshould make every effort to ensure that those who have put themselves \nin harm's way on our behalf have access to the same transition services \nno matter their discharge/demobilization location or the branch of the \nArmed Forces in which they serve.\n  My bill would also ensure, consistent with GAO's recommendation, that \nthere are programs that are directed to the specific needs of active \nduty and National Guard and Reserve personnel. And my bill includes a \nprovision to ensure that personnel who are on the temporary disability \nretired list and\n\n[[Page S7824]]\n\nwho are being retired or discharged from alternate locations will have \naccess to transition services at a location that is reasonably \nconvenient to them.\n  In addition, my bill would enhance the information that is presented \nto members by requiring that pre-separation counseling include the \nprovision of information regarding certification and licensing \nrequirements in civilian occupations and information on identifying \nmilitary occupations that have civilian counterparts, information \nconcerning veterans small business ownership and entrepreneurship \nprograms offered by the Federal Government, information concerning \nemployment and reemployment rights and veterans preference in Federal \nemployment and Federal procurement opportunities, information \nconcerning homelessness and housing counseling assistance, and a \ndescription of the health care and other benefits to which the member \nmay be entitled under the laws administered by the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs including a referral (to be provided with the \nassistance of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs) for a VA medical and \npension examination, as appropriate.\n  Participation in pre-separation counseling through a TAP/DTAP program \nis a valuable tool for personnel as they transition back to civilian \nlife. My bill is in no way intended to lengthen the time that military \npersonnel spend away from their families or to provide them with \ninformation that is not relevant to their civilian lives or that they \notherwise do not need. In order to ensure that this information remains \na valuable tool and does not become a burden to demobilizing members of \nthe National Guard and Reserve who experience multiple deployments for \nactive duty assignments, my bill clarifies that participation in the \nDepartment of Labor's transitional services employment program will not \nbe required if a member has previously participated in the program or \nif a member will be returning to school or to a position of employment.\n\n  My bill would also require the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans \nAffairs to submit a plan to Congress for increasing access to the joint \nDoD-VA Benefits Delivery at Discharge program, which assists personnel \nin applying for VA disability benefits before they are discharged from \nthe military. This very successful program has helped to cut the red \ntape and to speed the processing time for many veterans who are \nentitled to VA disability benefits.\n  In addition to the uneven provision of transition services, I have \nlong been concerned about the immediate and long-term health effects \nthat military deployments have on our men and women in uniform. I \nregret that, too often, the burden of responsibility for proving that a \ncondition is related to military service falls on the personnel \nthemselves. Our men and women in uniform deserve the benefit of the \ndoubt, and should not have to fight the Department of Defense or the VA \nfor benefits that they have earned through their service to our nation.\n  Since coming to the Senate in 1993, I have worked to focus attention \non the health effects that are being experienced by military personnel \nwho served in the Persian Gulf War. More than ten years after the end \nof the Gulf War, we still don't know why so many veterans of that \nconflict are experiencing medical problems that have become known as \nGulf War Syndrome. Military personnel who are currently deployed to the \nPersian Gulf region face many of the same conditions that existed in \nthe early 1990s. I have repeatedly pressed the Departments of Defense \nand Veterans Affairs to work to unlock the mystery of this illness and \nto study the role that exposure to depleted uranium may play in this \ncondition. We owe it to these personnel to find these answers, and to \nensure that those who are currently serving in the Persian Gulf region \nare adequately protected from the many possible causes of Gulf War \nSyndrome.\n  Part of the process of protecting the health of our men and women in \nuniform is to ensure that the Department of Defense carries out its \nresponsibility to provide post-deployment physicals for military \npersonnel. I am deeply concerned about stories of personnel who are \nexperiencing long delays as they wait for their post-deployment \nphysicals and who end up choosing not to have these important physicals \nin order to get home to their families that much sooner. I am equally \nconcerned about reports that some personnel who did not receive such a \nphysical--either by their own choice or because such a physical was not \navailable--are now having trouble as they apply for benefits for a \nservice-connected condition.\n  I firmly believe, as do the military and veterans groups that support \nmy bill, that our men and women in uniform are entitled to a prompt, \nhigh quality physical examination as part of the demobilization \nprocess. These individuals have voluntarily put themselves into harm's \nway for our benefit. We should ensure that the Department of Defense \nmakes every effort to determine whether they have experienced, or could \nexperience, any health effects as a result of their service.\n  In light of concerns raised by many that each service and each \ninstallation uses a different process for demobilization physicals, my \nbill would require the Secretary of Defense to set minimum standards \nfor these important medical examinations and to ensure that these \nstandards are applied uniformly at all installations and by all \nbranches of the Armed Forces. In addition, to ensure that all personnel \nreceive these important exams, my bill stipulates that the exam may not \nbe waived by the Department or by individual personnel.\n  My bill also would strengthen current law by ensuring that these \nmedical examinations also include a mental health assessment. Our men \nand women in uniform serve in difficult circumstances far from home, \nand too many of them witness or experience violence and horrific \nsituations that most of us cannot even begin to imagine. I have heard \nconcerns that these brave men and women, many of whom are just out of \nhigh school or college when they sign up, may suffer long-term physical \nand mental fallout from their experiences and may feel reluctant to \nseek counseling or other assistance to deal with their experiences.\n  My bill would improve mental health services for demobilizing \nmilitary personnel by requiring that the content and standards for the \nmental health screening and assessment that are developed by the \nSecretary include content and standards for screening acute and delayed \nonset post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and, specifically, \nquestions to identify stressors experienced by military personnel that \nhave the potential to lead to PTSD. These efforts should build on--not \nreplace--the mental health questions that the Pentagon is already using \nas part of its post-deployment health screening process.\n  Some Wisconsinites have told me that they are concerned that the \nmultiple deployments of our National Guard and Reserve could lead to \nchronic PTSD, which could have its roots in an experience from a \nprevious deployment and which could come to the surface by a triggering \nevent that is experienced on a current deployment. The same is true for \nfull-time military personnel who have served in a variety of places \nover their careers.\n\n  We can and should do more to ensure that the mental health of our men \nand women in uniform is a top priority, and that the stigma that is too \noften attached to seeking assistance is ended. One step in this process \nis to ensure that personnel who have symptoms of PTSD and related \nillnesses have access to appropriate clinical services, through DoD, \nthe VA, or a private sector health care provider. To that end, my bill \nwould require that the health care professionals who are assessing \ndemobilizing military personnel provide all personnel who may need \nfollow-up care for a physical or psychological condition with \ninformation on appropriate resources through DoD or the VA and in the \nprivate sector that these personnel may use to access additional \nfollow-up care if they so choose.\n  I commend the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs for \nissuing in March 2005 a memorandum to the Assistant Secretaries for the \nArmy, Navy, and Air Force directing them to extend the Pentagon's \ncurrent post-deployment health assessment process to include a \nreassessment of ``global health with a specific emphasis on mental \nhealth'' to occur three to six months post-deployment. At a hearing of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee's Personnel Subcommittee earlier\n\n[[Page S7825]]\n\nthis year, the Assistant Secretary stated that the services were in the \nprocess of implementing a program that would include a ``screening \nprocedure with a questionnaire and a face-to-face interaction at about \nthree months'' post-deployment. He also noted that the idea for this \nprogram came from ``front line people'' and that he ``asked them. . . \n`do you think we should make it mandatory?' and the answer was: yes.'' \nThis sentiment makes it even more important that the initial post-\ndeployment mental health assessment be strengthened and that it be \nmandatory as well so that health care professionals have a benchmark \nagainst which to measure the results of the follow-up screening \nprocess.\n  In order to gain a better understanding of existing programs, my bill \nrequires the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs to report to \nCongress on the services provided to current and former members of the \nArmed Forces who experience PTSD and related conditions. This report \nwill include an analysis of the number of persons treated, the types of \ninterventions, and the programs that are in place for each branch of \nthe Armed Forces to identify and treat cases of PTSD and related \nconditions.\n  In addition, in order to ensure that all military personnel who are \neligible for medical benefits from the VA learn about and receive these \nbenefits, my bill would require that, as part of the demobilization \nprocess, assistance be provided to eligible members to enroll in the VA \nhealth care system.\n  My bill would also make improvements to the DoD demobilization and \ndischarge processes by ensuring that members of military and veterans \nservice organizations (MSOs and VSOs) are able to counsel personnel on \noptions for benefits and other important questions. The demobilization \nand discharge process presents our servicemembers with a sometimes \nconfusing and often overwhelming amount of information and paperwork \nthat must be digested and sometimes signed in a very short period of \ntime. My bill would authorize a ``veteran to veteran'' counseling \nprogram that will give military personnel the opportunity to speak with \nfellow veterans who have been through this process and who have been \naccredited to represent veterans in VA proceeding by the VA. These \nveterans can offer important advice about benefits and other choices \nthat military personnel have to make as they are being discharged or \ndemobilized.\n  Under current law, the Secretary of Defense may make use of the \nservices provided by MSOs and VSOs as part of the transition process. \nBut these groups tell me that they are not always allowed access to \ntransition briefings that are conducted for our personnel. In order to \nhelp facilitate the new veteran-to-veteran program, my legislation \nwould require the Secretary to ensure that representatives of MSOs, \nVSOs, and state departments of veterans affairs, are invited to \nparticipate in all transition and Benefits Delivery at Discharge \nprograms. In addition, my legislation requires that these dedicated \nveterans, who give so much of their time and of themselves to serving \ntheir fellow veterans and their families, are able to gain access to \nmilitary installations, military hospitals, and VA hospitals in order \nto provide this important service. By and large, these groups are able \nto speak with our military personnel at hospitals and other facilities. \nBut I am disturbed by reports that representatives of some of these \ngroups were having a hard time gaining access to these facilities in \norder to visit with our troops. For that reason, I have included this \naccess requirement in my bill.\n  I want to stress that my bill in no way requires military personnel \nto speak with members of MSOs or VSOs if they do not wish to do so. It \nmerely ensures that our men and women in uniform have this option.\n  I am pleased that this legislation is supported by a wide range of \ngroups that are dedicated to serving our men and women in uniform and \nveterans and their families. These groups include: the American Legion; \nthe Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States; \nthe National Coalition for Homeless Veterans; the Paralyzed Veterans of \nAmerica; the Reserve Officers Association; the Veterans of Foreign \nWars; the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs; the Wisconsin \nNational Guard; the American Legion, Department of Wisconsin; Disabled \nAmerican Veterans, Department of Wisconsin; the Wisconsin Paralyzed \nVeterans of America; the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Department of \nWisconsin; and the Wisconsin State Council, Vietnam Veterans of \nAmerica.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill and I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1341\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the \noutreach activities of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation \nthat will help to ensure that all of our veterans know about Federal \nbenefits to which they may be entitled by improving outreach programs \nconducted by the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  I am please to be joined in this effort by the Senator from Arkansas, \nMrs. Lincoln.\n  Five years ago, the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs (WDVA) \nlaunched a Statewide program called ``I Owe You,'' which encourages \nveterans to apply, or to re-apply, for benefits that they earned from \ntheir service to our country in the Armed Forces.\n  As part of this program, WDVA has sponsored 20 events around \nWisconsin called ``Supermarkets of Veterans Benefits'' at which \nveterans can begin the process of learning whether they qualify for \nfederal benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). \nInformation about additional benefits through WDVA is also provided. \nThese events, which are based on a similar program in Georgia, \nsupplement the work of Wisconsin's County Veterans Service Officers and \nveterans service organizations by helping our veterans to reconnect \nwith the VA and to learn more about services and benefits for which \nthey may be eligible.\n  More than 18,650 veterans and their families have attended the \nsupermarkets, which include information booths with representatives \nfrom WDVA, VA, and veterans service organizations, as well as a variety \nof Federal, State, and local agencies. I am proud to have had members \nof my staff speak with veterans and their families at a number of these \nevents. These events have helped veterans and their families to learn \nabout numerous topics, including health care, how to file a disability \nclaim, and pre-registration for internment in veterans cemeteries. \nAccording to WDVA, this program has helped Wisconsin to receive \napproximately $250 million in additional VA funding and benefits for \nour veterans each year.\n  The Institute for Government Innovation at Harvard University's \nKennedy School of Government recognized the ``I Owe You'' program by \nnaming it a semi-finalist for the 2002 Innovations in American \nGovernment Award. The program was featured in the March/April 2003 \nissue of Disabled American Veterans Magazine. And in August 2003, the \nMidwestern Legislative Conference of the Council of State Governments \nnamed the program a finalist in its 2003 Innovations in American \nGovernment Awards Program.\n  The State of Wisconsin is performing a service that is clearly the \nobligation of the VA. These are federal benefits that we owe to our \nveterans and it is the federal government's responsibility to make sure \nthat they receive them. The VA has a statutory obligation to perform \noutreach, and current budget pressures should not be used as an excuse \nto halt or reduce these efforts.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today was spurred by the \noverwhelming response to the WDVA's ``I Owe You'' program and the \nsupermarkets of veterans benefits. If more than 18,000 Wisconsin \nveterans want to make sure they know about all the benefits that are \nowed to them, there must be many more veterans around our country who \ndeserve to be told about the benefits they have earned. We can and \nshould do better for our veterans, who selflessly served our country \nand protected the freedoms that we all cherish. And it is important to \naddress gaps in the VA's outreach program as we welcome home and \nprepare to enroll into the VA system the tens of thousands of dedicated \nmilitary personnel who are serving in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other \nplaces around the globe.\n  In order to help to facilitate consistent implementation of VA's \noutreach responsibilities around the country, my bill would create a \nstatutory definition of the term ``outreach.''\n  My bill also would help to improve outreach activities performed by \nthe VA in three ways. First, it would create separate funding line \nitems for outreach activities within the budgets of the VA and its \nagencies (the Veterans Health Administration, the Veterans Benefits \nAdministration, and the National Cemetery Administration). Currently \nfunding for outreach is taken from the general operating expenses for \nthese agencies. These important programs should have a dedicated \nfunding source instead of being forced to compete for scarce funding \nwith other crucial VA programs.\n  I have long supported efforts to adequately fund VA programs. We can \nand should do more to provide the funding necessary to ensure that our \nbrave veterans are getting the health care and other benefits that they \nhave earned in a timely manner and without having to travel long \ndistances or wait more than a year to see a doctor or to have a claim \nprocessed.\n  Secondly, the bill would create an intra-agency structure to require \nthe Office of the Secretary, the Office of Public Affairs, the VBA, the \nVHA, and the NCA to coordinate outreach activities. By working more \nclosely together, the VA components would be able to consolidate their \nefforts, share proven outreach mechanisms, and avoid duplication of \neffort that could waste scarce funding.\n  Finally, the bill would ensure that the VA can enter into cooperative \nagreements with state departments of veterans affairs regarding \noutreach activities and would give the VA grant-making authority to \naward funds to State Departments of Veterans Affairs for outreach \nactivities such as the WDVA's ``I Owe You Program.'' Grants that are \nawarded to state departments under this program could be used to \nenhance outreach activities and to improve activities relating to \nveterans claims processing, which is a key component of the VA benefits \nprocess. State departments that receive grants\n\n[[Page S7828]]\n\nunder this program may choose to award portions of their grants to \nlocal governments, other public entities, or private or non-profit \norganizations that engage in veterans outreach activities. I want to be \nclear that it is not my intention that the funding for these grants be \ntaken from existing VA programs.\n  I am pleased that this bill has the support of a number of national \nand Wisconsin organizations that are committed to improving the lives \nof our nation's veterans, including: Disabled American Veterans; \nParalyzed Veterans of America; Vietnam Veterans of America; the \nNational Association of County Veterans Service Officers; the National \nAssociation of State Directors of Veterans Affairs; the Wisconsin \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs; the Wisconsin Association of County \nVeterans Service Officers; the American Legion, Department of \nWisconsin; the American Legion Auxiliary, Department of Wisconsin; \nDisabled American Veterans, Department of Wisconsin; the Wisconsin \nParalyzed Veterans of America; the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Department \nof Wisconsin; and the Wisconsin State Council, Vietnam Veterans of \nAmerica.\n  I hope that my colleagues will support this effort to ensure that our \nveterans know about the benefits for which they may be eligible as a \nresult of their service to our country. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe text of my bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1342\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a \nstudy of maritime sites in the State of Michigan; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will help celebrate Michigan's lighthouses and maritime heritage.\n  The Great Lakes are an inseparable part of Michigan's identity and \ncultural history. One of our symbols of that identity are the over 120 \nlighthouses that define our shorelines--more lighthouses than any other \nstate in the nation.\n  These beautiful beacons not only serve their purpose as a \nnavigational tool for ships, but they also draw thousands of tourists \nto Michigan's shores. Our lakeshore communities host visitors from \nacross the country, who travel to view the magnificence of our coastal \nareas and the lighthouses that illuminate them. Our maritime museums \ndetail the Great Lakes' rich history and unique character.\n  As the economy in Michigan faces numerous challenges, these small \ncommunities are more dependant than ever on tourism dollars. We must \nhelp them by ensuring that there are coordinated efforts to protect \nMichigan's lighthouses and promote the Great Lakes' maritime culture. \nIf we don't, we risk losing these symbols of our history and our future \nfor all time.\n  The Michigan Maritime Heritage and Lighthouse Trail Act would help \ndevelop Federal, State and local partnerships by requiring the National \nPark Service to work with the State of Michigan and local communities \nto study and make recommendations to Congress on the best ways to \npromote and protect Michigan's lighthouses and maritime resources. \nThese recommendations would include specific legislative proposals for \nthe preservation of lighthouses and maritime history. For example, they \nmay call for\n\n[[Page S7829]]\n\nthe creation of a statewide trail highlighting the historical features \nof our shorelines and lighthouses. The recommendations would also \ninclude the identification of funding sources for Michigan communities, \nwhich are critical to this effort.\n  This bill has strong bipartisan support from all of Michigan's \nmembers of Congress. I urge my colleagues to join us in expediting \npassage of the Michigan Maritime Heritage and Lighthouse Trail Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1346\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this \n     Act $500,000.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 1347. A bill to authorize demonstration project grants to entities \nto provide low-cost, small loans; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Low-Cost \nAlternatives to Payday Loans Act, which would authorize demonstration \nproject grants to eligible entities to provide low-cost, short-term \nalternatives to expensive, predatory payday loans. Payday loans are \nsmall cash loans repaid by borrowers' postdated checks or borrowers' \nauthorizations to make electronic debits against existing financial \naccounts. Payday loan amounts are usually in the range of $100 to $500 \nwith payment in full due in two weeks. Finance charges on payday loans \nare typically in the range of $15 to $30 per $100 borrowed, which \ntranslates into triple digit interest rates in the range of 390 percent \nto 780 percent when expressed as an annual percentage rate (APR). Loan \nflipping, which is a common practice, is the renewing of loans at \nmaturity by paying additional fees without any principal reduction. \nLoan flipping often leads to instances where the fees paid for a payday \nloan well exceed the principal borrowed. This situation often creates a \ncycle of debt that is hard to break. Currently, there is a lack of low-\ncost, short-term credit product alternatives available to consumers. My \nlegislation is intended to encourage the development of products that \nsatisfy the current demand for small loans of a short duration, but at \na fair interest rate.\n  The payday loan business has grown rapidly in recent years, with \nindustry revenues ballooning from $810 million in 1998 to $40 billion \nin 2004. A study by the investment bank, Stephens, Inc., of Little \nRock, AK, estimated payday loan volume of $25 to $27 billion to 9 to 14 \nmillion U.S. households, generating between $4 and $4.3 billion in \nfees. According to a 2004 study conducted by the Consumer Federation of \nAmerica (CFA), there were an estimated 22,000 payday lender storefronts \nnationally. Through these storefronts, payday lenders originated an \nestimated $40 billion in loans and received $6 billion in finance \ncharges.\n  Payday loan providers claim that they are offering a simple financial \nproduct that addresses an emergency or temporary credit need that \nusually cannot be met by traditional financial institutions. An \nanalysis of payday lending statistics by the Center for Responsible \nLending indicates that the\n\n[[Page S7830]]\n\nmajority of payday loan borrowers have multiple loans each year. Two of \nthree borrowers have five or more payday loans annually, and half of \nthese borrowers have 12 or more payday loans annually. Only 33 percent \nof payday borrowers use four or fewer payday loans annually. Some \nborrowers seek loans from two or more payday lenders, multiplying the \npotential for getting trapped in debt. Research by the Community \nFinancial Services Association of America, the payday loan industry's \nnational trade association, found that 40 percent of payday loan \ncustomers renew their payday loans five times or more. Many of these \ncustomers are lower or middle income working families who need a small \namount of money for a short period of time. This becomes a financial \nbridge to help pay for unexpected expenses.\n  More and more predatory lenders locate near military installations, \ntargeting vulnerable military servicemembers and their families. The \nArmy has gone to the extent of offering payday lenders some competition \nthrough its Army Emergency Relief (AER) initiative. AER, a private, \nnonprofit organization, has been working on a national program called \nCommanders Referral that will debut at Fort Hood, Texas, later this \nyear. This program will offer soldiers up to two no-interest, $500 \nloans a year, in an attempt to undercut the aggressive tactics of \npayday lenders. Testifying before the House Subcommittee on Life Issues \non February 16, 2005, the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy \ntestified that the payday industry ``has made it a practice to prey \nupon our Sailors.'' He went on to say ``it is not being dramatic to \nstate these payday loans to our troops could be a threat to their \nmilitary readiness.'' As the ranking member of the Armed Services \nSubcommittee on Readiness and Management Support, this is an issue of \ngrave concern to me.\n  I am heartened to see that some federal credit unions have developed \nalternatives to payday loan products. The Pentagon Federal Credit Union \nFoundation, Pentagon Federal, and Langley Federal Credit Union, Langley \nFederal, have each introduced a payday loan alternative. Pentagon \nFederal offers the Asset Recovery Kit (ARK). For ARK, borrowers must \nagree to financial counseling, or already be receiving counseling, in \norder to receive a loan of up to $500. The borrower pays a $6 flat fee \nfor the loan and no credit report is required, but financial counseling \nis mandatory. Langley Federal's QuickCash product features the quick \nturnaround of a payday loan, but at an 18 percent annual percentage \nrate. It does not have the financial counseling requirement of the \nPentagon Federal's ARK, but is still a viable alternative to a high \ncost payday loan. In my home state, Windward Community Federal Credit \nUnion, located in Kailua, Hawaii, has developed a payday loan \nalternative. This credit union is offering simple short-term loans, \nwith a short approval period, at a fair interest rate. With the \ndemonstration grants offered through my legislation, it is my hope that \nmore credit unions, community development financial institutions and \nbanks will develop and offer similar types of innovative credit \nproducts that can serve as alternatives to payday loans.\n  The payday loan industry exploits people that are in financial need. \nThere is a demand for this type of loan, but these loans are \nexcessively priced. My bill authorizes the Department of the Treasury \nto award demonstration project grants to banks, credit unions, and \ncommunity development financial institutions to develop and implement a \ncredit product subject to the APR promulgated by the National Credit \nUnion Administration's Loan Interest Rates, which is currently capped \nat an APR of 18 percent. The grants would provide consumers with a \nlower-cost, short-term alternative to predatory payday loans. The \ndemonstration project grants would require individuals seeking a loan \nthrough this program to pursue financial literacy and education \nopportunities that will help them better prepare to manage their \nfinances.\n  I have a letter in support of my legislation that is signed by the \nConsumer Federation of America, the U.S. Public Interest Research Group \nand the Center for Responsible Lending. I ask unanimous consent that it \nbe printed in the Record.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation so that \naffordable alternatives to payday loans can be found.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Center for Responsible Lending, Consumer Federation of \n           America, U.S. Public Interest Research Group,\n                                                      May 3, 2005.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: Consumer Federation of America, Center \n     for Responsible Lending and U.S. Public Interest Research \n     Group write in support of your legislation to encourage \n     mainstream financial institutions to meet the small loan \n     needs of their own customers. We agree with you that banks, \n     credit unions, and community development financial \n     institutions can and should provide affordable small loans to \n     depositors, along with financial literacy training and asset \n     development to turn debtors into savers.\n       When consumers turn to the under-regulated small loan \n     market, they typically pay triple-digit interest for very \n     short term loans and risk valuable assets to coercive \n     collection tactics. Last year consumers paid $6 billion to \n     borrow $40 billion for check-based small loans from payday \n     loan outlets. National Consumer Law Center and CFA recently \n     reported that low to moderate income consumers paid almost \n     $1.4 billion to borrow against their anticipated income tax \n     refunds. The Center for Responsible Lending and CFA report on \n     car title lending describes the booming business of making \n     one-month loans secured by a title to a paid for vehicle.\n       We believe that the solutions to the use of fringe lenders \n     by low to moderate income consumers include effective state \n     and federal consumer protections, a stronger safety net of \n     financial literacy and credit counseling, and the development \n     of beneficial alternatives by mainstream financial \n     institutions. Your bill seeks to expand mainstream \n     alternatives by authorizing Treasury demonstration grants to \n     non-profit organizations and qualifying financial \n     institutions. It is very important that the bill limits the \n     cost of loans made per these grants to the federal credit \n     union cap of 18% annual interest rate and requires that \n     borrowers also receive educational resources.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Jean Ann Fox,\n\n                                  Director of Consumer Protection,\n                                   Consumer Federation of America.\n\n                                           Edmund Mierzwinski,\n\n                                        Consumer Program Director,\n                              U.S. Public Interest Research Group.\n\n                                                  Mark Pearce,\n\n                                                        President,\n     Center for Responsible Lending.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 1347\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend chapter 111 of title 28, United States Code, \nrelating to protective orders, sealing of cases, disclosures of \ndiscovery information in civil actions, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Sunshine in \nLitigation Act of 2005, a bill to curb the ongoing abuse of secrecy \norders in Federal courts. The result of this abuse, which often comes \nin the form of sealed settlement agreements, is to keep important \nhealth and safety information from the public.\n  This problem has been recurring for decades, and most often arises in \nproducts liability cases. Typically, an individual brings a cause of \naction against a manufacturer for an injury or death that has resulted \nfrom a defect in one of its products. The plaintiff has limited \nresources and faces a corporation that can spend an unlimited amount of \nmoney on delay tactics. Facing a formidable opponent, plaintiffs are \ndiscouraged from continuing and often seek to settle the litigation. In \nexchange for the award he or she was seeking, the victim is forced to \nagree to a provision that prohibits him or her from revealing \ninformation disclosed during the litigation.\n  While the plaintiff gets a respectable award and the defendant is \nable to keep damaging information from getting out, others are forced \nto pay the price. Because they remain unaware of critical public health \nand safety information that could potentially save lives, the American \npublic incurs the greatest cost.\n  Currently, judges have broad discretion in granting protective orders \nwhen ``good cause'' is shown. Too much discretion, however, can \nsometimes lead to abuse. Tobacco companies, automobile manufacturers \nand pharmaceutical companies have settled with victims and used the \nlegal system to hide information which, if it became public, could \nprotect the American public. Surely, there are appropriate uses for \nsuch orders, like protecting trade secrets and other truly confidential \ncompany information. Our legislation makes sure such information is \nprotected. But, protective orders are certainly not supposed to be used \nto hide public safety information from the public to protect a \ncompany's reputation or profit margin.\n  The most famous case of abuse involved Bridgestone/Firestone. From \n1992-2000, tread separations of various Bridgestone and Firestone tires \nwere causing accidents across the country, many resulting in serious \ninjuries and even fatalities. Instead of owning up to their mistakes \nand acting responsibly, Bridgestone/Firestone quietly settled dozens of \nlawsuits, most of which included secrecy agreements. It wasn't until \n1999, when a Houston public television station broke the story, that \nthe company acknowledged its wrongdoing and recalled 6.5 million tires. \nBy then, it was too late; too many unnecessary injuries and deaths had \nalready occurred.\n  If the story ended there, and the Bridgestone/Firestone cases were \njust an aberration, maybe there would be no cause for concern. But, \nunfortunately, the list goes on. In January 2004, Jodie Lane was \nwalking her dog in Manhattan when she slipped and fell on a Con Edison \ncable cover. She was electrocuted and killed. It has since been \ndiscovered that Con Edison has settled eleven similar cases, all \ninvolving secrecy agreements.\n  Then there is the case of General Motors (``GM''). Although an \ninternal memo suggests that GM was aware of the risk of fire deaths \nfrom crashes of pickup trucks with ``side saddle'' fuel tanks, an \nestimated 750 people were killed in fires involving these fuel tanks. \nWhen victims sued, GM disclosed documents only under protective orders \nand settled these cases on the condition that the information in these \ndocuments remained secret. This type of fuel tank was installed for 15 \nyears before being discontinued.\n  There are no records kept of the number of confidentiality orders \naccepted by state or federal courts. However, anecdotal evidence \nsuggests that court secrecy and confidential settlements are prevalent. \nBeyond General Motors, Bridgestone/Firestone and Con Edison, secrecy \nagreements had real life consequences by allowing Dalkon Shield, Bjork-\nShiley heart valves, and numerous other dangerous products to remain in \nthe market. And those are only the ones we know about.\n  While some States have already begun to move in the right direction, \nwe still have a long way to go. It is time to initiate a Federal \nsolution for this problem. The Sunshine in Litigation Act is a modest \nproposal that would require Federal judges to perform a simple \nbalancing test to ensure that the defendant's interest in secrecy truly \noutweighs the public interest in information related to public health \nand safety. Specifically, prior to making any portion of a case \nconfidential or sealed, a judge would have to determine by making a \nparticularized finding of fact--that doing so would not restrict the \ndisclosure of information relevant to public health and safety. \nMoreover, all courts, both Federal and State, would be prohibited from \nissuing protective orders that prevent disclosure to relevant \nregulatory agencies.\n  This legislation does not prohibit secrecy agreements across the \nboard. It does not place an undue burden on judges or our courts. It \nsimply states that where the public interest in disclosure outweighs \nlegitimate interests in secrecy, courts should not shield important \nhealth and safety information from the public. The time to focus some \nsunshine on public hazards to prevent future harm is now.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 1349. A bill to promote deployment of competitive video services, \neliminate redundant and unnecessary regulation, and further the \ndevelopment of next generation broadband networks; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Rockefeller to \nintroduce the Video Choice Act of 2005. This bill will promote \ncompetition and help bring choice to consumers in the video market. In \naddition, the bill will further the development of next generation \nbroadband networks and spur economic development in rural areas of the \ncountry, like Wallowa, OR.\n  A recent Government Accountability Office study underscores the \nbenefits of competition in the video market. In August 2004, GAO \nconcluded that cable rates are on average 15 percent lower in markets \nwith a wire-based competitor to the incumbent cable operator. My \nlegislation promotes competition and lowers rates by eliminating \nredundant and unnecessary video franchises.\n  Specifically, my legislation permits any company that has already \nobtained a franchise to build and operate a network to offer video \nservices over that\n\n[[Page S7832]]\n\nnetwork without obtaining a second, redundant franchise. These \ncompetitive video service providers will still be subject to the \nimportant social policy obligations of cable operators, including the \nobligation to pay fees to local governments; to comply with the \nretransmission consent and must-carry provisions of the Act; to carry \npublic, educational, governmental and non-commercial, educational \nchannels; to protect the privacy of subscribers and to comply with all \nstatutory consumer protections and customer service requirements.\n  Importantly, my legislation also preserves State and local government \nauthority to manage the public rights-of-way and to enact or enforce \nany consumer protection law. In so doing, we have ensured that local \ncommunities continue to play a meaningful role in the management of \nthese networks.\n  We recognize that the video franchising process imposes burdens on \ncable operators and welcome the opportunity to investigate and address \nthose concerns as this debate moves forward.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1349\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Video Choice Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Cable rates continue to rise substantially faster than \n     the overall rate of inflation.\n       (2) Wire-based competition in video services is limited to \n     very few markets. According to the Federal Communications \n     Commission, only 2 percent of all cable subscribers have the \n     opportunity to choose between 2 or more wire-based video \n     service providers.\n       (3) It is only through wire-based video competition that \n     price competition exists. The Government Accountability \n     Office has confirmed that where wire-based competition \n     exists, cable rates are 15 percent lower than in markets \n     without competition.\n       (4) It is in the public interest to further wire-based \n     competition in the video services market in order to provide \n     greater consumer choice and lower prices for video services.\n       (5) To spur competition in the communications industry, \n     Congress has decreased the regulatory burden on new entrants, \n     thereby increasing entry into the market and creating \n     competition.\n       (6) The United States continues to fall behind in broadband \n     deployment rates. According to a recent study by the \n     International Telecommunications Union, the United States is \n     now ranked 16th in the world in broadband deployment.\n       (7) The deployment of advanced high capacity networks would \n     greatly spur economic development in rural America.\n       (8) The deployment of advanced networks that can offer \n     substantially higher capacity are critical to the long-term \n     competitiveness of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Smith in \nintroducing the Video Choice Act of 2005. We believe that our bill will \nincrease competition in the video marketplace and spur the deployment \nof advanced broadband networks.\n  Cable and telephone companies are competing to offer a bundle of \nInternet, video and telephone service to consumers. Cable companies are \nnow offering telephone services. Cable companies offer both traditional \ntelephone services over the public switched telephone network and \nrecently have begun a major expansion into offering voice services over \nthe internet. Congress, in an effort to spur entry into the voice \nmarket, decided to minimally regulate or deregulate cable companies' \nentry in these voice services.\n  As cable enters the voice market, it is driving prices down and \ncreating innovative new voice services and products. At present, cable \ncompanies control nearly 70 percent of the multi-channel video market \nand are not subject to effective price competition for video services. \nThe Senate Commerce Committee, of which Senator Smith and I are both \nmembers, spent much of the last Congress examining options to address \nthe ever escalating price of cable television. I recognize that the \ncable industry has invested heavily in its networks and programming \ncosts continue to rise, but I am hearing from some of my constituents \nthat they feel\n\n[[Page S7833]]\n\ncaptive to the pricing decisions of their local cable company.\n  I believe the government should encourage facilities-based video \ncompetition. The Government Accountability Office has reported that in \nareas where cable faces competition from a facilities-based competitor, \ncable television prices are, on average, 15 percent less and as much as \n41 percent less than in areas without effective competition.\n  To compete with cable, traditional telephone companies are slowly \nentering the video marketplace. Instead of offering video services over \ncable, the telephone companies will offer it over their high capacity \nfiber networks. Fiber-optic cables consist of bundles of hair-thin \nglass strands. Laser-generated pulses of light transmit voice, data, \nand video signals via the fiber at speeds and capacities far exceeding \ntoday's copper-cable systems. Fiber technology provides nearly \nunlimited capacity, as much as 20 times faster than today's fastest \nhigh-speed data connections.\n  Even more importantly, our bill would speed the deployment of super \nfast broadband networks. To offer video services, telephone companies \nwill have to either lay fiber optic cables or develop other networks \nthat have enough capacity to transmit hundreds of television channels. \nThese networks will also be able to offer consumers the ability to \nreceive and send vast amounts of data.\n  Our Nation continues a precipitous decline in the world's broadband \ndeployment rate. As Asian countries develop broadband networks capable \nof delivering consumers 30 to 100 megabits of data, the United States \nfalls further behind in deployment of next generation broadband \ntechnologies. The deployment of fiber optic or technologically \nequivalent networks would spur economic development as well as consumer \nchoice in the cable television market.\n  I have worked for almost eight years on legislation to provide \nincentives to promote the deployment of next generation broadband \ntechnology and services. The Senate has adopted this measure numerous \ntimes, but because of opposition in the House of Representatives, it \nhas never been enacted into law. We must examine other policies if we \nare to achieve universal broadband penetration. I believe that our \nlegislation will serve as a catalyst for the deployment of next \ngeneration broadband networks that will bring enormous economic \nbenefits to Americans, especially rural Americans.\n  I know that many local governments are concerned about changing the \nexisting regulatory framework for video regulation. I recognize that \nmunicipal governments have an important role to play in the \ntelecommunications debate. As a former governor, I am aware of the \nimportant local revenues that cable franchise fees provide local \ngovernment in West Virginia and across the Nation. I have always \nsupported the local government's ability to collect local fees and \ntaxes on telecommunications services, and I want to state that I will \ncontinue to do so.\n  Our legislation states that competitive video providers, as defined \nby the bill, do not have to secure a local franchise agreement to offer \ncompetitive video services. However, the legislation mandates that all \nvital social policy obligations of current cable television operators \nwill also have to be met by the competitive video industry. First and \nforemost, our bill mandates that competitive video providers pay a \nfranchise fee to the appropriate local government. This fee would be \nequal to the fee the incumbent video provider pays. Our bill also \nrequires that competitive video providers carry all existing local \npublic, educational, and government use channels; carry all local \nbroadcast stations; carry all noncommercial, educational channels; \nadhere to strict consumer privacy obligations; and comply with all \nstatutory consumer protections and customer service requirements. The \nbill explicitly prohibits economic redlining in the provision of \ncompetitive video services. Finally, the legislation explicitly states \nthat nothing in the bill affects the authority of a State or local \ngovernment to manage the public-rights-of-way or to enact or enforce \nany consumer protection law.\n  Senator Smith and I have crafted a narrowly tailored bill to promote \nthe entry of new competitors into the video marketplace. Our \nlegislation balances the need to promote competition in this market \nwith preserving the core social and policy obligations that we have \nalways imposed on providers of video services.\n  In addition to promoting competition in the video marketplace, this \nbill gives us the opportunity to foster an exponential growth in \nadvanced broadband networks. By having advanced communications networks \nthat are exponentially faster than our existing networks, we will \nunleash our economic potential, especially in places like my home State \nof West Virginia.\n  Again, I would like to thank Senator Smith for all of his hard work \non this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 1350. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to protect \nthe privacy rights of subscribers to wireless communications services; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to introduce the \nWireless 411 Privacy Act. As every Senator is aware, consumers, today \nrely on their wireless telephones as a vital and important means of \ncommunication. Wifeless telephones enable families to stay connected, \npermit commerce to be conducted anywhere at any time, and provide a \nvital link in the event of an emergency. Some people have even \nabandoned traditional telephones and now use their wireless phones as \ntheir primary phone service. In fact, when I last introduced this bill \nin November 2003, the Federal Communications Commission began requiring \nnumber portability for wireless phones so that consumers, if they wish, \ncan make their wireless phone their only phone.\n  The wireless industry is on the verge of introducing a ``wireless \nwhite pages'' service, and though this step could have positive \nbenefits, it raises concerns about how consumers' expectation of \nprivacy will be protected. The legislation I am introducing today, \nalong with Senator Boxer, ensures that consumers' expectations will be \npreserved.\n  An important reason that Americans increasingly trust their cell \nphone service is that they have a great deal of privacy in their cell \nphone numbers. For more than 20 years of cellular service, consumers \nhave become accustomed to not having their wireless phone numbers \navailable to the public. The protection of wireless telephone numbers \nis important. For example, wireless customers are typically charged for \nincoming calls. Without protections for wireless numbers, subscribers \ncould incur large bills, or use up their allotted minutes of use, \nsimply by receiving calls they do not want--from telemarketers and \nothers. Because consumers often take their cell phones with them \neverywhere, repeated unwanted calls are particularly disruptive, and \nmay even present safety concerns for those behind the wheel.\n\n  Since 2003, four States--California, Georgia, South Dakota and \nWashington--have passed similar laws that prohibit a carrier from \ndivulging a customer's wireless telephone number without permission. \nWhile the industry remains poised to introduce wireless directory \nassistance services as early as this year, it is important for Congress \nto act now to preserve the expectation of privacy that consumers across \nthe country have in their wireless phone numbers. The legislation I am \nintroducing today strikes an important balance by providing privacy \nprotections that are important to consumers, while enabling those \nconsumers who want to be reached to be accessible.\n  This legislation permits wireless subscribers to choose not to have \ntheir wireless telephone number listed in wireless directory assistance \ndatabases. This feature gives consumers the ultimate ability to keep \ntheir numbers entirely private. In addition to divulging subscribers' \nphone numbers, wireless directory assistance services may forward calls \nto wireless subscribers without prior notice or permission. My bill \nrequires that these services must not divulge a subscriber's wireless \nnumber, unless the subscriber consents to disclosure, must provide \nidentifying information to the wireless subscriber so that the \nsubscriber knows who is calling through a forwarding service, and must \ngive a subscriber the option\n\n[[Page S7834]]\n\nof rejecting or accepting each incoming call. Finally, this legislation \nprohibits wireless carriers from charging any special fees to consumers \nwho wish to receive the privacy protections provided by the bill. There \nshould be no ``privacy tax'' for consumers to continue the privacy \nprotection they have long enjoyed, and this bill ensures that will be \nthe case.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1350\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Wireless 411 Privacy Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) there are roughly 150 million wireless subscribers in \n     the United States, up from approximately 15 million \n     subscribers just a decade ago;\n       (2) wireless phone service has proven valuable to millions \n     of Americans because of its mobility, and the fact that \n     government policies have expanded opportunities for new \n     carriers to enter the market, offering more choices and ever \n     lower prices for consumers;\n       (3) in addition to the benefits of competition and \n     mobility, subscribers also benefit from the fact that \n     wireless phone numbers have not been publicly available;\n       (4) up until now, the privacy of wireless subscribers has \n     been safeguarded and thus vastly diminished the likelihood of \n     subscribers receiving unwanted or annoying phone call \n     interruptions on their wireless phones;\n       (5) moreover, because their wireless contact information, \n     such as their phone number, have never been publicly \n     available in any published directory or from any directory \n     assistance service, subscribers have come to expect that if \n     their phone rings it's likely to be a call from someone to \n     whom they have personally given their number;\n       (6) the wireless industry is poised to begin implementing a \n     directory assistance service so that callers can reach \n     wireless subscribers, including subscribers who have not \n     given such callers their wireless phone number;\n       (7) while some wireless subscribers may find such directory \n     assistance service useful, current subscribers deserve the \n     right to choose whether they want to participate in such a \n     directory;\n       (8) because wireless users are typically charged for \n     incoming calls, consumers must be afforded the ability to \n     maintain the maximum amount of control over how many calls \n     they may expect to receive and, in particular, control over \n     the disclosure of their wireless phone number;\n       (9) current wireless subscribers who elect to participate, \n     or new wireless subscribers who decline to be listed, in any \n     new wireless directory assistance service directory, \n     including those subscribers who also elect not to receive \n     forwarded calls from any wireless directory assistance \n     service, should not be charged for exercising such rights;\n       (10) the marketplace has not yet adequately explained an \n     effective plan to protect consumer privacy rights;\n       (11) Congress previously acted to protect the wireless \n     location information of subscribers by enacting prohibitions \n     on the disclosure of such sensitive information without the \n     express prior authorization of the subscriber; and\n       (12) the public interest would be served by similarly \n     enacting effective and industry-wide privacy protections for \n     consumers with respect to wireless directory assistance \n     service.\n\n     SEC. 3. CONSUMER CONTROL OF WIRELESS PHONE NUMBERS.\n\n       Section 332(c) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n     332(c)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(9) Wireless consumer privacy protection.--\n       ``(A) In general.--A provider of commercial mobile \n     services, or any direct or indirect affiliate or agent of \n     such a provider, may not include the wireless telephone \n     number information of any subscriber in any wireless \n     directory assistance service database unless--\n       ``(i) the mobile service provider provides a conspicuous, \n     separate notice to the subscriber informing the subscriber of \n     the right not to be listed in any wireless directory \n     assistance service;

A bill to provide grants to States for improved workplace \nand community transition training for incarcerated youth offenders; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce the Improved Workplace and Community Transition Training for \nIncarcerated Youth Offenders Act of 2005, which is legislation designed \nto enhance educational opportunities and reduce recidivism for adult \nand juvenile offenders. Following the repeal of Pell Grant eligibility \nfor incarcerated individuals, I worked to create the Grants to States \nfor Workplace and Community Transition Training for Incarcerated Youth \nOffenders program. This program is aimed at providing postsecondary \neducation and workplace and community transition training for \nincarcerated youth offenders while in prison, as well as employment \ncounseling and other services that continue when the individual is \nreleased.\n  This legislation, which I am introducing today, builds upon my \nearlier efforts by increasing flexibility and accountability within the \nGrants to States for Workplace and Community Transition Training for \nIncarcerated Youth Offenders. This legislation is a positive step \nforward in providing realistic rehabilitation by increasing access to \nthe current program for incarcerated youth offenders.\n  With over two million incarcerated adults, the United States has the \nhighest incarceration rate in the world. The National Adult Literacy \nStudy indicates that the majority of prison inmates either are \nilliterate or have marginal reading, writing, and math skills. This \nyear more than 650,000 inmates will be released from United States \nprisons. Most of these adults and juveniles will leave correctional \ninstitutions having received little to no education and no more skilled \nthan when they arrived. Frustrated by a lack of marketable skills, \nburdened with a criminal record, and released without transitional \nservices, nearly two-thirds of released prisoners are re-arrested for \neither a felony or a serious misdemeanor within 3 years of release. It \nshould come as no surprise that an individual who is released and who \nis illiterate or lacks the necessary skills to get a job returns to a \nlife of crime.\n  The key to preventing recidivism has proven to be educational access \nand opportunity. A Correctional Educational Association report \npublished findings from a study of education programs provided in \ncorrectional facilities. The findings show a remarkable decrease of \napproximately 10 percent in recidivism for those inmates that \nparticipated in education programs while incarcerated. The study also \nshows that the higher the education level reached by the offender, the \nlower the resulting recidivism rate.\n  Most incarcerated youth offenders will one day return back to their \ncommunities, so this legislation is about making sure they have an \nopportunity to turn their lives around before they are released. It is \nabout focusing on literacy and job training in order to reduce \nrecidivism and prevent incarcerated youth offenders from becoming \ncareer criminals. I believe that criminal offenders, especially \njuveniles, should be given a chance at rehabilitation and gainful \nemployment. This chance can only come through education.\n  This legislation would authorize $30 million to provide incarcerated \nyouth offenders, up to 35 years of age who are eligible for parole or \nrelease within 5 years, an opportunity to acquire postsecondary \neducation while incarcerated, as well as employment counseling and \nother services that continue for up to one year after the individual is \nreleased. Currently, the Grants to States for Workplace and Community \nTransition Training for Incarcerated Youth Offenders program provides \nformula grant funding to State correctional education agencies to \nprovide postsecondary education and related services to incarcerated \nyouth offenders up to 25 years of age. This legislation would increase \neligibility for incarcerated youth offenders to individuals 35 years of \nage to allow more individuals to participate in the program, as the \naverage age of inmates in most States is 35.\n  This legislation also aims to increase flexibility with regard to the \ndelivery of postsecondary education and related services to \nincarcerated youth offenders. To that end, this legislation would raise \nthe allowable expenditure permitted for each youth offender to the \nmaximum Federal Pell Grant level. The current program limits \nexpenditures per youth offender to $1,500 for tuition and books, and an \nadditional $300 for related services. Under this legislation, State \ncorrectional education agencies have increased flexibility to address \nthe unique needs of each inmate due to the elimination of the caps on \nfunding, which currently dictate the specific amounts permitted to be \nused for tuition and books, and related services.\n  Additionally, this legislation requires State correctional education \nagencies to more thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of the goals and \nobjectives of the program by tracking and reporting specific and \nquantified student outcomes referenced to the outcomes of non-program \nparticipants. Increased accountability included in this legislation \nwill allow a more in-depth study of the impact of education on key \ngoals, such as, knowledge and skill attainment, employment attainment, \njob retention and advancement and recidivism rates.\n  Recognizing the impact that education and job training can have on \nincarcerated youth offenders, it is my sincere hope that this \nlegislation will encourage incarcerated individuals to achieve \nindependence and to gain the skills necessary to become productive \nmembers of society upon their release. With realistic rehabilitation, \nincluding literacy training and job training, we can stop the cycle of \ncatch-and-release.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this legislation, and \nurge its swift adoption.\n\n[[Page S7836]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. Warner, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Cochran, \n        Mr. Corzine, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. \n        Vitter):\n  S. 1353. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nthe establishment of an Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Registry; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ALS Registry Act. I \nam pleased that Senators Warner, Stabenow, Murkowski, Bingaman, \nCochran, Durbin, Vitter, and Corzine are joining me as original \ncosponsors of this important legislation.\n  ALS is a fatal, progressive disease where the nerve cells that \nconnect the brain and spinal cord to the muscles slowly die. As the \ndisease progresses, patients slowly lose control of their muscles. \nThrough it all, patients remain completely aware of what is happening \nto their bodies because ALS does not affect the mind. The harsh reality \nof ALS is that a person can expect to live on average only two to five \nyears from the time the first signs of the disease appear.\n  Lou Gehrig brought Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) to the \npublic's attention more than 65 years ago and his courage put a human \nface on this terrible disease. Each of us has a Lou Gehrig back in our \nhome State--someone who shows great courage in the face of ALS. Over \nthe years, I have worked closely with the Nevada ALS Association and \nhave met with many Nevadans who have been touched by this devastating \nillness. One of these Nevadans was a man by the name of Steve Rigazio \nwho was invited to testify before the Labor/HHS/Education \nAppropriations Subcommittee in May of 2000. Steve was at the height of \nhis career when he was diagnosed with ALS. He worked through the ranks \nof the Nevada Power Company, the largest utility company in the State, \nfor 16 years until he became President. He coached and played \nrecreational hockey and at one point played semi-pro baseball. After \nhis diagnosis, Steve continued to show up at work at 6 a.m. for as long \nas he could. Steve Rigazio died of ALS on December 27, 2001 at the age \nof 47 and left behind a family that included a wife, two children and \nhundreds of friends. The ALS Steve Rigazio Voice of Courage Award was \nnamed in his honor as a living testimony to the life of this special \nman.\n  Sadly, every year approximately 5,600 Americans will learn they have \nALS. There is no cure for ALS and there is only one FDA approved drug \nto specifically treat ALS. That drug extends life for only a few months \nand only works in 20 percent of patients.\n  ALS has proven particularly hard for scientists and doctors to tackle \nfor a number of reasons; including the fact that there is also not a \ncentralized place where data on the disease is collected and no one \nplace for patients to go to find out about clinical trials and new \nresearch findings. Currently, there is only a patchwork of data about \nALS that does not include the entire U.S. population and only includes \nlimited data for specific purposes, such as to determine the \nrelationship between military service and the disease. Perhaps the most \nobvious example of the limitations of current surveillance systems and \nregistries is that we do not know with certainty how many people are \nliving with ALS in the United States today. Over 136 years after the \ndiscovery of ALS, estimates on its prevalence still vary by as much as \n100 percent--from a low of about fifteen thousand patients to as many \nas thirty thousand.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would create an ALS registry \nat the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and will aid in the \nsearch for a cure to this devastating disease. The registry will \ncollect data concerning: the incidence and prevalence of ALS in the \nU.S.; the environmental and occupational factors that may contribute to \nthe disease; the age, race or ethnicity, gender and family history of \nindividuals diagnosed; and other information essential to the study of \nALS. The registry will also provide a secure method to put patients in \ncontact with scientists conducting clinical trials and scientists \nstudying the environmental and genetic causes of ALS.\n  A national registry will help arm our Nation's researchers and \nclinicians with the tools and information they need to make progress in \nthe fight against ALS. The data made available by a registry will \npotentially allow scientists to identify causes of the disease, and \nmaybe even lead to the discovery of new treatment, a cure for ALS, or \neven a way to prevent the disease in the first place.\n  The establishment of a registry will bring new hope to thousands of \npatients and their families that ALS will no longer be a death \nsentence. No one wants to wait another 65 years before a cure is found. \nI urge my colleagues to support the swift passage of the ALS Registry \nAct.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1353\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``ALS Registry Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (referred to in this \n     section as ``ALS'') is a fatal, progressive neurodegenerative \n     disease that affects motor nerve cells in the brain and the \n     spinal cord.\n       (2) The average life expectancy for a person with ALS is 2 \n     to 5 years from the time of diagnosis.\n       (3) The cause of ALS is not well understood.\n       (4) There is only one drug currently approved by the Food \n     and Drug Administration for the treatment of ALS, which has \n     thus far shown only modest effects, prolonging life by just a \n     few months.\n       (5) There is no known cure for ALS.\n       (6) More than 5,000 individuals in the United States are \n     diagnosed with ALS annually and as many as 30,000 individuals \n     may be living with ALS in the United States today.\n       (7) Studies have found relationships between ALS and \n     environmental and genetic factors, but those relationships \n     are not well understood.\n       (8) Scientists believe that there are significant ties \n     between ALS and any motor neuron diseases.\n       (9) Several ALS disease registries and databases exist in \n     the United States and throughout the world, including the \n     SOD1 database, the National Institute of Neurological \n     Disorders and Stroke repository, and the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs ALS Registry;\n       (10) A single national system to collect and store \n     information on the prevalence and incidence of ALS in the \n     United States does not exist.\n       (11) The establishment of a national registry will help--\n       (A) identify the incidence and prevalence of ALS in the \n     United States;\n       (B) collect data important to the study of ALS;\n       (C) promote a better understanding of ALS;\n       (D) promote research into the genetic and environmental \n     factors that cause ALS;\n       (E) provide a means for patients to contact scientists \n     researching the environmental and genetic factors that cause \n     ALS as well as those engaged in clinical trials; and\n       (F) enhance efforts to find treatments and a cure for ALS.\n\n     SEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT.\n\n       Part P of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 280g et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 399O.

A bill to establish commissions to review the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding injustices suffered by European Americans, \nEuropean Latin Americans, and Jewish refugees during World War II; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I introduce the Wartime Treatment \nStudy Act. This bill would create two fact-finding commissions: one \ncommission to review the U.S. government's treatment of German \nAmericans, Italian Americans, and European Latin Americans during World \nWar II, and another commission to review the U.S. government's \ntreatment of Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi persecution during World War \nII. This bill is long overdue.\n  I am very pleased that my distinguished colleagues, Senators \nGrassley, Kennedy, Lieberman, Corzine and Wyden, have joined me as \ncosponsors of this important bill. I thank them for their support.\n  The victory of America and its allies in the Second World War was a \ntriumph for freedom, justice, and human rights. The courage displayed \nby so many Americans, of all ethnic origins, should be a source of \ngreat pride for all Americans.\n  But, as so many brave Americans fought against enemies in Europe and \nthe Pacific, the U.S. government was curtailing the freedom of people \nhere at home. While, it is, of course, the right of every nation to \nprotect itself during wartime, the U.S. government must respect the \nbasic freedoms for which so many Americans have given their lives to \ndefend. War tests our principles and our values. And as our nation's \nrecent experience has shown, it is during times of war and conflict, \nwhen our fears are high and our principles are tested most, that we \nmust be even more vigilant to guard against violations of the \nConstitution or of basic freedoms.\n  Many Americans are aware of the fact that, during World War II, under \nthe authority of Executive Order 9066, our government forced more than \n100,000 ethnic Japanese from their homes into internment camps. \nJapanese Americans were forced to leave their homes, their livelihoods, \nand their communities and were held behind barbed wire and military \nguard by their own government. Through the work of the Commission on \nWartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians, created by Congress in \n1980, this shameful event finally received the official acknowledgement \nand condemnation it deserved. Under the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, \npeople of Japanese ancestry who were subjected to relocation or \ninternment later received an apology and reparations on behalf of the \npeople of the United States.\n  While I commend our government for finally recognizing and \napologizing for the mistreatment of Japanese Americans during World War \nII, I believe that it is time that the government also acknowledge the \nmistreatment experienced by many German Americans, Italian Americans, \nand European Latin Americans, as well as Jewish refugees.\n  The Wartime Treatment Study Act would create two independent, fact-\nfinding commissions to review this unfortunate history, so that \nAmericans can understand why it happened and work to ensure that it \nnever happens again. One commission will review the treatment by the \nU.S. government of German Americans, Italian Americans, and other \nEuropean Americans, as well as European Latin Americans, during World \nWar II.\n  I believe that most Americans are unaware that, as was the case with \nJapanese Americans, approximately 11,000 ethnic Germans, 3,200 ethnic \nItalians, and scores of Bulgarians, Hungarians, Romanians or other \nEuropean Americans living in America were taken from their homes and \nplaced in internment camps during World War II. We must learn from our \nhistory and explore why we turned on our fellow Americans and failed to \nprotect basic freedoms.\n\n[[Page S7838]]\n\n  A second commission created by this bill will review the treatment by \nthe U.S. government of Jewish refugees who were fleeing Nazi \npersecution and genocide. We must review the facts and determine how \nour restrictive immigration policies failed to provide adequate safe \nharbor to Jewish refugees fleeing the persecution of Nazi Germany. The \nUnited States turned away thousands of refugees, delivering many \nrefugees to their deaths at the hands of the Nazi regime.\n  As I mentioned earlier, there has been a measure of justice for \nJapanese Americans who were denied their liberty and property. It is \nnow time for the U.S. government to complete an accounting of this \nperiod in our nation's history. It is time to create independent, fact-\nfinding commissions to conduct a full and through review of the \ntreatment of all European Americans, European Latin Americans, and \nJewish refugees during World War II.\n  Up to this point, there has been no justice for the thousands of \nGerman Americans, Italian Americans, and other European Americans who \nwere branded ``enemy aliens'' and then taken from their homes, \nsubjected to curfews, limited in their travel, deprived of their \npersonal property, and, in the worst cases, placed in internment camps.\n  There has been no justice for Latin Americans of European descent who \nwere shipped to the United States and sometimes repatriated or deported \nto hostile, war-torn European Axis powers, often in exchange for \nAmericans being held in those countries.\n  Finally, there has been no justice for the thousands of Jews, like \nthose aboard the German vessel the St. Louis, who sought refuge from \nhostile Nazi treatment but were callously turned away at America's \nshores.\n  Although the injustices to European Americans, European Latin \nAmericans, and Jewish refugees occurred fifty years ago, it is never \ntoo late for Americans to learn from these tragedies. We should never \nallow this part of our Nation's history to repeat itself. And, while we \nshould be proud of our Nation's triumph in World War II, we should not \nlet that justifiable pride blind us to the treatment of some Americans \nby their own government.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Wartime Treatment \nStudy Act. It is time for a full accounting of this tragic chapter in \nour nation's history.\n  I ask that the full text of the Wartime Treatment Study Act be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1354\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Wartime Treatment Study \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) During World War II, the United States successfully \n     fought the spread of Nazism and fascism by Germany, Italy, \n     and Japan.\n       (2) Nazi Germany persecuted and engaged in genocide against \n     Jews and certain other groups. By the end of the war, \n     6,000,000 Jews had perished at the hands of Nazi Germany. \n     United States Government policies, however, restricted entry \n     to the United States to Jewish and other refugees who sought \n     safety from Nazi persecution.\n       (3) While we were at war, the United States treated the \n     Japanese American, German American, and Italian American \n     communities as suspect.\n       (4) The United States Government should conduct an \n     independent review to assess fully and acknowledge these \n     actions. Congress has previously reviewed the United States \n     Government's wartime treatment of Japanese Americans through \n     the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of \n     Civilians. An independent review of the treatment of German \n     Americans and Italian Americans and of Jewish refugees \n     fleeing persecution and genocide has not yet been undertaken.\n       (5) During World War II, the United States Government \n     branded as ``enemy aliens'' more than 600,000 Italian-born \n     and 300,000 German-born United States resident aliens and \n     their families and required them to carry Certificates of \n     Identification, limited their travel, and seized their \n     personal property. At that time, these groups were the two \n     largest foreign-born groups in the United States.\n       (6) During World War II, the United States Government \n     arrested, interned or otherwise detained thousands of \n     European Americans, some remaining in custody for years after \n     cessation of World War II hostilities, and repatriated, \n     exchanged, or deported European Americans, including \n     American-born children, to hostile, war-torn European Axis \n     nations, many to be exchanged for Americans held in those \n     nations.\n       (7) Pursuant to a policy coordinated by the United States \n     with Latin American countries, many European Latin Americans, \n     including German and Austrian Jews, were captured, shipped to \n     the United States and interned. Many were later expatriated, \n     repatriated or deported to hostile, war-torn European Axis \n     nations during World War II, most to be exchanged for \n     Americans and Latin Americans held in those nations.\n       (8) Millions of European Americans served in the armed \n     forces and thousands sacrificed their lives in defense of the \n     United States.\n       (9) The wartime policies of the United States Government \n     were devastating to the Italian Americans and German American \n     communities, individuals and their families. The detrimental \n     effects are still being experienced.\n       (10) Prior to and during World War II, the United States \n     restricted the entry of Jewish refugees who were fleeing \n     persecution and sought safety in the United States. During \n     the 1930's and 1940's, the quota system, immigration \n     regulations, visa requirements, and the time required to \n     process visa applications affected the number of Jewish \n     refugees, particularly those from Germany and Austria, who \n     could gain admittance to the United States.\n       (11) Time is of the essence for the establishment of \n     commissions, because of the increasing danger of destruction \n     and loss of relevant documents, the advanced age of potential \n     witnesses and, most importantly, the advanced age of those \n     affected by the United States Government's policies. Many who \n     suffered have already passed away and will never know of this \n     effort.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to enhance the adoption of health information \ntechnology and to improve the quality and reduce the costs of \nhealthcare in the United States; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, no matter who we are, where we live or which \nParty we belong to, one thing we have in common is that all of us have \nbeen and will again be patients under the care of a health professional \nwho we may, or may not, have visited before for treatment.\n  If we have already established a relationship with the doctor who is \nabout to treat us, our problems will either be minimized, or will not \nexist. But, if this is our first experience with a physician or a \nspecialist, how can we be certain that he or she has all the \ninformation that is necessary to prescribe a course of treatment and \nbegin our care?\n  These are the kind of thoughts that run through every patient's mind \nas we sit in the waiting room, wondering if the high tech equipment \nthat surrounds us is also reflected in our physician's access to our \nlab reports and previous examinations. In other words, is there any way \nfor our doctors to get to know us, before we've even set foot in their \nexamining room?\n  It's ironic that we live in a world where the latest news, sports and \nweather can make their way from the either side of the world to our \ncomputers and television sets as it happens. Our financial information \nis kept by our banks and is updated continuously throughout the day and \nis available to us almost instantaneously. Our medical records, \nhowever, are still kept the old fashioned way, on paper, and filed \naway. It is a tedious system, built the old fashioned way, because \nthat's the way it was always done. Well, I am here to announce that the \ntime has come to move to a newer, faster and more reliable system. \nImagine a medical network that will reduce errors, help to lower costs \nand improve the quality of care we receive, all at the same time, by \nproviding a treating physician with the information he needs \nimmediately at the point of care. Is it possible--yes! Then why hasn't \nit happened yet?\n  Why is our medical system surging ahead in the kinds of technology \nthat are available to diagnose and treat disease, when, at the same \ntime, it is falling further and further behind in the creation of \nelectronic medical records and the ability to share that information \nwith health care providers who need that material to make what can all \ntoo often be life and death decisions?\n  Clearly, something has to change when I can carry a fob on my key \nchain that provides my local gas station owner with instant access to \nmy credit information so I can buy fuel for my car, but providing \naccess to my medical records to my doctor is a much longer and tedious \nprocess. This needs to change and it needs to change now.\n  We can all see how the information revolution has had a dramatic \nimpact on virtually every industry in the United States. Its ability to \npromote efficiency has helped to reduce costs and increase \neffectiveness wherever it has been applied. It is now time to bring \nthat technology to bear on our healthcare system.\n  At present, healthcare expenditures are growing faster than the \noverall economy. In 2003, we spent more than $1.7 trillion on \nhealthcare. By 2014, that number is expected to reach $3.1 trillion. \nClearly we need to find ways to increase the efficiency of our health \ncare system and reduce the costs associated with it.\n  We have all heard it said that, when it comes to our health care \nsystem, you can't maintain the current standards of quality and control \nor reduce costs at the same time. While the implementation of a health \ninformation technology system may not dramatically reduce costs, it \nwill help move us further down the road of controlling costs.\n  If we could manage a quick trip to the future, and pay a visit to the \ndoctor's office when a health information technology system is put in \nplace, we would see some dramatic changes have been made in the ability \nof our doctor to diagnose, treat and provide warnings of current and \nfuture medical problems.\n  In that future, when I arrived at my new doctor's office I gave the \nnurse at the front desk my key fob. She took a moment to swipe it past \ntheir computer access link. It is soon downloading my medical \ninformation and compiling a ``health report'' that focuses on any \ntrends that are developing as the previous results of my examinations \nare charted and compared.\n  Then, as I sit in the waiting room, my physician is already \nconsulting those records and monitoring my current and previous test \nresults which are presented to him in the form of a graph that he has \npulled up on his computer screen. With the simple swipe of a mechanical \nkey my future doctor has\n\n[[Page S7841]]\n\nbeen able to unlock my complete medical history, and examined the \nresults of all the tests I had taken over the years, regardless of \nwhere I had received care.\n  If my doctor was concerned about my cholesterol level, for example, \nhe or she could pull up a complete history of blood tests that will \nenable my physician to track my blood chemistry and note any changes in \nmy cholesterol level over the years.\n  Later, if my doctor considers writing a prescription for a new drug \nor medication, he will have the ability to first view all medications I \nam currently taking in order to make an informed decision regarding any \npotentially dangerous interactions or adverse side effects that might \noccur as a result of the new prescription.\n  Such a system will enable doctors to spend less time gathering \ninformation and quizzing patients about past health problems and spend \nmore time listening to patients and ensuring their health care needs \nare met.\n  President Bush and Secretary of the Department of Health and Human \nServices Michael Leavitt have made their support for this clear. They \nrecognize that the increased use of health information technology has \nthe potential of saving this country billions of dollars that are now \nspent on duplicative tests, unnecessary inpatient admissions, and the \ncosts associated with adverse drug effects. Some estimates suggest \nthat, when an information technology system is established and put into \noperation, for each dollar we spend on this new technology we will save \nas much as four dollars in reduced costs. In a system with such high, \nincreasing costs every dollar we can save is magnified.\n  Fortunately, this is not something that will have to wait for someday \nuntil it is technologically possible and practical. There are already \nmedical pioneers in the field who are putting the tools together and \nworking on the network that will be needed to provide for rapid and \ncomplete transmission of our medical history when it is needed. One of \nthese innovators currently lives in my home State of Wyoming, in Big \nPiney, in fact.\n  The story of Dr. William Close is quite a remarkable one. With a wide \nand varied background that includes his love for the outdoors and a \ntaste for classical music, Dr. Close has spent his life ensuring that \nthe latest possible technologies were being used to address the health \ncare needs of people all over the world.\n\n  Prior to settling down in Wyoming, Dr. Close spent 16 years in Africa \nbattling the illnesses and dealing with the medical problems faced by a \nnation with a large population of patients, and not enough doctors to \ngo around. His first year there he was one of only three doctors in a \n2,000-bed hospital.\n  It was during those days that Dr. Close determined to find a way to \nbring the tools of modern technology to the diagnosis and treatment of \ndisease. Faced with such a huge patient population, he needed a tool \nthat would make the compiling of information and its interpretation \neasier.\n  His work led to the creation of a unique software that enabled a \ndoctor to input a series of symptoms and come up with a possible \ndiagnosis. It turned out to be such a valuable tool that it was able to \nbe used on Palm Pilots, which made it an invaluable program for use on \nour Navy subs.\n  Upon his return to the United States he continued to work on the \ndevelopment of his computer application so he could track a patient's \nmedical history over several visits, rather than focus on each \nappointment as a unique set of data. That enabled Dr. Close to spot \nproblems before they became serious and to treat trends before they \nbecame life threatening.\n  Dr. Close has now logged more than 50 years of medical practice and, \nalthough he's officially retired, he still finds time to see patients \nin his office. He still makes house calls, too. That's a rare thing in \nmost States, but a welcome part of life in Wyoming. He continues to \nwork at what he calls his ``gentle, limited practice'' as he continues \nto provide an example for other health care providers and health \ninformation systems on how to maximize health care choices and \ntreatments for his patients by getting to know the needs of his \npatients, by tracking their past history so he can help create a plan \nthat will minimize a patient's risk for future health problems.\n  These are the kinds of things that are possible, if we commit to \nworking together with our nation's health care providers to establish a \nnetwork of information that will address the needs of the people of our \ncountry. I have been pleased to work with my ranking member on the HELP \nCommittee, Senator Kennedy, and the chair and ranking member of the \nFinance Committee, Senators Grassley and Baucus, on this and other \ncomplementary legislation that will promote the use of health \ninformation technology today, not tomorrow. We have been putting a \nconsiderable amount of time and effort into the crafting of these bills \nto ensure that they will increase efficiencies, make our health care \nsystem more effective and responsive, and provide better care to us all \nas patients.\n  I mention the effect our bills will have on individuals because, as \nwith most changes to our health care system, how well the system will \nwork is ultimately determined by how well it works for those who rely \non it.\n  For most Americans, their first and primary concern is the privacy of \ntheir records. That is an important provision of the bill and we have \nincluded strong language to ensure the privacy and security protection \npatients were guaranteed under HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability \nand Accountability Act, are preserved. As that medical oath says so \nwell, first, do no harm.\n  At present, most of our medical records are kept by well meaning \nphysicians who, unfortunately, are known for having illegible \nhandwriting. Some of their handwriting is worse than my own. A \ncomputerized record will eliminate that problem and provide clear, \neasily read and interpreted medical data to those who will need it to \nprescribe a course of treatment.\n  As with most things, there will be a great deal of concern about the \nsystem's cost and the availability of funds to pay for it. Our \nlegislation will award competitive, matching grants to healthcare \nproviders, states and academic programs to facilitate the purchase and \nenhance the utilization of qualified health information technology.\n  In the months to come, we will continue to encourage the \nparticipation of the private sector in this effort. They have asked \nfor, and I believe they deserve, a seat at the table when standards are \nbeing determined and policies are being implemented. There is no \nquestion that some of them are closest to the problem at hand and their \nexperience, ideas, and suggestions for innovation will be invaluable as \nwe pursue the implementation of this new technology nationwide.\n  Secretary Leavitt recently announced the formation of what he is \ncalling the American Health Information Community. He will chair this \n17-member public-private collaborative that will help facilitate a \nnationwide transition to electronic health records, including common \nstandards and interoperability, in a smooth, market-led way. I share \nhis support for such an approach and his efforts to make it a reality.\n  The implementation of this new technology will make the sharing of \nhealth information more efficient between doctors and health \nprofessionals. And, most importantly, it will help to make our health \ncare system more effective and provide better care to those who make \nuse of it. It will also help to begin the vital process of controlling \nhealth care costs, something we must set as a goal and begin to achieve \nin the time before us.\n  This is a vital step in that process. With it, we can continue to \nmake health care services more affordable and available. Without it we \nrun the risk of having the best health care system in the world, with \nfew among us able to afford taking full advantage of it.\n  I look forward to working with all my colleagues in the months ahead \nto ensure that meaningful health information technology legislation is \nsigned into law later this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S7842]]\n\n                                S. 1355\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, It is a privilege to join Senator Enzi, \nSenator Grassley, Senator Baucus and many other sponsors on this bill \nto modernize our health care system with information technology.\n  The United States has the best doctors and hospitals in the world, \nbut we will soon be left behind other industrialized nations if we fail \nto adopt modern technology. When enacted, this bill will be the first \nlegislation to address the glaring lack of such technology in U.S. \nhealth care. Modern information technology can transform health care as \nprofoundly as any medical discovery of the past, and the American \npeople deserve that transformation.\n  The Institute of Medicine estimates that as many as 98,000 Americans \ndie in hospitals each year because of medical errors--making it the \neighth leading cause of death in the United States. Elderly patients \nare prescribed improper medication in one out of every 12 physician \nvisits. Adult Americans receive recommended care only 55 percent of the \ntime. Nearly 30 percent of health care spending, $300 billion a year, \ngoes for treatments that may not improve health, are redundant, or are \neven wrong for the patient's condition. Medical experts agree that most \nof these shameful statistics could be drastically reduced by modern \ninformation technology in doctors' offices, hospitals, nursing homes, \npharmacies, clinical laboratories and public health departments across \nthe country.\n  It is not just quality of care that improves with use of Health IT--\nthe cost goes down as well. National health care spending now exceeds \n$1.7 trillion a year--and health spending and health insurance premiums \ncontinue to rise at rates much higher than general inflation. The \nFederal Government estimates that savings in the range of $140 billion \na year, close to 10 percent of total health spending, could be achieved \nthrough widespread adoption of health IT. These system-wide savings \nwould reduce insurance premiums by $700 a year for every family in \nAmerica.\n\n  Some States, including Massachusetts, are leading the way toward a \nfully interconnected health IT system, with cutting edge projects being \nconducted by organizations such as the\n\n[[Page S7847]]\n\nMassachusetts e-Health Collaborative, the Massachusetts Technology \nCollaborative, the New England Healthcare Institute and the Center for \nInformation Technology Leadership. But, we still have much to do.\n  Despite the obvious health benefit, most doctors and hospitals are \nnot using this technology or preparing to do so. In fact, only 10 \npercent of hospitals are using computerized prescribing. Another 20 \npercent of hospitals are currently installing them. That leaves 70 \npercent out. The United States ranks far below other industrial \ncountries on IT in healthcare--lower than 12 out of 15 European \nnations.\n  Part of the problem is the up-front cost of these systems. Doctors \nare not always confident that the system they invest in will be able to \ntalk to other parts of the overall system. We need rules and standards \nfor electronic data sharing to encourage doctors to accept them, as our \nbill proposes.\n  The legislation establishes a public-private partnership to create \nnational standards for health IT--a common language for doctors' \ncomputer systems to talk to each other. Targeted funding mechanisms \nwill help doctors and hospitals acquire the technology they need for \ntheir patients. Grants will be available for cases of special need, \nsuch as doctors practicing in underserved areas. Financial assistance \nwill also help establish regional health information technology \norganizations, such as networks of doctors, hospitals, health plans and \npharmacies. These networks will be a crucial testing ground to work out \nhow all parts of the health system can communicate to provide clinical \ninformation wherever and whenever it is needed.\n\n  The bill also creates a Federal-State public-private loan fund to \nmake loans available at low rates to help health care professionals to \nacquire the technology. The State fund will accept private sector \ncontributions from health plans and large systems that would benefit \nfrom having more doctors using the technology. Insurers and large \nhospitals stand to gain the most savings from IT, and should contribute \nto this national effort.\n  The bill will also help providers improve quality by establishing a \nBest Practices Center where IT users can learn from the experience of \nothers, and by funding new programs to train health professionals to \nuse the technology.\n  We have a responsibility to make the miracles of modern medicine \navailable to every American. Rising costs are crushing our health care \nsystem. Premiums are going through the roof. The ranks of the uninsured \ngrow every day. Families have to choose between health care and \ngroceries, rent, and college tuition. When millions of Americans \nstruggle to afford health care for their families, it is profoundly \nwrong to squander more than half a trillion dollars each year on \nobsolete administrative expenses. That's not the American dream. We can \nfind a better way.\n  Other nations are taking action to use this extraordinary technology \nto cut costs and save lives--but America lags behind. We can't continue \nto let the high cost of health care price American goods and services \nout of the global marketplace.\n  The need for this investment is urgent. In the words of Secretary \nLeavitt, ``Every day that we delay, lives are lost.'' The proposals we \nare introducing today will improve care, save lives and make health \ncare more affordable for every American.\n  I commend Senator Enzi, Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus for their \nleadership, and I look forward to working closely with all our \ncolleagues to see that these important proposals are enacted into law \nthis year.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I join several of my colleagues in \nintroducing the Better Healthcare Through Information Technology Act. \nThis bill represents a strong step forward in modernizing our health \ncare system and paving the way to greater efficiency and quality in the \ndelivery of care.\n  Health care costs are becoming an enormous drain on employers, \nemployees, and the Nation as a whole. More Americans are uninsured, and \npremiums for health insurance are increasing at an unsustainable rate \nof 20, 30, and even 40 percent per year. Health care reform is needed \nto address the huge concerns of the American people and our Nation's \nbusinesses. Indeed, the fact that companies like GM are losing \ncompetitiveness and laying off 25,000 workers, in part due to health \ncosts, is a strong sign that our current health care system is flawed.\n  Solving these challenges will require new, bold policy initiatives to \nmake health care coverage more affordable for employers, employees, and \nall Americans. Comprehensive efforts at change must be considered in \nour approach to health care reform. As a start, there are numerous \nimprovements that can--and should--be made to fully pull the industry \ninto the information age with the widespread adoption of information \ntechnology. It is unfortunate, but not surprising, that many of our \nNation's other systems, such as our banking systems, are decades ahead \nin providing a seamless national network facilitating nearly \ninstantaneous and universal access to information. It is high time for \nthis body to act to modernize our health system as well, for its \nadoption of IT systems has the promise to improve quality while \nsimultaneously reducing cost.\n  There are significant barriers to the adoption of IT by health care \nproviders, including often-prohibitive costs of capital expenditures \nneeded for hardware and software and a lack of uniform standards for \nthe electronic exchange of information. Systems are prohibitively \nexpensive for many physician practices and there is no guarantee of \ninteroperability with the system used at a local hospital, lab, or \npharmacy.\n  The Better Healthcare Through Information Technology Act addresses \nmany of these barriers. It codifies existing efforts by the government \nto spur the use of health IT. It creates a public-private collaborative \nto build consensus on a single set of standards. To ensure that these \nstandards will then be embraced, our bill requires Federal procurement \nof information technology, and data collection by Federal agencies to \ncomply with them.\n  A similar collaborative on a local scale already exists in Rhode \nIsland. The Rhode Island Quality Institute links providers, hospitals, \ninsurers, government, businesses, and the academic community in the \npursuit of improving health care quality. I commend the Rhode Island \nQuality Institute for its statewide efforts to make Rhode Island a true \nhealth care improvement ``learning lab,'' and I believe that the bill \nwe are introducing today will support these and similar efforts around \nthe country.\n  To do this, our legislation recognizes and aims to address the \nfinancing challenges faced by providers. The bill establishes a number \nof competitive grants and facilitates State loan programs that are \ndesigned to get qualified health IT systems in the hands of doctors, \nhospitals, and clinics. Other provisions, including modifications to \nFederal anti-kickback and Stark laws and the establishment of a toll-\nfree telephone number or Web site to assist physicians, will accelerate \nthe implementation and integration of health IT.\n  The combination of uniform standards, help for physicians to purchase \nhealth IT systems, and improved exchange of electronic information \nthrough a national system will ultimately move us toward a conversion \nto Electronic Medical Records. Records will seamlessly follow the \npatient and improve evidence-based medicine by allowing aggregate data \nto be used in the determination of best treatment practices. Decision \nsupport systems will provide doctors with the most up-to-date evidence-\nbased recommendations available.\n  Perhaps most importantly, though, the use of IT offers the hope of \nreducing the thousands of medical errors each year that add to both \nunnecessary pain and suffering and the cost of health care. \nComputerized Physician Order Entry, or CPOE, could alone bring enormous \nsavings to the health care system by reducing medication errors in \nhospitals and clinics.\n  Systemic errors such as these account for many of the medical errors \nidentified by the Institute of Medicine in their seminal study on this \ntopic that estimated up to 98,000 avoidable deaths from medical errors \neach year. It will take government action and investment to bring about \nthe technological sophistication and interoperability necessary to \nsubstantially reduce the incidence of these errors.\n\n[[Page S7848]]\n\n  I want to thank Senators Enzi, Kennedy, Dodd, and others for their \nefforts on this bill. I look forward to continuing to work with each of \nthem and the rest of my colleagues to bring our Nation's health system \ninto the 21st century.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Enzi, and Mr. \n        Kennedy):\n  S. 1356. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide incentives for the provision of high quality care under the \nmedicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Baucus in \nintroducing the Medicare Value Purchasing (MVP) Act of 2005. Senator \nBaucus shares my strong commitment to ensuring the vitality of the \nMedicare program for generations of beneficiaries to come. Two years \nago, we worked in a bipartisan manner to establish the first ever \nMedicare prescription drug benefit, to create new coverage choices \nunder the Medicare Advantage program, and to cover more preventive \nscreening tests. The Medicare Modernization Act transformed Medicare \nbenefits and choices.\n  Over the past 40 years, Medicare has made immeasurable differences in \nthe lives of our Nation's seniors and disabled citizens by providing \nbeneficiaries with access to care. The bill that we are introducing \ntoday will ensure that they continue not only to have that access, but \nalso have access to good care. Some folks might think I am saying that \nbeneficiaries don't receive good care today. Nothing could be further \nfrom the truth. I know that physicians, hospitals, nurses and other \nproviders across the country work every day to provide quality care. \nBut just like all Medicare beneficiaries have the same benefits, all \nMedicare beneficiaries should get the highest quality care possible. \nAnd today, that's just not the case; there is tremendous room for \nimprovement.\n  A May 2005 Commonwealth Fund review of more than four hundred studies \nand data sets painted a mixed picture on the quality of care received \nby Medicare beneficiaries. The analysis found that many improvements \nare occurring--breast cancer screening rates have tripled and many \npatients with diabetes get the tests they need to keep them healthy. At \nthe same time, the review showed that in some parts of the country, \nbeneficiaries get recommended treatments, such as immunizations, but in \nother parts they don't. They found that improvements in care for \nMedicare beneficiaries have not kept pace with improvements among other \ngroups. For example, between 1988 and 1994, the percent of forty-five-\nyear-olds to sixty-four-year-olds whose blood pressure was controlled, \nincreased from 33 percent to 40 percent. Among Medicare beneficiaries, \nit stayed the same--just 24 percent. They also zeroed in on the need to \nstrengthen programs to care for beneficiaries with a chronic illness. \nResearch shows that twenty percent of Medicare beneficiaries have five \nor more chronic illnesses. Caring for these beneficiaries accounts for \nnearly 70 percent of Medicare spending.\n  One of the study's most disturbing findings was the States with \nhigher spending per Medicare beneficiary tended to rank lower on \ntwenty-two quality-of-care indicators. According to the researchers, \nthis might reflect practice patterns that favor intensive, costly care \nrather than ``effective'' care. Simply stated, spending more, does not \nnecessarily translate into better quality care for beneficiaries. Of \nthe $300 billion Medicare dollars spent last year, I think it is safe \nto say that in many cases we--beneficiaries and taxpayers--did not get \nthe absolute best value. Not even close.\n  Why is that the case? In part, it is because of the way we pay for \ncare. I am sure that everyone remembers ``To Err is Human'' in which \nthe Institute of Medicine reported the startling fact that studies \nsuggest that up to 98,000 Americans die in hospitals each year from \nmedical errors. It was in headlines for months.\n\n  I would bet that not as many folks know about the IOM's follow-up \nreport, ``Crossing the Quality Chasm.'' In my opinion, that report is \nequally, if not more, important because it sets forth a wide-ranging \nstrategy to address the deficiencies in our health care system that \nundermine the delivery of high quality care. Among the IOM's chief \nrecommendations was a call to both public and private purchasers to \nexamine their current payment methods to remove barriers that currently \nimpede quality improvement, and to build stronger incentives for \nquality enhancement.\n  The IOM specifically recommended that payment methods should provide \n``fair payment for good clinical management.'' Providers also need to \nbe able to share in the benefits of quality improvement. Consumers and \npurchasers need opportunities to recognize quality differences and to \nuse quality information when making health care decisions. In simplest \nterms, we need to better align financial incentives to help promote \nquality and to achieve better value. The Medicare Payment Advisory \nCommission (MedPAC) has issued similar recommendations.\n  Today, Medicare pays the same amount regardless of quality of care. \nSome people would argue that in fact, the current Medicare payment \nsystem rewards poor quality. For example, if a patient suffers a \ncomplication from subpar hospital care and ends up back in the same \nhospital to treat that complication, Medicare will pay the hospital for \nthe patient's rehospitalization. On the other hand, if a hospital \nfollows best practices of care and helps patients avoid complications \nthat could require a rehospitalization, well, that hospital doesn't get \nanything. The hospital that provides lower quality care to the \nbeneficiary gets another payment. The hospital that provides higher \nquality care to the beneficiary gets nothing.\n  Over time, this perverse situation could disadvantage the hospital \nthat delivers higher quality care to beneficiaries because it will get \nless revenue, which could compromise its ability to compete against \nother hospitals. This situation just does not make sense; neither to \nme, nor should it to beneficiaries. Providing lower quality care can \nlead to greater revenue, while providing higher quality care can \npenalize providers financially. It is the exact opposite of what we \nwant and need for Medicare and beneficiaries. Of course, our Nation is \nblessed with millions of dedicated and qualified health care providers \nwho care deeply about the quality of care they provide to their \npatients. What we have is a systemic failure of Medicare payment \nsystems to reward quality and provide the incentives to invest more in \nhealth care information technology and other efforts to improve health \ncare quality. This bill creates the financial incentives that reward \nthose providers who deliver that quality care today, and to those who \nmake improvements where they are needed.\n  The MVP Act seeks to remedy this situation and to implement the IOM's \nand MedPAC's recommendations by creating quality payments under \nMedicare for physicians and other providers, hospitals, health plans, \nskilled nursing facilities, home health, and end stage renal disease \nfacilities. Senator Baucus and I know that it is a pretty ambitious \nstrategy. We also recognize that this substantial departure from \ncurrent payment practices cannot and should not happen overnight. \nCareful consideration of which quality measures that the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) should use in making quality-based \npayments will take some time. Providers will play a significant role in \ndetermining which measures to use. This is important--we need to make \nsure that the measures are valid and reliable. In addition, providers \nwill need some time to become more proficient in collecting and \nreporting quality data for payment purposes.\n\n  The MVP Act builds on the small step made in the MMA which \nestablished reporting incentives in its early years. Under the MMA, \nhospitals that report ten quality measures receive a full payment \nupdate, those that don't report, receive a smaller update. This \napproach has been successful. In 2005, 99 percent of hospitals reported \nthe data and CMS has seen improvements in quality among the \nparticipating hospitals. Under the MVP Act, using the data from these \nreporting years, CMS will give providers an idea of where they stand on \nquality before quality payments will begin. This will allow providers \nthe chance to fine tune their quality practices and data reporting\n\n[[Page S7849]]\n\ncapabilities before payments will be determined based on a specific \nprovider's quality measures.\n  For each provider group and facility, as well as Medicare Advantage \nplans under our legislation, CMS will then begin to make quality \npayments from a pool that initially will equal one percent of their \nMedicare payments. Over five years, quality payments will increase to \ntwo percent of total payments. Payments will be awarded for meeting \nperformance thresholds and to those who demonstrate a level of \nimprovement specified by CMS. This approach recognizes that we need to \noffer incentives to a broad base of providers--providers who perform \nwell today deserve recognition; those that might not be performing \nwell, but have improved, also should be recognized. Finally, CMS will \nreport publicly on how various providers, facilities, and plans do with \nrespect to quality. This information will help empower beneficiaries \nwhen making their health care decisions and when making informed \nchoices.\n  Our bill recognizes that the private sector has made a lot of \nprogress in developing and adopting quality measures. There are several \nvalue-based purchasing projects underway around the country. We don't \nwant to reinvent the wheel--we want to build on these initiatives. \nThese private projects, along with its own projects, can help inform \nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as it works out \ntechnical details to implement quality-based payments using the \nframework established by the MVP Act.\n  This framework is consistent with the thinking of CMS on quality-\nbased payments as expressed by Administrator Mark McClellan. It also is \nconsistent with principles endorsed today by more than twenty of the \nNation's leading consumer, employer, and labor organizations. In \nannouncing the principles, Peter Lee, president and CEO of the Pacific \nBusiness Group on Health and co-chair of the Consumer-Purchaser \nDisclosure Project stated, ``We must move beyond a system that is \nperformance-blind to one that rewards better quality and gives \nconsumers tools to make informed choices.''\n  Now some folks may think that Medicare shouldn't take on this issue--\nthat it might better for the private sector to do it alone. I \nrespectfully disagree with that view. Medicare is the single largest \npurchaser of health care in the Nation. The IOM in ``Leadership by \nExample'' expressed its opinion that Federal Government health care \nprograms can significantly influence how care is provided by the \nprivate sector. The Commonwealth Fund researchers share this view--that \nadopting quality payments in Medicare can influence the level of \nquality in all health care, not just care for the elderly.\n  And there's a lot of health care to be influenced. Our Nation spent \n$1.8 trillion on health care last year. Health care spending is \nexpected to reach more than 15 percent of the gross domestic product. \nBut just like in Medicare, we are not always getting the best value for \nthose dollars. That $1.8 trillion in spending translated to a 37th \nplace ranking for the United States compared to other countries around \nthe world, in quality, according to the World Health Organization \n(WHO). Spending more and more money without achieving commensurate \nimprovements in quality is simply wasteful and unsustainable.\n  Medicare is just one month shy of its fortieth anniversary--a \ntremendous milestone. It has positively affected the lives of millions \nof seniors and disabled citizens. We set a goal for ourselves forty \nyears ago--to improve access to care. Providers and policymakers came \ntogether to make that goal a reality. It is time for a new goal, a new \nchallenge--to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries and all Americans get \nthe best possible care and that as a nation, we get the highest value \nfor our health care dollars. The MVP Act of 2005 provides us with a \nroad map to live up to that challenge. I urge my colleagues to join me \nand Senator Baucus in advancing this important legislation.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of the ``Medicare \nValue Purchasing Act of 2005.''\n  This bill will establish a new program to link a portion of \nMedicare's reimbursement for health care services to the quality of \nthat care. This bill takes a crucial step towards improving the value \nof our health care dollar as well as the safety and quality of our \nNation's health care system.\n  Last week, I gave a statement in this Chamber about America's place \nin the world. I am proud of our Nation; I am proud of our enterprising \nspirit, our energy, our diversity, and the hope for a better future \nthat is inherent to our roots. I am proud of this country, but I am \ndisappointed in the state of our health care system and in the impact \nit is having on the lives of our fellow citizens, as well as on the \neconomy and ultimately on our place in the world. As I look to the \nfuture, I see a stronger America, but I know we must work hard to make \nsure that vision is realized.\n  We hear about the problem of increasing health care costs nearly \nevery day--in newspaper headlines and in casual conversations. Per \ncapita spending on health care in America is nearly 2\\1/2\\ times the \naverage in the industrialized world. We spend over $5,000 per person on \nhealth care, and premiums for employer-sponsored coverage are rising \nfive times faster than inflation.\n  With all this money going into health care, one might assume we had \nthe best health care in the world. But that assumption is wrong. \nDespite spending more per capita than any other developed nation, the \nWorld Health Organization ranks the United States 37th in health care \nquality. As many as 98,000 patients die each year as a result of \nmedical errors, and research has shown that in some cases more care, \nmore specialists, and more treatments, actually result in worse \noutcomes for the patient.\n  Costs are rising, we are not getting high-quality care for the \ndollars spent, and due to the nature of our health care system much of \nthis burden is borne by employers. For the first time, the Big Three \nautomakers are beginning to charge premiums and scale back benefits for \ntheir workers and retirees, because they can't afford the cost of \nhealth care. All told, GM estimates that they will spend about $6 \nbillion in 2005 on health care. This translates into $1,525 for every \nvehicle they sell. That is more than the company spends on steel.\n  By comparison, Toyota's health care costs are about $1,000 less per \nvehicle. It is not surprising, therefore, that a recent survey of \nbusiness leaders found that 65 percent of top Chief Financial Officers \nin the United States feel that it is very important for Congress to \naddress the cost of health care. Their European and Asian counterparts \ndid not cite the costs of health care among their top concerns.\n  No other industry tolerates the level of disrepair that can be found \nin the U.S. health care system today. Many of my colleagues in the \nSenate agree that in order to improve the system, we need to do more to \ncontrol health costs through efficient purchasing and the use of health \ninformation technology. In other words, we need to create a ``culture \nof efficiency'' in health care.\n  How do we do that? First, we need to begin building a health \ninformation infrastructure that can reach providers and patients \nnationwide, from Manhattan, NY to Manhattan, MT. We must take \naggressive steps to establish standards and policies around this \ninfrastructure, and to make initial investments in hardware, software, \nand training. I applaud my colleagues Senator Enzi and Senator Kennedy \nfor introducing important legislation on this topic today, the ``Health \nInformation Technology and Quality Improvement Act of 2005''.\n  Building a Health Information Infrastructure will facilitate the \nprovision of high-quality care. But we also must begin rewarding \nquality in the way we pay for health care. Today, Medicare payment \npolicies typically do not include mechanisms designed to encourage \nquality of care. Medicare does not distinguish between paying for care \nthat is necessary and that which might be unnecessary or inappropriate.\n   As a result, I worked with Senator Grassley to design a program that \nwill tie a portion of Medicare reimbursement for hospitals, physicians, \nhealth plans, renal dialysis facilities, and home health agencies to \nthe quality of care provided in these settings. Payment for these \nproviders, as well as for Skilled Nursing Facilities, would also be \nlinked to reporting data on\n\n[[Page S7850]]\n\nquality of care and, after the first year of the program, to making \nthis data available to the public.\n  The Medicare Value-Based Purchasing program would begin paying for \nvalue in the health care system--good care, better patient outcomes, \nevidence-based medicine, and increased transparency. We have learned a \nlot from programs such as this that have begun on a smaller scale in \nthe private sector, and we hope that taking this step forward in \nMedicare will drive the entire health care system toward a system of \nhigh-quality, high-value health care.\n  But designing a program like this one is not easy, and I want to be \nclear on this point: I don't believe Congress should determine how the \nquality of health care is measured. That is why my bill sets up a \nsystem of stakeholder involvement at every step in the development and \nimplementation of a Quality Measurement System for Medicare--in \ndetermining what measures of health care quality are appropriate for \neach provider group, in implementing a system of data collection and \nanalysis, and in updating the measurement system in accordance with \nchanging science. Providers, payers, patients, and many other groups \nare the key experts who should be involved in the details of a health \ncare quality system--not Congress.\n  But it is our job to lay out some of the parameters for the system, \nand to provide the Secretary of Health and Human Services with the \nauthority to follow them and create this new program. It is also our \njob to oversee such a program once it is enacted and implemented. Over \nthe last year or so, we have met with provider groups, consumer \norganizations, researchers and policy experts, and many of the \nindividuals who have built and participated in private-sector programs \nto drive quality improvement in health care.\n  As I mentioned, our bill sets up a process by which a quality \nmeasurement system is developed in consultation with stakeholders and \nis uniquely tailored for the different groups of providers who \nparticipate in Medicare. This system should measure the quality of \nhealth care in a variety of ways, looking at processes of care, health \ninformation technology infrastructure, patient outcomes, patient \nexperience of care, efficiency of resource use, and equity. For some \ngroups of providers, only a very few measures of health care quality \nwill be available when the program begins. These providers should not \nbe penalized for that, but rather rewarded for reporting and improving \nthe quality of the care they provide according to those measures. We \nmay start small in some cases, but we can get the ball rolling.\n  The bill sets up a two-phase approach to quality improvement. In the \nfirst phase, the annual update to a provider's reimbursement is tied to \nreporting data on quality of care. This data would be on the measures \nincluded in the Medicare Quality Measurement System which has been \ndeveloped by the Secretary with stakeholder involvement. Some \nproviders--such as hospitals, Medicare Advantage Plans, and renal \ndialysis facilities, are already reporting data on quality of care to \nMedicare and might move more quickly to the second phase of the \nprogram.\n  In the second phase, those providers who report data on quality of \ncare to the Secretary will be able to participate in value-based \npurchasing, where a portion of total payments to participants in each \nprovider group is taken to form a quality pool. The funds in this pool \nare then reallocated to award providers who demonstrate high-quality \ncare, or who show that they are improving. In theory, this sets up a \nsystem in which all providers could receive money back out of the \npool--in essence it is a system that will ``raise all boats.'' \nFollowing the recommendation of the Medicare Payment Advisory \nCommission, the portion of payments tied to quality in this second \nphase will be 1 percent in the first year of the program for each \nprovider group, and will increase to 2 percent over five years.\n  In addition to setting up this program, the ``Medicare Value \nPurchasing Act of 2005'' includes additional measures to facilitate \nquality improvement in the health care system, such as a provision to \nreduce the legal barriers to health IT adoption that are present in the \nFederal anti-kickback and Stark laws.\n  It also includes several studies to look more closely at the true \ncosts of health care, and the benefits--both human and financial--that \ncan be gained from improving quality. The information generated by \nthese studies will be critical in moving forward with value-based \npurchasing, allowing us to more accurately predict the program-wide \nsavings from efforts to improve quality. Given that the Medicare Part A \nTrust Fund faces insolvency in 2020--decades earlier than Social \nSecurity--identifying these savings will be critical to preserving \naccess, to care for Medicare beneficiaries and adequate reimbursement \nfor providers.\n\n  Senator Grassley and I set out to write a bill that would address \nvalue-based purchasing, set up a system of measuring quality of care in \nMedicare, and encourage the adoption of health information technology. \nWe set out to write a bill that, in concert with the bill introduced by \nSenators Enzi and Kennedy would create a roadmap to a ``culture of \nefficiency'' in health care.\n  That means that our bill does not put new money on the table to \nreward health care quality, and it does not fix the problems that \ncurrently exist with the physician payment system or with reimbursement \nupdates to renal dialysis facilities. But nor does it mean that we are \nblind to these issues. Indeed, I know that sustained cuts to the \nphysician fee schedule, which will take effect if current law is not \nchanged--are not sustainable.\n  I want to work with physicians and practitioners to find a \nsustainable solution to the problems with the physician fee schedule, \nand I want to work with the renal dialysis community to make sure that \nreimbursement is adequate so that facilities--especially those in \nunderserved areas--can keep their doors open. But I also ask these \nproviders to work with me to move Medicare in the right direction--\nultimately, better quality and value means better health care, better \ncoverage, and a stronger system for all.\n  Finally, I believe that quality improvement efforts should extend \nbeyond Medicare, into the Medicaid and SCHIP programs, and into the \nprivate sector. Currently, programs at the State level have found ways \nto improve quality and find efficiencies through health information \ntechnology use in Medicaid. Our bill includes State government health \nprogram representatives in the process of developing the Quality \nMeasurement System because we believe they have important perspective \nto share, and also because we believe that quality improvement policies \nare equally important for their programs. I look forward to working \nwith Chairman Grassley on a bill to address quality of care in the \nMedicaid and SCHIP programs later this year.\n  I want to thank my colleagues Chairman Grassley, Chairman Enzi, and \nSenator Kennedy, as well as their able health care staff, for their \ntireless work on this legislation. We feel passionately about this \nissue because it matters to all of us. We all want to ensure that the \nbest care possible is provided. We know how hard health care providers \nwork for their patients, and we believe they should be rewarded for \nthat work. And we believe this issue should be advanced in the Congress \nas soon as possible.\n  As I said, I have a vision of a stronger America. I envision a health \ncare system in which quality and value are rewarded, in which \ninnovative health information technology is accessible to all, in which \ndata systems that can exchange crucial patient information to save \nlives and prevent mistakes, and in which American companies are not at \na competitive disadvantage in the world because of health care costs. I \ncall on my colleagues to support the important steps toward that vision \nthat will be taken under the pieces of this legislation introduced \ntoday.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Durbin, \n        Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Schumer).\n  S. 1357. A bill to protect public health by clarifying the authority \nof the Secretary of Agriculture to prescribe performance standards for \nthe reduction of pathogens in meat, meat products, poultry, and poultry \nproducts processed by establishments receiving inspection services and \nto enforce the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) \nSystem requirements,\n\n[[Page S7851]]\n\nsanitation requirements, and the performance standards; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Meat and \nPoultry Pathogen Reduction Act of 2005. This legislation, commonly \nknown as Kevin's Law, is dedicated to the memory of 2-year-old Kevin \nKowalcyk, who died in 2001 after eating a hamburger contaminated with \nE. coli O157:H7 bacteria. Passage of this bill is vital because on \nDecember 6, 2001, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld and expanded \nan earlier District Court decision that removes the Department of \nAgriculture's authority to enforce its Pathogen Performance Standard \nfor Salmonella. The 5th Circuit's decision in Supreme Beef v. USDA \nseriously undermines the strong food safety improvements adopted by \nUSDA in its 1996 Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point and Pathogen \nReduction (HACCP) rule.\n  In 2003, there was another court case that calls into question USDA's \nauthority to enforce basic sanitation standards. A company called \nNebraska Beef sued USDA after the Department tried to shut down the \nplant for numerous sanitation violations. USDA settled the case because \nit feared losing yet again in court and having another vital piece of \nits authority struck down.\n  According to the 5th Circuit's opinion in the Supreme Beef case and \nthe settlement in the Nebraska Beef case, today, there is nothing USDA \ncould do to shut down a meat grinding plant that insists on using low-\nquality, potentially contaminated trimmings. These decisions seriously \nundermine the new meat and poultry inspection system.\n  The HACCP rule recognized that bacterial and viral pathogens were the \nforemost food safety threat in America, responsible for 5,000 deaths, \n325,000 hospitalizations and 76 million illnesses each year according \nto the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. To address the \nthreat of foodborne illness, USDA developed a modern inspection system \nbased on two fundamental principles.\n  The first was that industry has the primary responsibility to \ndetermine how to produce the safest products achievable. Industry had \nto examine their plants and determine how to control contamination at \nevery step of the food production process, from the moment a product \narrives at their door until the moment it leaves their plant.\n  The second, even more crucial, principle was that plants nationwide \nmust reduce levels of dangerous pathogens in meat and poultry products. \nTo ensure the new inspection system accomplished this, USDA developed \nPathogen Performance Standards. These standards provide targets for \nreducing pathogens and require all USDA-inspected facilities to meet \nthem. In theory, facilities failing to meet a standard are shut down \nuntil they create a corrective action plan to meet the standard.\n  So far, USDA has only issued one Pathogen Performance Standard, for \nSalmonella. The vast majority of plants in the U.S. have been able to \nmeet the new standard, so it is clearly workable. In addition, USDA \nreports that Salmonella levels for meat and poultry products have \nfallen substantially. Therefore the Salmonella standard has been \nsuccessful. The Supreme Beef and Nebraska Beef decisions threaten to \ndestroy this success because they restrict USDA's ability to penalize \nmeat and poultry plants that violate a pathogen standard.\n  The other major problem is we have an industry dead set on striking \ndown USDA's authority to enforce meat and poultry pathogen standards. \nEver since the original Supreme Beef decision, I have spent untold \nhours trying to find a compromise that will allow us to ensure we have \nenforceable, science-based standards for pathogens in meat and poultry \nproducts. I have introduced bills to address this issue and I have \nworked with industry leaders trying to reach a reasonable compromise.\n  However, despite repeated attempts to address industry concerns, \nindustry has continually backtracked and moved the finish line. Many \ntimes, I have made changes in my legislation to address their \n``pressing'' concern of the moment only to have them come back and say \nwe hadn't gone far enough. We have to look out for the consumers of \nmeat and poultry so our children, our families are not put at increased \nrisk of getting ill or dying, because some in the industry want to \nbacktrack on food safety.\n  I plan to seek every opportunity to get this language enacted. I \nthink it is essential, both to ensuring the modernization of our food \nsafety system, and ensuring consumers that we are making progress in \nreducing dangerous pathogens.\n  I hope that both houses of Congress will be able to act to pass this \nlegislation without delay. The effectiveness of our meat and poultry \ninspection system and the public's confidence in it are at stake.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in \ncosponsoring the Meat and Poultry Pathogen Reduction and Enforcement \nAct, also referred to as Kevin's Law. Foodborne disease is a very \nserious concern for American consumers. According to CDC estimates, 76 \nmillion illnesses, 325,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths occur \neach year in the United States from foodborne diseases; sadly, the \nmajority of these fatal incidents involve children.\n  Barbara Kowalcyk, a constituent of mine, has been a true pioneer in \nfighting to protect Americans from the harmful effects of food \npathogens. Mother to 2\\1/2\\-year-old Kevin Kowalcyk, Barbara's \ndedication stems from personal tragedy. Barbara went through what no \nmother should have to go through; she watched in agony as the life \nfaded out of her little boy. Kevin died from an E. Coli infection \nbefore he even had the chance to step foot into a kindergarten \nclassroom.\n  Eager to ensure that no other parent suffers as she has, Barbara has \nbecome a thoughtful advocate for tougher food-safety laws. She has \nworked with me personally on the issue, and through her involvement \nwith STOP, Safe Tables Our Priority. Barbara has been instrumental in \neducating policy makers about the threat of foodborne diseases such as \nE. Coli and Salmonella. Barbara's testimony in front of the Committee \non Review of the Use of Scientific Criteria and Performance Standards \nfor Safe Food at the National Academy of Sciences helped the NAS write \nits 2003 report Scientific Criteria to Ensure Safe Food. Barbara \nrealizes that these diseases are preventable, that we have technology \nand understanding to improve the safety of America's meat and poultry, \nand it is high time that we do it.\n  Kevin's Law grants the USDA enforcement authority to enhance the \nregulatory structure for food safety. It includes key provisions that \nwill allow the USDA to conduct scientific surveys to identify the \nfoodborne pathogens that represent the largest threat to our public \nhealth and to set and update pathogen reduction standards to reduce the \npresence of these pathogens in meat and poultry. I applaud Senators \nSpecter and Harkin for their leadership on this issue, and I thank \nBarbara Kowalcyk for her commitment to keeping American consumers safe \nfrom dangerous food products.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 1358. A bill to protect scientific integrity in Federal research \nand policymaking; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Restore \nScientific Integrity to Federal Research and Policymaking Act. I thank \nmy House colleagues Henry Waxman and Bart Gordon, who introduced the \noriginal legislation in the House of Representatives. I also thank my \ncolleague, Senator Lautenberg, who is an original co-sponsor of this \nlegislation.\n  This bill prohibits censoring or tampering with government science \nand protects government scientists who blow the whistle on abuses.\n  Thousands of scientists--including 48 Nobel Laureates--have come \nforward to express their concerns that science has been manipulated or \nsilenced by the Bush Administration.\n  We learned a few weeks ago, for example, that a White House lawyer \nwith no scientific credentials had been revising government scientific \nreports on climate change to systematically weaken conclusions on \nglobal warming.\n  In May, the New York Times reported that the southwestern regional\n\n[[Page S7852]]\n\ndirector of the Fish and Wildlife Service instructed scientists on his \nstaff to ignore the latest genetic data when determining protections \nfor endangered species.\n  In 2002, a professor invited to join an NIH advisory committee was \ncalled and asked for his views on a number of political issues, \nincluding whether he supported abortion rights and whether he had voted \nfor President Bush. The professor--who had not voted for President \nBush--was not appointed to the committee.\n  These are disturbing examples of the intrusion of politics into \nscience. We rely on science to give us objective facts, not political \nspin. The Restore Scientific Integrity Act will help protect science \nfrom political interference.\n  The Act prohibits Federal employees from obstructing or censoring \nfederally funded scientific research and from disseminating scientific \ninformation known to be false or misleading.\n  The legislation prohibits the use of political litmus tests when \nappointing experts to serve on scientific advisory committees and \nstrengthens protections against conflicts of interest.\n  The bill extends whistleblower protections to federal employees who \nreport allegations of political interference with science.\n  The bill establishes that peer review processes should be established \nby science-based agencies, not by the Office of Management and Budget.\n  And, the legislation directs the White House Science Advisor to \nprepare annual reports on scientific integrity in the federal agencies.\n  These are common sense provisions that help protect government \nscience from political interference. I ask my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SESSIONS (for himself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Inhofe, and Mr. \n        Isakson):\n  S. 1362. A bill to provide for enhanced Federal enforcement of, and \nState and local assistance in the enforcement of, the immigration laws \nof the United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Homeland \nSecurity Enhancement Act of 2005. I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nCraig and Senator Inhofe, who cosponsored an earlier version of the \nbill in the 108th Congress, and who are original sponsors of this \nyear's legislation. Our bill takes the lead in encouraging a culture of \ncooperation among all levels of immigration law enforcement--Federal, \nState, and local--it seeks to build an immigration law enforcement \nsystem that is inclusive of all law enforcement officers, has adequate \ndetention bedspace, uses unified databases for information sharing from \none level of law enforcement to another, and has adequate detention \nbedspace.\n  These elements are a necessary foundation for any future \ncomprehensive immigration reform and I am pleased that the need for \nthis foundation was recently recognized by Senators Kyl and Cornyn in \nthe release of the enforcement principles of the immigration bill they \nare currently drafting. Changes in substantive immigration law are \nsurely needed, but unless an effective enforcement mechanism is \nincluded, the new rules will also collapse under a rising tide of \nillegality.\n  More than 15 years of service as a U.S. Attorney in Alabama and then \nas Alabama's Attorney General--as well as my current role on the \nImmigration, Border Security, and Citizenship Subcommittee--have taught \nme that the involvement of State and local law enforcement will be a \ncritical part of any new and successful immigration enforcement scheme. \nEstablishing an effective partnership between the 700,000 State and \nlocal law enforcement officers who patrol our streets every day and the \nsmall number of Federal immigration officers will be a test of our \nNation's will to establish an effective and enforceable legal scheme \nfor immigration.\n  I care very deeply about the ability of State and local law \nenforcement to voluntarily aid the federal government in the \nenforcement of immigration law. As a result, I also care very deeply \nabout tearing down barriers to that voluntary assistance. The need for \nthis voluntary assistance has only grown stronger over the last year \nand a half, since I first introduced this legislation in the Senate. \nOver the course of that time we have heard about the need to reform our \nimmigration laws to create a system that is as enforceable as it is \ngenerous and workable. Creation of an enforceable immigration system \nwill undoubtedly require increased manpower, streamlined information \nsharing, and bedspace to hold those we apprehend.\n  This legislation targets all three of these essential enforcement \ncomponents, and will go a long way toward fixing our broken immigration \nenforcement system--the system that is currently allowing people to \nremain in the U.S. for indefinite time periods, regardless of how they \ncame here.\n  Let me be clear, this bill is not about the commandeering of State \nand local police forces or about forcing them to dedicate resources \ntoward immigration law enforcement when they have other priorities, it \nis simply about welcoming their assistance in the realm of immigration \nlaw enforcement if they choose to give it.\n  We know that Americans strongly value our heritage as a Nation of \nimmigrants. Americans openly welcome legal immigrants and new citizens \nwith character, ability, decency, and a strong work ethic. However, it \nis also clear that Americans do not feel the same way about illegal \nimmigration. The fact is that a large majority of Americans feel that \nState and local governments should be aiding the Federal Government in \nstopping illegal immigration.\n  A RoperASW poll published in March of 2003 titled ``Americans Talk \nAbout Illegal Immigration'' found that 88 percent of Americans agree, \nand 68 percent ``strongly'' agree, that Congress should require state \nand local government agencies to notify the INS, now ICE, and their \nlocal law enforcement when they determine that a person is here \nillegally or has presented fraudulent documentation. Additionally, 85 \npercent of Americans agree, and 62 percent ``strongly'' agree that \nCongress should pass a law requiring State and local governments and \nlaw enforcement agencies, to apprehend and turn over to the INS illegal \nimmigrants with whom they come in contact.\n  Those numbers speak volumes about the desires of the American \npopulation. It is important to note that these responses were collected \nin response to questions about requiring State and local immigration \nenforcement action. It is very likely that a poll on this bill, a bill \nthat is about voluntary State and local action, would yield even \nstronger support.\n  America's strength is based on its commitment to the rule of law. \nInscribed on the front of the Supreme Court Building just down the \nstreet are the words, ``Equal Justice Under Law.''\n  In the world of immigration laws, the current facade of enforcement \nthat holds no real consequences for law breakers is both dangerous and \nirresponsible. If the only real consequence of coming to this country \nillegally is a social label, then our immigration laws are but a \nbrightly painted sepulcher full of dead bones, for it is impossible to \nbe a nation governed by the rule of law, if our laws have no real \neffect on the lives of the people they govern.\n  Our illegal alien population was at a record high two years ago and \nthe numbers continue to climb. The lack of immigration enforcement in \nour country's interior has resulted in 8-12 million illegal aliens \nliving in the U.S. with another estimated 800,000 illegal aliens \njoining them every year--that is on top of the more than 1 million that \nlegally immigrate each year. These numbers make it easy for criminal \naliens and absconders to disappear inside our borders.\n  Of the 8-10 million illegal aliens present today, the Department of \nHomeland Security has estimated that 450,000 are ``alien absconders''--\npeople that have been issued final deportation orders but have not \nshown up for their hearings. An estimated 40,000 absconders join that \nnumber every year.\n  An estimated 86,000 of them are criminal illegal aliens--people \nconvicted of crimes they committed in the U.S. who should have been \ndeported, but have slipped through the cracks and are still here.\n  The next number is perhaps the most concerning--3,000 of the ``alien \nabsconders'' within our borders are from one of the countries that the \nState Department has designated to be a ``state sponsor of terrorism.''\n\n[[Page S7853]]\n\n  The number of illegal aliens outweighs the number of federal agents \nwhose job it is to find them within our borders by 5,000 to 1. The \nenforcement arm of the old INS, now called The Bureau of Immigration \nand Customs Enforcement, ICE, has just over 2,000 interior agents \ninside the borders. Leaving the job of interior immigration enforcement \nsolely to them will guarantee failure. If each interior agent \ninvestigated, arrested, prosecuted and deported an illegal alien every \nday, it would take almost 14 years to deport the current illegal alien \npopulation.\n  State and local police, a force 700,000 strong, are the eyes and ears \nof our communities. They are sworn to uphold the law. They police our \nstreets and neighborhoods every day. Their role is absolutely critical \nto the success of our immigration system.\n  For that critical role to be effective, a few very important things \nneed to happen: 1. State and local law enforcement officers need clear \nauthority to voluntarily act; 2. the NCIC Immigration Violators File \nneeds to contain all critical immigration information so that officers \nhave quick roadside access to critical immigration information; 3. \nFederal immigration officials have to take custody of illegal aliens \napprehended by State officers, they can not continue to ignore State \nand local requests for assistance; 4. the Institutional Removal Program \nhas to be expanded so that all criminal aliens are detained after their \nState sentences until deportation, instead of being released back into \nthe community just to be searched for by Federal officials at a later \ndate; and 5. critically needed Federal bed space has to be given to DHS \nso that the practice of ``catch and release'' can be ended and \neffective removal can begin.\n  The Homeland Security Enhancement Act that Senator Craig, Senator \nInhofe, and I are introducing today will do all of those things.\n  Let me tell you about a few of the problems in immigration \nenforcement that started my interest in this area and prompted me to \nauthor this bill, to push for the hearing on April 22 of 2004 in the \nSenate Judiciary Committee titled ``State and Local Authority to \nEnforce Immigration Law: Evaluating a Unified Approach for Stopping \nTerrorists'', and to author a law review article in the April 2005 \nissue of the Stanford Law and Policy Review titled ``The Growing Role \nfor State and Local Law Enforcement in the Real of Immigration Law.''\n  A few years ago, police chiefs and sheriffs in Alabama began to tell \nme that they had been shut out of the immigration enforcement system \nand that they felt powerless to do anything about Alabama's growing \nillegal immigrant population.\n  As I went to town hall meetings and conferences with police, I heard \nthe same story-- ``When we come across illegal aliens in our normal \ncourse of duty, we have given up calling because the INS tells us we \nhave to have 15 or more illegal aliens in custody or they will not even \ncome pick them up.''\n  Even worse, Alabama police were routinely told that the aliens could \nnot be detained until the INS could manage to send someone. They were \ntold they had to just let them go! They were being told this, even \nthough I believed that the legal authority of State and local officers \nto voluntarily act on violations of immigration law was pretty clear. \nIf there is any doubt that State and local officers have this \nauthority, Congress needs to remove that doubt which is exactly what \nthis bill will do.\n  Only two U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeal have expressly ruled on State \nand local law enforcement authority to make an arrest on an immigration \nlaw violation. In 1983, the Ninth Circuit, while not mentioning a \npreexisting general authority, held that nothing in Federal law \nprecludes the police form enforcing the criminal provisions of the \nImmigration and Naturalization Act. Gonzales v. City of Peoria, 722 \nF.2d 468 (9th Cir. 1983).\n  The Tenth Circuit has reviewed this question on several occasions, \nconcluding squarely that a ``state trooper has general investigatory \nauthority to inquire into possible immigration violations.'' United \nStates v. Salinas-Calderon, 728 F.2d 1298, 1301 n.3 (10th Cir. 1984). \nAs the Tenth Circuit has described it, there is a ``preexisting general \nauthority of state or local police officers to investigate and make \narrests for violations of Federal law, including immigration laws.'' \nUnited States v. Vasquez-Alvarez, 176 F.3d 1294, 1295 (10th Cir. 1999).\n  Again, in 2001, the Tenth Circuit reiterated that ``state and local \npolice officers [have] implicit authority within their respective \njurisdictions 'to investigate and make arrests for violations of \nFederal law, including immigration laws.''' United States v. Santana-\nGarcia, 264 F.3d 1188, 1194 (citing United States v. Vasquez-Alvarez, \n176 F.3d 1294, 1295).\n  None of these Tenth Circuit holdings drew any distinction between \ncriminal violations of the INA and civil provisions of the INA that \nrender an alien deportable. It appears that the Ninth Circuit started \nthe confusion regarding the distinction between civil and criminal \nviolations in Gonzales v. City of Peoria by asserting in dicta that the \ncivil provisions of the INA are a persuasive regulatory scheme, and \ntherefore only the Federal Government has the power to enforce civil \nviolations. See Gonzales v. City of Peoria, 722 F.2d 468 (9th Cir. \n1983).\n  This confusion was, to some extent, fostered by an erroneous 1996 \nopinion of the Office of Legal Counsel, OLC of the Department of \nJustice, the relevant part of which has since been withdrawn by OLC.\n  Why was the Federal agency responsible for interior immigration \nenforcement telling my police chiefs in Alabama to let illegal aliens \ngo free?\n  To be fair, ICE still does not have the manpower or detention space \nto take custody and detain all illegal aliens. With less than 20,000 \nappropriated detention beds, ICE tells us over and over again that they \ndo not have the bed space to detain all the illegal aliens that they \napprehend; instead, they are forced to give first priority to detaining \nthe worst of the worst individuals such as convicted felon aliens.\n  It is shocking to me that even though we know that detention is a key \nelement of effective removal, we do not even detain all illegal aliens \nthat have been convicted of crimes for removal. Last February, in a \nreport titled ``The Immigration and Naturalization Service's Removal of \nAliens Issued Final Orders'' the Department of Justice Inspector \nGeneral found that 87 percent of those not detained before removal \nnever get deported. Even in high risk categories, the IG found that \nonly fractions of non-detained violators are ever removed-- 35 percent \nof those with criminal records and 6 percent of those from ``state \nsponsors of terrorism.'' These percentages have not changed since 1996, \nwhen the last IG report issued on the ability to remove aliens found \nthat 89 percent of aliens with final deportation orders that are not \ndetained are never removed.\n  Just this month, during a joint hearing of the Judiciary Committee \nImmigration and Terrorism Subcommittees titled ``The Southern Border in \nCrisis: Resources and Strategies to Improve National Security'' we \nlearned that in some jurisdictions such--as Harlingen Texas--`` no \nshow'' rates for immigration hearings are as high as 98 percent. Those \nnumbers speak for themselves about our efficiency in the realm of \nimmigration enforcement. The American people deserve better, \nthey deserve to know that our laws will be enforced instead of ignored \nwithout consequence.\n\n  But we can not lay all the blame on DHS--they can only detain illegal \naliens that they have space to detain. We know that DHS is using all of \nthe bed space that they have and that it is not enough they \nconsistently tell us that they are releasing people that should be \ndetained because there is no more room. The Homeland Security \nEnhancement Act would add critical bed space DHS needs to fulfill its \nmission of interior enforcement.\n  The third problem that was brought to my attention and motivated my \ndesire to introduce this bill, is the inadequate way we share \nimmigration information with State and local police. We have databases \nfull of information on criminal aliens and aliens with final \ndeportation orders, but that information is not directly available to \nState and local police. They have to make a special second inquiry to \nthe immigration center in Vermont just to see if an illegal alien is a \nwanted by DHS.\n  The Hart Rhudman Report, ``America Still Unprepared--America Still In \nDanger,'' found that one problem America still confronts is ``700,000 \nlocal and State police officials continue to operate in a virtual \nintelligence vacuum, without access to terrorist\n\n[[Page S7854]]\n\nwatchlists.'' The first recommendation of the report was to ``tap the \neyes and ears of local and State law enforcement officers in preventing \nattacks.'' On page 19, the report specifically cited the burden of \nfinding hundreds of thousands of fugitive aliens living among the \npopulation of more than 8.5 million illegal aliens living in the U.S. \nand suggested that the burden could and should be shared with 700,000 \nlocal, county, and State law enforcement officers if they could be \nbrought out of the information void.\n  Without easy access to immigration database information, and with ICE \nunwilling to come and identify every suspected illegal alien, State and \nlocal police can not quickly and accurately identify who they have \ndetained and who they will be releasing back into the community if they \nfollow ICE's instruction to ``just let them go.''\n  State and local police are accustomed to checking for criminal \ninformation in the NCIC, National Crime Information Center, database, \nwhich is maintained by the FBI. They can, and routinely do, access the \nNCIC on the roadside when they pull over a car or stop a suspect. An \nNCIC check, which takes just minutes, includes information about \nindividuals with outstanding warrants. Even fugitives that use false \nidentification can be identified on the roadside through use of the \nNCIC when, as is often the case, a police officer has access to an \ninstant fingerprint scanner in his car.\n  Separate from the NCIC, ICE operates the Law Enforcement Support \nCenter, which makes immigration information available to State and \nlocal police, but requires a second additional check after NCIC that \nmost State and local police either don't know about or don't have the \ntime to perform.\n  The ability of the NCIC to convey immigration information to State \nand local police is not being fully utilized. To date, the Immigration \nViolators File of the NCIC contains just over 150,000 entries and only \n39,000 of those are alien absconders. This file should be greatly and \nrapidly expanded. At the very least, the NCIC should contain \ninformation on all illegal aliens who have received final orders of \ndeparture, all illegal aliens who have signed voluntary departure \nagreements, and all aliens who have had their visas revoked. In truth, \nthe NCIC should contain information on all violations of immigration \nlaw.\n  If State and local police are not accessing the immigration \ninformation we have worked hard to make available, we must find a way \nto get the information to them, through systems they are used to using. \nOur bill will get information to them through the system they are \nalready using--the NCIC.\n  Our bill will ensure that when an NCIC roadside check is done on an \nindividual pulled over for speeding, police will know immediately if \nthe individual has already been ordered to leave the country, has \nsigned a legal document promising to leave, has overstayed their visa, \nor has had their visa revoked.\n  Understanding the value of getting immigration information to State \nand local police comes from understanding that they are the ones who \nwill come into contact with the dangerous illegal aliens on a day-to-\nday basis.\n  Three 9/11 hijackers were stopped by State and local police in the \nweeks proceeding 9/11. Hijacker Mohammad Atta, believed to have piloted \nAmerican Airlines Flight 77 into the World Trade Center's north tower, \nwas stopped twice by police in Florida. Hijacker Ziad S. Jarrah was \nstopped for speeding by Maryland State Police two days before 9/11. \nAnd, Hani Hanjour, who was on the flight that crashed into the \nPentagon, was stopped for speeding by police in Arlington, Virginia. \nLocal police can be our most powerful tool in the war against \nterrorism.\n  The D.C. Snipers were caught because of the fingerprint collected by \nlocal police. John Lee Malvo was identified when the fingerprint \ncollected from a magazine at the scene of the liquor store murder and \nrobbery in Montgomery, Alabama matched with the fingerprints collected \nby INS agents in Washington State. Had both law enforcement entities \nnot done their job by taking prints, it is possible that the identity \nof John Lee Malvo could have been a mystery for weeks longer.\n  In New York a 42-year-old woman sitting on a park bench with her \nboyfriend was dragged away and gang-raped by five deportable illegal \nimmigrants. Although 4 of the 5 had State criminal convictions and 2 \nhad served jail time, the INS claims they were never told about them--\nthus, they were not deported as the law requires.\n  56 illegal aliens were caught by State and local police, and \nconvicted of molestation and child abuse, long before ICE's ``Operation \nPredator'' found them living in New York and Northern New Jersey long \nafter they should have been deported. Of the 56 arrested, one had raped \nhis 10-year-old niece; another had sexually assaulted a 6-year-old boy; \none had raped his 7-year-old niece; and another had sexually assaulted \na 2-year-old.\n  The 9/11 hijacker cases, the D.C. sniper cases, and a multitude of \ncriminal alien cases clearly illustrate that our State and local police \nare the front lines of combating alien crime. To leave them out of the \nenforcement system, as we do now, eliminates our most effective weapon \nagainst criminal and terrorist aliens.\n  Many advocacy groups have vocally opposed the idea of State and local \nimmigration law enforcement over the course of the last year. They \nwould prefer that Congress not clarify this enforcement authority and \nthat we leave State and local officers in the dark.\n  Such groups contend that if immigration enforcement functions \nare performed by anyone other than Federal law enforcement officials, \nat least three negative consequences will ensue. First, they argue that \nState and local law enforcement entities will be handed an unfunded \nmandate and will be forced to enforce immigration law violations \nagainst their will and at their expense. Second, they argue that \nimmigrant communities, and the victims and witnesses that live within \nthem, will abandon their trust of, and cooperative partnership with, \nState and local law enforcement. And third, they argue that State and \nlocal law enforcement officers will abuse their inherent enforcement \nauthority to engage in racial profiling, harassment, and \ndiscrimination.\n\n  By making these claims, advocacy groups seek to maintain the \nineffective status quo for enforcement by local officers and thwart the \npossibility of an effective enforcement partnership between the Federal \nGovernment and the States.\n  The assertions of these advocacy groups are more myth than reality. \nThe first assertion is that the Federal Government is trying to burden \nState and local governments with an unfunded mandate. Every police and \nsheriff's department across the country must make choices every day \nregarding their enforcement priorities and resources. Certainly, their \nlegal authority and law enforcement goals are not served by being shut \nout of immigration law enforcement. It is a curious argument to say \nthat local police are helped by being denied their lawful powers to \nvoluntarily aid Federal immigration authorities. They should not be \nforced to ignore laws being broken in their presence and in their \ncommunities.\n  The second myth that anti-local enforcement advocates would have \npolicymakers believe is twofold: that a current cooperative partnership \nexists between local police and immigrant communities, and that \nimmigration enforcement will cause immigrant victims and witnesses of \ncrimes to abandon these cooperative partnerships. One advocacy group, \nthe American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, argues: ``These \ncombined measures will ensure that more immigrants will avoid contact \nwith law enforcement, putting entire communities at risk. For instance, \nimmigrant victims of crime will hesitate to report the crimes to the \npolice if they fear adverse immigration consequences from their contact \nwith the officials.'' Again, the argument fails because State and local \npolice retain their independent power to make prosecution choices. They \nare not required to report illegal alien victims or witnesses to \nFederal authorities or to investigate crimes they do not want to \ninvestigate. To make sure that this is understood, the authors of this \nbill have agreed to add language clarifying that nothing in the bill \nrequires State and local officers to report crime victims or witnesses \nto Federal immigration authorities.\n\n[[Page S7855]]\n\n  Perhaps the most egregious assertion made by opponents of effective \nenforcement is the allegation that State and local law enforcement \nofficers will use their inherent enforcement authority as a license to \nengage in racial profiling, harassment, and discrimination. \nSpecifically, the National Council of La Raza strongly opposes State \nand local law enforcement participation because it claims such \ninvolvement is ``likely to result in increased racial profiling, police \nmisconduct, and civil rights violations.'' This argument is curious \nbecause it would effectively grant more protection to non-citizens here \nillegally than to citizens, who are subject to arrest by State and \nFederal law enforcement officers for violations of Federal law. It is \ncurious logic to say that we trust our police to enforce laws against \ncitizens but not against non-citizens here illegally. State and local \npolice are trained to protect the civil rights of all types of suspects \nand defendants and they do so every day in this country. In Alabama, \nState troopers receive annual training on racial profiling. In New \nYork, the NYC Police Department Operations Order #11 strictly prohibits \nracial profiling in law enforcement actions. If Alabama and New York \nare consistent in how they instruct and train their State and local \npolice with regards to racial profiling, it is safe to assume that the \nrest of the Nation is as well.\n\n  Under this bill, State and local police will have to respect the \ncivil rights of illegal aliens the same way they respect the civil \nrights of all people against whom they enforce the law. State and local \npolice will continue to be held responsible for violations of civil \nrights; this bill does not change that fact.\n  The opposition will say that this bill is expensive; that it costs \ntoo much. It is always expensive to enforce the law. I do not think \nthis bill is overly expensive. We have made it as cost affordable as we \ncan by electing to use resources already available to us--facilities \nclosed down under the Defense Base Closure Realignment Act of 1990 and \nlaw enforcement officers across America already out on our streets \ndoing their jobs. Law enforcement is not an area where it pays to pinch \npennies. In immigration enforcement, it costs us too much not to \nenforce the law. It is time that Congress take responsibility for \nproviding DHS with the resources they need to do the job we have given \nthem.\n  When it comes to immigration enforcement in America, the rule of law \nis not prevailing. If we are serious about securing the homeland, we \nsimply must get serious about immigration enforcement.\n  It is time to talk about the big picture--time to be honest about \nwhat it will really take to fix our broken immigration system. In most \ncases, we don't need tougher immigration laws, we just need to utilize \nour existing resources and use some new resources to enforce the laws \nwe already have.\n  If State and local police are confused about their authority to \nenforce immigration laws, that authority needs to be clarified. This \nbill will do that. If State and local police cannot access immigration \nbackground information on individuals quickly enough, we should change \nthat. This bill makes that information more accessible through \nexpanding use of the NCIC. If DHS is not taking custody of illegal \naliens being apprehended by State and local police, we need to make it \npossible for them to do so. This bill will address the practice of \n``catching and releasing'' illegal aliens. If we do not have enough \ndetention space to hold people that break the law, then we need more \ndetention space. This bill gives DHS 50 percent more bedspace for \nimmigration enforcement. If illegal aliens are being released back into \nthe community after their prison sentences instead of being deported, \nwe need to fix the system that releases them. This bill will extend the \nInstitutional Removal Program to ensure that custody is transferred \nfrom the State prison to Federal officials at the end of the alien's \nprison sentence.\n  Once again I would like to thank Senator Craig and Senator Inhofe for \njoining with me to introduce this legislation, and I would like to \nthank Congressman Norwood for introducing companion legislation in the \nHouse.\n  It is imperative that we take critical steps toward regaining control \nof our borders and that we lay the enforcement foundation for necessary \nimmigration reforms. This bill is a critical step in the right \ndirection. I encourage my colleagues to study this bill and join us in \nworking to pass the Homeland Security Enhancement Act of 2005.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1362\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to prevent \ndividends received from corporations in tax havens from receiving a \nreduced tax rate; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to be joined by my two \nfriends and Finance Committee colleagues, Senator Jeffords and Senator \nKerry, in filing legislation to close a loophole in the 2003 tax cut \nbill. The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief and Reconciliation Act of 2003 \nprovided for lower rates of taxation on dividend income. Formerly, \ntaxpayers paid ordinary income rates on dividend income. Now, \nindividuals who receive dividends are taxed at either a 15 percent for \nupper-income taxpayers, or a 5-percent rate for lower-income taxpayers. \nFurther, in 2008, this lower rate becomes zero before the whole \nprovision expires in 2009.\n  The demand for lower rates was premised on the claim that dividend \nincome was subject to double taxation; that is, taxed once by the \ncorporate entity and then again by the shareholder. Assuming that is \nthe case, then if we are sure the corporate entity is not subject to \ntax, the dividend should not be afforded the special rate. In fact, we \nheard testimony today in the Taxation Subcommittee that corporations \nwith little or no taxes at the entity level really receive an \nadditional benefit from the dividend tax break.\n  Current law, however, allows dividends from ``qualified'' foreign \ncorporations to benefit from these lower rates if the company is based \nin a U.S. possession, or based in a country with which the U.S. has a \ntax treaty, or has stock which is traded on a U.S. stock exchange. \nSenator Jeffords, Senator Kerry, and I have become concerned that the \ndefinition of qualifying foreign corporations is overly broad and may \nencompass companies in tax haven countries with little or no tax \nsystem. Providing this special benefit for such companies simply \nbecause its stock is traded on a U.S. exchange does not meet with the \noriginal intent of the legislative change. Our bill would shut down \nthis loophole by modifying the ``stock exchange'' test to only allow \nthis special rate for companies based in countries with a comprehensive \nincome tax system. By doing this, we will address a current inequity \nbetween dividend-paying stocks and make sure that only stock of \ncompanies subject to tax at the corporate level enjoys this \npreferential rate.\n  With every tax bill we enact, it is important to review the \nprovisions from time to time to make sure the law works as intended. \nHere, I believe we have found a significant and unintended loophole. \nCertainly, as we debate whether to extend, expand, or eliminate these \npreferential rates, we should also be open to improvements in the \ncurrent law. I encourage my colleagues to join with us in working for \nsuch an improvement.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED:\n  S. 1364. A bill to amend part A of title II of the Higher Education \nAct of 1965 to enhance teacher training and teacher preparation \nprograms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Preparing, \nRecruiting, and Retaining Education Professionals, PRREP, Act to \nimprove education and student achievement through high-quality \npreparation, induction, and professional development for teachers, \nearly childhood education providers, principals, and administrators.\n  As Congress turns to the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, \nwe must ensure that educators receive the training and support \nnecessary to thrive in our Nation's early childhood programs, \nelementary schools, and secondary schools. Improving teacher quality is \nthe single most effective measure we can take to increase student \nachievement.\n  With the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act we took an important \nstep toward demanding that all of the Nation's children are taught by \nhighly qualified teachers. To meet the law's definition, teachers are \ngenerally required to hold a bachelor's degree, be fully certified by a \nState, and to demonstrate content knowledge of the subjects they teach. \nThe deadline is looming, and the States are struggling to get all of \ntheir teachers deemed highly qualified by the coming school year.\n  This struggle will not end at the initial deadline. Teacher turnover \nregularly drains schools of their most important resource, qualified \neducators. Higher standards for teacher credentials are essential, but \nat the same time make it even more challenging for schools to staff \ntheir classrooms. This is a critical moment for us to tackle persistent \nteacher attrition and to foment teacher retention. At the same time, we \nhave an opportunity to support the development of educators so they not \nonly have the credentials, but also the skills and training to be truly \neffective in the classroom. By strengthening the State, partnership, \nand recruitment grants in Title II of the Higher Education Act, my \nlegislation will accomplish both of these important goals.\n  Teacher attrition undermines teacher quality and creates teacher \nshortages. According to the National Commission on Teaching and \nAmerica's Future, one-third of beginning teachers leave the profession \nwithin 3 years, and nearly one-half leave within 5 years. In high \npoverty schools turnover rates are even worse--approximately one-third \nhigher than the rate for all teachers. A recent study in New York found \nthat teachers who leave are likely to have greater skills than those \nwho stay.\n  The Preparing, Recruiting, and Retaining Education Professionals Act \nfocuses recruitment activities where high teacher turnover and \nshortages exist, where students are having trouble meeting academic \nstandards, or where there is great difficulty demonstrating that \nteachers are highly qualified. The grants also allow funds for outreach \nto encourage recruitment in inner city and rural areas.\n  Teachers consistently cite lack of administrative support as a \nprimary reason for leaving a school and teaching altogether. My \nlegislation would create a year-long clinical learning experience for \nprospective teachers, and establish a three-year residency program for \nnew teachers that provides comprehensive induction. The legislation \nalso includes provisions to develop managerial skills among principals \nso they can provide the most effective instructional leadership and \nclassroom support for teachers during induction and beyond. Research \nconsistently shows that induction programs reduce the number of \nteachers who leave their schools or the profession. Comprehensive \ninduction programs can cut that number by half or more.\n  Furthermore, my legislation promotes professional development \nthroughout a teacher's career and strengthens teacher preparation \nprograms so that teachers will reach their maximum potential to \npositively affect student achievement. A focus on scientific knowledge \nof teaching skills and methods of student learning will equip teachers \nto understand and respond effectively to diverse student populations, \nincluding students with disabilities, limited-English proficient \nstudents, and students with different learning styles or other special \nlearning needs. The legislation also stresses the ability to integrate \ntechnology into the classroom, strategies to effectively use \nassessments to improve instructional practices and curriculum, and an \nunderstanding of how to communicate with and involve parents in their \nchildren's education.\n  My legislation further focuses on teaching skills and learning \nstrategies by including in the partnership grants academic departments \nsuch as psychology, human development, or one with comparable expertise \nin the disciplines of teaching, learning, and child and adolescent \ndevelopment. It also ensures that States hold institutions of higher \neducation and entities that provide alternative routes to State \ncertification equally accountable for preparing highly qualified \nteachers and\n\n[[Page S7859]]\n\nhighly competent early childhood education providers.\n  The State, partnership, and recruitment grants are currently funded \nat only $68 million a year--far too small of an investment for this \ncritical enterprise. The stakes are too high, not just in terms of \nmeeting the highly qualified requirements of No Child Left Behind, but \nfor real students in real classrooms. My bill significantly boosts this \nfunding, authorizing $500 million for these vital programs.\n  The PRREP Act is supported by a diverse array of education \norganizations, including the American Association of Colleges for \nTeacher Education, American Psychological Association, Council for \nExceptional Children, National Association of Elementary School \nPrincipals, National Association of Secondary School Principals, \nNational Association of State Directors of Special Education, National \nAssociation for the Education of Young Children, National Council of \nTeachers of English, National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, and \nNational PTA.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this essential endeavor by \ncosponsoring this legislation and working for its inclusion in the \nreauthorization of the Higher Education Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1364\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \ntax-free distributions from individual retirement accounts for \ncharitable purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I'm pleased to be joined by Senators \nSnowe, Kerry, Smith, and Schumer in re-introducing legislation we call \nthe Public Good IRA Rollover Act to allow taxpayers to make tax-free \ndistributions from their individual retirement accounts (IRAs) for \ngifts to charity. I think that the charitable IRA rollover approach in \nthis legislation, which has received strong support from the charitable \ncommunity, will encourage significant new giving.\n  As a Nation, we often look to a strong network of charities, large \nand small, to offer financial and other support to families and \nindividuals who need help when government assistance is unavailable. \nThat is why I think it's critically important for Congress to do \neverything we can to help encourage the work of worthy charities.\n  Unfortunately, Congress has tried but failed in the past several \nyears to pass major legislation that would be helpful to the Nation's \ncharities. This legislation has stalled, in part, because of the \nefforts of some in Congress to add controversial measures that \nundermine the bipartisan support needed to enact this kind of \nlegislation into law.\n  One of the non-controversial tax incentives included in the Senate's \nversion of that legislation is our measure that would permit \nindividuals to make gifts to charities from their IRAs without adverse \ntax consequences. I have previously described on the Senate floor that \ncharities are frequently asked by people about using their IRAs to make \ncharitable donations. However, I'm told that many donors decide not to \nmake a gift from their IRAs after they are told about the potential tax \nconsequences under current law.\n  The Public Good IRA Rollover Act would eliminate this obstacle. \nSpecifically, the bill we are introducing today would allow individuals \nto make tax-free distributions to charities from their IRAs at the age \nof 70\\1/2\\ for direct gifts and age 59\\1/2\\ for life-income gifts. \nThese changes to the Tax Code could put billions of additional dollars \nfrom a new source to work for the public good.\n  Tax-favored charitable IRA rollovers have previously garnered broad \nbipartisan support in both the House of Representatives and the U.S. \nSenate. In fact, the Senate-passed CARE Act in the last Congress \nincluded the provisions of our bill.\n  The Bush administration also supports charitable IRA rollovers. In \nhis FY 2006 budget submission, President Bush has proposed, once again, \nto allow individuals to make certain tax-free charitable IRA \ndistributions after age 65. While the President's charitable IRA \nproposal has merit, the Public Good IRA Rollover Act is superior in one \nimportant respect: By allowing tax-free life-income gifts from an IRA. \nLife-income gifts involve the donation of assets to a charity, where \nthe giver retains an income stream from those assets for a defined \nperiod. Life-income gifts are an important tool for charities to raise \nfunds, and would receive a substantial boost if they could be made from \nIRAs. But life-income gifts are not part of the administration's \nproposal. Again, the Public Good IRA Rollover Act permits individuals \nto make tax-free life-income gifts at the age of 59\\1/2\\.\n  When the Senate Finance Committee crafts charitable giving tax \nincentive legislation in the 109th Congress, I hope they will adopt, \nonce again, the IRA charitable rollover approach used in the Public \nGood IRA Rollover Act. The benefits of this approach are two-fold. \nFirst, the life-income gift provision in our bill would stimulate \nadditional charitable giving. The evidence also suggests that people \nwho make life-income gifts often become more involved with charities. \nThey serve as volunteers, urge their friends and colleagues to make \ncharitable gifts and frequently set up additional provisions for \ncharity in their life-time giving plans and at death. Second, this \napproach comes at little or no extra cost to the government when \ncompared to other major charitable IRA rollover proposals.\n  In closing, I urge my Senate colleagues to review and consider \ncosponsoring this bill. With your help, we can help enact into law tax-\nfree IRA rollover provisions that a senior official from a major \ncharity once said would be ``the single most important piece of \nlegislation in the history of public charitable support in this \ncountry.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALEXANDER (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. DeWine, and Mrs. \n        Clinton):\n  S. 1367.

Our legislation authorizes up to $25 million so that \nthe highly successful program, which began as a privately funded, non-\nprofit effort, can rapidly expand.\n  TFA was founded in 1990 by Wendy Kopp, a young woman who had just \ngraduated from Princeton. It served just six communities in that first \nyear. Today it serves 22, and hopes to keep growing. TFA raises more \nthan 75 percent of its operating budget through non-Federal sources, \nprimarily through philanthropic gifts in the communities it serves.\n  The results of this program have been notable, as reported in a study \nlast year by Mathematica Policy Research, an independent research firm: \n``Even though Teach for America teachers generally lack any formal \nteacher training beyond that provided by Teach for America, they \nproduce higher student test scores than the other teachers in their \nschools--not just other novice teachers or uncertified teachers, but \nalso veterans and certified teachers.''\n  Probably more exciting than the success of the program in teaching \nstudents is the impact it has had on its ``corps members.'' Teach for \nAmerica\n\n[[Page S7866]]\n\nisn't just for education majors, it's primarily there to attract highly \nsuccessful college graduates who wouldn't otherwise go into education. \nOf its 9,000 alumni, 60 percent are still involved in education today. \nThe 2005 National Teacher of the Year, Jason Kamras, a teacher here in \nWashington, DC, who was honored in a Rose Garden ceremony by President \nBush, is an alumnus of Teach for America. And my own education policy \nadvisor is also an alumna of the program.\n  So, in addition to providing better education for students in poorer \nschool systems, this program is creating a new cadre of highly talented \nand highly motivated individuals who now understand what it's like to \nteach in a classroom and who are dedicated to improving our education \nsystem. That's probably the greatest benefit of the program.\n  And that's why I'm glad to join the Senator from Nevada in \nintroducing this legislation to provide Federal funding to help TFA \nexpand to new communities and recruit even more corps members.\n  Teach for America is aiming to grow from 3,000 to 8,000 corps \nmembers, from 22 to 35 regional sites, and from 250,000 to 700,000 \nstudents by 2010. To reach these growth goals, the program must recruit \nmore than 4,000 new teachers each year by 2010, and it must grow its \ntotal annual budget from $40 million today to $100 million by 2010.\n  The legislation that Senator Reid and I offer today will not turn \nTeach for America into a Federal program, but it will supplement their \nprivately raised funds to help TFA attain their worthy goals. The bill \nprovides up to $25 million to that end. Interest by college graduates \nin TFA is very high--17,000 applied for the 2,100 teaching slots last \nyear. Additional funding will allow more of those 17,000 to serve \npoorer children in classrooms across the country.\n  In the upcoming issue of U.S. News and World Report, there is an \nexcellent article about Teach for America by David Gergen. I ask \nunanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  I hope other Senators will join with the Senator from Nevada and I in \nsupporting this important legislation. Teach for America has helped \nmore than 1 million students and is creating a highly talented pool of \nindividuals to advance our education system into the next century. \nProviding Federal support to this non-profit program will help it \nexpand not only to help more students, but also to create an even wider \nand stronger pool of talented individuals to advocate the best for our \nschools for decades to come.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the U.S. News & World Report, July 4, 2005]\n\n                        A Teacher Success Story\n\n                           (By David Gergen)\n\n       With tribal warfare spreading in politics, corporate \n     chieftains heading to jail, the news media sinking, and \n     casualties rising in Iraq, it's easy these days to be \n     discouraged. No wonder over 60 percent of Americans think the \n     country has swerved off track. But hold on. To lift your \n     spirits, just spend a little time with leaders of the younger \n     generation.\n       This spring on many college campuses, something absolutely \n     remarkable happened: Talented young people lined up by the \n     scores to teach lower-income kids in urban and rural public \n     schools. In years past, investment banks like Goldman Sachs \n     were the recruiting powerhouses at top campuses; this year, \n     they were joined by Teach for America, a program that \n     expresses the fresh idealism and social values of this new \n     generation.\n       At Yale, no fewer than 12 percent of the graduating \n     seniors--nearly 1 out of every 8--applied. At Dartmouth and \n     Amherst, some 11 percent did; at Harvard and Princeton, 8 \n     percent. Hundreds more signed up at Northwestern, Boston \n     College, the University of Texas, and the University of \n     California-Los Angeles. Altogether, over 17,000 seniors \n     applied for 2,100 openings.\n       A few words of background: Sixteen years ago, Teach for \n     America was merely an idea in a thesis by a Princeton senior, \n     Wendy Kopp. She thought the country needed an organization \n     modeled after the Peace Corps that would attract top college \n     graduates into classrooms with poor kids. With thesis in \n     hand, she bravely ventured out to raise money, find recruits, \n     and find school superintendents who would hire them. Kopp \n     experienced the bumps and detours of every new start-up, but \n     a year later, she had 500 recruits.\n       This summer, the newest class of teachers will enroll in a \n     five-week training institute to prepare them for the \n     classroom. In the fall, they will report for work at some of \n     the toughest public schools in America, classified by the \n     federal government as ``high need.'' Some 95 percent of their \n     students will be minorities. Each member of the program is \n     committed to two years of teaching, paid by the local school \n     systems at the same rate as other starting teachers; at the \n     end of their service, they may qualify for a $9,500 \n     scholarship for graduate study.\n       As you can imagine, skeptics have popped up all along the \n     way: professors at schools of education scoffing that college \n     graduates who haven't enrolled in formal teacher education \n     will never succeed in the classroom; cynics who say that \n     these are just a bunch of elitist kids punching their tickets \n     to make it into law or business school who will then turn \n     their backs on social reform. Well, the doubters just don't \n     get this young generation.\n       A year ago, Mathematica Policy Research found that students \n     of Teach for America recruits got better results in math and \n     the same gains in reading as did those of other teachers, \n     including veteran instructors. In math, the TFA students made \n     a month more progress than other students. The results partly \n     reflect the fact that 70 percent of Teach for America \n     volunteers come from among the nation's most highly rated \n     colleges, compared with fewer than 3 percent of other \n     teachers; the results also reflect the passion that these \n     volunteers bring to their work.\n       Dedicated to the cause. The 10,000 alumni of TFA have not \n     turned their backs after their service, either. The \n     organization says that nearly two thirds still work full time \n     in education, most in low-income communities. TFA alum Jason \n     Kamras, a math teacher in a Washington, D.C., public school, \n     was just named national teacher of the year. Two other \n     alumni, Mike Feinberg and David Levin, founded and now run \n     what is probably the most successful set of charter schools \n     in the country: the KIPP academies (Knowledge Is Power \n     Program). Started in Houston and New York, the academies have \n     become a network of 38 schools in low-income communities that \n     demand extra studies by students, balance that with \n     extracurricular activities like martial arts, music, chess, \n     and sports, and--guess what?--have achieved the largest and \n     quickest improvement in learning around the country. No fewer \n     than 25 principals in KIPP schools are alumni of Teach for \n     America.\n       What does all this mean? First, the nation owes a debt of \n     gratitude to Wendy Kopp. She represents the emergence of a \n     new breed of social entrepreneur, talented doers who are \n     unleashing their generation's innovation and idealism to \n     address long-standing social problems. Even as they struggle \n     for the resources to turn their visions into reality, the \n     success of Kopp and others shows that this has the makings of \n     a social movement.\n       But it also shows that the rest of us need to wake up and \n     see what we can do to help. It's time for the country to \n     embrace the national service movement with serious money--not \n     the cheap change we are putting today into AmeriCorps. It's \n     time to scale up nonprofits so that when 17,000 kids \n     volunteer, there are 17,000 openings. It's time, in short, to \n     recognize the greatness that lies in the next generation.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Alexander in \nintroducing this legislation authorizing Teach for America to recruit, \nselect, train, and support its national teacher corps in underserved \ncommunities.\n  This bill comes at a crucial time. Federal law now requires more from \nour teachers, yet we have dwindling resources to draw from.\n  Many local education agencies are finding themselves having to \nsupplement their teacher corps.\n  Clark County, NV, is the fifth largest school district in the \nNation--in the fastest growing State. As one can only imagine, the \ninflux of new residents has an incredible impact on our public works, \nespecially our schools.\n  Clark County's outgoing superintendent told me that the district \nspends close to $1 million annually for teacher recruitment efforts \nacross the country.\n  Clark County School District has made great strides in its commitment \nto reversing the trend of sagging high school graduation rates and \ncollege attendance by hiring nearly 2,000 new teachers a year to fill \nits classrooms.\n  But, last year, the school district did something that several other \nurban and rural districts around the country did: they partnered with \nTeach for America in order to augment their qualified teaching staffs.\n  Founded by Wendy Kopp, who conceived the idea for the program in her \nsenior thesis at Princeton, Teach for America recruits some of the \nNation's best college graduates to become teachers in low-performing \nurban or rural school districts for 2 years.\n  From the 500 college graduates who began teaching in its inaugural \nyear,\n\n[[Page S7867]]\n\nTeach for America has grown to more than 3,100 corps members teaching \nin 21 regions across the country.\n  Indeed, this highly selective program--in which only 2,000 out of \n16,000 applicants were accepted in 2003--has a powerful impact on the \ncommunities in which it serves.\n  This legislation authorizes Teach for America to receive $25 million \nto execute several activities related to teacher readiness, \nrecruitment, and placement. Reports are also required, citing the \nprogress of the Teach for America corps members.\n  I would not be Senator if it had not been for a couple of dedicated \nteachers. One teacher was Ms. Dorothy Robinson. Ms. Robinson pulled me \nout of class one day and said, ``Harry, I've watched your progress and \nI really think you should go to college and become a lawyer.''\n  I said, ``OK,'' and went back to class.\n  That is why I have dedicated myself at the Federal level to ensure \nthat Teach for America and Clark County have the resources they need to \ncontinue this partnership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/30/senate-section/article/S7867-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 185--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING \n                      REFORM OF THE UNITED NATIONS\n\n  Mr. SMITH (for himself and Mr. Nelson of Florida) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was:\n\n                              S.

Would it matter?\n  I am very disappointed we are not able to do what the Senate \nrequested and voted for just a few hours ago, even hours ago, after the \nAppropriations Committee, one floor below this Chamber, agreed \nunanimously that we stick by our number.\n  As a result we have done that. Again, the veterans have been \nshortchanged. I am disappointed. I don't in any way question the \nmotives of my distinguished friend from Idaho. I know he has the best \ninterests of the veterans at heart. But I don't know if the veterans \nunderstand that. I hope we can resolve this issue quickly. The veterans \ndeserve this.\n  Even though it is early Friday morning in the Eastern United States, \nit does not take away from the seriousness of what we are doing.
