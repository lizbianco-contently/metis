Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude that today I honor the life of a brave young man \nfrom Hammond. Jonathan Rojas, 27 years old, died on October 3 after \nbeing struck by a sniper bullet while on patrol in Baghdad. Jonathan \nrisked everything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our \nhearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  Jonathan spent several years in the workforce after graduating from \nHammond High School before enlisting. He had been due to return home to \nIndiana 2 months before he was killed but agreed to stay longer, \npromising his family in Hammond that he would be home in time for \nChristmas. Jonathan was remembered by his brother William as playful \nand warm hearted, when he said, ``We're going to miss him being \nhimself, doing stupid things, his company, having a brother, someone to \ntalk to.''\n  Jonathan was killed, while serving his country in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. He was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 17th Infantry Regiment, \n172nd Stryker Brigde Combat Team. This brave soldier leaves behind wife \nTasha Rojas, parents Jose and Catalina Rojas, brother William Rojas, \nand sister Isaura Rojas.\n  Today, I join Jonathan's family and friends in mourning his death. \nWhile we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take \npride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Jonathan, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Jonathan was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry. He was looking forward to civilian life and starting a family \nwith his wife Tasha. Today and always, Jonathan will be remembered by \nfamily members, friends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, \nand we honor the sacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Jonathan's sacrifice, \nI am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the \nfamilies of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we \ncannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living \nand dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor \npower to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember \nwhat we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This \nstatement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am \ncertain that the impact of Jonathan's actions will live on far longer \nthan any record of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Jonathan Rojas in the official \nRecord of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his \nprofound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I think \nabout this just\n\n[[Page S10824]]\n\ncause in which we are engaged and the unfortunate pain that comes with \nthe loss of our heroes, I hope that families like Jonathan's can find \ncomfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, ``He will swallow \nup death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all \nfaces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Jonathan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/09/senate-section/article/S10824-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING WILLIAM E. OSOS\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, It is with a heavy heart that I pay \ntribute to a true friend and Hoosier, William E. Osos. Bill, a former \ndirector for the United Auto Workers Region 3, passed away on October \n6th, leaving behind a loving family and thousands of Hoosiers who \nbenefited from his devotion to working men and women. My thoughts and \nprayers this week are with his wife Genevieve and their children and \ngrandchildren.\n  Bill was a man of courage and conviction, who did what was right \nregardless of the popularity at the moment. He served for 2 years in \nthe Navy during World War II. At home in Michigan City, Bill first \nbecame active in the UAW while working at Michiana Products Company. It \nwas the beginning of a commitment he would honor throughout his life. \nIn 1966, he was appointed an international representative of the union \nby UAW president Walter P. Reuther. He eventually was elected to be \ndirector of the union's Region 3 in 1984, a position he served in until \nhis retirement in 1992.\n  Bill's dedication to the working men and women of Indiana was \napparent to everyone who met him. He truly relished his role in leading \nthe fight for good jobs and good wages. In fact, many Hoosiers and UAW \nmembers could tell you that it is a role he continued well after his \nretirement. Even after moving from Indiana to Florida, Bill stayed \ninvolved in UAW work, always ready to help serve.\n  His work in Indiana meant so much to the thousands of UAW workers in \nour State, and I also owe Bill a personal debt of gratitude. When I was \nrunning for secretary of state in Indiana, we didn't have much of a \nDemocratic party organization, but we did have organized labor and the \nUAW, with Bill as Region 3 director. His support during my first \npolitical race was a strong foundation to build on, and with his help, \nI won that election. I went on to serve two terms as Indiana's \nGovernor, when together, we were able to give 30,000 of our workers \ncollective bargaining rights, more than half represented by the UAW.\n  I have had the privilege of knowing and working with many union \nleaders over the years, from the days I spent with my father on his \ncampaigns outside plant gates to my work as Governor and through today. \nBut Bill sticks out in my memory for his belief in the importance of \nhis work and his tireless fighting on behalf of working men and women.\n  Bill spent his life fighting for good jobs, affordable health care, \nand secure pensions--all the things that make up the American dream. We \nneed more people fighting that fight today, and we will miss Bill \ngreatly as we continue his efforts to ensure that every American who \nworks hard and plays by the rules can do right by his family.\n  Indiana and its people are better for his leadership. Bill was my \nfriend, and I will miss him. It is my honor to enter his name into the \nCongressional Record of the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/09/senate-section/article/S10824-2", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ETHAN SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 17-1\n\n Mr. THUNE.
