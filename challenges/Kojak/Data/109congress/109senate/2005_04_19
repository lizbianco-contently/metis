I yield to the coauthor of our amendment, the Senator \nfrom Arizona, Mr. Kyl.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 432\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, first I compliment my colleague from Idaho \nfor bringing to the Nation's attention a problem which does deserve \nconsideration, and that is how to both fulfill our need for workers in \nthis country for difficult labor that some Americans have not been \nwilling to perform and at the same time deal with the very difficult \nproblem of the status of illegal immigrants who are currently in the \ncountry and who have been relied upon by employers in the field of \nagriculture to perform some of this work.\n  Both the Senator from Georgia and I intend to work with the Senator \nfrom Idaho in the future to try to develop the very best kind of guest \nworker program we can to achieve the objective of providing matching, \nwilling employers and willing employees and at the same time doing it \nwithin the construct of the rule of law. We look forward to that debate \nat a later time.\n\n  Earlier in the debate on the supplemental appropriations bill, which \nis the legislation before us, the Senate adopted overwhelmingly a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution that we should not be trying to deal \nwith these immigration problems in this legislation. This bill is too \nimportant. It requires that we provide funding for our war efforts in \nIraq and Afghanistan. The reason it is called a supplemental \nappropriations bill is because it is supplemental to the regular \nprocess. It accounts for the fact that there are unforeseen \nexpenditures in the conduct of this war we have to fund and we have to \nget the money to our troops as soon as we possibly can.\n  With that in mind, the full Senate voted we should be deferring the \ndebate on these difficult and complicated issues such as immigration \nreform to a later date when we can take that up in the full \nconsideration it deserves and not delay important legislation such as \nthe funding of the war effort. We are already into the second week on \nthe supplemental appropriation for that purpose. We hoped to finish \nthis bill last Thursday.\n  I provide that as background to simply note this: We have two votes \nthis morning. The first is on an alternative proposal that has been set \nout by the Senator from Georgia and myself that would provide a way to \nmatch these willing employers and employees but to do so without \ngranting amnesty to illegal immigrants. We will then vote on a second \nalternative of the Senator from Idaho and the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The key point I want to make to my colleagues is if both of these \npropositions are defeated--and they both require 60 votes to pass under \nthe agreement--then we can move on to complete the work on the \nsupplemental appropriations bill and we might be able to finish that \nbill this week. In fact, hopefully, presumably, ideally, we will finish \nthat bill this week. There is no reason why we cannot do our work and \nfund our troops. However, if the Craig-Kennedy legislation were to \nreceive 60 votes, we are in for a tough time because that bill is then \nopen for amendment, and we are already aware of numerous amendments \nthat are going to be filed, all of which are going to delay \nconsideration of the supplemental appropriations bill.\n  Some of my colleagues signed on to this legislation before the bill \nwas actually printed or before they realized it contained amnesty. The \npoint I would make to anybody who is in that position is whether they \nsupport the Craig-Kennedy version or the Chambliss-Kyl version of guest \nworker legislation, it is not the time to be considering that \nlegislation. We voted already to not have that debate but rather to get \non to the supplemental appropriation bill. Therefore, anyone wishing to \nmove on should vote literally against the first vote we will have on \nChambliss-Kyl and the second vote on Craig-Kennedy. If either one of \nthem gets 60 votes, then we are in for a long time of debate on \nimmigration, with an awful lot of amendments on that subject and \ndelaying the time that we can get back to considering the supplemental \nappropriations bill.\n  Even though it argues against an affirmative vote on our proposition, \nfor\n\n[[Page S3867]]\n\nthose who are interested in moving on to the supplemental appropriation \nbill, frankly, the correct vote is a ``no'' vote on both of these \namendments.\n  Let me explain to my colleagues a second reason to vote ``no'' on the \nsecond vote and ``yes'' on the first vote. The first vote is Chambliss-\nKyl. What we have attempted to do in our guest worker legislation is \nprovide an expedited, streamlined, simplified way for employers to hire \nthe people they need in agriculture, something they are not able to do \ntoday. We have a law today, but they do not use it because it is so \ncumbersome, expensive, and time consuming. The idea is to make it more \nstreamlined so it will work.\n  In that respect, we think we have a much superior product and that is \nwhy I think the Farm Bureau supports our legislation, because they \nrealize farmers will actually use it. I am very concerned that they \nwould not use the Craig-Kennedy legislation because it has so many \nother things built into it that I believe would make it difficult, at \nleast as difficult to use as the current law.\n  I will cite one of the reasons now. Up to now it has been the law in \nthe United States that Legal Services Corporation does not represent \nillegal immigrants or illegal aliens. It represents Americans, people \nwho are here either on legal permanent residency status, green card \nstatus, or citizens. There is little funding available to begin \nrepresenting illegal immigrants and I am afraid the representation of \nAmerican citizens who are residents would significantly suffer if the \nLegal Services Corporation is now going to begin representing these \nillegal immigrants as is called for under the Craig-Kennedy \nlegislation. That represents a significant departure from current law \nand it certainly will make it more complicated for employers to use \nthat law.\n\n  I will move to the other point, because the primary question is \nwhether we want to embark on a road to granting amnesty to illegal \nimmigrants.\n  Folks on the other side will say it is earned amnesty, but it is \nstill amnesty by any name one wants to call it. It reminds me of that \nold saying, put lipstick on a pig and it is still a pig. The fact of \nthe matter is it is still amnesty and here is why specifically Craig-\nKennedy is amnesty.\n  Under section 101 of S. 359, an illegal alien shall--it is not \n``may'' but ``shall''--be given status after working, and then the \nperiods of time are laid out, but essentially in as little as 2\\1/2\\ \nweeks, one could accomplish the accumulated 3\\1/2\\-month labor period, \nbut a maximum of 3\\1/2\\ months, minimum of 2\\1/2\\ weeks. They then have \na legal status in the country. One year later, they get their green \ncard.\n  A green card is legal permanent residency, and I underline the word \npermanent. When one gets their card in this country, they have a status \nwhich enables them to live here for the rest of their life. Under \nexisting law, it enables them to do something else. They can also apply \nfor citizenship. They can apply to chain migrate their family into the \ncountry.\n  The point is that while that status should be available to anyone who \ndesires to immigrate to the United States, we believe it should be \navailable to people who abide by the law. We also do not discriminate \nagainst those who have violated the law and who seek to apply for this \nstatus. We simply urge that they not be given an advantage over those \nwho have done everything right, who have followed the law, applied for \nthe legal permanent residency status from their country of origin, and \nhave sought to get in line the same as everybody else. As the President \nsays, if one wants to come here and stay, they need to get in line with \neverybody else. They should not be given an advantage. That is what \namnesty is. When one is given an advantage over those who have \nconformed to the law, who have abided by the law, and one is given an \nadvantage because they violated the law, that is frankly a concept I \nthink most Americans would deem not only very unfair but getting on a \nvery slippery slope in this country where people who do it wrong, who \nviolate the law, have an advantage over those who are willing to do it \nright. That is not the American way and that is the key difference \nbetween the Craig-Kennedy legislation and the Chambliss-Kyl \nlegislation.\n  We say one can work here and continue to work here. In fact, we have \nthree different 3-year periods, one right after the other, in which one \ncan work in the United States. But we say if they seek to become a \nlegal permanent resident, as opposed to a legal temporary resident, \nthat permanent residency should require them to apply for it the same \nas everybody else. They have to go home, make the application--it takes \n1 year to do it--and then they have their green card. Once they get \ntheir green card, it is true they can apply for citizenship, but at \nleast they have to follow the rules. They have done it the same as \neverybody else and they have not gotten an advantage because they came \nhere illegally and stayed in this country illegally.\n  The final point I want to make is there is another provision of the \nCraig-Kennedy legislation which I do not understand. It has been \nalluded to by the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, and \nothers. It is a provision which actually attracts people who have \npreviously violated the law. They snuck in, they came into the United \nStates illegally, they illegally used documents to gain employment, \nthey have been employed illegally in the United States, and the fact of \nall of those illegal activities is what permits them to come back into \nthe United States. In other words, they have gone home for some reason, \nand if they can establish that they were here illegally, then they get \nto come back into the country legally. I don't know of anything that \nstands the law on its head more than that. Why would somebody try to \nabide by the law if they realized that, with counterfeit documents, \nthey can simply show up at the border and say, Hey, I worked in the \nUnited States illegally and I want to come back in now and get this new \nstatus you are creating for me.\n\n  It is a magnet not only for counterfeit and fraud but for people to \ncome back into the United States who are now not here illegally, \nclaiming that they have a right to do so on one basis and one basis \nonly--because they violated our law. It seems to me to be totally \nupside-down to grant legal status to people, to invite them into our \ncountry, on the basis that they violated our law when there are not \nenough visas to grant to people who are trying to do it legally.\n  This is amnesty, and it is wrong. What we are saying is there is a \nperfectly legal way to do this, to get all of the employers matched up \nthat we need. We have no cap on the number of people who can apply \nthrough our streamlined H-2A process. As many workers as we need, we \ncan get. I think that is why the Farm Bureau supports this. They know \nwhatever labor needs we have in this country, we can fulfill them \nthrough a legal process, and there will not be any magnet for illegal \nimmigrants to come to the country anymore.\n  To conclude, there are two reasons to vote against the Craig-Kennedy \nlegislation and one good reason to vote for the Chambliss-Kyl \nlegislation. The reason to vote against both, frankly, is that unless \nboth of these are defeated, we are going to be on this immigration \nissue for a long, long time. Who knows when we are going to conclude \nthe supplemental appropriations legislation? We are certainly not going \nto finish it this week again. This will be the second full week we have \nbeen on it.\n  Second, I don't think at the end of the day we are going to pass \nlegislation--through the Senate and House and have it signed by the \nPresident--that grants amnesty to illegal immigrants or invites illegal \nimmigrants back into the United States because of their illegal status. \nFor that reason, we suggest we have a better approach, an approach \nwhich can meet our labor needs but do so within the rule of law and \nwithout granting a reward to those who have violated our law.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will yield to the Senator from Nevada for \nthe purpose of the introduction of an amendment to the underlying bill. \nIt would not take time from me. Then I will claim the floor for a few \nmoments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 487\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN.

I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 432\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona has come up with \nsome fascinating and interesting explanations of why his is not and \nours is amnesty. By that I simply mean there are a lot of people who \nbelieve that if people have broken the law and that you grant them any \nforgiveness whatsoever, that is amnesty. But now, according to Mr. \nChambliss and Mr. Kyl, we have a whole new definition of why theirs is \nnot, even though they grant those who have broken the law a blue card \nto continue to stay and work. They say there is a difference.\n  You know, there really is not a difference in this respect. If I am \nnot amnestied by the Chambliss-Kyl amendment, there is no stretch of \nthe imagination that would suggest otherwise about the Craig-Kennedy \nbill. I do not believe our bill has amnesty, because I think when you \nask someone who has broken the law to pay back to society and to limit \ntheir rights, then recognizing that they have done so and allowing them \nto earn that legal status--and certainly that is what we do in the \nCraig-Kennedy bill. We demand, if you will, 360 days over 3 to 6 years \nin the field, working hard, so you gain the right to apply for a green \ncard. I do not call that amnesty; I call that hard-earned, labor-paid-\nfor, to get the ability to stay and work. You can have your own \nthoughts about amnesty, but nowadays I am finding out anyone can have \nhis or her own definition of amnesty. Amnesty is in the eye of the \nbeholder. The word is an epithet, like calling someone a communist.\n  In other ways, there is a very real difference between these two \napproaches. Let me outline it. We have 200-some-odd agriculture groups, \npart of a coalition of 509 groups, supporting our bill. It is very \nbipartisan. It is a significant reform of the H-2A program. It is not \njust crafted in the last minutes as a stopgap measure to block and \ndivide. It is not so narrowly crafted that it delivers almost no real \nbenefit. Most important, we say something that is fundamental to \nAmericans who are concerned that our border to the south is now out of \ncontrol and people are pouring over it. We say you had to be here last \nyear, working for 100 days last year, not just here on April 1 of this \nyear, like the other amendment. So regarding that problem we are all \nhearing about on our borders to the south, where people are pouring \nover, if they made it by April 1, the Kyl-Chambliss bill says: You get \na blue card. You can stay 3 years, 6 years, 9 years, and in 9 years, if \nyou are capable of developing your job into a supervisory position, you \ncan stay permanently.\n  That is not amnesty? Again, I think I have well established, no \nmatter who tries to interpret what amnesty is, that it is in the mind \nof the beholder.\n  The reason I am on the floor today and the reason we have been \nallowed to come to the floor is because in this particular bill we \nbecame germane by an action of the House. I know the Senator from \nArizona talks urgency. We have been 3 months producing an urgent \nsupplemental. It has been 3 months since the President asked us to \nrespond. That is not the fault of the Senate. The House took 2 of those \nmonths. The House turned this appropriations bill into an immigration \nbill. We can take a few more hours to discuss AgJOBS.\n  Can't we take a day and a half to solve what Americans believe is the \nNo. 1 problem in our country, or a problem that is in the top three, \nand that is uncontrolled immigration and uncontrolled borders? What we \nare trying to do with a segment of our economy and a segment of our \nworkforce that works predominantly in agriculture is to gain control of \nthe process, shape it, identify it, and stop the flood that is coming \nacross our borders.\n  Let me show you some of the work we have done. I think it better \nexplains to America the urgency of the problem. They hear the reports \non the borders. Now let's look at the statistics as to what we have \nbeen doing since 9/11.\n  The morning of 9/11, we woke up to a rude awakening, that America had \nslacked off way too long on its immigration laws and that we had 8 to \n12 million undocumented foreign nationals in our country--undocumented. \nThat meant that they were here, by definition, illegally. Most were \nhard working, and most are hard working. Most are law abiding. But some \nwere here to do us evil. Some were here to kill us. We found that out \nto our great surprise.\n  That was more than 1,300 days ago, and Congress has done nothing \nabout the laws that were so slack as to create that problem. So over \nthe last 5 years--prior to that and now after that--I have worked with \na diverse bunch of groups across the country to come up with a \nsignificant change in policy specific to a segment of that larger \ngroup--about 1.6 million in that particular workforce. But on this \nchart is a good example of what we are attempting to do at this moment.\n  Here is 1994 through the year 2005: total funding level from all \nsources in the billions of dollars that we are spending on the borders \nof America today to try to control our borders, and on enforcement of \nour immigration laws within those borders. Here this red line on this \nchart goes. Starting in 2001 and up, you see this tremendous increase \nin what we spend on enforcement. We are now, today, spending $7 billion \na year on the borders and on internal enforcement. That is ``b,'' $7 \nbillion on enforcement. The Senator from Arizona would be the first to \nadmit that the borders south of his State are still like sieves--people \nare pouring across them in an illegal way. Yet, today, for America's \nsake, we are spending $7 billion on our borders and on internal \nenforcement.\n  Look at the green line that represents apprehensions in millions of \nindividuals. Last year we apprehended more than 1.2 million individuals \nand sent them back across the border. These are dramatic increases. Did \nit stem the tide of illegality? No, it didn't. The Senator from Arizona \nis sitting there agreeing with me. They are pouring over the border. \nSeven billion dollars later, with thousands more new law enforcement \npeople on the borders and with apprehensions up, more people are \ncoming. What is wrong with that picture?\n\n  Let me show you what is wrong with that picture. We could build a \nfence along the border. We could build it high and dig it deep, and we \ncould man it with people every few feet, but if the laws that backed up \nthe fence were not working, somebody would come through. Somebody would \nget through. They would dig under it. They would go around it. There \nare more than 7,000 miles of land borders in our country and more than \n88,000 miles of tidal shoreline and water inlets. They would come. The \nreason they would come is that the law is not effective, nor is it \ndeterring them. They would come because our economy and our way of life \nare a powerful magnet and because our laws provide no reasonable way to\n\n[[Page S3869]]\n\nmatch those willing workers with jobs here that would go begging.\n  Here is another interesting graph. There was a time in our country \nwhen the laws did work. Starting in the 1950s we had a program for \nguest workers to come into our country and work. They were identified \nand the worker matched to the work. They came and worked, and they went \nhome. As a result of that, this green line represents the developing of \nthe Bracero Program, which did just that.\n  From a humanitarian point of view, it was not a good program. Many of \nthese people were not well treated. But the side of it that worked was \nthe side that identified the worker and the work, and here is the \nresult. The red line represents apprehensions, those illegally crossing \nthe border who were caught. Look at the drop, the dramatic drop in \nillegal activity going on in our country in the 1950s. Illegal \nimmigration dropped more than 90 percent stayed low for a long period \nof time.\n  Here we are in 1954: over 1 million apprehensions. What did I say \nabout last year? Over a million apprehensions. Millions were coming \nacross the border illegally before we changed the law. We changed it \nand, in 1953 and 1954, and we implemented it. These crossings stayed \nlaw all through the 1950s and into the 1960s, until somebody did not \nlike it anymore because of the way people were being treated, and they \nrepealed it. Eventually we wound up with the law we have today, the H-\n2A program. Guest workers in the 1950s, you can see, remained \nrelatively constant at a few hundred thousand, but those numbers \ndropped and flattened out because there were those in Congress who did \nnot like the old law. They repealed it and up went the number of \nillegals again. Why? The system did not work. Over the years, the \ngovernment and the people knew it. We watched it. We ignored it. That \nis why we are here today, because Americans are asking us not to ignore \nit any longer. It is almost the same scenario--my goodness, 40 years \nlater, 50 years later.\n  Did we learn lessons? History has a way of repeating itself, and it \nappears it is repeating itself today--1954, apprehension of illegals, \n1.2 million; last year, 1.2 million. But in the interim we had laws \nworking for a period of time that clearly demonstrated that if this \nCongress has the will to deal with the problem, it can. My legislation, \nthe Craig-Kennedy legislation, clearly does so. We would dramatically \nchanged the underlying H-2A program in a way that has produced support \nof over 500 organizations, 200 of them agricultural organizations, and \nwe do so in a bipartisan way and a broad-based way.\n  The Kyl-Chambliss bill is very narrow in who benefits from limited \nchanges in the current program, and it does not reflect that bipartisan \napproach, nor does it reflect a national approach in large part on this \nissue. Their bill would benefit a few employers and a few labor \ncontractors in some parts of the country. We have brought all \nstakeholders, all communities of interest to the table with our bill. \nThat is why it is significant for all of us to understand that there \nare very real differences in these bills. Besides, as long as you just \nmade it here by April 1 of this year, you can stay under the Kyl-\nChambliss bill. You get a blue card, and you can stay 3 years, 6 years, \n9 years, and if you elevate yourself to a supervisory position, you \nstay forever.\n  Under our legislation you have to have been here last year. By \nJanuary 1, 2005, you will have to have proved you worked 100 days and \nthen you get a temporary card, and then you continue to work, and meet \na higher standard of good behavior under the law than other, legal \nimmigrants, to pay for your right to stay to work, to pay for your \nright to eventually apply for a green card, to be able to move back and \nforth in a continuum and to be, if you will, a permanent employee in \nthis country.\n  The Senator from Arizona is talking about a quick pathway to \ncitizenship in our bill. I would not suggest that 10 to 15 years of \nhard work, standing in line and making application is a quick path to \nanything. Most Americans would never stand in line for 10 years for \nanything, let alone work at least 360 days in temporary, seasonal farm \nlabor, over several years in 100-degree heat in fields in Yuma, AR, or \nTwin Falls, ID. There are some who will, and they work very hard to \nearn that right. But they will work to earn the right, it will not be \ngiven to them unconditionally.\n  There is one thing the Craig-Kennedy and Chambliss-Kyl bills have in \ncommon. We do not make a free gift, of citizenship regardless of \ncircumstance, unconditionally. I would call that amnesty. We give \npeople--our legislation gives people--the right to come here and work, \nto earn the right to stay, and the right to continue to work. So there \nis a very real difference. Don't fall off on the idea of this quick fix \nin the substitute amendment that was just produced in the last few \nweeks because they know that I knew I was going to be here on the \nSenate floor with a bill that has been 5 years in the crafting and has \nliterally a nationwide base of support from all groups--from labor, \nfrom agriculture, from Hispanic groups, from taxpayer groups, from \nreligious and community groups, and has strong bipartisanship.\n  Last year, it was cosponsored by 63 Republicans and Democrats alike. \nThis year, we are again building the numbers, and cosponsorship is now \nnearly 50--again, Democrats and Republicans alike--supporting this. \nThat is why we are here on the Senate floor. Americans are demanding \nthat we control this immigration problem. We are offering an approach, \na solution to a portion of that.\n  I hope the Congress will then continue to work its will to get to a \nmuch broader based, comprehensive program.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me respond to a couple of comments which \nmy colleague just made. He characterized his legislation as enabling \npeople to earn the right to stay. This is the earned amnesty provision. \nBut the point is, there is no difference between coming across the \nborder illegally and working here illegally and working under the \nCraig-Kennedy bill. You are working in the field, and after a period of \ntime you get permanent legal residency. Between 2\\1/2\\ weeks and 3\\1/2\\ \nmonths, you get legal status. Then a year later you get legal permanent \nresidency by doing the very same thing you are illegally doing today.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. There is a difference. If you come forth and say, I have \nbeen here and have worked 100 days and I want to get a temporary green \ncard, we do a background check.\n  Mr. KYL. The green card is permanent, not temporary.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The temporary card is for people working 360 days over 3 \nto 6 years, and then you apply for permanency. It is at least 3 years, \nand maybe 6 years before you can even apply for permanent residency. \nThen that processing and adjudication takes about 2 to 3 additional \nyears, because there are backlogs. It is not immediately permanent. It \nis at least 5 years, and maybe 9 years before you have permanent \nresidency. Then it takes another 5 years before citizenship, if you \nqualify. Do you do a background check? And do you make those who have a \nblue card--those whom you are giving the right to stay here legally--go \nthrough a full background check in full compliance with immigration law \ntoday? Are they drug dealers, felons, three-misdemeanor conductors? We \ndo that. We do a thorough background check to make sure we have the \nright people working here and not have criminals slipping through our \nborders. Do you do the same?\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator yield 2 minutes to me on his time?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. KYL. The answer is yes. We have a much more effective way because \nwe have biometric identifiers, a fingerprint check, or other kinds of \nbiometric identifiers so the individual identifies himself both as \nbeing in legal status for employment and being the person he says he \nis. That, of course, requires documents to demonstrate legality, in the \nfirst instance, so we can absolutely confirm that the only people who \nare being hired are here legally. You can make the card whatever color \nyou want to, but under today's law, legal permanent residency is called \ngreen card status. Everybody knows you get a green card when you have \nlegal permanent residency.\n\n[[Page S3870]]\n\n  Under your legislation, it is, in fact, the case that with as little \nas 2\\1/2\\ weeks but no more than 3\\1/2\\ months a status of legality is \ngranted. After 1 year an application can be made for legal permanent \nresidency. The only question is how much time it takes to complete that \napplication process. That is when you can apply for it, 1 year. It may \ntake several more months to gain the status. Once the application has \nbeen made, you are a legal permanent resident in this country.\n  Mr. CRAIG. If the Senator will yield, then we both have \nidentification with the background check. We would require a Homeland \nSecurity identifier program. They are working on those kinds of efforts \nnow. We would require the same.\n  The real difference is your folks could work 1 hour and get a blue \ncard. Ours have to work at least 100 days and have been here prior to \nJanuary 1. I think we agree on that. I do not know where the Senator \ngets his reference to 2\\1/2\\ weeks. No one last year worked in \nagriculture one hour a day for 100 days. That was before AgJOBS was \neven introduced. That kind of employment arrangement would be \nirrational. If someone did show up and claim they had worked 1 hour a \nday for 100 days, that would be a reason to investigate them for fraud.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me reclaim my time.\n  The key difference is how you gain the status of legal permanent \nresident. Under the Craig-Kennedy bill, you get that after working here \ndoing the very same thing that you are doing illegally today. You are \nnot doing anything different. You are just doing it now under a new \nstatus as opposed to the old status. Once you do that, you get legal \npermanent residency. That is the difference. Under the Chambliss-Kyl \nlegislation, you never get legal permanent residency.\n  Second, under the Craig-Kennedy legislation, I think the Senator from \nIdaho misspoke when he said we don't grant citizenship. I think it is \nfair to say we don't grant citizenship, but it is that status of legal \npermanent residency which entitles you to apply for citizenship under \nthe United States Code--8, United States Code, section 1427(a).\n  The point is, the granting of the legal permanent status under the \nCraig-Kennedy legislation automatically entitles you to apply for \ncitizenship. That is the amnesty. You can't do that under the \nChambliss-Kyl legislation. There is no path to citizenship for people \nwho violated the law except to go back to the country of origin and do \nit just like everybody else--to get in line like everybody else.\n  The final point I want to make is this: I think it is a very \ndangerous proposition to argue that we can't control our borders. We \ncan. I have talked to the Tucson sector chief of the Border Patrol who \nsays if we have enough resources, we can get control of our borders. It \nhas largely been accomplished in California and Texas. It is not \naccomplished in Arizona because illegal immigrants came to where we \ndon't have the control. We spent the money in California, we spent the \nmoney in Texas, and sure enough they are coming through Arizona. Over \nhalf of the illegal immigrants are coming through one sector in the \nState of Arizona.\n  The statistic which the Senator from Idaho pointed out is exactly \ncorrect in that regard. They are mushrooming.\n  He is also correct in saying we need two things. I hope he will agree \nwith me we need both. We need both an effort to enforce the law--after \nall, if the country cannot protect its own borders, it cannot protect \nits sovereignty. If we do that, we need to devote the resources to do \nthat. We also need enforceable legislation for people who work in this \ncountry. We can do that by having a simplified H-2A program and some \nlanguage similar to what we are talking about here, matching willing \nworkers and employers within the legal construct, and with combined \nefforts to control the border and enforce those laws we can end up with \na legal regime.\n  But I think it is a very dangerous proposition for us to say we \ncan't, under any circumstances, control our borders. We can, and we \nmust.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, this is going to be a very interesting \ndebate. I hope all of our colleagues are watching this.\n  I wish to respond to a couple of things my friend said relative to \nour legislation.\n  First of all, this is not a stop-gap measure. This is not something \nwe conceived over the last several weeks--even the last several months. \nI have actually been working on this issue for the entire 11 years I \nhave served in the House of Representatives and now in this body. In \nfact, on the floor of the House of Representatives in 1995, Congressman \nRichard Pombo of California and myself proposed a very similar piece of \nlegislation to what the Chambliss-Kyl amendment is today to reform the \nH-2A program. We weren't as expansive back then because we didn't \nconceive the blue card concept. But we had a very similar proposition \nrelative to H-2A because H-2A has been a good program, if it were \nstreamlined. And if it were not so cumbersome for employees to use, it \nwould be used more often than what it is today.\n  Second, I want to talk about this issue relative to the control of \nthe borders. Senator Kyl is exactly right. I think it is very dangerous \nfor anybody to argue during this process or any other process that we \ncannot control the borders. We can control the borders, and we must \ncontrol the borders. If we don't control the borders to our country \nduring this process or conceive of some way to make sure that Homeland \nSecurity does so during this process, then we are going to accomplish \nnothing.\n  Our goal is--I know what the goal of Senator Craig and Senator \nKennedy is--to provide our agricultural sector in this country with a \nstable, with a quality, and with an abundant labor force pool from \nwhich to choose, and that they must be legal. That we can agree on. But \nwe can control the border, and under our legislation--it is absent from \nSenator Craig's legislation--we demand that the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, within 6 months after the effective date of this amendment, \ncome forward to Congress with a proposal as to how they want to seal \nthe border and control it from allowing illegal immigrants to come \nacross that border.\n  It can be done, it should be done, and it must be done as a part of \nthis process.\n  I want to go back to the AgJOBS bill and talk about what is truly the \nmajor significant difference; that is, the issue of amnesty.\n  Under the AgJOBS bill that Senator Craig and Senator Kennedy have, \nfirst, illegal aliens are eligible for temporary work visas if they \nhave worked in agriculture a minimal amount of time. I will not go \nthrough what Senator Kyl just said but, basically, if they have been \nhere for 100 days and worked 1 hour each day, then they can apply for \nwhat is known as ``temporary adjustment status'' under the Craig-\nKennedy bill. That makes them legal. We simply do not do that. We \nintentionally put the burden on the employer to make sure the employee \nis who he says he is.\n  First of all, I need the workers; second, that these workers will be \ncoming here as law-abiding citizens; and, they have not violated the \nlaw--as you can do under Senator Craig's and Senator Kennedy's \namendment, not once, not twice, but you can have three misdemeanors on \nyour record and still get the legal adjustment status.\n  We have zero tolerance. We think folks who come here and say they \nwant to work in the United States must be law-abiding citizens, if that \nis what they want to do. We say, unlike Craig-Kennedy, that the burden \nmust be on the employer to, first of all, go out and say, I want to \nhire American workers to fill these jobs. Then, if he can't do that, it \nis the employer who comes in and says: I have tried to hire American \nworkers to fill these jobs. I cannot find the American workers to do \nit. Therefore, under the H-2A reform provision, I need these workers \nfor a temporary period of time--X number of days--to do this job. Then \nthey will return to their native country.\n  In the case of the blue card, it is a little bit different. There are \nsome agricultural industries in this country--for example, the \nlandscape or the nursery business--where employees are needed for a 12-\nmonth period every time, not just for a temporary 90-day\n\n[[Page S3871]]\n\nor 120-day period of time. In that particular instance, these \nemployers--again, the burden is on the employer--make the estimation \nthat they need these employees--this individual is here, is law \nabiding, and that they want to have a blue card issued to that \nindividual.\n  That individual, again, can work only for that employer. When he \nleaves the employ of that individual, the burden is on the employer to \nlet the Department of Labor know he has left. If he goes to work for \nanother employer, which he can do in the agricultural sector, the \nemployer for whom he goes to work must again file the proper \ndocumentation with the Department of Labor as well as with the \nDepartment of Homeland Security so they can track that individual. That \nis critically important.\n  The major difference in that provision versus the Craig-Kennedy \nprovision is they grant the temporary adjustment status which says they \nare here illegally. After a 3\\1/2\\ month period of time, they can then \nwork for a year and get a green card, which means they basically can \nstay in the United States forever with that green card. If they want to \napply for citizenship, they can apply for citizenship while they are in \nthe United States.\n  Under Chambliss-Kyl, they must comply with current law in order to \nget a green card. In order to do that, you must go back to your native \ncountry. You must stand in line, as everyone else is required to do \ntoday, in order to make application for a green card. They do not get \nany preferential treatment.\n  If they want to secure what we think is the most precious asset an \nAmerican has, and that is American citizenship, that individual, under \nthe Craig-Kennedy amendment, simply can stay in this country legally \nwith a green card, and while they are here under that green card--even \nthough they came illegally--they can make application for citizenship. \nI don't know whether it will be granted in 5, 6, 7 years, but that is \nimmaterial. They can do so outside of what is current law.\n  Under the Chambliss-Kyl amendment, you cannot do that. If you are \ngoing to apply for a green card, you must go back to your native \ncountry and stand in line with everyone else and come in under the cap \nprovided for in current law, make application, go through all the \nprocess, and maybe get your green card. If you want to apply for \ncitizenship, again, you have to follow current law. You have to go back \nto your native country, you have to make the proper application, and go \nthrough all the appropriate steps before you can secure citizenship.\n  That major difference of rewarding those people here illegally in the \nCraig-Kennedy AgJOBS amendment versus not rewarding individuals who are \nhere illegally but only granting them a temporary status under the \nChambliss-Kyl amendment is the major difference in these two bills.\n  Why should we even grant anyone here illegally the right to stay in \nthis country? The Department of Labor estimated 2 years ago we have \nbetween 8 million and 13 million people in this country illegally. We \nhave no idea who they are. Sure, we see them standing on the street \ncorner from time to time looking for jobs. We know, in the agriculture \nsector, about 85 percent of the employees are here illegally. They all \nhave false documentations. They are pretty easy to get. You can go to \nalmost any street corner, unfortunately, or across the border in \nSenator Kyl's State of Arizona and pay somebody somewhere between $300 \nand $1,000--I understand is the current market rate--and you will get a \nfake Social Security card and other fake documentation that will allow \nyou to stay here.\n  It is illegal for an employer, before he hires somebody, whether it \nis the agricultural sector or not, to ask that person for further \nverification of the fact they are here legally in this country. That is \na weird provision in our law, but it is a fact, so we don't know who \nthese people are. The mere fact we have a 5-million gap between 8 \nmillion and 13 million tells how serious the problem is. It is serious \nfrom the standpoint these people are taxing our education system, our \njudicial system, and our health care system. We need to identify who \nthese people are.\n  We are firing the first rifle shot. Again, on this, Senator Craig, \nSenator Kennedy, and I agree. I applaud them, particularly Senator \nCraig, for continuing to push this ball forward. We need this debate in \nthe Senate as well as in the House of Representatives. Once we identify \nthose people who are involved in agriculture and are here illegally, we \nhave to make a fundamental determination, as legislators, and that is \nare we going to try to round those people up? Are we going to try to \nhire the hundreds of thousands of additional border patrol agents and \nINS agents, round those people up, and send them back from where they \ncame and expect them to stay there? Or are we going to be practical, \nand are we going to identify those people--we will not look at them and \nsay: We will give you permanent status in this country, but we will \nallow you to stay here legally for a temporary period of time if you \nare law abiding. As I say, we have zero tolerance. The AgJOBS bill will \nallow for three misdemeanors and still allow them to stay here.\n  Second, we ask: Are you displacing an American worker? We agree on \nthat. Both of us say we should not displace an American worker. But if \nthey are not displacing American workers, if they are law abiding, and \nif their employer--one other critical difference in the two bills--if \ntheir employers make the attestation here he has complied with all the \nlaws, he has sought to hire American workers, and he cannot do so, the \nemployer will be granted the right to either have those workers come in \nunder the streamlined H2-A process or the employer will be the one who \nsecures the blue card for that employee that he needs on more of a \nfull-time basis.\n\n  I submit there are significant differences in these two bills but the \nbasic overall difference is we think the Federal Government has the \nobligation, No. 1, to control the border. We think you can control the \nborder. We think, if you did not control the border, I don't care how \nsophisticated a piece of legislation we pass in this Senate or the \nHouse of Representatives, or it might go to the President's desk, we \nwill have accomplished nothing.\n  We do request and mandate the Department of Homeland Security give us \nthat plan within 6 months as to how they will control the border. As \nSenator Kyl said, they have a plan in place in Texas and California \nthat is working better than what we have in place in Arizona, where it \nsimply is not working. It is working much better than what we have in \nmy home county of Colquitt County, GA, where it is not working. They \nare getting into our county somehow. We need a provision to control the \nborder.\n  Second, the major difference is a question of whether you want to \nvote to grant somebody who is here illegally, who may have violated our \nlaw on three separate occasions with misdemeanors, a pathway to \ncitizenship or whether you want to give somebody who is here for the \nright reasons, and who has not violated the law but who is needed by an \nagricultural employer, give them the opportunity to work for that \nagricultural employer for a temporary period of time and never, during \nthe whole time he stays in the United States, be given anything other \nthan a temporary status.\n  Mr. KYL. Might I ask the Senator from Georgia to yield for a quick \nquestion?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Sure.\n  Mr. KYL. I was told a colleague was watching this debate from his \noffice and is under the impression a point was made, under our \nlegislation, a supervisor could apply for citizenship or be granted \ncitizenship or legal permanent residency under the Chambliss-Kyl \nlegislation. I wonder if the Senator would clarify that is not the \ncase.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. That is absolutely not the case. There is no way, \nunder the Chambliss-Kyl amendment, anyone, anybody who is here \nillegally and who gets a blue card by virtue of the employer of that \nindividual requesting the blue card, ever becomes anything other than a \ntemporary resident of this country.\n  Under our law--and we maintain current law--under current law, there \nis no way someone who is in this country on a temporary basis can ever \napply for a green card--and can never apply for citizenship.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask you to respond on my time. I appreciate that.\n\n[[Page S3872]]\n\n  I understand what you are saying, ``greening'' versus ``blueing,'' \nbut if you give someone a blue card and he becomes a supervisor, he may \nnot be a permanent resident but he is permanently in this country by \nyour legislation.\n  We all identify with the green card today because it has been around \na long time. When you get a permanent green card, you can become a \npermanent resident and not a citizen. I suggest, and you may disagree, \nif you become a supervisor after 9 years of being here with a blue \ncard, it is permanent, is it not?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I appreciate the question of the Senator from Idaho. \nThat is exactly the opposite from what is the truth. The truth is, he \nis always a temporary employee, and if he has a supervisory position \nand if he is granted additional time after 9 years, his temporary \nstatus never changes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. But he is permanently here if he wants to be.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. That is not true because if his employer ever released \nhim from his employment, he has to notify the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and the Department of Labor, and that individual must go back \nto where he came from. Or if he secures a----\n  Mr. CRAIG. So I am right, but under certain conditions I am wrong. \nThank you.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. You are wrong, but there are exceptions to everything.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thought so.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. He is never a permanent citizen as he becomes under \nyour bill after about 2\\1/2\\ weeks.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have to come back on that. Not after 2\\1/\n2\\ weeks.\n  He gets a temporary green card for 360 days or 5 years. Then he \napplies for permanency. That is the way the bill reads. That is an \nadditional 2 years. Math is math and it adds up and that is 6 years. I \nam sorry, that is not 2 weeks. It does not work that way. That we \ndisagree on.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Is it not true, under your bill, an individual can get \nthe temporary adjustment status after working 100 hours?\n  Mr. CRAIG. As of 2004, not in 2005. January 1, he had to be here last \nyear working, cannot come across the border through Arizona. March 29, \nbefore April 1 of this year.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Is it true that 1 hour is defined in the Fair Labor \nStandards Act, or 1 day's work is defined as 1 hour, and it is actually \n100 days?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I understand it is kind of the semantics we played a few \nmoments ago. Temporary is not permanent, even though they are \npermanently here temporarily. I understand those semantics, yes.\n  Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, 1 hour is a day. But I do require \nnot 1 hour, I require 100 days. You require 1 hour.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Is it not true this is a fundamental difference in our \ntwo amendments? Under your amendment, the employee or the illegal alien \ncomes in and says: I worked here for those 100 hours last year or 2 \nyears ago.\n  Mr. CRAIG. And must demonstrate through tax returns----\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Where under our bill they come in and an employer \nsays: I need this employee, and I want to make application for the H2-A \nor the blue card.\n  Mr. CRAIG. That employee must demonstrate tax records and an \nemployment record during that 100-hour period by an employee prior to \nJanuary 1, 2005.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Would the Senator not agree a fundamental difference \nis, under your bill, the employee is the one who makes that \nattestation. Whereas, under our bill, it is the employer--the American \nemployer--says: I need you.\n  Under your bill, the employee says: I have been here for this period \nof time, and therefore I deserve to receive this adjustment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. In my situation, they must have worked and, of course, \nthey must do that full background check we all go through.\n  It is a time-consuming thing. One of the things the American people \nwant that we are both doing is to control the current illegal \npopulation, to identify and find out who they are, to make sure they \nare not bad people, if we are going to grant them the right to stay and \nwork. That we both accomplish.\n  It is not just, oh, get a card because you got 100 hours or, oh, you \nget a card because you got 1 hour, in your circumstance. It is because \nyou have submitted yourself to a full background check. That is 14 \npages in the current code of this country as it relates to immigration. \nThat is very significant for all of us.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Alabama 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Georgia. I appreciate the \ndebate that has been going on. It is an important debate. It is \nsomething we need to be discussing.\n  I say, with real conviction, we can improve the immigration system in \nAmerica. We can make it work better. We must do that.\n  This is a defense supplemental bill, early in this Senate calendar. \nWe are not ready, in any way, shape or form, to be debating this \ncomprehensive legislation today.\n  If the American people were to know what is being proposed, they \nwould be very unhappy with us. I certainly hope we are not about to \nmake this law.\n  I understand, at one point, there were over 50 cosponsors to the \nCraig-Kennedy legislation, which is breathtaking, in a way. But I don't \nthink the American people and Members of this body fully understand the \nimport of it. It is a big deal.\n\n  I say to my colleagues, you will be voting on this soon. I urge you \nto get your mind focused on what we are about to vote on and I urge you \nto say, ``I am not ready to vote on such comprehensive legislation--\nthis is a Defense bill''--and vote no. That is the first thing we ought \nto do.\n  Let me see if I can summarize, from reading this legislation \ncarefully, what I think the AgJOBS amendment says without any doubt.\n  People who are here illegally, for any number of reasons, who should \nnot be here contrary to the law, and, therefore, are who also working \nillegally and violating American law--under this bill, if they have \nworked 100 hours in 100 days, meaning 1 hour per day, within 18 \nmonths--virtually no real work is required in the 18 months--they \nbecome, immediately, just like that, a lawful temporary resident. They \nimmediately become able, legally, to stay here. If they have brought \ntheir families here unlawfully, their families also get to stay and can \nnot be deported.\n  Then, in the next 6 years, if they work 2,060 hours--this has been \nexplained as somehow earning your citizenship. I want to remind us that \nthese people are here voluntarily, they are working and they are being \npaid what they earn. They are simply doing what they wanted to come \nhere and do. This should not earn them a path to citizenship. They are \nnot doing volunteer work in the community. They are earning a living \nand being paid for their work. Some say they should be earning more \nthan their pay, that they are earning amnesty as well. But if they work \n2,060 hours in 6 years--now, 2,060 hours is about 1 year's work for an \nAmerican worker; that is how much you work a year--if they do that, \nsome say they are then entitled to legal permanent resident status. At \nthat point, they can bring in their family if they are out of the \ncountry. They can come into the country with you and also become legal \npermanent residents--even if you never intended for your family to \nfollow you when you decided to come to the U.S. illegally and work \nillegally.\n  Then, if you wait 5 years, as a legal permanent resident in the \nUnited States, and you work, and you are not convicted of a felony, you \nare not convicted of three misdemeanors--three will block you, but two \nwill not. You can be convicted of two misdemeanors. You can be \ninvestigated for drug smuggling, for murder, for child exploitation, \nall of these things. You can even be indicted for those charges. But \nthe statute says, if you are not convicted, the Secretary shall make \nyou a lawful temporary resident and shall make you a legal permanent \nresident. It is mandatory on the Secretary. They are not able to do a \nbackground check and say: Well, the FBI is investigating this guy for \ndrug smuggling or being a member of some gang or involved in\n\n[[Page S3873]]\n\nchild sexual exploitation. It says ``conviction'' is necessary to keep \nyou from getting amnesty. Otherwise, you shall be approved as a \ntemporary and permanent resident. And being a legal permanent resident \nputs you on the road to citizenship.\n  That is what it is all about. If, indeed, a person has in 18 months \nmet this 100-hour work status and has gone back to their home country, \nmaybe without any intention of returning to America--this amendment \nwill effectively be a notice to them from Uncle Sam that says: By the \nway, you once worked here illegally. We know you have left and gone \nback, but you should come back and become a temporary resident, then a \npermanent resident, and then a citizen.\n  So it says: Come on back. They may not even have been intending to do \nthis, but this may be an offer they feel they can't refuse because they \nmay think: Well, the illegal alien is thinking--``I can go to the U.S. \nand become a lawful temporary resident, and then I can become a legal \npermanent resident. And, I can bring my family. I will move to the \nU.S.''\n  That is not the way we want to be doing immigration in America. It is \nnot the way we need to be doing it. There is no dispute that this is \namnesty. How can it not be amnesty? If this is not amnesty, what is \namnesty? You take someone who violated the law, give them a guaranteed \npath to citizenship, not subject to review by the Department of \nHomeland Security and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, \npeople--a guaranteed path. You shall be made a temporary resident if \nyou meet these qualities. You shall be made a permanent resident if you \nmeet this standard. And if you meet the legal permanent resident \nstatus, you are on the road to citizenship. That is what it is all \nabout.\n  If we ever want to create a legal immigration system--and I know we \ndo--that is generous and allows people to come here who will be \ncontributors to our country, that has any integrity whatsoever, we must \nnot adopt this AgJOBS bill. It is a capitulation. It is a total \ncollapse of any attempt to create an enforceable legal system. I must \nsay that. We absolutely do not need to be sneaking it in on a Defense \nsupplemental without the American people knowing what is going on here. \nThey are not going to be happy.\n  Now, how do these amnesty programs work? My colleague earlier \nchallenged my numbers. I said it could be a million or even more \npeople. He said it would be a half a million, plus children. But Dr. \nPhillip Martin, professor of agricultural economics of UC Davis and a \nmember of the Agricultural Workers Commission says that at least \n860,000 workers will come, and then their family members on top of \nthat.\n  We know last time we had an agricultural workers amnesty, in 1986, \nthat amnesty drastically underestimated the number that would be \napproved. I think the number was two or three times as many as expected \nthat were approved. So I think the numbers will be huge.\n\n  Now, the commission that was called upon to study the 1986 amnesty \nsaid the program legalized ``many more workers than expected. It \nappears that the number of undocumented workers who had worked in \nagricultural seasonal services prior to the IRCA was generally \nunderestimated.''\n  The commission also said that the 1986 agricultural amnesty, which \nwas similar to the amnesty we are voting on today in fundamental \nprinciples, did not solve agriculture worker problems, rather they \nfound that ``six years after IRCA was signed into law, the problems \nwithin the system of agricultural labor continue to exist.'' That was \nan official finding of a commission created by that act. Additionally, \nthe commission found that ``an increasing number of newly arriving \nundocumented workers'' were still coming to the U.S.\n  And finally, they said, ``Worker-specific and/or industry-specific \nlegalization programs, as contained in IRCA, should not be the basis of \nfuture immigration policy.'' That is exactly what we will be doing if \nwe pass this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I do not know how much time I have.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 1 additional \nminute.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am going to put this chart up and make \na couple of points in relation to some of the details in the act that \nare really breathtaking in their scope.\n  I mentioned the amnesty provisions already. The AgJOBS amendment also \noverrides State law by eliminating ``at will'' employment, where an \nemployer or employee can leave the employment whenever they chose. This \nsays, if you come in under this act, unlike an American citizen, you \ncannot be terminated, except for just cause. To make sure that happens, \nthis act has about six pages creating an arbitration situation where \nthe Federal Government pays to arbitrate these disputes, an arbitration \nsystem that is not made available to an American citizen worker. They \ndo not get that protection. It will also provide illegal aliens with \ntaxpayer-funded legal assistance through the Legal Services Corporation \nto process their applications for legal status.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama has used \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask if the Senator would not mind if I \nhave 3 additional minutes.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. How about 2?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Two minutes.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I yield 2 additional minutes to the \nSenator from Alabama.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator.\n  By the way, the AgJOBS amendment also provides they shall be given \nfully paid-for health insurance, which American workers do not get.\n  It provides that the worker organizations and employer associations \nare the ones to receive the applications for temporary status. But, \nthey cannot provide that application or the information in the \napplication to the Department of Homeland Security unless the alien \nconsents. They might receive information or evidence in the application \npertaining to a crime, but, apparently the sponsors of this amendment \nare not concerned about that. Instead, they want the applications and \nthe information that is given to the organizations and associations \nthat are authorized to receive them kept from the Department of \nHomeland Security. As a matter of fact, the only way your application \nis allowed to go to the Department Homeland Security and its \nSecretary--the only way it can go there--is if you have a lawyer. If \nyou do not have a lawyer, your application has to go to one of these \ngroups who will send it to DHS for you. These groups are not \nindependent, fair groups.\n\n  The employer groups and the worker organizations are groups that have \na special interest in promoting this. So this is not protecting the \ninterests of the people of the United States to give this process over \nto two groups, both of which have a special interest in promoting \npeople coming into this country. And, of course, there are no numerical \nlimits on the number of aliens who would be given amnesty.\n  Also, finally, I would note, as the Senator from Georgia is well \naware, group after group that are said to have been in favor of this \nlegislation have changed their mind or oppose it. The National Farm \nBureau no longer supports AgJOBS. Farm groups all over the country are \nopposed to it. I know that the largest individual H2A employer in the \ncountry opposes the AgJOBS amendment. I also know that the largest co-\nop user of the H2A program--the North Carolina Growers Association--\noppose the amendment. I have received letters from Mid-Atlantic \nSolutions, the Georgia Peach Council, AgWorks, the Georgia Fruit and \nVegetable Growers Association, the Virginia Agricultural Growers \nAssociation, the Vidalia Onion Business Council, and the Kentucky-\nTennessee Growers Association all of which oppose the passage of \nAgJOBS.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used his additional \n2 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia has 11 \nminutes 10 seconds. The Senator from\n\n[[Page S3874]]\n\nIdaho has 9 minutes. The Senator from Massachusetts has 29 minutes.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Massachusetts \nwill be arriving soon. His time and my time are for the same purpose. \nHe has given me the ability to use up some of that time. I will not, at \nthis moment, ask unanimous consent for those purposes because there is \nno one on the floor from the other side to visit with about that.\n  Senator Chambliss mentioned year round work in the nursery and \nlandscape industry. The nation's premiere nursery and landscape \nassociation is the co-chair of the vast coalition supporting AgJOBS. \nWhy? Because they know AgJOBS will work. It will provide the workers \nthey need. The blue card system in the substitute amendment will not. \nIt is written so narrowly that there will be little incentive for \nworkers to come forward and it will be cumbersome to use.\n  The Senator mentioned misdemeanors. AgJOBS goes beyond current law in \nthe good behavior it requires. We would deport for a single felony, for \nany three misdemeanors, however minor, and for any one serious \nmisdemeanor, which involves 6 months jail time. But if you say deport \nfor any misdemeanor, you are talking about some truly minor things, \nlike loitering, jaywalking, parking a house trailer in a roadside park, \ndepositing trash from a home or farm in a roadside trash can, having \nuntethered animal stock on a highway, or making known in any manner \nwhat library book another person borrowed. These are misdemeanors in \ndifferent states. We do tighten up the law. We do require better \nbehavior than current law and better than that of other, legal \nimmigrants. But the punishment should be proportional to the offense. \nWe provide for that.\n  I want to go through one thing again in some of the time we have left \nbecause what Americans are frustrated about today--whether it is the \nsolution we have offered up or the solution our other colleagues have \noffered up--is that history has shown us what works and what does not \nwork. For border security alone--and I know I have been corrected by \nthe Senator from Arizona for the language I have used, and \nappropriately so--my guess is, if we did not put $7 billion on the \nborder and into internal enforcement, if we put $14 or $15 or $20 \nbillion on the border, we could probably finally do a fairly good job \nof locking that border up. Of course, the more persons we lock out, the \nmore undocumented persons we lock in. We need to deal with that, too.\n  Americans are frustrated. They want that border controlled, as do all \nof us. But what we know works well is the coupling of more security \nwith a law that provides for a legal work force. And that is what we \nare offering today, some $7 billion a year worth of certification and \nbetter internal enforcement. We are putting law enforcement money on \nthe ground in the local communities. And because there is a segment of \nour economy that needs this particular type of employee, we have a \nguest worker program that faces up to the economic reality of our \ncountry.\n  That is what we are talking about. We did that some time ago. We did \nthat in the 1950s, and it worked. We were, here on this chart in 1954, \napprehending nearly 1.2 million illegals a year and taking them back \nacross the border. Then we created the Bracero Program. Now, the \nprogram worked because it matched employee and employer. It received a \nlot of criticism, and I will not step back from being very clear about \nit in the way the employee was treated. That is partly what brought the \nprogram down. But we literally saw numbers of illegals drop almost to \nnothing and flat-lined from through the 1950s into the early 1960s, as \nthe Bracero Program worked.\n  What had we done? We matched Border Patrol along with effective law \nenforcement along with a guest worker program that worked. Along came \nthe 1960s. We changed it and eventually wound up with the current law. \nWe flat-lined, by bureaucracy, the number of guest workers we allowed \nlegally into the program on an annual basis.\n  You can see what happened. Here it is, as shown on this chart. \nApprehensions of illegals and illegal entry began to rise. What \nhappened last year, as this very dysfunctional program all but broke \ndown? We were back at 1.2 million apprehensions. America has asked for \na solution. We have brought a solution to the floor. The only \nexperience our country has had on a broad basis with the a legal guest \nworker program is the one I have outlined.\n  AgJOBS is a groundbreaking, necessary part of balancing a realistic \napproach to solving this problem. American agriculture has boldly \nstepped forward and admitted they have a problem.\n  They are not hiding behind lobbyists saying: Lift the lid in a \ncertain program, allow more people in. They are almost in a panicked \nway saying to us: We have a 70-plus-percent illegal problem that we are \ndependent upon for the harvesting of our fruits and vegetables, for the \nsupplying of the American food shelf with its food. Please do something \nabout it. Please provide a vehicle that allows these people to be \nlegal, and we will agree to work with you in setting up the necessary \nmechanisms to make sure they are treated right, the housing is there, \nthey are paid well, and all of those kinds of things.\n  If we don't have a legal work force in place, and we continue to lock \nup the border--and we should--and we do all of the other things such as \nuncounterfeitable ID cards, we literally could collapse American \nagriculture. That is something this Congress should not be responsible \nfor doing simply by being negligent.\n  That is why for the last 5 years and more I have worked on this \nissue. We have worked cooperatively, Democrat and Republican alike--\nCongressman Howard Berman, who is on the floor at this moment from the \nHouse, Congressman Chris Cannon, Senator Ted Kennedy, and I--for hours \nand hours, with all the interested groups, now 509 groups, over 200 of \nthem in agriculture. We have come up with this approach. We didn't come \nup with it, as my colleagues have, as a blocking measure to stop this \nlegislation by throwing at the last minute something into the mix, by \nchanging the color from green to blue and suggesting that it is new \nbecause it is blue. They do a few of the things we do, but ours is a \nmuch broader program and bipartisan. That is significant as we try to \nmove legislation forward to solve this problem.\n  As I have said, the agricultural sector is facing its worst problems \never. Fifty to 75 percent of its farmworkers are undocumented. As \ninternal law enforcement has stepped up, farms large and small are \ngoing out of business because they can't get the workforce at the right \ntime to plant the crop, to tend the crop, to harvest the crop. This \nmighty machine we call American agriculture, which has fed us so well \nfor hundreds of years, is at a very dangerous precipice, perhaps the \nmost dangerous it has ever seen in its history.\n  This year for the first time since records were kept, the United \nStates will be on the verge of becoming a net importer of foodstuffs. \nHard to imagine, isn't it? The great American agricultural machine, and \nnow we are at a point of being a near net importer of foodstuffs. We \ndid that with energy. When I came to Congress in 1980, we supplied the \nmajority of our own energy. Now we are a net importer. We did that with \nminerals. When I got here, we were supplying most all of our minerals. \nNow we are a net importer. Are we going to let this happen with food \nbecause we can't agree on a reasonable program to have one of the most \nvaluable inputs into agriculture stabilized, secured, and legal, and \nthat is the workforce?\n  No, we have all come together, Democrats and Republicans, labor, \nfarmworker organizations, Hispanic groups. That is what you have before \nyou in AgJOBS. That is why it got 63 cosponsors last year. We are \nnearly at 50 today, and building. Its time is now. It is important we \nhave this vote that will occur this morning. It is a critical piece of \nlegislation.\n  Aside from that, every year on the Arizona border, the California \nborder, New Mexico, Texas border, over 300 people die trying to get \ninto this country to earn a wage. They do that because of a \ndysfunctional H-2A law, because of a system that does not provide for a \nlegal work force, and because of bad people who prey upon them as \nvictims, and they are literally victims of\n\n[[Page S3875]]\n\na law and victims of a broken process. We ought not stand idly by and \nallow that to happen, either. Control our borders? You bet. Create a \nlegal work force? Absolutely. Apprehend illegals after we have created \nthis system that works well? Absolutely. The integrity of a country is \nbased on the control of its borders and the ability to openly and \nfairly assimilate into its culture immigrants who come here for the \npurpose of benefiting not only from the American dream but by being a \npart of us. That is one side of it.\n  The other side is the realistic understanding that there will be \nthose who simply want to come and work and go home. There are types of \nwork that they can qualify for that Americans cannot do or choose not \nto qualify for, and they ought to be allowed to do that. American \nagriculture depends on it, as do many other segments of our economy. It \nis critically important that we respond accordingly.\n  Last year under the program, the broken law, about 40 plus thousand \nH-2A workers were identified and brought in legally by that law. Yet, \nin the same agricultural group, there are a total of 1.6 million \nworkers. That is how we come up with those numbers of some 70-plus \npercent undocumented workers or somewhere in that area. There has been \na great effort by the other side to confuse the argument. We believe in \nthe Department of Labor Statistics. The Department of Labor statistics \nshow that, under the Craig-Kennedy provision, about 500,000 workers \nwould be eligible to apply for adjustment, to start the process, and \nthey have about 200,000, maybe 300,000 dependents who would qualify, \nnot millions and millions and millions. That is so unrealistic when we \nare looking only at a field of 1.6 million to begin with. That is the \nreality. That is the honest figure. We didn't come up with it just in \nthe dark of night. This has been 5 years and more of study, working \nwith the Department of Labor and analyzing and understanding what the \nworkforce is, who would stay and who would go home, who would not come \nforth to be identified and who would.\n  That is why it is time now that we allow this legislation to move \nforward for the purpose of it becoming law. America demands that we \nrespond. Thirteen hundred days after 9/11 and we have not yet responded \nto the reality that is probably one of the most significant challenges \nthe United States as a nation has ever faced--to control our \nborders, control our destiny, recognize our needs, understand our \neconomy, be humane and fair to people, and do all of those things \nwithin the law. That is our responsibility to make that happen. It is \nwithout question a very important process.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that time under the quorum call be equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we don't have \nvery much time on our side, and that would mean that we could get out \nof time without the other side even coming down here until the very \nend. May I ask the Chair--I would like to pose a parliamentary \nquestion--under the agreement that was entered into, the time is not \ntaken equally off of both sides in a quorum call, is it?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. No, it is not. That requires \nunanimous consent.\n  Mr. KYL. Further reserving the right to object, because I think there \nis only about 10 minutes left on this side and a half hour left on the \nother side, that would mean our time could be wiped out without another \nword even being spoken. I would not agree to that at this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho is currently \nusing the time of the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. CRAIG. How much time, then, is left on all three?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho has consumed \nhis time. The Senator from Massachusetts now has 24 minutes. The \nSenator from Georgia has 11 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will continue to consume time of the Senator from \nMassachusetts. I understand he is en route to speak on behalf of \nAgJOBS. We will continue to do that. Over the course of the last day, I \nhave sent to the desk and provided to my colleagues a comprehensive \nlist of over 509 organizations nationwide, some 200 of them in \nagriculture, that have been a part of this growing broad coalition of \nDemocrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives, labor, employer, and \nother groups that have recognized the very critical nature of American \nagriculture today and the importance of stabilizing its workforce and \ncausing that workforce to become legal. That is exactly why the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts and I are here.\n  We have obviously had other colleagues of ours come forward with \nlegislation proposing another approach. It is nowhere near as broad \nbased, nor does it solve the kinds of very real problems all of us want \nto solve; that is, clearly creating a legal workforce.\n  Here are some of the frustrations I wish to talk about for a few \nmoments that are important. There is an opinion in this country that if \nyou just throw money at it, the problem will go away. Let me suggest \nright now that that is what we are doing. We are throwing a lot of \nmoney at it. In so doing, we are throwing about $7 billion a year at \nthe border and at internal enforcement, $7 billion well spent. In part, \nit is beginning to build systems that are getting better as they relate \nto controlling dominantly our southern border, but our northern border, \nas well, and our shoreline.\n  We did it for two reasons. Actually, we started doing it after 9/11 \nfor terrorist purposes because we were fearful that we would see \nterrorists coming up through Mexico and into the southern part of the \nUnited States or across our southern border or, for that matter, across \nour northern border. At the same time we were recognizing a near flood \nof people coming across those borders attempting to identify with work \nin our country. As you can see, the number of apprehensions of illegals \npeaked in about the year 2000. It was dropping. We started pushing \nheavy money at it. But it has begun to climb again.\n  The reality is, we are now putting about $7 billion a year into it \nand last year apprehended approximately 1.2 million illegals. We are \nstepping up to that plate now and stepping up aggressively, and we will \ndo more.\n  I have just joined with the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, to \ntake money out of this supplemental in areas where we didn't think it \nwas needed to put more into Border Patrol.\n  But as I have said earlier, there is not just a single solution to \nthis problem. We have to be able to control the numbers of people \ncoming across by stopping their belief that if they get across the \nborder, there is a job. We have to provide a legal work force system \nthat works. You do that by identifying the employees and the employers, \nand doing so as we did historically in the past, and as AgJOBS clearly \ndoes in the major reform of the existing law, the old H-2A program, \nwhich has allowed these problems to occur and is totally not functional \ntoday.\n  That is what we have offered. We think it is tremendously important. \nIt is not without criticism, and we certainly know that. Any time you \ntouch the immigration issue, it is not without criticism because there \nare those who simply don't believe anybody ought to be allowed into the \ncountry under nearly any circumstance, even though we are a nation of \nimmigrants. Our strength, energy, and dynamics have been based on the \nphenomenal immigration from all over the world that has produced the \ngreat American story as we know it. That immigration, to keep our \neconomy moving, to keep our culture where it is, strong and vital, is \ngoing to need to continue. But we need to control it in a way that \nallows the reasonable kind of assimilation that successful cultures \nhave been able to accomplish down through the centuries, as we have \nallowed controlled, managed immigration into our country. We are not \ndoing that, and we have not done it for 2 decades.\n\n[[Page S3876]]\n\n  As I have said several times on the floor in the last day and a half, \nawakening from 9/11 was a clear demonstration of that reality, that \nthere were 8 million to 12 million undocumented foreign nationals in \nour country whom we were ignoring. No longer can that happen, we say. \nWell, it is happening. We have let it happen for more than 1,300 days \nsince 9/11. That is why we are on the floor at this moment. That is why \nwe should not wait for a better day and push this back. Several \nSenators have been saying: Oh, we will get something done by late this \nyear or early next year. There is nothing on the drafting table. There \nare some hearings being held. No comprehensive work is going on that \nwill identify the broader picture and the very important, specific \nsegment of our economy. Meanwhile, there will be crops in the fields, \nand we need a legal work force, identified and trusted, to put that \nfood on the tables of American families.\n  The authors of this legislation, AgJOBS, recognize this is not a \ncomprehensive piece but it is a piece that deals with a segment of our \neconomy that is in the most critical need of their problems being \nsolved today--the economy that feeds us, puts the food on the market \nshelves for consumers in a safe, reliable, healthy fashion. That is \nwhat we are talking about today. We are talking about the need of \nAmerican agriculture to be able to respond to what is so very important \non a seasonal basis--planting, tending, harvesting of America's food \nsupply.\n  So that is why I am here, and I am not taking it lightly. We are most \nserious about our effort to try to respond to this problem. We have \nbeen attempting to gain access to the floor for well over a year for \nthis debate and not to deny it as something we simply put off. That is \nthe importance of what we do. That is why the Senator from \nMassachusetts--who is much different from I politically--and I have \ncome together, as that broad-based coalition demonstrates. All politics \nhave come together on this issue--left, right, and center, Democrat, \nRepublican, labor, employer. Why? Because of the very critical nature \nof the problem before us and the importance that we effectively \nrespond, for the sake of America, to control our borders, to identify \nthe undocumenteds who are within, to provide American agriculture with \na safe, identifiable and, most importantly, legal labor supply. I see \nmy colleague from Massachusetts has joined us on the floor. With that, \nI retain the balance of our time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask the Chair, what is the time \nallocation presently?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 13 minutes 40 \nseconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 8 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank my friend, Senator Craig, for his \nleadership in this area. As he just mentioned at the end of his \ncomments, Senator Craig and I do not share a great many common \npositions but we both are enthusiastic about this legislation. We come \nto it from different interests, over long periods of time. He may \nremember, as I very well do, in the early 1960s, we had what was called \nthe Bracero issue and problem. It was a very deep problem, where we had \nthis extraordinary exploitation of workers who came across the border \nliving in these absolutely inhumane conditions and being exploited like \nworkers in no other part of the world. It took us a long time to get \naway from the Bracero problem and issue. There was enormous conflict \nbetween the workers and the growers for many years. I remember very \ndistinctly the work of Cesar Chavez and the great interest that my \nbrother Robert Kennedy had in the rights of immigrant workers. It was a \npoisonous atmosphere year after year.\n  And now, through the hard work of many of those who were enlightened \nin the agribusiness, as well as the leadership with farmworkers, they \ncame together to recommend legislation. I paid great respect to our \nHouse colleagues, Congressman Berman and Congressman Cannon, for their \nconstancy in watching this issue develop.\n  Mr. President, we have an opportunity in the Senate now to take a \ndramatic step forward toward true, meaningful, significant immigration \nreform. Agribusiness is only about 10 or 12 percent of the total \nproblem. But should the Senate of the United States, in a bipartisan \nway, come to grips with this issue in a meaningful way, it will open \nthe path for further action in these next few weeks and months so we \ncan have a total kind of different view and way of handling immigration \nin our country.\n\n  The current system is a disaster. It is enormously costly and \nunworkable. We have spent more than $24 billion over the period of the \nlast 6 years, and the problem has gotten worse and worse. We hear talk \nabout extending a fence across the borders in southern California for a \nnumber of miles. We have to be reminded the total border in the South \nis 1,880 miles. Are we going to have a fence that is going to extend \nthat far, that long, over the period of the future? This system just \ndoes not work. We do not have enough border guards or policemen out \nthere who are going to the borders. We have to have a dramatic \nalteration and change. We are not going to deport the 7 million or 8 \nmillion undocumented that are here, that are absolutely indispensable, \nprimarily in the agricultural sector, but are playing increasing roles \nin other sectors as well.\n  So we have an extraordinary problem. With all due respect to those \nwho have tried the hard-line way of doing it, they have not been able \nto demonstrate any success. We hear those voices in the Senate, again: \nGive us another 500 border guards or some more barbed wire or another \nextension of the fence, let us just provide some additional kinds of \ntechnology, and we will solve our problem.\n  No way. We have learned that lesson. We should have learned that \nlesson. Now we have an opportunity, under the proposal Senator Craig \nand I have proposed, and in a bipartisan way, to try a different way.\n  With all respect to those who oppose this, we believe this is \nabsolutely consistent in terms of our national security issues. The \ndangers to national security are what happens in the shadows, the \nalleyways. What is happening in the shadows and alleyways is happening \namong the undocumented. People are able to hide in those areas. If we \nbring the sunlight of legality to an immigration policy, we are going \nto make it much more difficult. We are going to free up border guards \nto be able to go after those who might be terrorists, instead of \nconstantly looking out for the undocumented that are traveling back and \nforth across the border. If we have learned something over the period \nof time, it is immigration is not the problem. The problem is the \nterrorists. The best way to deal with that is to focus both manpower \nand technology to be able to deal with that.\n  Now, our effort also responds to and rebuts the idea that this is \namnesty. That is the quickest way to kill the legislation. People can \nsay, look, this is amnesty, and then go back to their offices, and that \nshakes people up enough to say they are not going to support that. We \nare talking about men and women who have lived and worked here, paid \ntheir taxes here, and they have to have done it some time ago. We are \nnot talking over the last year; we are talking about people who have \nworked and have been a part of the communities a number of years ago, \nto permit them a long period of time, probably stretched over a period \nof 7 to 9 years before they would even be eligible to start down the \npath toward citizenship--a long period of time, Mr. President. It just \nseems to me that these issues have been debated and discussed. Some \nhave been misrepresented.\n  Finally, this has a dramatic impact in terms of both working \nconditions and labor conditions for those who are going to be impacted \nby this issue. It is going to have a similar kind of impact in terms of \nAmerican workers. You have undocumented, you have illegal workers; they \nare going to be exploited, and they are going to drive wages down, they \nare going to fear their boss or their employer might tell on them. \nTherefore, they are going to settle for less in terms of payment. That \nis only natural. We can understand that. We have the figures and \nstatistics to demonstrate that. But when you drive those wages down, \nyou drive the wages down for American\n\n[[Page S3877]]\n\nworkers in related industries in those areas, and we have the figures \nto show that, too. This has a depressing impact in terms of legitimate \nAmerican workers as well.\n  So I think this is an enormously important vote. If we are able to \nget support for this legislation, this will be a pathway to try to deal \nwith the rest of the scene on immigration. If we are able to get the \ndownpayment, which this is, this will open a new day and new \nopportunity.\n  I don't often agree with the President of the United States, but he \nhas at least addressed this issue. We come to different conclusions \nwith regard to the ability to be able to earn their way into legitimacy \non this issue. Nonetheless, he understands. We can understand why; he \nhas been a Governor of a border State. I hope we can find a way of \ndeveloping a common ground here--Republicans and Democrats, those who \nhave been interested and have followed the challenges out there in \nterms of agribusiness, those of us who have been proud to represent the \nworkers who, over a long period of time, have been exploited in too \nmany instances and who have suffered. All they are looking for is \nfairness and respect and some ability to rejoin with members of their \nfamilies. Not long ago, the Senate considered fast-track legislation \nregarding those individuals who were serving in the Armed Forces \noverseas--a number of them had actually lost their lives--who were \npermanent resident aliens--not even citizens, but were permanent \nresident aliens who served in our Armed Forces. The President gave \ncitizenship to some who were killed in Iraq. We were able to try to \nprovide for those going into the military at least some ability to \nfaster citizenship. They were prepared to go to Iraq to die and fight \nfor this country. All they wanted to do was be able to live in this \ncountry as well. If they were going to do that, we were going to \nunderstand and respect their service to this Nation. We provided an \nopportunity to move their process toward citizenship faster, if they \nwere going to serve in the Armed Forces or be in the Guard and Reserve, \nwith the real prospects of going to Iraq. Are we going to say those \nindividuals, they are going to be able to get consideration, and their \nbrothers and sisters who may not have gone into the service are still \ngoing to have to live in the shadows of illegality?\n  It seems to me we ought to be able to find common ground. We ought to \nbe able to provide common ground here when we recognize the current \nprocess and system is a disaster.\n  We have an unregulated system where illegality is running rampant \nand, quite frankly, those who are opposed to us and offer alternatives \nare offering more of the same.\n  This is an opportunity for a breakthrough. This is an opportunity for \na new start. This is an opportunity for a bipartisan effort that is \ngoing to do something significant about the challenges we are facing \nwith immigration. I hope it will be successful.\n  I withhold the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of the AgJOBS bill, which \nwill do a world of good for farmers and farmworkers in Vermont and \naround our Nation.\n  First, this amendment would reform the H2A program for temporary \nagricultural labor. As it currently exists, this program is cumbersome \nand deeply unpopular with farmers. As a result, it is underused and \npromotes the widespread use of illegal labor on our Nation's farms. \nIndeed, experts estimate that more than half of our Nation's \nfarmworkers are here illegally.\n  Second, this amendment would provide an opportunity for that illegal \nworkforce to come out of the shadows and obtain legal permanent \nresidency in return for the contributions they have made and will make \nto American agriculture, both before and after enactment. It would \nallow undocumented aliens who can demonstrate that they have worked in \nagriculture for 100 or more days in a 12-month period during the last \n18 months to apply for legal status. Eligible applicants would be \ngranted temporary resident status. If the farmworker then works at \nleast 360 days in agriculture during the next 6 years, he or she may \napply for permanent resident status. Workers would be free to choose \nfrom any employer. These provisions would create a substantially larger \nlegal, stable workforce from which farmers around the country could \nhire. And without these provisions, it is difficult to see why \nfarmworkers currently here illegally would come forward and announce \ntheir presence.\n  The AgJOBS bill is supported by a broad coalition of the agriculture \nindustry and farmworker union and advocacy groups. It has broad \nbipartisan support in the Senate, and I urge all Senators to vote for \ncloture.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, what is the time remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia has 11 \nminutes. The Senator from Massachusetts has 2 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I yield myself 5\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, we are coming to the close of the \ndebate on this issue. I think it is important that we review for those \nof our colleagues who are listening, as well as to the American people \nwho are listening relative to this issue, concerning whether we should \ngrant amnesty to illegal aliens who are in this country, who are \nworking in the agricultural field and given a pathway to citizenship, \nor should we grant to those individuals an accommodation to stay here, \nassuming they are law abiding, assuming they are working in agriculture \nfor an employer who needs them and they are not displacing an American \nworker, and where they will always be categorized as a temporary \nworker. That is the fundamental difference between our two bills.\n  I say to the Senator from Idaho, as well as the Senator from \nMassachusetts, again, I appreciate the debate we have had this morning \nbecause we have struck at the nerve of this issue relative to the \nagricultural sector.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is right. This is, in all probability, \ngoing to lay the groundwork for the broader overall issue we will deal \nwith relative to immigration. I hoped we could have dealt with this \nissue in a broader immigration bill, but with the rules of the Senate \nbeing what they are, we are here today talking about the supplemental \nfor the Iraq war, and this is an issue which, under our rules, can be \nbrought forth, has been brought forth, and that is obviously why we are \nhere.\n  There are a number of organizations on both sides that have come out \nin favor of the AgJOBS bill, as well as the Chambliss-Kyl amendment. I \nwant to make sure that all of my colleagues understand that the most \nrecognized agricultural group in America, the American Farm Bureau, has \nendorsed the Chambliss-Kyl amendment. They have sent a letter to every \nMember of the Senate. They have sent letters to all of their membership \naround the country, as well as being on the telephone calling those \nfolks today asking that they contact their Senators and request that \nthey vote for the Chambliss-Kyl amendment.\n  The reason the American Farm Bureau has done that is the American \nFarm Bureau knows and understands that we do need that stable, quality \nsupply of agricultural employees for our farmers and ranchers around \nAmerica, and they agree with Senator Kyl and myself that we need to do \nit in a way that gives these workers a temporary status, does not \ndisplace American workers, allows our employers--our farmers and \nranchers--to only hire those individuals who have had a background \ncheck by the Department of Homeland Security and have no criminal \nrecord whatsoever, as we provide for in the Chambliss-Kyl amendment. \nOnly then can you come to the United States and be recognized as an \neligible agricultural employee under the Chambliss-Kyl amendment.\n  Under the AgJOBS bill, you can have up to three misdemeanors and \nstill qualify for the adjusted status, which means you are here \nlegally, which means you can apply for a green card while you are here, \nwhich then means you can apply for citizenship while you are here, even \nthough you came to this country illegally to start with and even though \nyou have committed up to three misdemeanors and have been convicted of \nthree misdemeanors while you have been here.\n  We know a supply of agricultural workers is needed. Senator Kyl and I\n\n[[Page S3878]]\n\nhave worked very hard on this measure over the last several months to \ntry to ensure that we accommodate all of our farmers' and ranchers' \nneeds across America. Today we think streamlining the H-2A process, \nwhich will give us a prevailing wage rate that our employers can pay to \ntheir agricultural employees, will provide a streamlined paperwork \nprocess to allow our H-2A employers to have that ready supply of labor \nin a short period of time and to make sure that when they complete the \njob they have been allowed to come here to do, they go back to their \ncountry as available to our farmers and ranchers.\n  Also, with the blue card provision we have in our bill, farmers and \nranchers who need employees for a period in excess of a small window \nwill have available to them employees who can be here for up to 3 years \nprovided the Department of Homeland Security has done a background \ncheck and determined that they have never violated the law in this \ncountry, provided that those employees never be given anything but a \ntemporary status, and provided that those employees agree and \nacknowledge that they will never be allowed to apply for a green card \nfor permanent status or for citizenship in any way whatsoever, other \nthan under what is existing law today.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, what is the time situation again?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts has \n2 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The other side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Four minutes 51 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, one of the favorite techniques around \nhere is people misstate what is in a particular proposal and then \ndiffer with it. I do not accuse anyone of doing that on this particular \nlegislation, but I do believe they ought to listen to Senator Craig and \nmyself as to exactly what our bill does and what it is intended to do. \nIf there are some changes that will make these points clear, we are \nglad to do it. We want to free ourselves from distortions and \nmisrepresentations.\n  Opponents of reform continually mislabel any initiative they oppose \nas amnesty in a desperate attempt to stop any significant reform. \nInstead of proposing ways to fix our current broken system, they are \ncalling for more of the same--increased enforcement of broken laws. \nHowever, enforcing a dysfunctional system only leads to greater \ndysfunction.\n  To be eligible for legal status, applicants must present no criminal \nor national security problems. All applicants will be required to \nundergo rigorous security clearances. Their names and birth dates have \nto be checked against our Government's criminal and terrorist \ndatabases. Applicants' fingerprints will be sent to the FBI for a \ncriminal background check which includes comparing the applicants' \nfingerprints with all arrest records in the FBI's database.\n  Contrary to arguments made by detractors of AgJOBS, terrorists will \nnot be able to exploit this program to obtain legal status. Anyone with \nany terrorist activity is ineligible for legal status under our current \nimmigration laws and would be ineligible under the AgJOBS bill. Our \nproposal has no loopholes for terrorists.\n  Opponents of AgJOBS claim this bill is soft on criminals. Wrong \nagain. AgJOBS has the toughest provisions against those who commit \ncrimes--tougher than current immigration law. Convictions for most \ncrimes will make them ineligible to obtain a green card. Applicants can \nalso be denied legal status if they commit a felony or three \nmisdemeanors. It does not matter whether the misdemeanors involve minor \noffenses. In addition, anyone convicted of a single misdemeanor who \nserved a sentence of 6 months or more would also be ineligible.\n  Finally, opponents of the AgJOBS bill also claim it will be a magnet \nfor further illegal immigration. Once again, they are wrong. To be \neligible for the earned adjustment program, farmworkers must establish \nthat they worked in agriculture in the past. Farmworkers must have \nentered the United States prior to October 2004; otherwise, they are \nnot eligible. The magnet argument is false. New entrants who have \nworked in agriculture will not qualify for this program.\n  This is a sensible, responsible, well-thought-out program that has \nhad days of hearings and weeks and months of negotiations. It is a \nsensible answer, a downpayment to a problem this country needs to \naddress. I believe, with all respect to my friends and colleagues on \nthe other side, their proposal is more of the same. I hope the Senate \nwill support our amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields the time?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of our time to \nthe Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me try to summarize the status of this \ndebate over the last couple of hours as pertains to both of these \npropositions.\n  The first to be voted on is the Chambliss-Kyl proposal, and then the \nsecond will be the Craig-Kennedy proposal. Both need 60 votes to \nproceed.\n  The first point I make to my colleagues is that we voted in this body \non a sense-of-the-Senate resolution saying we should have this \nimmigration debate later when we can do it right and can take all the \ntime we need, where everybody can participate in it and know how to \napproach the problem not just from the standpoint of agriculture, in \nfact, but for a total attempt to solve our immigration reform issues in \nthis country.\n  We decided that it would not be a good idea to try to have that \ndebate on the supplemental appropriations bill because it would hold up \nthe bill. Guess what has happened. We are in the second week of debate \non this bill to fund our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq, and there is \nstill no end in sight. If either one of these proposals gets 60 votes, \nwe are off to the races with lots more amendments, debate time, and I \ndo not know when we will get to finish the supplemental appropriations \nbill, which the distinguished chairman of the committee has been urging \nus to get about the business doing. In that sense, it would be a shame \nif either one of these two propositions got the 60 votes. That is my \nfirst point.\n  The second point is that as between the two, both attempt to reform \nour immigration system and match willing employer with willing \nemployee, but one of them does so in a way that is going to, in fact, \nattract people to this country who have been here illegally in the past \nand under the provisions of the bill would enable them to come back.\n  People who have already gone home would be able to present themselves \nat the border and simply claim and try to document that they worked in \nthis country illegally in the past and, therefore, they get to come \nback in again. I do not know of anything that makes less sense than \nhaving an illegal immigrant who worked here illegally go back home and \nthen we invite them to come back into the country to get legal status \nsimply by working in the fields again. That makes no sense.\n  Secondly, it is very clear that one version is amnesty and the other \nversion is not. One simply cannot argue that when you give an advantage \nto people who broke the law in terms of obtaining legal permanent \nresidency, which Chambliss-Kyl does not do, and, therefore, a path to \ncitizenship, which Chambliss-Kyl does not do, you cannot argue that \nadvantage given to these people who have broken our laws is not a form \nof amnesty.\n  That is the key substantive difference between these two bills. Both \ntry to match willing employer and willing employee. One does it without \namnesty and the other does it with amnesty. What we mean by that is \namnesty meaning legal permanent residency and a pathway to citizenship \nwhich is achieved by virtue of the fact that somebody worked here \nillegally in the past. That is not, we believe, a good idea and a way \nto start off with a new guest worker program that we all agree needs to \nbe enforceable and enforced.\n  We need to control our borders. We need to have a workable law. It \nneeds\n\n[[Page S3879]]\n\nto be a law that matches willing employer and willing employee and does \nnot do so with amnesty, and until we are ready to do that, I suggest we \nshould defer that debate, get on with our supplemental appropriations \nbill, and have that debate when we consider it in the context of \noverall immigration reform.\n  Therefore, how do people vote on the first vote? As I said, the first \nvote is on the Chambliss-Kyl proposal. We urge a ``yes'' vote on that \nproposal. The second vote is on the Kennedy-Craig proposal. We urge a \n``no'' vote on that. If they both fail, then we can get on with the \nbusiness of the supplemental appropriations bill to fund our troops in \nAfghanistan and Iraq.\n  Mr. President, if there is no other speaker, I suggest we yield back \nall time and proceed with the votes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I am disappointed there is an objection to allowing this \nimportant committee to do its work.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To transfer funds relating to certain watershed programs of \n                     the Department of Agriculture)\n\n       On page 198, between lines 21 and 22, insert the following:\n       Sec. 5134. Of the amount provided to the Secretary of \n     Agriculture under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 \n     (Public Law 108-447) for the Lost River Watershed project, \n     West Virginia, $4,000,000 shall be transferred to the Upper \n     Tygart Watershed project, West Virginia, to be used under the \n     same terms and conditions under which funds for that project \n     were appropriated in section 735 of the Consolidated \n     Appropriations Act, 2004 (Public Law 108-199; 118 Stat. 36).\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the amendment I am offering today is \ntechnical in nature in that it will provide for the transfer of \npreviously appropriated funds from one ongoing Natural Resources \nConservation Service, NRCS, project in West Virginia to another. The \ntwo projects involved are the Upper Tygart Valley Watershed project and \nthe Lost River Watershed project. The Upper Tygart project will, once \ncompleted, provide water service to at least 16,000 residents in \nRandolph County, WV. The Lost River project is a series of dams that \nwere designed to provide flood control, water supply, and recreation in \nHardy County, WV.\n  The Upper Tygart Valley Watershed project requires a final $4 million \nin funding to initiate construction. The additional funds are necessary \ndue to the fact that the project design was not yet completed when cost \nestimates for the project were formed. There has also been a dramatic \nrise in the cost of building materials for the project.\n  Funding in the amount of $4.2 million was provided to the Lost River \nWatershed project in the fiscal year 2005 Agriculture Appropriations \nbill. However, the project cannot proceed to construction in the \ncurrent fiscal year due to a change in the project purpose requested by \nthe project sponsor and subsequent requirements for the NRCS to \nreevaluate the project.\n  Due to these circumstances, I am offering this amendment which will \nprovide the Natural Resources Conservation Service authority to \ntransfer the previously appropriated construction funds from the Lost \nRiver Watershed project to the Upper Tygart Valley Watershed project. \nThis action will enable the NRCS to initiate construction of the Upper \nTygart project during the coming months. Again, I would like to \nreemphasize to my colleagues that this amendment does not appropriate \nnew funds but instead transfers previously appropriated funds between \ntwo existing Natural Resources Conservation Service projects in West \nVirginia.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 548.\n  The amendment (No. 548) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to, and I move to lay that motion on the \ntable.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I have no further amendments to present \nto the Senate at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 499\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby the senior Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, of which I am a \ncosponsor as well as the two Senators from Florida.\n  The Department of Defense is on an ill-timed course to weaken our \nmilitary strength by reducing the number of aircraft carriers from 12 \nto 11 and maybe even more. This decision is completely inconsistent \nwith recent past statements on the absolute number of carriers needed \nto conduct operations.\n  According to ADM Vernon Clark, Chief of Naval Operations, just a \nlittle over 2 years ago:\n\n       The current force of 12 carriers and 12 amphibious groups \n     is the minimum we can have and sustain the kind of operations \n     we are in.\n\n  According to the 2002 Naval Posture Statement:\n\n       Aircraft carrier force levels have been set at 12 ships as \n     a result of fiscal constraints;\n\n[[Page S3882]]\n\n     however, real-world experience and analysis indicate that a \n     carrier force level of 15 ships is necessary to meet the \n     warfighting Commander in Chief's requirements for carrier \n     presence in all regions of importance to the United States.\n\n  I am not convinced that reducing our carrier fleet is the best \nstrategic decision in the midst of our global war against terrorism. \nRealistically, it looks like the Department of Defense and the Navy are \nmaneuvering quickly to negate any legislative oversight. But we in \nCongress should make sure that all considerations are taken into \naccount before we rush into a decision that may hamper our military's \nability to fight this global war on terrorism. That is why this \namendment is being offered.\n  What does this amendment achieve? First, the amendment ensures that \nthe Navy proceeds on the scheduled necessary maintenance of the USS \nJohn F. Kennedy so that the carrier is kept in active status. In \naddition, this amendment requires the Navy to keep 12 carriers until \nthe latter of the following: 180 days after the quadrennial defense \nreview comes before Congress or that the Secretary of Defense has \ncertified to Congress that agreements have been entered into to provide \nport facilities for the permanent forward deployment of such numbers of \naircraft carriers that are necessary in the Pacific Command Area of \nResponsibility to fulfill the roles and missions of that command.\n\n  Moreover, it is important that we keep the Kennedy available because \nAdmiral Clark stated that it is essential to have a carrier home ported \nin Japan. However, we know that Japan has serious reservations--in \nfact, prohibitions--about allowing us to port a nuclear carrier there, \nand currently there is no sign that that prohibition would be removed \nfor nuclear carriers. Therefore, with Japan's prohibition on nuclear \nvessels, it is unwise to limit our options by retiring one of the only \ntwo nonnuclear aircraft carriers. The other is the Kitty Hawk, which is \nactually an older vessel than the JFK.\n  The bottom line is that the United States must have maximum \nflexibility in protecting our security interests in the Pacific and the \nIndian oceans. I believe any plan to mothball the Kennedy is \nshortsighted, especially during this time of war and with China's rapid \nnaval buildup. In addition, as far as China is concerned, with the \ncontinued tension between China and Taiwan, it is imperative that we \nhave a carrier in the region that can respond quickly to any possible \nconflict that may arise.\n  In that regard, the Washington Post published a story written by \nEdward Cody on April 12, 2005, entitled ``China Builds A Smaller, \nStronger Military; Modernization Can Alter Regional Balance Of Power \nRaising Stakes For The U.S.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 12, 2005]\n\n China Builds a Smaller, Stronger Military; Modernization Could Alter \n           Regional Balance of Power, Raising Stakes for U.S.\n\n                            (By Edward Cody)\n\n       A top-to-bottom modernization is transforming the Chinese \n     military, raising the stakes for U.S. forces long dominant in \n     the Pacific.\n       Several programs to improve China's armed forces could soon \n     produce a stronger nuclear deterrent against the United \n     States, soldiers better trained to use high-technology \n     weapons, and more effective cruise and anti-ship missiles for \n     use in the waters around Taiwan, according to foreign \n     specialists and U.S. officials.\n       In the past several weeks, President Bush and his senior \n     aides, including Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, \n     Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Director of Central \n     Intelligence Porter J. Goss, have expressed concern over the \n     recent pace of China's military progress and its effect on \n     the regional balance of power.\n       Their comments suggested the modernization program might be \n     on the brink of reaching one of its principal goals. For the \n     last decade--at least since two U.S. aircraft carrier battle \n     groups steamed in to show resolve during a moment of high \n     tension over Taiwan in 1996--Chinese leaders have sought to \n     field enough modern weaponry to ensure that any U.S. decision \n     to intervene again would be painful and fraught with risk.\n       As far as is known, China's military has not come up with a \n     weapon system that suddenly changes the equation in the \n     Taiwan Strait or surrounding waters where Japanese and U.S. \n     forces deploy, the specialists said. China has been trying to \n     update its military for more than two decades, seeking to \n     push the low-tech, manpower-heavy force it calls a people's \n     army into the 21st-century world of computers, satellites and \n     electronic weapons. Although results have been slow in \n     coming, they added, several programs will come to fruition \n     simultaneously in the next few years, promising a new level \n     of firepower in one of the world's most volatile regions.\n       ``This is the harvest time,'' said Lin Chong-pin, a former \n     Taiwanese deputy defense minister and an expert on the \n     Chinese military at the Foundation on International and \n     Cross-Strait Studies in Taipei.\n       U.S. and Taiwanese military officials pointed in particular \n     to China's rapid development of cruise and other antiship \n     missiles designed to pierce the electronic defenses of U.S. \n     vessels that might be dispatched to the Taiwan Strait in case \n     of conflict.\n       The Chinese navy has taken delivery of two Russian-built \n     Sovremenny-class guided missile destroyers and has six more \n     on order, equipped with Sunburn missiles able to skim 4\\1/2\\ \n     feet above the water at a speed of Mach 2.5 to evade radar. \n     In addition, it has contracted with Russia to buy eight Kilo-\n     class diesel submarines that carry Club anti-ship missiles \n     with a range of 145 miles.\n       ``These systems will present significant challenges in the \n     event of a U.S. naval force response to a Taiwan crisis,'' \n     Vice Adm. Lowell E. Jacoby, director of the Defense \n     Intelligence Agency, told the Senate Armed Services Committee \n     in testimony March 17.\n       Strategically, China's military is also close to achieving \n     an improved nuclear deterrent against the United States, \n     according to foreign officials and specialists.\n       The Type 094 nuclear missile submarine, launched last July \n     to replace a trouble-prone Xia-class vessel, can carry 16 \n     intercontinental ballistic missiles. Married with the newly \n     developed Julang-2 missile, which has a range of more than \n     5,000 miles and the ability to carry independently targeted \n     warheads, the 094 will give China a survivable nuclear \n     deterrent against the continental United States, according to \n     ``Modernizing China's Military,'' a study by David Shambaugh \n     of George Washington University.\n       In addition, the Dongfeng-31 solid-fuel mobile ballistic \n     missile, a three-stage, land-based equivalent of the Julang-\n     2, has been deployed in recent years to augment the \n     approximately 20 Dongfeng-5 liquid-fuel missiles already in \n     service, according to academic specialists citing U.S. \n     intelligence reports.\n       It will be joined in coming years by an 8,000-mile \n     Dongfeng-41, these reports said, putting the entire United \n     States within range of land-based Chinese ICBMs as well. \n     ``The main purpose of that is not to attack the United \n     States,'' Lin said. ``The main purpose is to throw a monkey \n     wrench into the decision-making process in Washington, to \n     make the Americans think, and think again, about intervening \n     in Taiwan, and by then the Chinese have moved in.''\n       With a $1.3 trillion economy growing at more than 9 percent \n     a year, China has acquired more than enough wealth to make \n     these investments in a modern military. The announced defense \n     budget has risen by double digits in most recent years. For \n     2005, it jumped 12.6 percent to hit nearly $30 billion.\n       The Pentagon estimates that real military expenditures, \n     including weapons acquisitions and research tucked into other \n     budgets, should be calculated at two or three times the \n     announced figure. That would make China's defense \n     expenditures among the world's largest, but still far behind \n     the $400 billion budgeted this year by the United States.\n       Taiwan, the self-ruled island that China insists must \n     reunite with the mainland, has long been at the center of \n     this growth in military spending; one of the military's chief \n     missions is to project a threat of force should Taiwan's \n     rulers take steps toward formal independence.\n       Embodying the threat, the 2nd Artillery Corps has deployed \n     more than 600 short-range ballistic missiles aimed at Taiwan \n     from southeastern China's Fujian and Jiangxi provinces, \n     according to Taiwan's deputy defense minister, Michael M. \n     Tsai. Medium-range missiles have also been developed, he \n     said, and much of China's modernization campaign is directed \n     at acquiring weapons and support systems that would give it \n     air and sea superiority in any conflict over the 100-mile-\n     wide Taiwan Strait.\n       But the expansion of China's interests abroad, particularly \n     energy needs, has also broadened the military's mission in \n     recent years. Increasingly, according to foreign specialists \n     and Chinese commentators, China's navy and air force have set \n     out to project power in the South China Sea, where several \n     islands are under dispute and vital oil supplies pass \n     through, and in the East China Sea, where China and Japan are \n     at loggerheads over mineral rights and several contested \n     islands.\n       China has acquired signals-monitoring facilities on Burma's \n     Coco Islands and, according to U.S. reports, at a port it is \n     building in cooperation with Pakistan near the Iranian border \n     at Gwadar, which looks out over tankers exiting the Persian \n     Gulf. According to a report prepared for Rumsfeld's office by \n     Booz Allen Hamilton, the consulting firm, China has developed \n     a ``string of pearls'' strategy, seeking military-related \n     agreements with Bangladesh, Cambodia and Thailand in addition \n     to those with Burma and Pakistan.\n       Against this background, unifying Taiwan with the mainland \n     has become more than\n\n[[Page S3883]]\n\n     just a nationalist goal. The 13,500-square-mile territory has \n     also become a platform that China needs to protect southern \n     sea lanes, through which pass 80 percent of its imported oil \n     and tons of other imported raw materials. It could serve as a \n     base for Chinese submarines to have unfettered access to the \n     deep Pacific, according to Tsai, Taiwan's deputy defense \n     minister. ``Taiwan for them now is a strategic must and no \n     longer just a sacred mission,'' Lin said.\n       Traditionally, China's threat against Taiwan has been \n     envisaged as a Normandy-style assault by troops hitting the \n     beaches. French, German, British and Mexican military \n     attaches were invited to observe such landing exercises by \n     specialized Chinese troops last September.\n       Also in that vein, specialists noted, the Chinese navy's \n     fast-paced ship construction program includes landing vessels \n     and troop transports. Two giant transports that were seen \n     under construction in Shanghai's shipyards a year ago, for \n     instance, have disappeared, presumably to the next stage of \n     their preparation for deployment.\n       But U.S. and Taiwanese officials noted that China's \n     amphibious forces had the ability to move across the strait \n     only one armored division--about 12,000 men with their \n     vehicles. That would be enough to occupy an outlying \n     Taiwanese island as a gesture, they said, but not to seize \n     the main island.\n       Instead, Taiwanese officials said, if a conflict arose, \n     they would expect a graduated campaign of high-tech pinpoint \n     attacks, including cruise missile strikes on key government \n     offices or computer sabotage, designed to force the \n     leadership in Taipei to negotiate short of all-out war. The \n     1996 crisis, when China test-fired missiles off the coast, \n     cost the Taiwanese economy $20 billion in lost business and \n     mobilization expenses, a senior security official recalled.\n       A little-discussed but key facet of China's military \n     modernization has been a reduction in personnel and an \n     intensive effort to better train and equip the soldiers who \n     remain, particularly those who operate high-technology \n     weapons. Dennis J. Blasko, a former U.S. military attache in \n     Beijing who is writing a book on the People's Liberation \n     Army, said that forming a core of skilled commissioned and \n     noncommissioned officers and other specialists who can make \n     the military run in a high-tech environment may be just as \n     important in the long run as buying sophisticated weapons.\n       Premier Wen Jiabao told the National People's Congress last \n     month that his government would soon complete a 200,000-\n     soldier reduction that has been underway since 2003. That \n     would leave about 2.3 million troops in the Chinese military, \n     making it still the world's biggest, according to a report \n     issued recently by the Defense Ministry.\n       Because of pensions and retraining for dismissed soldiers, \n     the training and personnel reduction program has so far been \n     an expense rather than a cost-cutter, according to foreign \n     specialists. But it has encountered competition for funds \n     from the high-tech and high-expense program to make China's \n     military capable of waging what former president Jiang Zemin \n     called ``war under informationalized conditions.''\n       The emphasis on high-tech warfare, as opposed to China's \n     traditional reliance on masses of ground troops, was \n     dramatized by shifts last September in the Communist Party's \n     decision-making Central Military Commission, which had long \n     been dominated by the People's Liberation Army. Air force \n     commander Qiao Qingchen, Navy commander Zhang Dingfa and 2nd \n     Artillery commander Jing Zhiyuan, whose units control China's \n     ballistic missiles, joined the commission for the first time, \n     signaling the importance of their responsibilities under the \n     modernization drive.\n       Striving for air superiority over the Taiwan Strait, the \n     air force has acquired from Russia more than 250 Sukhoi Su27 \n     single-role and Su-30 all-weather, multi-role fighter planes, \n     according to Richard D. Fisher, vice president of the \n     International Assessment and Strategy Center in Washington. \n     The Pentagon has forecast that, as the Sukhoi program \n     continues to add to China's aging inventory, the air force \n     will field about 2,000 warplanes by 2020, of which about 150 \n     will be fourth-generation craft equipped with sophisticated \n     avionics.\n       But specialists noted that many of China's Su-27s have \n     spent most of the time on the ground for lack of maintenance. \n     In addition, according to U.S. and Taiwanese experts, China \n     has remained at the beginning stages of its effort to acquire \n     the equipment and skills necessary for midair refueling, \n     space-based information systems, and airborne reconnaissance \n     and battle management platforms.\n       A senior Taiwanese military source said Chinese pilots \n     started training on refueling and airborne battle management \n     several years ago, but so far have neither the equipment nor \n     the technique to integrate such operations into their order \n     of battle. Similarly, he said, China has been testing use of \n     Global Positioning System devices to guide its cruise \n     missiles but remains some time away from deploying such \n     technology.\n       Buying such electronic equipment would be China's most \n     likely objective if the European Union goes ahead with plans \n     to lift its arms sales embargo despite objections from \n     Washington, a senior European diplomat in Beijing said. A \n     Chinese effort to acquire Israel's Phalcon airborne radar \n     system was stymied in 2000 when the United States prevailed \n     on Israel to back out of the $1 billion deal.\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. At a time when our military is already stretched thin, why \nwould we want to eliminate one of the most effective methods of \nprojecting our power and possibly opening up an area of vulnerability \nfor the United States and our allies. The decision is clear: We must \npreserve at least a 12-carrier minimum for the safety of Americans and \nfor the rest of the world, particularly our allies.\n  I strongly support this amendment and urge my colleagues to do the \nsame. This amendment offers a lifeline to the USS John F. Kennedy, and \nI am pleased that my good partner, Senator Warner, was able to offer \nthis commonsense approach to keeping the Kennedy viable as well as our \ndeterrence and our ability to protect our interests in the western \nPacific.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMaryland, Ms. Mikulski, will be recognized for 5 minutes, and the \nSenator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, will be recognized for 2 minutes.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to ask my colleagues to support \ncloture on the amendment I offered last week on the H-2B visas. This \namendment is desperately needed by small and seasonal business \nthroughout the United States. This amendment is identical to the \nbipartisan bill I introduced in February called the Save Our Small and \nSeasonal Business Act. It is designed to be a temporary solution to the \nseasonal worker shortage that many coastal and resort States are \nfacing.\n  My amendment helps keep American jobs, keep American companies open, \nand yet retains control of our borders. Small and seasonal businesses \nall over our country are in crisis. They need seasonal workers before \nthe summer can begin so they can survive. For years they relied on an \nH-2B visa program to meet their needs. The program allows businesses to \nhire temporary seasonal foreign workers with a mandated return to their \nhome country when no other American workers are available. But this \nyear they can't get temporary labor. They have been facing this for the \nlast couple of years because they have been shut out of the program \nbecause there is a cap and the cap is reached by the wintertime.\n  My amendment will help these employers by doing three things. One, it \ntemporarily exempts good actor workers from the H-2B cap so employers \ncan apply for and name employees who have already come back and forth \nto the United States. It protects against fraud, and it provides a fair \nand balanced allocation of the H-2B visas between winter and summer \npeople.\n  Let me be clear about my amendment. First, it protects American jobs. \nSecond, it is a short-term remedy because it is only a 2-year solution. \nWhat it does is exempt seasonal workers from the cap. That means there \nare no new workers. There are no new immigrants. It means no more new \nguest workers. It means people who have worked here before, who have \nplayed by the rules and gone back home, are the only ones who will be \neligible. They have to have been here in the last 3 years, worked in \nabsolute compliance with the law, and returned back home to Mexico as \nrequired. So it is not new people who will be exempt. It is an \nemployment program for them and for us.\n  The employer has to go through the whole Department of Labor and \nHomeland Security process so we are in compliance with labor rules and \nwe also ensure our national security.\n  Like my colleagues, I worry about fraud, so we have very strong \nantifraud provisions. We also make the system better by creating this \nfair allocation. We recognize that States need them in the winter, but \nsummertime people need them, too.\n  There is a crisis. Thousands of small businesses are affected by \nthis. Hitting the cap so early had a great impact on my own State of \nMaryland. We had a lot of summer seasonal business, particularly over \nthere on the Eastern Shore, working that wonderful, fabulous Chesapeake \nBay I share with my colleagues from Virginia. Many of our businesses \nused this program year after year. First they hire all the American \nworkers they can find. Then they turn to the H-2B to find additional \nworkers. I could give example after example, but I can tell you, if \nthey don't get this legislation, they will have to either lay off their \npermanent workers or close their doors.\n  So what my legislation is all about is a simple legislative remedy \nwith strong bipartisan support. It is realistic. It is specific. It is \nnarrow. It stands up for American companies, protects our borders.\n\n  I know there is great urgency about this. We absolutely need it. Many \nof my companies have been around for 100 years working in the \nChesapeake Bay. Many of them provide the livelihoods not only on the \nEastern Shore but because of our fabulous seafood processing industry. \nWe provide jobs also in Baltimore and Bethesda and other parts. We have \nto pass this legislation because if they can't start to hire within the \nnext few weeks, we are going to close American companies and end up \nwith an even more porous border.\n  I urge the adoption of my amendment, but now I urge my colleagues to \nvote for cloture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nMaryland. We have in the Senate a great respect and admiration for the \njunior Senator from Maryland for her commitment for the little person. \nI cannot think of another example in her long and distinguished career \nin the Senate where there is a clearer case for the small business, \nthat individual who is struggling to make an honest living and provide \njobs for others.\n  We have before us today a tremendous challenge as it relates to \nimmigration on a wide range of issues. This program works. It is very \nsmall in comparison to others, but it works. It serves the small \nbusinesses, not only seafood, which we have talked about before in the \ncontext of this amendment, but other small things--the bed and \nbreakfasts, the small hotels that are so important in our respective \nStates and elsewhere in America.\n  I say to our colleagues, as they come to join us, it is essential \nthat we pass this to help this category of small businesspersons and to \nlend credence to a program that works. For every one of these \nindividuals who is brought in, it would be my judgment--and I concur, \nwith my distinguished colleague--that there are two or three permanent \nAmerican workers whose jobs are supported by their efforts. Oftentimes \nmost of these come in for a short period, some several months, largely \nin the summertime; some in the fall. Then they go back to their homes \nbeyond the borders of the United States. But the American worker then \ntakes their work product and it enables them to have a full-time, 12-\nmonth means of employment.\n  This is one on which my colleagues will be proud to vote for cloture. \nIn effect, it will enable this legislation to pass.\n  On behalf of the leadership of the Senate, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the filing deadline for second-degree amendments be extended until \nthe beginning of the cloture vote on the Mikulski amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I yield whatever time I have remaining \nto the other Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Do I not have a bit of time on mine? On behalf of my \ncolleague from Virginia, I ask unanimous consent that he proceed for 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Virginia and the \nSenator from Maryland. I urge my colleagues to support the cloture \nmotion on this amendment. It is an immigration issue, but it is more \nimportantly a small business issue.\n  There are a lot of small businesses that are seasonal in nature. It \nmay be construction, landscaping, tourism, or the seafood industry. It \nis vitally important that we get this immigration, this H-2B visa \nissue, in order logically. These are law-abiding citizens who want to \nkeep their small business in operation, providing the services that \npeople in their communities so desire.\n  I thank the Chair and my colleagues. I hope all colleagues will vote \nfor small businesses, to keep them operating in States all across the \nNation and bring some common sense with this temporary remedy, to bring \nsome common sense and reasonableness to a program that every year ends \nup in a crisis. I thank Senator Mikulski of Maryland and my colleague \nfrom Virginia, Senator Warner, of course. All of us are\n\n[[Page S3886]]\n\nworking together for the betterment of many family businesses.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the two Senators from Virginia accept the \nchallenge of the Senator from Maryland to a cookoff on crabcakes. \nBefore we started this, the Senator talked about her mother's formula. \nWe have ours.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

On this vote, the yeas are 83, the nays are \n17. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Save Our \nSmall and Seasonal Business Act, offered as an amendment by Senator \nMikulski to the Supplemental Appropriations Act.\n  As many of my colleagues have stated, this amendment is very simple \nand straightforward. It is a temporary fix and does not reward illegal \nworkers. It basically allows those workers who have followed the rules \nand returned home at the end of their season to come back to work in \nthe United States and not count against the H-2B visa cap.\n  As the situation stands right now, the many businesses across our \nNation that use the visas are limited by how many can be approved each \nyear. The demand of the visas is high and the Department of Labor has \ncertified that there are positions that cannot be filled locally. With \nthe cap being for the entire fiscal year, those businesses with their \nseason in the fall and winter have a better chance of getting the \nemployees they need. In Wyoming, we have strong summer and winter \nseasons. Our winter businesses have been able to get their workers and \nyet see the impact of not having enough employees in the summer.\n  The H-2B visas are used in Wyoming by small businesses in a variety \nof areas. I have heard from hotels, restaurants, touring companies, \nhunting companies, art and framing stores, and others. Many of these \npeople depend on their return workers to keep their businesses going. \nWhile some may consider this unskilled labor, a return worker who knows \nthe job and knows the customers is invaluable for a small business.\n  This amendment is about helping our small and seasonal businesses \nsurvive another year--to give them a chance to stay in business until \nthe Senate can fully debate needed changes in immigration reform. It \ndoes not provide amnesty or benefit those who have broken our laws.\n  This type of visa actually puts such a high level of responsibility \non the employers that we should consider putting some of these \nrequirements on other types of visas. Under Federal law, the employer \nmust certify that they cannot hire locally, the employer must guarantee \nwages, and the employer accepts responsibility for the worker. The \namendment we are considering today keeps that built-in protection. It \nalso increases fraud protection to help us ensure that those who have \nthe visa applications approved are those who need the employees.\n  The support we have already heard for this amendment is evidence of \nthe wide impact of the H-2B visa program. Businesses from mountain \nStates and coastal States are in need of help. We have an opportunity \nto take positive action in support of the small businesses that drive \nour economy. I encourage all my colleagues to support the Mikulski \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 555\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, No. 555.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 555.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To modify the criteria for excluding certain H-2B workers \n   from the numerical limitations under section 214(g)(1)(B) of the \n                    Immigration and Nationality Act)\n\n       On page 2, strike lines 5 through 11, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(9)(A) Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), an alien \n     counted toward the numerical limitations of paragraph (1)(B) \n     during any 1 of the 3 fiscal years prior to the submission of \n     a petition for a nonimmigrant worker described in section \n     101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b) may not be counted toward such \n     limitation for the fiscal year in which the petition is \n     approved.\n       ``(B) A petition referred to in subparagraph (A) shall \n     include, with respect to an alien--\n       ``(i) the full name of the alien; and\n       ``(ii) a certification to the Department of Homeland \n     Security that the alien is a returning worker.\n       ``(C) An H-2B visa for a returning worker shall be approved \n     only if the name of the individual on the petition is \n     confirmed by--\n       ``(i) the Department of State; or\n       ``(ii) if the alien is visa exempt, the Department of \n     Homeland Security.''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Section 106(d)(2)(A) of the American \n     Competitiveness in the Twenty-first Century Act of 2000 \n     (Public Law 106-313; 8 U.S.C. 1153 note) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1), by inserting before the period at the \n     end of the second sentence ``and any such visa that is made \n     available due to the difference between the number of \n     employment-based visas that were made available in fiscal \n     year 2001, 2002, 2003, or 2004 and the number of such visas \n     that were actually used in such fiscal year shall be \n     available only to employment-based immigrants, and the \n     dependents of such immigrants, and 50% of such visas shall be \n     made available to those whose immigrant worker petitions were \n     approved based on schedule A, as defined in section 656.5 of \n     title 20, Code of Federal Regulations, as promulgated by the \n     Secretary of Labor''; and\n       (2) in paragraph (2)(A), by striking ``and 2000'' and \n     inserting ``through 2004''.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this is an amendment to recapture \nunused EB-3 visas. Senator Schumer, Senator Kennedy and I have worked \non this to try to assure that 50 percent of the unused EB-3 visas help \nresolve our serious nursing shortage. It is very important. These visas \ngo out of existence and cannot be recaptured except by an act of \nCongress. They have already been authorized. We need to recapture the \nunused visas from 2001 to 2004, add to the number of nurses we can \nbring to our country, as well as the EB-3 engineers and educated \nworkforce that are waiting in the wings.\n  Mr. President, I ask all of my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Texas. This is \nan amendment we have worked on together. As she said, it fills some \nbadly needed positions without increasing the overall number. I hope we \nwill support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas modified, of the Senator from Texas.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 418, As Further Modified\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to further \nmodify my amendment No. 418 with the changes that are at the desk, and \nalso add a number of cosponsors whose names are also at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as further modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 169, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n\n    prohibition on termination of existing joint-service multiyear \n              procurement contract for C/KC-130J aircraft\n\n       Sec. 1122. No funds in this Act may be obligated or \n     expended to terminate the joint service multiyear procurement \n     contract for C/KC-130J aircraft that is in effect on the date \n     of the enactment of this Act.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I stand with Senator Saxby Chambliss and \nstrongly support his amendment to ensure the C-130J contracts continue \nwithout interruption this year.\n  The C-130J has quickly been adapted to play vital and unique roles in \nour national defense efforts. Today, both U.S. and Allied C-130Js are \nperforming operational missions in CENTCOM with a mission capable rate \nof over 90 percent. The J performs missions in Iraq in 1 day that \nrequires the C-130E or H model 2 days. It is equally critical for \nrelief operations like the Tsunami effort in Asia, where lives were \nspared due to the C-130Js quick capabilities.\n  I have made several visits to the Little Rock Air Force Base, the \npremier training facility for the C-130J, and I have seen first hand \nthe J model's new features and capabilities. The C-130Js climb higher \nand faster, flies at higher cruise speeds, takes off and lands in a \nshorter distance, and is easier, safer and cheaper to operate than its \npredecessor.\n  The military officials and troops who I have talked with want to \ncontinue using C-130Js and they depend on the model's new features on \nthe ground. Cutting production of the C-130Js would not only deny our \nsoldiers the cutting-edge technology they need on today's battlefield, \nbut it would leave the Air Force and Marine Corps with an aging and far \nless capable tactical airlift.\n  As I am sure my colleagues are aware, the Air Force recently grounded \nor severely restricted the flying of 90 C-130s due to old age. Eighty-\nfour of these carriers are assigned to the Active-Duty Air Force. By \nfurther terminating the contracts for C-130Js, we would be leaving the \nAir Force unable to meet its future tactical requirements. The Air \nForce will be 116 aircraft short of requirement and the Marine Corps \nwill be short 18 aircraft.\n  Terminating the C-130J contracts is short-sighted from a tactical \nstandpoint, but it is also foolish from a financial standpoint. \nTerminating the current contracts could cost taxpayers more than the \ncost of building new carriers. Liability fees for ending the C-130J \nmultiyear contracts are estimated at $1.3 billion for the Air Force and \n$0.3 billion for the Marine Corps for a total of $1.6 billion. This \nestimate does not\n\n[[Page S3888]]\n\ninclude the increased costs of maintaining aging planes.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and help ensure our \nmilitary has the equipment it needs to effectively and safely carry out \ntheir missions, now and in the future.\n\n\n                     amendment no. 379, as modified\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask for a voice vote on my \namendment. We need to dispose of amendment No. 379, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas modified.\n  The amendment (No. 379), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I ask that the amendment be temporarily laid \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nArizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am obviously always glad to accommodate \nthe most distinguished Member of the Senate from West Virginia.\n  The emergency supplemental appropriations for Defense, the global war \non terror, and tsunami relief for 2005 provides critical resources for \nour men and women in uniform and for our foremost foreign policy \npriorities. While I recognize the importance of its timely passage, I \nam concerned it includes a number of provisions that do not constitute \n``emergency spending.'' These items clearly should be debated and \nfunded under the regular order.\n  Before I go further, I would like to congratulate the distinguished \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee for the hard work that he and \nhis staff have done in putting together this very vital appropriations \nmeasure to pursue the war on terror and, of course, the war in \nAfghanistan and Iraq.\n  We ought to ask a basic question: What is the purpose of emergency \nappropriations? It is twofold. First, it is supposed to provide funding \nfor critical expenditures beyond what was anticipated in the \nPresident's annual budget request; second, it is supposed to pay for \nvital priorities that simply cannot wait until next year's budget.\n  What are the common elements? The unexpected and the time sensitive. \nSimply put, the purpose of the supplemental appropriations bill is to \nfund our country's urgent and unanticipated needs.\n  We have to consider this in the context of a couple of comments that \nhave been made recently. At a conference in February, David Walker, the \nComptroller General of the United States, said:\n\n       If we are to continue on our present path, we'll see \n     pressure for deep spending cuts or dramatic tax increases. \n     GAO's long-term budget simulations paint a chilling picture. \n     If we do nothing, by 2040 we may have to cut federal spending \n     by more than half or raise federal taxes by more than two and \n     a half times to balance the budget. Clearly, the status quo \n     is both unsustainable and difficult choices are unavoidable. \n     And the longer we wait, the more onerous our options will \n     become and the less transition time we will have.\n\n  Is that really the kind of legacy we should leave to future \ngenerations of Americans?\n  Referring to our economic outlook, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan \nGreenspan testified before Congress:\n\n\n[[Page S3889]]\n\n\n       (T)he dimension of the challenge is enormous. The one \n     certainty is that the resolution of this situation will \n     require difficult choices and that the future performance of \n     the economy will depend on those choices. No changes will be \n     easy, as they all will involve lowering claims on resources \n     or raising financial obligations. It falls on the Congress to \n     determine how best to address the competing claims.\n\n  He said it falls on Congress. The head of the U.S. Government's chief \nwatchdog agency and the Nation's chief economist agree we are in real \ntrouble. We are in real trouble. Here is a radical idea for my \ncolleagues to consider to help secure our economic future: Stop using \nscarce Federal dollars, taxpayers' dollars to fund unnecessary earmarks \nand all the other frivolous projects that do nothing to provide for the \ngreater good of our Nation.\n  A case in point of what this legislation is and should be all about \nis the urgent need of Balad Air Base in Iraq, a U.S. Army camp on the \nvery front line of the war on terror. The service members who live \nthere have nicknamed it ``Mortaritaville'' because of the frequency of \ninsurgent mortar attacks. Balad is quickly becoming a hub for military \noperations in the Sunni Triangle and is home to more than 20,000 U.S. \ntroops. As a result, the camp's infrastructure is becoming overwhelmed \nand requires more than $63 million to remain functional and effective. \nThis camp needs emergency funding.\n  The Department of Defense listed construction of a hospital facility, \ncommand and control buildings, and related equipment among its \nemergency needs for Balad, and appropriators in the House and Senate \nhave rightly agreed to such funding. The DOD and our appropriators \nrecognize these improvements to Balad are critical to our efforts in \nIraq and the broader war on terror, and this is why we have an \nemergency supplemental appropriations bill to fund these types of \nneeds.\n  The bill includes many important provisions such as increased death \nbenefits, military operational costs, recapitalization of equipment, \nand research and development associated with the war on terror to which \nI lend my strongest support.\n  For example, this bill provides $1.285 billion in assistance to the \nsecurity forces of Afghanistan; $5.7 billion for the security forces of \nIraq; $227 million for counternarcotics activities in Afghanistan and \nPakistan; and $44 million for humanitarian assistance in Darfur, Sudan.\n  The foreign affairs provisions of this bill are remarkably free of \npork. As one who supports ensuring that taxpayers' dollars are spent \nproperly, I commend my colleagues and the chairman for their restraint \nin this area. Unfortunately, due to its ``must pass'' nature, a number \nof unauthorized provisions and funding not requested by the President \nand unrelated to defense or foreign affairs have been included in this \nbill, and literally hundreds of amendments have been attempted to be \nadded to the bill. The administration's proposed definition of an \nemergency requirement is ``a necessary expenditure that is sudden, \nurgent, unforeseen, and not permanent.''\n  We should do everything in our power to ensure this bill passes. But \nwe must also ensure every item in it is of a true emergency nature.\n  It is evident that some of my colleagues misunderstand the purpose of \nsupplemental appropriations, and continue to seek to add spending to \nthis bill that should be addressed as part of the regular \nappropriations process. In fact, there is an unmistakable trend turning \nemergency supplementals into a second budget request. Many programs \nthat should be in the baseline budget are somehow finding their way \ninto this supplemental. We must not allow this trend to continue--we \nmust not allow the supplemental to become a de facto second budget.\n  Let's look at a few examples of the kind of non-emergency spending \nthat has found its way into this bill.\n  There is $10 million for the University of Hawaii Library. I was \nunaware that the war in Iraq and Afghanistan was also being fought at \nthe University of Hawaii's library.\n  There is $2.4 million to the Forest Service to repair damage to \nnational forest lands--surely a necessary expense--but one that should \nbe funded through the proper process, beginning with an authorization \nand testimony by officials from the Forest Service in a public hearing.\n  There is $23 million to the Capitol Police for the construction of an \n``off-site delivery facility.'' I'll be the first one around here to \npraise the U.S. Capitol police for the good work that they do--I am \nsure this facility is a high priority to them. But, again, let's \nprovide funding for this through the proper process--public hearings, \nauthorizing legislation, and the proper appropriations vehicle.\n  There is language in the bill to increase authorized funds for a fish \nhatchery in Fort Peck, Montana, from $20 million to $25 million. I \nwould like to know how a ``multi-species fish hatchery'' is related to \nthe War on Terror. Does the author of such language believe the hatched \nfish may enlist in our armed forces? Was it requested by the President \nas an emergency need? No. Is this authorization related to the stated \npurpose of the supplemental? No.\n  The bill also includes language authorizing the Secretary of the \nInterior to analyze the viability of a sanctuary for the Rio Grande \nSilvery Minnow in the Middle Rio Grande Valley. The Rio Grande Silvery \nMinnow is a stout silvery minnow with moderately small eyes and a small \nmouth. Adults minnows may reach 3.5 inches in total length. Perhaps the \nsilvery minnow could enlist with the Fort Peck, MT fish. I will await \nthe Secretary's study.\n  The bill includes $500,000 for a study of wind energy in North Dakota \nand South Dakota. I believe we can all agree that this expenditure \nearmark is not urgent. In fact, I am not certain there is a need for a \nstudy as the wind energy potential in the Dakotas is well-established. \nAnd I don't know what it has to do with fighting the war on terror or \naiding the tsunami disaster victims.\n  Another $500,000 is earmarked to the University of Nevada Reno for \nthe Oral History of the Negotiated Settlement project. I ask my \ncolleagues, how is this useful to the war on terror? How is this an \nemergency need?\n  No bill would be complete without several projects for the State of \nAlaska. The bill includes language that addresses how the Agriculture \nDepartment pays dairy farmers in Alaska. I certainly don't wish to \nneglect our Alaskan dairy farmers, but I cannot support prioritizing \ntheir payment issues over the needs of our soldiers.\n  The bill includes $175,000 not requested by the President to remove \nthe sunken vessel State of Pennsylvania from the Christina River in \nDelaware. That particular vessel has been at the bottom of the \nChristina River for more than a decade, is not endangering commercial \ntraffic on the river, and I am sure Congress can wait to fund its \nremoval during the regular appropriations process.\n  Another $55 million is earmarked for a wastewater treatment facility \nin Desoto County, MS. How exactly does this help the troops?\n  Not only do I have concerns with some of the provisions the \nAppropriations Committee included in this bill, as I have highlighted, \nI am very troubled by some of the amendments being proposed. I am well \naware that many of my colleagues--and their staffs--have expressed \nfrustrations about my objections to their amendments. I have, and will \ncontinue, to object to adopting certain amendments by unanimous \nconsent. This is an ``emergency supplemental''--its not a Christmas \nwish list. I frankly do not understand the managers willingness to \nagree to some of these proposals. Some of them sound reasonable, but \nwho can be sure? That is why the President's request is so important--\nit is thought out and designed to carry out specific objectives that \nare urgent and necessary. I do not particularly care for being in the \nposition of ``bad cop'', but so be it. But I cannot agree to unanimous \napproval of amendments that appear more wishful and urgent. For \nexample, $1 million for lobster disease in the northeast. I do not \ndoubt that this may be a problem but it simply does not belong on an \nemergency supplemental appropriations bill to fund the war. There is \nlegislation regarding State regulation of hunting and fishing. I \nsupport this concept, and even cosponsored a bill last year to reaffirm \nthe authority of State governments to regulate their own hunting and \nfishing programs. But the simple\n\n[[Page S3890]]\n\nfact remains that tacking this legislation onto a war-time emergency \nsupplemental is both inappropriate and unnecessary. We can and should \npass this bill through the regular legislative process.\n  Tomorrow I will be joining with my friend from Oklahoma, Senator \nCoburn, in offering amendments to strike the most egregious, \nunnecessary, and non-emergency provisions from this bill. I urge my \ncolleagues to support our efforts to keep this important legislation \nfree from non-essential, pork barrel projects.\n  Let me close by noting that I appreciate the hard work of the \nAppropriations Committee and their staff. Field visits were conducted \nin Afghanistan and the Middle East as the Committee diligently \nresearched the DoD's many requests pursuant to the war on terror. But I \nam concerned about their decision to include unnecessary, nonemergency \nearmarks in this bill and the accompanying report. When considering \nmilitary construction projects like those in Balad, Iraq, consideration \nwas taken to determine whether the project was truly of an emergency \nnature. Why did the Committee not apply the same consideration to the \nfish hatchery in Montana?\n  As I mentioned, on tomorrow I have a couple of amendments we will be \nseeking votes on. I hope we realize we have a looming deficit, a trade \ndeficit, and unanticipated expenses concerning the war in Iraq. There \nwas one high-ranking Defense official at the time of the beginning of \nthe war in Iraq who said the oil revenues would pay for United States \nexpenses. We are now up to close to $300 billion and we are not yet \nable to reduce our forces. I think we ought to take into consideration \nthe fact that we will have continued, very significant expenses \nassociated with the conflict in Iraq and in Afghanistan before we begin \nappropriating money for fish hatcheries and for libraries.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To appropriate, with an offset, $6,000,000 for the Defense \n   Health Program for force protection work and medical care at the \n                      Vaccine Health Care Centers)\n\n       On page 169, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n\n force protection work and medical care at vaccine health care centers\n\n       Sec. 1122. (a) Increase in Amount for Defense Health \n     Program.--The amount appropriated by this chapter under the \n     heading ``Defense Health Program'' is hereby increased by \n     $6,000,000.\n       (b) Availability of Amount.--Of the amount appropriated or \n     otherwise made available by this chapter under the heading \n     ``Defense Health Program'', as increased by subsection (a), \n     $6,000,000 shall be available for force protection work and \n     medical care at the Vaccine Health Care Centers.\n       (c) Offset.--The amount appropriated by chapter 2 of this \n     title under the heading ``Global War on Terror Partners \n     Fund'' is hereby reduced by $6,000,000.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to offer amendment No. 440 on behalf \nof myself, Senator Bingaman, and Senator Carper to fully protect the \nhealth of our military personnel. Let me explain. The military \nregularly protects our troops by vaccinating them. There are vaccines \nto keep personnel healthy in the face of common illnesses like the flu \nand to protect them from biological warfare agents such as anthrax or \nsmallpox.\n  These force protection measures are important. Equally important is \nthe recognition that not every person will react positively to a \nvaccination.\n  Vaccines, even those generally considered safe, are still drugs put \ninto the body. There will always be a small number of personnel whose \nbodies have an adverse reaction to a safe vaccine. In order to deal \nwith this, the Vaccine Health Care Centers Network was established in \n2001.\n  The centers act as a specialized medical unit that can provide the \nbest possible clinical care to any military member, active duty, Guard \nor Reserve, or their family that has a severe reaction. They also \nadvise the Department of Defense regarding vaccine administration \npolicies and educate military health care professionals regarding the \nsafest and best practices for vaccine administration. Their overall \nmission is to promote vaccine safety and provide expert knowledge to \npatients and physicians.\n  Why is this so important? As many of my colleagues know, the number \nof adults who get regular vaccines is fairly small. While we have \nspecialists who deal with childhood vaccinations and problems that \nmight develop, the population of adults regularly vaccinated with \nanything more than the flu vaccine is small.\n  In the military, the reverse is true. Military personnel are \nregularly vaccinated for travel, for threats relating to their theater \nof operation, and for thinks such as the flu.\n  For this reason, it is essential that the military have a centralized \nplace to capture the information on those who experience severe \nproblems. In particular, because serious problems are rare, it is \ndifficult for the average base physician to develop the expertise \nneeded to provide the best treatment.\n  Let me give my colleagues more specifics.\n  In fiscal year 2004, the centers responded to over 120,000 emails and \nother consultation inquiries.\n  They managed over 600 cases of prolonged adverse events, which means \nliterally over 58,000 pages of medical information reviewed. These are \nvery complex and specialized medical cases. They require personnel with \nexpertise and the ability to dedicate significant time.\n  Since beginning operations in 2001, the total number of cases managed \nthrough fiscal year 2004 is 1,341.\n  Without the centers, that is over one thousand military personnel who \nwould not have gotten the care they deserve. The best possible care we \ncan provide.\n  In addition to providing care and consultative services, the centers \ndeveloped clinical guidelines and aids for physicians and nurses giving \nvaccines. Over 28,000 immunization ``tool kits'' were distributed. They \nhave also provided ongoing education at bases through lectures and \ntraining.\n  In addition, they have worked collaboratively with outside \nresearchers to get the best possible analysis of the trends in cases \nthat they do see.\n  This has all been done by an extremely small staff--only one full-\ntime doctor, three nurse practitioners, and five educators and support \nstaff at each of the four regional facilities. The value and medical \nservices they have provided to the entire military family--Army, Navy, \nAir Force, Marines, and Coast Guard--has been extraordinary.\n  Military personnel and their dependents are more confident in the \nvaccination programs and reports from those who do suffer adverse \nreactions are extremely positive regarding the care they now get from \nthe centers.\n  Why do we need to provide $6 million on the emergency supplemental \nfor this? The reason is simple. The centers are in danger of losing \npart of their funding this fiscal year. They are currently funded with \nArmy global war on terror money.\n  I applaud the Army for recognizing the need for the centers and \nproviding those funds from their wartime allocation. But the Army is \nonly the executive agent for what is a defense-wide service. They \ncannot be the sole funder. I am very concerned that the funding this \nyear is being redirected because other services have not budgeted for \nthe centers' work, despite the fact that 46 percent of their cases were \nrelated to Air Force, Navy, and Marines personnel.\n  Clearly, force protection in this time of war demands a good \nvaccination program. Equally clear, that program must include quality \ncare for those who suffer adverse events in every service, not just the \nArmy.\n\n[[Page S3891]]\n\n  In addition, as we look ahead, we all anticipate a growing need for \nbiological defenses, particularly vaccines. We established Project \nBioShield for that very reason.\n  At this point, there is no civilian equivalent to the Vaccine Health \nCare Centers Network, but I think we are going to need to consider \nsetting up some collaborative effort to take advantage of their \nknowledge should a mass civilian inoculation become necessary.\n  Let me also remind my colleagues that the Department of Defense asked \nfor and received an emergency authority from the Department of Health \nand Human Services to begin administering the anthrax vaccine.\n  I will not go into the technicalities of that, but it basically \nallows the military to vaccinate personnel with informed consent. If \nthe Department believes it is an emergency to resume that vaccine, how \ncan we consider preserving the Vaccine Health Care Centers any less?\n  At the end of the day, this is very simple. We simply cannot mandate \nthat military personnel take these vaccines and then abandon them when \na problem arises.\n  This is the same as providing a prosthesis to someone who loses a \nlimb.\n  If military personnel are injured because of their service to this \nNation, we have an absolute obligation to give them the best possible \ncare. Anything less is unconscionable.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we have some requests to make on behalf \nof the managers of the bill with respect to amendments that have been \ncleared on both sides of the aisle. We understand there has been a \nreview undertaken by staff to try to ensure that the amendments which \nare going to be presented to the Senate are consistent with the vote \ntaken on cloture earlier in the day.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 343\n\n  With that information, I call up amendment No. 343 on behalf of Mr. \nPryor regarding Camp Joseph T.

Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator, my \nfriend from Vermont. He is a valuable member of the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased with the progress we have been able to \nmake on this supplemental appropriations bill today. The Senate is \nworking hard to ensure we consider requests that have merit which \nshould be included in this bill.\n  The focus of the bill, as everyone realizes, though, is on assisting \nand providing for our troops, the Department of Defense facilities that \nare located in Iraq, trying to help ensure we protect the forces we \nhave there, giving them what they need to bring these operations to a \nsuccessful conclusion. We have made tremendous progress there, as well \nas in Afghanistan, bringing an opportunity for peace and freedom to the \npeople of both of those countries. It is quite amazing to see the \nsuccess that has been achieved in that direction, as those nations \ncontinue to work to build the infrastructure for democracy and a \ngrowing economy.\n  Our troops still need additional assistance, and that is why it is \nimportant for us to respond in a positive way to the requests of the \nadministration to fund those needs and provide that assistance which \nwill play such a critical role in their success.\n  The funds appropriated in this bill will provide support, pay in \nallowances. It will provide additional equipment, more modern and more \neffective equipment, so that the chances of success will be enhanced.\n  We do not want to drag out this supplemental unnecessarily. We need \nto complete action on the bill so we can go to conference with our \ncounterpart committee, the Appropriations Committee in the House, and \nwork out differences between the two bodies on this bill.\n\n  We do not want to delay this supplemental. We do not want to endanger \nour troops and our national interests in those areas of the world and \nhere at home by unnecessary delay.\n  We appreciate the cooperation of all Senators. I thank everyone who \nhas played a part today in our success in moving forward with this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each day I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  Last March, 29-year-old Jason Gage, who is gay, was beaten and \nstabbed in his home. According to police reports, his attacker \nacknowledged striking Gage twice with a bottle in the head and stabbing \nhim with a piece of glass. There have been reports that the victim was \ntargeted solely because of his sexual orientation.\n  I believe that the government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/19/senate-section/article/S3893-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       SPECIALIST SASCHA STRUBLE\n\n  Mr. Bayh. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from Hanna. \nSPC Struble, twenty years old, died on April 6 in a military helicopter \ncrash near Ghazni city, 80 miles southwest of Kabul. With his entire \nlife before him, Sascha risked everything to fight for the values \nAmericans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  Two years out of high school, Sascha had joined the Army in the hopes \nof getting the education he needed to become a paralegal, even working \nin the Army Judge Advocate General unit while stationed in Afghanistan. \nA former teacher recounted that Sascha was ``a terrific kid . . . \nSascha made us all want to be a better person.'' Described as a father \nfigure to his younger siblings, Sascha never liked conflict and was \noften the family peacekeeper. His younger sister described Sascha to a \nlocal television station as ``always a happy person, always making us \nlaugh. I can't think of a time that he wasn't smiling.''\n  Sascha was killed while serving his country in Operation Enduring \nFreedom. He served in the 1st Battalion, 173rd Airborne Brigade, 508 \nInfantry.\n  Today, I join Sascha's family and friends in mourning his death. \nWhile we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take \npride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Sascha, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Sascha was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, Sascha will be remembered by family members, \nfriends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero and we honor the \nsacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Sascha's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of Sascha's actions will live on far longer than any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Specialist Sascha Struble in \nthe Official Record of the United States Senate for his service to this \ncountry and for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and \npeace. When I think about this just cause in which we are engaged, and \nthe unfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope \nthat families like Sascha's can find comfort in the words of the \nprophet Isaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the \nLord God will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Sascha.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/19/senate-section/article/S3893-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3893-S3894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT AND COPYRIGHT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the House has voted \nto pass the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of 2005, clearing \nthe way for the President to sign this important bill into law. That \nsignature will mark the completion of our unfinished intellectual \nproperty business from last year. As we work to enact an equally \nambitious intellectual property agenda in this new Congress, we have \nstarted off on the right foot.\n  The Family Entertainment and Copyright Act will help protect the \nrights of our innovators and support efforts at preserving America's \ncultural heritage. Title I of the bill, the ``Artists' Rights and Theft \nPrevention Act,'' will criminalize a growing scourge: the use of \ncamcorders to surreptitiously swipe movies from the big screen. Theft \nof intellectual property does not involve stealing something tangible, \nbut the economic impact is very real. According to the Motion Picture \nAssociation of America, our film industries lose $3 billion annually \ndue to piracy. We already know of high profile examples of movies \nshowing up in other parts of the world on DVD while still in theaters \nin the United States. Theft of intellectual property is a global \nproblem, and we need to ensure that our own IP house is in order even \nas we continue efforts at stronger international enforcement.\n  I have long been an enthusiastic proponent of the Library of \nCongress's efforts at protecting and promoting our nation's rich and \ndiverse film heritage. Thus, I am particularly pleased that the bill \npassed today also contains the National Film Preservation Act, \nlegislation that I sponsored in the last Congress to continue support \nfor this extraordinary project. It reauthorizes a Library of Congress \nprogram dedicated to preserving precisely those types of films most in \nneed of archival preservation: ``orphaned'' works that do not enjoy the \nprotection of the major studios. The movies saved include culturally \nsignificant silent-era films, ethnic films, newsreels, and avant-garde \nworks. The Act will allow the Library of Congress to continue its \nimportant work, and to provide assistance to libraries, museums, and \narchives in preserving films and in making these works available to \nresearchers and the public. We know that more than 50 percent of the \nworks made before 1950 have disintegrated and that only 10 percent of \nfilms made before 1929 still exist. Once these works are gone, they are \nlost to history forever. The Librarian of Congress, James Billington, \nhas referred to our film heritage as ``America's living past.'' The \nNational Film Preservation Act will help ensure that this past is \naccessible in order to entertain and enlighten future generations.\n  I am also glad that a small but significant component of the bill is \nthe Preservation of Orphan Works Act, which corrects a drafting error \nin the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act. Correction of this \nerror will allow libraries to create copies of orphan works, \ncopyrighted materials that are in the last 20 years of their copyright \nterm, are no longer commercially exploited, and are not available at a \nreasonable price. The last provision in the bill is the Family Movie \nAct, which ensures that in-home viewing of movies can be done as \nfamilies see fit.\n  I noted when this bill was introduced that while I might well have \ndrafted specific components of this package differently, the Family \nEntertainment and Copyright Act was built around collegiality and \ncompromise, both across the aisle and between chambers. As a result, we \nhave produced good law worthy of the broad support it has enjoyed. I \nthank the bill's Senate cosponsors, Senators Hatch, Cornyn, Feinstein, \nand Alexander, for all of their\n\n[[Page S3894]]\n\nhard work. I also wish to thank in particular Chairmen Sensenbrenner, \nCongressman Conyers, Congressman Smith, and Congressman Berman, without \nwhose efforts this bill could not become law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/19/senate-section/article/S3894-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             EQUAL PAY DAY\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I stand today to speak in support of an \nissue that affects every woman in this country--the fight for equal pay \nfor men and women.\n  Today is Equal Pay Day--the day when the wages paid to American women \n``catch up'' to the wages paid to men last year. So, essentially, women \nhave to work almost four months more than men who do the same job just \nto bring home the same amount of income.\n  Until the early 1960s, newspapers published separate want-ads for men \nand women. Some newspapers even printed the same job in the male and \nfemale listings, but with separate pay scales. Full-time working women \nwould earn on average between 59-64 cents for every dollar their male \ncounterparts earned doing the exact same job.\n  Finally, in 1963, Congress passed the Equal Pay Act making it illegal \nto pay women lower rates for the same job strictly on the basis of \ngender. Since its passage, we have made significant progress in the \nfight for equal pay. Women now earn 76 cents for every dollar earned by \na man in the same position.\n  While we have improved over the last 40 years, however, we still have \na long way to go. Apparently this Administration, however, thinks we \ncan stop fighting for equal pay. The Department of Labor quietly \neliminated its Equal Pay Matters Initiative, removed all information \nabout narrowing the wage gap from its Web site, and refused to use \navailable tools to identify violations of equal pay laws.\n  Today, we teach our young girls that they can be anything they want \nto be, that no job or career is out of their reach. What we do not tell \nour young girls is that once they get that job and start their career, \nthey will make 24 percent less than their fellow male coworker even if \nthey do the same exact and work just as hard. And if they are women of \ncolor, they will make 34 percent less. If the U.S. Department of Labor \nthinks that this is acceptable, then we may as well tell those young \ngirls to stop dreaming because their work will not be valued as much as \ntheir brother's will.\n  I think we should continue to encourage women who are in the \nworkforce and young girls who will be in the workforce that working \nhard will payoff. That is why I am proud to be a co-sponsor of two \nbills that will move this country toward equal pay for women--Senator \nClinton's Paycheck Fairness Act and Senator Harkin's Fair Pay Act.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act will enforce equal pay laws for Federal \ncontractors and prohibit employers from retaliating against employees \nwho share salary information with their co-workers. This bill also \naddresses what is known as the ``negotiation gap.'' Women are eight \ntimes less likely to negotiate their starting salaries then men. In \norder to empower women to negotiate their salaries, the Paycheck \nFairness Act creates a training program to help women strengthen their \nnegotiation skills. Finally, the bill requires the Department of Labor \nto continue collecting and disseminating information about women \nworkers.\n  While the Paycheck Fairness Act addresses pay inequity among men and \nwomen for performing the same job, the Fair Pay Act addresses the \nproblem of women not getting paid what they are worth for doing jobs \nthat may be different than those performed by men, but are of equal \nvalue to the employer. The Fair Pay Act requires employers to provide \nequal pay for jobs that are comparable in skill, effort, responsibility \nand working conditions. The Fair Pay Act would apply to each company \nindividually and would prohibit companies from reducing other \nemployees' wages to achieve pay equity.\n  This issue is not just one of equality among men and women--it is a \nbread-and-butter issue for working families. According to the National \nWomen's Law Center, if working women earned the same as men, those who \nwork the same number of hours; have the same education, age, and union \nstatus; and live in the same region of the country, their annual family \nincomes would rise by $4,000 and poverty rates would be cut in half. As \nwe all know, family earnings determine where and how a family lives, \nthe education of their children, the family's health care, their \nstandard of living, including whether workers have a pension on which \nto retire comfortably. We're talking about serious consequences to this \npervasive problem.\n\n  Since the beginning of my tenure, I have been very involved with this \nissue. When the administration wanted to eliminate the Equal Pay \nInitiative within the Department of Labor's Women's Bureau, I wrote a \nletter to President Bush expressing my outrage at the Department's \nactions. In addition, I was also a co-sponsor of the Civil Rights Act \nof 2004, which included the Paycheck Fairness Act.\n  I commend my colleagues, Senator Clinton and Senator Harkin, for \ntheir commitment to the equal pay issue. I am proud to join them as co-\nsponsors of the Paycheck Fairness Act and the Fair Pay Act. I believe \nthat these two pieces of legislation will help put an end to the pay \ndisparity between men and women and bring us closer to the year when we \ncelebrate Equal Pay Day on January 1.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/19/senate-section/article/S3894-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF MARLA RUZICKA\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the life \nand work of Marla Ruzicka, a remarkable woman and humanitarian who was \nkilled last Saturday in a car bomb blast in Baghdad.\n  My thoughts and prayers go out to her parents, Cliff and Nancy, her \nsiblings, and her friends and coworkers. She will be sorely missed.\n  Born and raised in Lakeport, CA, Marla dedicated her life to helping \nthe innocent victims of war who needed a voice and needed a champion.\n  She traveled to war zones like Afghanistan and Iraq on her own and at \nher own risk to document civilian casualties and find ways to provide \nthe needed humanitarian assistance.\n  Two years ago, at the age of 26, she founded the Campaign for \nInnocent Victims in Conflict to ``mitigate the impact of the conflict \nand its aftermath on the people of Iraq by ensuring that timely and \neffective life-saving assistance is provided to those in need''.\n  A tireless and relentless advocate for her cause, she talked to \nanyone who would listen and would win over doubters with her smile, \nkindness, and compassion.\n  In fact, in no small part to her own initiative, she helped convince \nCongress and the U.S. military to provide $30 million for innocent \nvictims of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, something that had not \nbeen accomplished before.\n  Few have done so much and helped so many at such a young age.\n  Her father said he would remember her as a ``lady with a tremendously \nopen heart and warm feelings toward the people who've been in conflict \nand war.''\n  As we mourn the loss of a loving and caring American, let us also \ncelebrate the life of Marla Ruzicka and rededicate ourselves to the \ncause she personified. In her memory, let us reach out to Afghan and \nIraqi civilians who have suffered in silence and be their voice and \nchampion.\n  I can think of no finer tribute.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/19/senate-section/article/S3894-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3894-S3895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               CONGRATULATING EL CAMINO REAL HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate El \nCamino Real High School of Woodland Hills, CA, on winning the \nprestigious U.S. Academic Decathlon for a second year in a row an \nastonishing achievement for all the students, teachers, and parents \ninvolved.\n  Each year, the U.S. Academic Decathlon brings together some of our \nNation's brightest students for 2 days of competition on a broad range \nof subjects including mathematics, literature, economics, art, science, \nand music. I am very proud to report that\n\n[[Page S3895]]\n\nin the 24 years of this competition, schools representing California \nhave finished first or second every year except for one.\n  El Camino's tremendous victory represents an incredible fourth title \nin the last 8 years. Only one other school in the Nation has been more \nsuccessful. El Camino is the first school to win back-to-back \nchampionships since their fellow Californians, Palo Alto High School, \nachieved that distinction in 1982 and 1983.\n  This triumph is the result of much effort and sacrifice. These \namazingly dedicated students have given up spring and summer vacations \nand spent up to 10 hours a day preparing. Their hard work and \ncommitment have certainly paid great dividends.\n  El Camino finished first with 49,009 points out of a possible 60,000, \nbeating their nearest opponent by 723, and were led by their top \nscorer--Laura Descher.\n  It is important to note that the Academic Decathlon is set up to \naward versatility and breadth of knowledge, requiring each student to \nprepare for all the various academic events. This means that each \nstudent has developed a diverse and robust degree of scholarship rather \nthan just specializing in one given topic.\n  The nine students whose effort and determination have made our State \nso proud are Micah Roth, Benjamin Farahmand, Jihwan Kim, Lindsey Cohen, \nLaura Descher, Lindsay Gibbs, Sean Follmer, Brian Hwang, and Kevin \nRosenberg.\n  A great deal of the credit must be given to the dedicated coaches--\nChristian Cerone and Lissa Gregorio. This whole experience has \ncertainly been just as memorable for them as it has for their students.\n  Of course, no congratulations would be complete without mentioning \nthe contributions of the parents and family members who have been there \neach step of the way to cheer these young people on and support them in \ntheir lofty goals.\n  Again, I congratulate El Camino Real High School on this great \nachievement and wish all the students involved continued success in \nwhatever they decide to do. You have made your State, your parents, \nyour school, and your Senator very proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/19/senate-section/article/S3895-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MRS.

Mr. President, I am pleased to commend Ken \nMurphree of Tunica for his distinguished service as president of Delta \nCouncil this year.\n  Delta Council is an economic development organization representing \nthe 18 Delta and part-Delta counties of northwest Mississippi. Delta \nCouncil was organized in 1935 to bring together the agriculture and \nbusiness leadership of the region to focus on the challenges which face \nthe economy and society of the Delta.\n  Ken Murphree has served admirably as president of Delta Council; and \nwith his distinguished record of public service as a county \nadministrator for DeSoto County during its early years as a growth-area \nfor the Memphis metropolitan region, and more recently, as the county \nadministrator for Tunica County, MS, he has provided careful and \nresponsible leadership for orderly economic growth in our State. The \ngrowth of the local tax base in Tunica County, MS, resulting from the \nrapid expansion of the gaming industry in that area, has ben \ncharacterized as a model and a standard by which other rural growth \nareas are measured.\n  Ken Murphree has been a strong proponent of Delta Council's programs \nof education and health care during the past year. His history of \ninvolvement in transportation improvements has served Delta Council \nwell this year. The progress being registered on the development of \nInterstate 69 and the U.S. Highway 82--Mississippi River Bridge has \nalso benefited from his leadership.\n  Ken has coordinated the activities of Delta Council in a way which \nhas brought consensus throughout the region in areas such as flood \ncontrol, industrial development, higher education funding, and \ntransportation improvements.\n  Ken has been a leader in his community, and as he concludes his year \nas president of Delta Council I congratulate him for the contributions \nwhich he has made to this special region of our country.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nNew Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in Socorro, NM for the \nschool's No. 2 ranking in The Princeton Review's 2006 edition of the \nNation's ``best value'' colleges. New Mexico Tech is an outstanding \nschool and I am very proud of what they have accomplished. This is a \nwell deserved recognition for the excellent work being done by the \nfaculty and students at this fine university.\n  The New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, known to New \nMexicans as New Mexico Tech, was originally founded in 1889 as the New \nMexico School of Mines. At that time the Territorial Legislature, \nwanting to boost New Mexico's economy, decided to establish a School of \nMines to train young mining engineers. Silver and lead ores taken from \nthe nearby Magdalena Mountains were processed nearby and the new School \nof Mines would allow young mining engineers to train near the eventual \nsite of their work. The New Mexico school of mines opened with one \nbuilding, two professors, and seven students.\n  Over the years, their mission has expanded to say the least. Today \nthe enrollment at this university exceeds 1,800 students from different \nparts of the country and the world. New Mexico Tech is an outstanding \nresearch university, recognized for their excellence\n\n[[Page S3896]]\n\nas a leader in many areas of research, including homeland security, \nhydrology, astrophysics, atmospheric physics, geophysics, information \ntechnology, geosciences, energetic materials engineering, and petroleum \nrecovery. Students come to tech for its outstanding academic \nreputation, hands-on laboratory learning experiences, opportunities for \nemployment in one of their many research facilities, and its beautiful \nSouthwestern setting.\n  In the past, I have strongly supported New Mexico Tech and have \nhelped them secure defense and homeland security appropriations \nfunding. In return, they have provided the country with first rate \nresearch giving American defense and homeland security planners' better \ntechnology to protect military personnel and civilians from attack. \nThey have been on the forefront of homeland security research, \nantiterrorism efforts, and bringing new job opportunities to the \ncentral New Mexico region. The school's hard work and record of success \nhas made it easy for me to convince my colleagues that New Mexico Tech \nis a good investment. I am very pleased with the dynamic coming out of \nthis wonderful school and I encourage them to keep up the good work.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a article entitled ``New \nMexico Tech Second on `Best Value' College List'' be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the ABQJOURNAL, Apr. 18, 2005]\n\n          New Mexico Tech Second on `Best Value' College List\n\n       Socorro--The New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology \n     ranked second on The Princeton Review's 2006 edition of the \n     nation's ``best value'' colleges.\n       New Mexico Tech's Web site listed its annual undergraduate \n     cost for tuition, room and board and books as $8,750 for \n     2004-2005 academic year, which includes $3,280 a year in \n     tuition and fees. Earlier this month, Tech's regents approved \n     a 10 percent tuition increase.\n       Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, whose tuition, room and \n     board costs roughly $40,000 a year, was ranked the nation's \n     ``best value'' college. Bates, fifth in the previous year's \n     rankings, topped the new ``America's Best Value Colleges,'' \n     which hits the bookstores Tuesday.\n       The Princeton Review said all 81 schools on the list offer \n     outstanding academics, generous financial aid packages and \n     relatively low costs.\n       ``It's always pleasing to be recognized and acknowledged \n     for the good work of our faculty as well as our students,'' \n     Dan Lopez, president of Tech, said Monday. ``It does give us \n     a certain amount of presence in the higher education \n     community.''\n       And, he said, it makes people aware of a small school in a \n     more remote area.\n       ``We really have an outstanding school,'' Lopez said. \n     ``We're very proud of it.''\n       George Zamora, a spokesman for Tech, said it's the first \n     time the school has cracked the top 10, although it has been \n     on the overall ``best value'' list for years.\n       New Mexico Tech primarily focuses on science and \n     engineering at both the undergraduate and graduate level.\n       The rest of the 2006 top 10: Brigham Young University of \n     Provo, Utah;

A bill to allow modified bloc voting by cooperative \nassociations of milk producers in connection with a referendum on \nFederal Milk Marketing Order reform; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am re-introducing a measure that \nwill begin to restore democracy for dairy farmers throughout the \nNation.\n  When dairy farmers across the country voted on a referendum six years \nago, perhaps the most significant change in dairy policy in sixty \nyears, they didn't actually get to vote. Instead, their dairy marketing \ncooperatives cast their votes for them.\n  This procedure is called ``bloc voting'' and it is used all the time. \nBasically, a Cooperative's Board of Directors decides that, in the \ninterest of time, bloc voting will be implemented for that particular \nvote. It may serve the interest of time, but it doesn't always serve \nthe interests of their producer owner-members.\n  While I think that bloc voting can be a useful tool in some \ncircumstances, I have serious concerns about its use in every \ncircumstance. Farmers in Wisconsin and in other States tell me that \nthey do not agree with their cooperative's view on every vote. Yet, \nthey have no way to preserve their right to make their single vote \ncount.\n  I have learned from farmers and officials at the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture (USDA) that if a cooperative bloc votes, individual members \nhave no opportunity to voice opinions separately. That seems unfair \nwhen you consider what significant issues may be at stake. Co-ops and \ntheir individual members do not always have identical interests. \nConsidering our nation's longstanding commitment to freedom of \nexpression, our Federal rules should allow farmers to express a \ndiffering opinion from their co-ops, if they choose to.\n  The Democracy for Dairy Producers Act of 2005 is simple and fair. It \nprovides that a cooperative cannot deny any of its members a ballot to \nopt to vote separately from the co-op.\n  This will in no way slow down the process at USDA; implementation of \nany rule or regulation would proceed on schedule. Also, I do not expect \nthat this would often change the final outcome of any given vote. Co-\nops could still cast votes for their members who do not exercise their \nright to vote individually. And to the extent that co-ops\n\n[[Page S3900]]\n\nrepresent farmers' interests, in the majority of cases farmers are \nlikely to vote the same as their co-ops. But whether they join the co-\nops or not in voting for or against a measure, farmers deserve the \nright to vote according to their own views.\n  I urge my colleagues to return the democratic process to America's \nfarmers, by supporting the Democracy for Dairy Producers Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 838\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       The Act may be cited as the ``Democracy for Dairy Producers \n     Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. MODIFIED BLOC VOTING.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding paragraph (12) of section \n     8c of the Agricultural Adjustment Act (7 U.S.C. 608c), \n     reenacted with amendments by the Agricultural Marketing \n     Agreement Act of 1937, in the case of the referendum \n     conducted as part of the consolidation of Federal milk \n     marketing orders and related reforms under section 143 of the \n     Agricultural Market Transition Act (7 U.S.C. 7253), if a \n     cooperative association of milk producers elects to hold a \n     vote on behalf of its members as authorized by that \n     paragraph, the cooperative association shall provide to each \n     producer, on behalf of which the cooperative association is \n     expressing approval or disapproval, written notice \n     containing--\n       (1) a description of the questions presented in the \n     referendum;\n       (2) a statement of the manner in which the cooperative \n     association intends to cast its vote on behalf of the \n     membership; and\n       (3) information regarding the procedures by which a \n     producer may cast an individual ballot.\n       (b) Tabulation of Ballots.--At the time at which ballots \n     from a vote under subsection (a) are tabulated by the \n     Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary shall adjust the vote \n     of a cooperative association to reflect individual votes \n     submitted by producers that are members of, stockholders in, \n     or under contract with, the cooperative association.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. \n        Mikulski, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. \n        Lincoln, Mr. Corzine, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 840. A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nprohibit discrimination in the payment of wages on account of sex, \nrace, or national origin, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senators Murray, \nKennedy, Mikulski, Durbin, Leahy, Akaka, Feingold, Lincoln, Corzine and \nKerry, I am introducing the Fair Pay Act.\n  April 19th is Equal Pay Day. Even though the Equal Pay Act was passed \nmore than 40 years ago, women working full time, year-round, still make \nonly 76 cents for every dollar that a man makes. On April 19th, four \ndays after tax returns for 2004 are due, U.S. women will finally reach \nthe earnings mark that their male counterparts achieved by December \n31st of last year. April 19th reminds us that the 60 million working \nwomen in this country are suffering economically because equal pay is \nstill not a reality.\n  We've got millions of families struggling to make ends meet. The \nWhite House and the Republican House leadership believes a $750 billion \ntax cut for the rich is the solution, a permanent one.\n  I disagree. One way we can put more money in the pockets of working \nfamilies is to pay women what they're worth. Nearly 40 years after the \nEqual Pay Act became law, women are still paid only 76 cents for every \ndollar a man earns.\n  Working women at all income and education levels are affected by the \nwage gap. In 2003, the GAO found that the pay gap continues to affect \nwomen in management and that, for these women, the pay gap has actually \nwidened since 1995.\n  Regardless of education, the impact is the same. These women work as \nhard as men, but have less money to pay the bills, to put food on the \ntable, or to save for their retirement or their child's education. That \nis simply wrong and it must end. We must close the wage gap once and \nfor all.\n  First, we need to do a better job by enforcing and strengthening the \npenalties for the law that demands equal pay for equal work. That's why \nI support the Paycheck Fairness Act, sponsored by Senator Clinton and \nCongresswoman DeLauro.\n  However, an even more important part of discrimination against women \nin the work place is the historic pattern of undervaluing and \nunderpaying so-called ``women's jobs.''\n  Millions of women today working in female-dominated jobs--as social \nworkers, teachers, child care workers and nurses--are ``equivalent'' in \nskills, effort, responsibility and working conditions to similar jobs \ndominated by men, but these women aren't paid the same as men.\n  That's what the Fair Pay Act--that Congresswoman Norton and I are \nreintroducing today--would address. Unfairly low pay in jobs dominated \nby women is un-American, it is discriminatory and our bill would make \nit illegal.\n  Twenty States have ``fair pay'' laws and policies in place for their \nemployees, including my State of Iowa. And Iowa had a Republican \nlegislature and Governor when this bill passed into law, so ending wage \ndiscrimination against women is a nonpartisan issue.\n  Some say we don't need any more laws; market forces will take care of \nthe wage gap. If we had relied on market forces we would have never \npassed the Equal Pay Act, the Civil Rights Act, the Family Medical \nLeave Act or the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  I first introduced the Fair Pay Act in 1996 after the Iowa Business \nand Professional Women alerted me to this problem. And as long as I'm \nin the U.S. Senate, I will continue to fight to pass this important \nlegislation so we can end wage discrimination against women once and \nfor all.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Harkin, \n        Mr. Durbin, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Schumer, \n        and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 841. A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nprovide more effective remedies to victims of discrimination in the \npayment of wages on the basis of sex, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Paycheck \nFairness Act, which I am introducing along with my colleagues Senators \nReid, Kennedy, Harkin, Durbin, Landrieu, Corzine, Leahy, Schumer, and \nStabenow. I also want to acknowledge Senator Daschle for his \nlongstanding support of this critical issue and Congresswoman DeLauro \nfor being a champion in the House of Representatives.\n  This morning I met Brenda Wholey, a plaintiff in the Wal-Mart class \naction sex discrimination lawsuit. Brenda came all the way to \nWashington from Philadelphia to share her story with us. She worked \nhard, put in her time, and watched as time in and time out, men were \npromoted above her and compensated with higher salaries.\n  Too often when we talk about equal pay we talk about numbers--the 76 \ncents on the dollar that women earn, the 54 cents that Hispanic women \nearn. We talk about GAO reports and violations and litigation. But what \nthis is really about is women like Brenda. Women who get up every day \nand go to work so they can provide for their families. Women who work \nhard and play by the rules and want to build a better life for their \nchildren. Women like Brenda who just want to be treated fairly.\n  The Equal Pay Act was an important step forward for women. It gave \nwomen a real chance to be full, equal participants in the workforce and \nto earn equal pay for equal work.\n  In the 42 years since the Equal Pay Act was enacted, women have \nshattered so many barriers. And for young women entering the workforce \ntoday, the sky is the limit. But we still have work to do to truly \nlevel the playing field.\n  That means making sure that employers treat men and women equally in \nthe workplace. It also means giving women the tools they need to \nacquire the pay and recognition they deserve.\n  That is why I am pleased to be introducing the Paycheck Fairness \nAct--a bill that will build on the promise of the Equal Pay Act and \nhelp close the pay gap.\n\n[[Page S3901]]\n\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act has three main components.\n  First, it prevents pay discrimination before it starts. By helping \nwomen strengthen their negotiation skills and providing outreach and \ntechnical assistance to employers to ensure they fairly evaluate and \npay their employees, the Paycheck Fairness Act gives employers the \ntools they need to level the playing field between men and women.\n  Second, the Paycheck Fairness Act creates strong penalties to punish \nthose who do violate the act. By strengthening the penalties for \nemployers who violate the Equal Pay Act, this bill sends a strong \nmessage--Equal Pay is a matter to be taken seriously.\n  And finally, the Paycheck Fairness Act ensures that the Federal \nGovernment, which should be a model employer when it comes to enforcing \nFederal employment laws, uses every tool in its toolbox to ensure that \nwomen are paid the same amount as men for doing the same jobs.\n  From ending the Clinton administration's Equal Pay Matters \nInitiative, to halting the collection of data on women workers, to \nremoving important information about the wage gap from the Department \nof Labor's website, to tying its own hands in enforcing the Equal Pay \nAct among Federal contractors, the Bush administration has taken this \ncountry backwards in the fight for equal pay. You might say the Bush \nadministration has taken one giant step backwards for womenkind.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act would stop the Bush administration's \nrollbacks and make sure, once again, that our Federal Government sets a \nstandard of excellence for making sure women are paid the same as men.\n  There is no question that we've come a long way since the Equal Pay \nAct became law 42 years ago. And women have earned every step they have \ngained in the journey toward equality.\n  But what has made this country great is that we have never accepted \nthat ``less discrimination'' is ``good enough.'' The history of our \ncountry is one of constant striving to live up to the ideal of our \nfounding. And the most basic element of our American character is the \nbelief that all of us deserve to be treated as equals.\n  Our country in its history has faced lots of difficult questions, \nquestions on which reasonable people could disagree. Equal pay is not \none of those hard questions. It is common sense, it is basic fairness. \nIt is simply right.\n  And frankly, when it comes to equal pay, we still have a lot of work \nto do. Women's compensation still lags behind men's in nearly every \noccupation and every field. As the American Association of University \nWomen study being unveiled today shows us, this fact is not lost on \nmost Americans. Young, old, Democrat, Republican, male, female--there \nis universal recognition that a wage gap exists. Well, the Paycheck \nFairness Act will do something about it.\n  This issue is about our mothers, our sisters, our daughters. It's \nabout women being able to earn an equal wage for equal work. It is in \nall of our interests to allow women to support their families and to \nlive with the dignity and respect accorded to fully engaged members of \nthe workforce.\n  Equality works for all of us. Now is the time to make sure that we \nall work towards equality.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Reid, Mr. Durbin, \n        Mr. Schumer, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Harkin, Ms. Mikulski, \n        Mrs. Murray, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Biden, Mr. \n        Leahy, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Levin, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Dorgan, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Feingold, Mr. \n        Wyden, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Carper, Ms. Stabenow, Ms. \n        Cantwell, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Obama, \n        Mr. Salazar, and Mr. Reed):\n  S. 842. A bill to amend the National Labor Relations Act to establish \nan efficient system to enable employees to form, join, or assist labor \norganizations, to provide for mandatory injunctions for unfair labor \npractices during organizing efforts, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in recognition of our country's \nlongstanding commitment to basic fairness for the Nation's hard-working \nmen and women, I am introducing the Employee Free Choice Act. I want to \nthank my distinguished colleague, Senator Arlen Specter, for also \nsupporting this important legislation to protect workers' right to free \nassociation.\n  The essence of the American dream is the ability to provide a better \nlife for yourself and your family. At the very heart of that dream are \na good job, a good workplace, good health care, and a good retirement. \nUnfortunately, too many families today find that dream increasingly \nbeyond their reach in today's global economy. Vast numbers of citizens \nsuddenly find themselves in a race to the bottom against workers in \nother countries. Whoever is willing to work for the lowest pay gets the \nwork.\n  That is why the labor movement is more important today than ever. \nIt's not the profits of business that are being shipped overseas. \nThey're higher than ever. It is the jobs of American workers that are \nbeing outsourced, and they're being outsourced in droves. Hardworking \nAmericans are paying a high price for this intense new era of worldwide \ncompetition. Our economy is growing, but workers are not benefiting. \nBusiness profits are up 70 percent since 2001, but wages have been \nstagnant.\n  Labor unions have always led the fight for working families--for the \n8-hour day and the 40-hour week--for overtime protections--for a fair \nminimum wage--for a safe and healthy workplace--for decent health \ninsurance and a decent pension. Every working American deserves these \nprotections. But when they try to organize, employers typically respond \nwith threats and intimidation. They hire union-busting firms and force \nemployees to listen to anti-union speeches. Companies close down \ndepartments--or even entire operations--to avoid negotiating a union \ncontract.\n  These are not isolated abuses. Every year, over 20,000 workers are \nillegally fired or discriminated against for exercising their labor \nrights. In at least one quarter of all organizing efforts, an employer \nillegally fires a worker for supporting the union. For these anti-union \nemployers, union-busting is just another cost of doing business. \nAmerica's workers deserve better, and our democracy deserves better.\n  That is why I am introducing the Employee Free Choice Act, to protect \nthe right of workers to choose a union. This bill seeks to level the \nplaying field for employees attempting to organize a union or negotiate \ntheir first contract. It requires employers to come to the table to \ntalk. And it puts real teeth in existing protections by strengthening \nthe penalties for discriminating against workers who support a union.\n  These protections are long overdue. For too long, Congress has failed \nto act against the anti-labor, anti-worker, anti-union tactics now far \ntoo prevalent in the workplace. This bill is an important step towards \nensuring that millions of American workers and their families can do \nbetter in today's economy. I urge my colleagues to join me in this \nfight to support the Employee Free Choice Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 845. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to permit \nretired servicemembers who have a service-connected disability to \nreceive disability compensation and either retired pay or Combat-\nRelated Special Compensation and to eliminate the phase-in period with \nrespect to such concurrent receipt; read the first time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 845\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) For more than 100 years before 1999, all disabled \n     military retirees were required to fund their own veterans' \n     disability compensation by forfeiting $1 of earned retired \n     pay for each $1 received in veterans' disability \n     compensation.\n\n[[Page S3902]]\n\n       (2) Since 1999, Congress has enacted legislation every year \n     to progressively expand eligibility criteria for relief of \n     the retired pay disability offset and further reduce the \n     burden of financial sacrifice on disabled military retirees.\n       (3) Absent adequate funding to eliminate the sacrifice for \n     all disabled retirees, Congress has given initial priority to \n     easing financial inequities for the most severely disabled \n     and for combat-disabled retirees.\n       (4) In the interest of maximizing eligibility within cost \n     constraints, Congress effectively has authorized full \n     concurrent receipt for all qualifying retirees with 100 \n     percent disability ratings and all with combat-related \n     disability ratings, while phasing out the disability offset \n     to retired pay over 10 years for retired members with \n     noncombat-related, service-connected disability ratings of 50 \n     percent to 90 percent.\n       (5) In pursuing these good-faith efforts, Congress \n     acknowledges the regrettable necessity of creating new \n     thresholds of eligibility that understandably are \n     disappointing to disabled retirees who fall short of meeting \n     those new thresholds.\n       (6) Congress is not content with the status quo.\n\n     SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that military retired pay \n     earned by service and sacrifice in defending the Nation \n     should not be reduced because a military retiree is also \n     eligible for veterans' disability compensation awarded for \n     service-connected disability.\n\n     SEC. 3. ELIGIBILITY FOR PAYMENT OF BOTH RETIRED PAY AND \n                   VETERANS' DISABILITY COMPENSATION FOR CERTAIN \n                   ADDITIONAL MILITARY RETIREES WITH COMPENSABLE \n                   SERVICE-CONNECTED DISABILITIES.\n\n       (a) Extension of Concurrent Receipt Authority to Retirees \n     With Service-Connected Disabilities Rated Less Than 50 \n     Percent.--Section 1414(a) of title 10, United States Code, is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(a) Payment of Both Retired Pay and Compensation.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Subject to subsection (b), an individual \n     who is a qualified retiree for any month is entitled to be \n     paid both retired pay and veterans' disability compensation \n     for that month without regard to sections 5304 and 5305 of \n     title 38.\n       ``(2) Qualified retirees.--For purposes of this section, a \n     qualified retiree, with respect to any month, is a member or \n     former member of the uniformed services who--\n       ``(A) is entitled to retired pay, other than in the case of \n     a member retired under chapter 61 of this title with less \n     than 20 years of service creditable under section 1405 of \n     this title and less than 20 years of service computed under \n     section 12732 of this title; and\n       ``(B) is entitled for that month to veterans' disability \n     compensation.''.\n       (b) Repeal of Phase-In of Concurrent Receipt of Retired Pay \n     and Veterans' Disability Compensation.--Section 1414 of title \n     10, United States Code, is further amended--\n       (1) by striking subsection (c);\n       (2) by redesignating subsections (d) and (e) as subsections \n     (c) and (d), respectively; and\n       (3) in subsection (d), as redesignated, by striking \n     subparagraph (4).\n       (c) Clerical Amendments.--\n       (1) The heading for section 1414 of title 10, United States \n     Code, is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 1414.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING MULTIEMPLOYER PENSION \n                   PLANS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Multiemployer pension plans have been a major force in \n     the delivery of employee benefits to active and retired \n     American workers and their dependents for over half a \n     century.\n       (2) There are approximately 1,700 multiemployer defined \n     benefit pension plans in which approximately 9,700,000 \n     workers and retirees participate.\n       (3) Three-quarters of the approximately 60,000 to 65,000 \n     employers that participate in multiemployer plans have fewer \n     that 100 employees.\n       (4) Multiemployer plans allow for greater access and \n     affordability for smaller employers and pension portability \n     for their employees as they move from one job to another, and \n     permit workers to earn a pension where they might otherwise \n     not be able to do so.\n       (5) The 2000-2002 drop in the stock market and decline in \n     equity values has affected all investors, including \n     multiemployer plans.\n       (6) The decline in value sustained by multiemployer defined \n     benefit pension plans have threatened the stability of this \n     private sector source of secure retirement income.\n       (7) Participating employers could face onerous excise taxes \n     and other penalties as a result of the serious, adverse \n     financial impact due to these market losses.\n       (8) In 2004, the United States Senate recognized the \n     severity of this situation and passed by an overwhelmingly, \n     large bipartisan margin of 86 to 9 temporary relief \n     provisions for single and multiemployer defined benefit \n     pension plans.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Senate--\n       (1) expresses its strong support for multiemployer defined \n     benefit pension plans;\n       (2) recognizes the importance of an environment in which \n     multiemployer plans can continue their vital role in \n     providing benefits to working men and women;\n\n[[Page S3903]]\n\n       (3) recognizes that multiemployer pension plan relief must \n     be designed for the multiemployer labor-relations environment \n     that supports the plans; and\n       (4) supports legislation to strengthen and protect the \n     viability of multiemployer pension plans for the continued \n     benefit of current and retired members, and their families \n     and survivors, and to strengthen the ability of all plans to \n     address funding problems that occur.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself and Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 850.

A bill to create a fair and efficient system to resolve \nclaims of victims for bodily injury caused by asbestos exposure, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nlegislation which may be cited as the Fairness In Asbestos Injury \nResolution Act of 2005. I do so on behalf of Senator Leahy, the ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, the former chairman \nof the committee, Senator Feinstein, Senator DeWine, Senator Baucus, \nSenator Voinovich and Senator Grassley. There are others in the wings \nwaiting to cosponsor, but this is a very complex bill, ranging over 300 \npages. Quite a number of my colleagues have told me they are supportive \nof the bill and are making the final check to determine cosponsorship.\n  Several months ago, a discussion draft was circulated. Last week, \nafter a great many refinements had been added, the current bill was \ncirculated. There have been a couple of relatively minor changes which \nhave been added to this bill, but it is essentially the same as the \ncirculation bill which was submitted a week ago.\n  I compliment my distinguished colleague, Senator Leahy, the ranking \nmember, for his diligence, hard work and cooperation in structuring a \nbill with a great many moving parts, which he and I have been able to \nagree upon on the core principles.\n  We have adopted a position that we will work jointly to retain these \ncore provisions. We are open to suggestions and amendments and \nmodifications which do not impact on these core provisions. But it is a \nvery difficult matter to structure an asbestos bill which can pass the \nSenate. There are 55 Republicans. You need at least five Democrats. It \nhas to be a balanced bill, and it is our submission that this is a \nbalanced bill.\n  A great deal of credit is due to senior Federal Judge Edward R. \nBecker, who until May 5, his 70th birthday, in the year 2003 was the \nchief judge of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit who wrote the \nopinion on the asbestos litigation which reached the Supreme Court of \nthe United States.\n  When the Judiciary Committee passed out of committee legislation on \nasbestos in July of 2003, the distinguished Presiding Officer was on \nthe committee at that time and can attest to the 12-hour marathon \nsession we had. We did so significantly along party lines to move the \nlegislation along, recognizing it had many problems. At my request, \nJudge Becker then convened the so-called stakeholders in his chambers \nin Philadelphia for 2 days in August, the stakeholders being identified \nas the manufacturers, the AFL-CIO, the insurance industry, and the \ntrial lawyers.\n\n[[Page S3906]]\n\n  To recite the power and diversity and difference of opinion of these \ngroups is to suggest the complication of bringing the stakeholders \ntogether on a piece of complex legislation.\n  Following those 2 days of meetings in Judge Becker's chambers, we \nhave had some 36 sessions in my conference room here in the Hart Senate \nOffice Building where Judge Becker presided and I assisted, and we \nworked out a great many of the issues to the satisfaction of the \nstakeholders.\n  One of the core provisions of the bill is that there is a trust fund \nof $140 billion. It is always difficult on projections to be absolutely \ncertain, but I believe there is a very high probability that this trust \nfund will be adequate to pay all of the claims.\n  In very extensive testimony from Goldman Sachs on very carefully \ncalculated projections, it was projected that the total cost of \npayments would be $118 billion. There is a considerable cushion between \n$118 billion and $140 billion. If for some unexpected reason the trust \nfund is insufficient, then those who have been injured by exposure to \nasbestos will be able to revert to jury trials.\n  All of us are mindful of the very substantial factor when a claimant \ngives up a constitutional right to jury trial, but in a program \nstructured largely along lines of workmen's compensation, it is our \nconclusion that it is a fair exchange.\n  When you find that there are many people who are suffering deadly \nailments from asbestos, mesothelioma and other deadly injuries, who are \nnot being compensated, this is a way to compensate those individuals \nwhose companies have gone bankrupt. Over 75 companies have gone \nbankrupt at a tremendous impact to the economy. This will relieve the \ncompanies of the onerous threat of bankruptcy--and they are taking \nadditional companies with rapidity.\n  On one development which candidly surprised me, last week, when we \ncirculated the draft bill a week ago today, there was a 25-point bump \nin the stock market for asbestos companies. When we had a meeting later \nin the day and deferred production of the bill, the stock market went \ndown to some extent. There is some consideration that the stock market \nis wiser even than Congress. Perhaps that would take a whole lot. But \nthe reaction of the stock market is an indication of the importance of \nresolving this asbestos issue in order to give the economy a start.\n  The hour is late. There are others who wish to seek recognition. The \ndistinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee is waiting \nthrough this nongermane part of his business, and the distinguished \nDemocratic leader, I know, wants to seek recognition.\n  I shall include the remainder of my statement in the Record and ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce new \n     legislation, the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act \n     of 2005, FAIR Act, the successor to S. 1125 and S. 2290, the \n     FAIR Acts of 2003 and 2004. My colleagues Senator Frist, \n     Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy deserve enormous credit for \n     the drafting of these acts and for the development of this \n     legislation. There is a will in the Senate to enact \n     legislation that should put an end to the ongoing rash of \n     bankruptcies, growing monthly; diverting resources from those \n     who are truly sick; endangering jobs and pensions; and \n     creating the worst litigation crisis in the history of the \n     American judicial system. The Congress plainly wants a more \n     rational asbestos claims system, and I believe that this \n     legislation offers a realistic prospect of accomplishing that \n     result.\n       This legislation provides substantial assurances of \n     acceptable compensation to asbestos victims and substantial \n     assurances to manufacturers and insurers to resolve, with \n     finality, asbestos claims. For more than two decades, a \n     solution to the asbestos crisis has eluded Congress and the \n     courts. Seventy-four companies have gone bankrupt, thousands \n     of individuals who have been exposed to asbestos have deadly \n     diseases--mesothelioma and other such ailments--and are not \n     being compensated. According to The Rand Institute for Civil \n     Justice, ``about two-thirds of the claims are now filed by \n     the unimpaired, while in the past they were filed only by the \n     manifestly ill.'' According to Rand, the number of claims \n     continues to rise, with over 600,000 claims filed already and \n     300,000 pending. The number of asbestos defendants also has \n     risen sharply, from about 300 in the 1980s, to more than \n     8,400 today and most are users of the product, not its \n     manufacturers. These companies span 85 percent of the U.S. \n     economy and nearly every U.S. industry, and include \n     automakers, shipbuilders, textile mills, retailers, insurers, \n     shipbuilders, electric utilities and virtually any company \n     involved in manufacturing or construction in the last 30 \n     years.\n       Asbestos leaves many victims in its wake. First and \n     foremost, the sick and their families have suffered. But the \n     flawed asbestos litigation system not only hurts the sick and \n     their chance at receiving fair compensation, but also claims \n     other victims. These include employees, retirees and \n     shareholders of affected companies whose jobs, savings and \n     retirement plans are also jeopardized by the tide of asbestos \n     cases. With asbestos litigation affecting so many companies, \n     this also impacts the overall economy, including jobs, \n     pensions, stock prices, tax revenues and insurance costs. \n     According to a 2002 study by Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, \n     asbestos bankruptcies have cost nearly 60,000 workers their \n     jobs and $200 million in lost wages. Employees' retirement \n     funds have shrunken by 25 percent.\n       In July 2003, the Judiciary Committee voted out S. 1125, a \n     bill with many problems, largely along party lines, in an \n     effort to move the legislation. S. 1125 created the basic \n     structure of the legislation, and made a huge stride in \n     working out the medical criteria. However, the bill \n     floundered on other issues. In August 2003, at my request, \n     Judge Edward R. Becker, a Federal judge for 34 years, \n     convened in his chambers in Philadelphia for 2 days the so-\n     called stakeholders--manufacturers, labor, AFL-CIO, insurers \n     and trial lawyers--to determine if some common ground could \n     be found. Until the preceding May, Judge Becker had been the \n     chief judge of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals and wrote \n     the opinion in the asbestos class action suit which was \n     affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n       From September 2003 through January 2005, there were some \n     36 stakeholder meetings held in my conference room, with \n     Judge Becker as a pro-bono mediator, usually attended by \n     25 to 40 representatives and sometimes over 75 present. I \n     have also met 15 times since January with various \n     officials from the administration, members of the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee and their staffs, the Senate \n     leadership and other various senators all in an effort to \n     move this bill forward. Judge Becker and I have sought an \n     equitable bill which took into account, to the maximum \n     extent possible, the concerns of the stakeholders and to \n     get their input on drafting of the bill. After analysis \n     and deliberation, we found we could accommodate many of \n     the competing interests.\n       This process commenced with the blessing of Chairman Hatch \n     and Ranking Member Leahy of the Judiciary Committee. This \n     extended process allowed the stakeholders an extraordinary \n     ``hearing'' process and really amounted to the longest \n     ``mark-up'' in Senate history although not in the customary \n     framework. We have had the cooperation of many Senators. \n     Senators Hatch and Leahy have had representatives at all the \n     meetings. The majority leader, Senator Hatch, and Senator \n     Leahy have addressed this ``working group'' at our meetings. \n     Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy's representatives have been \n     active participants at every meeting, as well as the members \n     of the staffs of Senators Baucus, Biden, Brownback, Burns, \n     Carper, Chafee, Chambliss, Coburn, Cornyn, Craig, DeWine, \n     Dodd, Durbin, Feingold, Feinstein, L. Graham, Grassley, \n     Hagel, Kennedy, Kohl, Kyl, Landrieu, Levin, Lincoln, Murray, \n     Ben Nelson, Pryor, Schumer, Sessions, Snowe, Stabenow, and \n     Voinovich.\n       The concept of a trust fund is an outstanding idea. Senator \n     Hatch deserves great credit for moving the legislation in the \n     direction of a trust fund with a schedule of payments \n     analogous to workers' compensation so the cases would not \n     have to go through the litigation process. Under this \n     proposal, the Federal Government would establish a national \n     trust fund privately financed by asbestos defendant companies \n     and insurers. No taxpayer money would be involved. Asbestos \n     victims would simply submit their claims to the fund. \n     Claimants would be fairly compensated if they meet medical \n     criteria for certain illnesses and show past asbestos \n     exposure. The trust fund would guarantee compensation for \n     impaired victims.\n       Through the series of meetings with Judge Becker, we have \n     wrestled with and have been able to solve a number of very \n     complex issues. The size of the trust fund was always a \n     principal issue of dispute, starting at $108 billion. The \n     manufacturers/insurers raised their offer to $140 billion. \n     Last October, Majority Leader Frist and then-Democratic \n     Leader Daschle agreed to $140 billion. When Senator Frist and \n     Senator Daschle, in an adversarial context, agreed to the \n     adequacy of the $140 billion figure, it is difficult to \n     exceed it even though the AFL-CIO did not contemporaneously \n     agree.\n       It is not possible to say definitely what figure would be \n     adequate because it depends on the uncertainty of how many \n     claims will be filed. There is support for the adequacy of \n     the $140 billion figure from reputable projections. But they \n     are, admittedly, only projections.\n       The real safety valve, if the fund is unable to pay claims, \n     is for the injured to have the ability to go back to court if \n     the system is not operational and able to pay exigent health \n     claims within 9 months after enactment, and all other valid \n     claims within 24 months of enactment. Upon reversion to the \n     tort system, the bill provides that claimants may file suits \n     either in Federal court or\n\n[[Page S3907]]\n\n     State court in the state in which the plaintiff resides or \n     State court in the state where the asbestos exposure took \n     place.\n       The claimants object to any hiatus between access to the \n     courts and an operating system; but the reality is that court \n     delays are customarily longer than the delay structured in \n     this system. The defendants and insurers object saying it \n     is too short a time frame, but they have the power to \n     expedite the process by promptly paying their assessments. \n     I am confident that there will be no problem in \n     administering the system and processing the claims. The \n     leaders of the Manville Trust and the Rand Institute study \n     and point out that the volume of claims can be efficiently \n     administered by the fund administrator using a technique \n     developed by the Manville Trust and other similar claims \n     facilities that have processed asbestos claims for many \n     years. The Manville Trust has processed as many as 150,000 \n     claims per year. The number of exigent claims anticipated \n     in the first 9 months of the fund is vastly smaller and \n     even the total number of claims anticipated in the first \n     24 months is significantly less that which the Manville \n     Trust has handled in a comparable period. Additionally, \n     the bill provides the administrator with the option to \n     contract out the exigent claims to a claims facility for \n     expedited processing under the standards of the fund on a \n     voluntary basis. The short time frame will prod the system \n     to become operative at an early date. The bill sends the \n     claims back to the fund as soon as it is certified \n     operational with a credit for any payment of the scheduled \n     amount.\n       Similarly, the defendants seek a commitment that the \n     legislation will bar return to the courts for at least 7\\1/2\\ \n     years. It is hard to see how the substantial fund would be \n     expended in a lesser period. Here again, the legislation \n     gives the defendant substantial assurances that the system \n     will last at least 7\\1/2\\ years. If it collapses, the \n     claimants should not bear the burden, but should reclaim \n     their constitutional right to a jury trial. However, sunset \n     cannot take place before there is an extensive and rigorous \n     ``program review.'' This would give the administrator an \n     opportunity re-fashion the program to compensate for any \n     major shortcomings.\n       The claimants sought $60 billion in startup contributions \n     within 5 years and the defendants countered with a maximum of \n     $40 billion. The fund's borrowing power should enable it to \n     borrow at least the balance of $20 billion because of the \n     defendants continuing substantial financial commitments. Here \n     again, the bill meets the standard of substantial assurances, \n     albeit not perfect certainty, that $60 billion will be in \n     hand within the first 5 years.\n       A key issue for the claimant has been that of workers' \n     compensation subrogation. This issue is important because the \n     value of an award to the claimant depends on whether the \n     claimant may have to pay a substantial amount of it to \n     others. While the precise picture is different from State to \n     State, in general, workers' compensation laws give \n     employers--and their insurance carriers--subrogation rights \n     against third-party tortfeasors and a lien on the injured \n     employee's recovery from a third-part tortfeasor. This is a \n     big issue because workers' compensation covers the employee's \n     medical costs.\n       I closely examined and considered including a proposal that \n     would have called for a so-called workers' compensation \n     ``holiday.'' Such a proposal would have provided for a \n     ``holiday'' from worker's compensation payments during the \n     period of receipt of payments from trust fund except to the \n     extent that the compensation would exceed them, with a waiver \n     of past and future subrogation. However, as each State has \n     different workers' compensation laws and I concluded that \n     such a proposal may go beyond the practice in a number of \n     States, leaving some claimants with a significantly reduced \n     award.\n       Furthermore, while not undisputed like some other matters \n     on this legislation, there is some significant basis in the \n     assertion by claimants that the award values in the bill were \n     designed with the concept in mind that there would be no \n     liens or rights of subrogation against the claimants based on \n     workers' compensation awards and health insurance payments.\n       Therefore, in the final analysis, it has been determined \n     that to be fair to victims, claimants should be allowed to \n     retain and receive the full value of both their fund awards \n     and workers' compensation payments. It is important that the \n     bill must extinguish any liens or rights of subrogation that \n     other parties might otherwise assert against the claimants \n     based on workers' compensation awards and health insurance \n     payments.\n       Another key issue for the claimants has been the \n     legislation's treatment of asbestos disease claims under the \n     Federal Employers' Liability Act, FELA, the workers' \n     compensation system for rail workers. Earlier versions of the \n     bill would have preempted FELA claims for asbestos-related \n     diseases, limiting victim's recovery to compensation under a \n     national asbestos trust fund. Rail labor asserts that such an \n     approach is unfair to rail workers, since for all other \n     workers, the bill maintains workers' compensation rights. \n     Alternative approaches to dealing with the FELA issue have \n     been proposed, including providing for a supplemental \n     payment, in addition to awards under the bill, to provide \n     compensation to rail workers for work-related asbestos \n     diseases. The AFL-CIO's affiliates who represent workers in \n     the rail industry have been engaged in discussions with \n     industry on this issue, and a fair resolution has been \n     reached. The bill provides for a principled compromise that \n     would allow for a special adjustment for railroad workers so \n     that the compensation award would be structured in a manner \n     that would allow for corollary benefits--similar benefits for \n     workers under FELA and workers compensation. It also \n     clarifies that this legislation intends to deal solely with \n     asbestos claims and does not in any manner impact FELA.\n       In these marathon discussions, plus the January 11 and \n     February 2 hearings, I understand the deep concerns expressed \n     by the stakeholder representatives on more concessions for \n     their clients. On the state of the 20-year record, this \n     choice is not between this bill and one which would give \n     their clients more concessions. The choice is between this \n     bill and the continuation of the present chaotic system which \n     leaves uncompensated thousands of victims suffering from \n     deadly diseases and litigation driving more companies into \n     bankruptcy.\n       We considered at length the manufactures/insurers \n     objections to medical screening, but concluded such a \n     provision was necessary as an offset to the reduced role of \n     claimant's attorney. With the previous potential of a \n     substantial contingent fee, claimant's attorneys identified \n     those damaged by exposure to asbestos. Absent that \n     motivation, with the attorneys fees capped at 5 percent, it \n     is reasonable to have routine examinations for people who \n     would not be expected to go for such checkups on their own; \n     so as a matter of basic fairness, such screening is provided. \n     By establishing a program with rigorous standards, as we have \n     done in this bill, unmeritorious claims can be avoided with \n     the fair determination of those entitled to compensation \n     under the statutory standard.\n       The legislation has closely examined the issues of so-\n     called ``leakage'' in the fund and has provided that all \n     asbestos claims pending on the date of enactment, except for \n     nonconsolidated cases actually on trial, and except cases \n     subject to a verdict or final order or final judgment, will \n     be brought into the asbestos trust fund. Furthermore, only \n     written settlement agreements, executed prior to date of \n     enactment, between a defendant and a specifically \n     identifiable plaintiff will be preserved outside of the \n     fund; the settlement agreement must contain an express \n     obligation by the settling defendant to make a future \n     monetary payment to the individual plaintiff, but gives \n     the plaintiff 30 days to fulfill all conditions of the \n     settlement agreement.\n       The legislation includes language which is designed to \n     ensure prompt judicial review of a variety of regulatory \n     actions and to ensure that any constitutional uncertainties \n     with regard to the legislation are resolved as quickly as \n     possible. Specifically, it provides that any action \n     challenging the constitutionality of any provision of the act \n     must be brought in the United States District Court for the \n     District of Columbia. The bill also authorizes direct appeal \n     to the Supreme Court on an expedited basis. An action under \n     this section is to be filed within 60 days after the date of \n     enactment or 60 days after the final action of the \n     administrator or the commission giving rise to the action, \n     whichever is later. The district court and Supreme Court are \n     required to expedite to the greatest possible extent the \n     disposition of the action and appeal.\n       Claimants also expressed the need for assurances that the \n     manufacturers payment into the fund. Therefore, the \n     legislation also requires enhanced ``transparency'' of the \n     payments by the defendants and insurers into the fund. The \n     proposal provides that 20 days after the end of such 60-day \n     period, the administrator shall publish in the Federal \n     Register a list of such submissions, including the name of \n     such persons or ultimate parents and the likely tier to which \n     such persons or affiliated groups may be assigned. After \n     publication of such list, any person may submit to the \n     administrator information on the identity of any other person \n     that may have obligations under the fund. In addition, there \n     are enhanced notice and disclosure requirements included in \n     the draft. It also provides that within 60 days after the \n     date of enactment, any person who, acting in good faith, has \n     knowledge that such person or such person's affiliated group \n     would result in placement in the top tiers, shall submit to \n     the administrator either the name of such person or such \n     person's ultimate parent; and the likely tier to which such \n     person or affiliated group may be assigned under this act.\n       This legislation deals with a number of very complex \n     issues, one of them being that of ``mixed-dust.'' I held a \n     hearing in the Judiciary Committee on this issue on February \n     2, 2005. The manufacturers fear that many asbestos claims \n     will be ``repackaged'' as silica claims in the tort system. \n     Evidence adduced at the hearing reflects that this has been \n     happening in a number of jurisdictions. If a claim is due to \n     asbestos exposure at all, the program should be the exclusive \n     means of compensation. The stakeholders agree that this is an \n     asbestos bill, designed to dispose of all asbestos claims but \n     that workers with genuine silica exposure disease ought to be \n     able to pursue their claims in the tort system. The problem \n     is that with those claims where the point of demarcation is \n     unclear. Silica/asbestos defendants are worried that they \n     will find themselves in court with the burden of proving that \n     the plaintiff's injury is due to asbestos rather than silica. \n     This legislation makes clear that pure silica claims are not \n     preempted, but claims involving asbestos disease are \n     preempted. A claimant must provide rigorous medical evidence\n\n[[Page S3908]]\n\n     establishing by a preponderance of evidence that their \n     functional impairment was caused by exposure to silica, and \n     asbestos exposure was not a significant contributing factor. \n     Although this does impose the burden on the claimant, this \n     is no different than the burden the plaintiff or any party \n     advancing a position has in producing medical evidence in \n     any case that the will physician will state that a disease \n     was caused by some condition or exposure or that it was \n     not caused by some condition or exposure. In addition, the \n     testimony given at the February 2 hearing on the issue \n     established that asbestos and silica are easily \n     distinguishable on xray and that asbestos and silica \n     rarely are found in the same patient.\n       Another very complicated issue addressed this legislation, \n     is that of providing for award adjustments for exceptional \n     mesothelioma cases based on age and the number of dependents \n     of the claimant. For example, a mesothelioma victim who is 40 \n     years old with two children will be able to get an upwards \n     adjustment in his award amount as compared to a 80 years \n     mesothelioma victim with no dependents. The impact of such \n     adjustments to the fund will remain revenue-neutral.\n       There has been a strong concern that this bill should not \n     become a ``smokers'' bill rather than an asbestos bill--that \n     thousands of smokers will claim to be in the Level VII \n     compensation tier in order to get money even if asbestos had \n     nothing to do with their disease. After long discussions with \n     the various sides, it has been decided to remove Level VII \n     cases from the fund, cases which had the potential to bring \n     down the entire fund.\n       There has also been a concern with the legitimacy of the \n     Level VI compensation tier. I requested that the Institute of \n     Medicine, IOM, commence a study to assess the medical \n     evidence so as to determine whether colorectal, laryngeal, \n     esophageal, pharyngeal or stomach cancer can be caused by \n     asbestos exposure. The IOM will conclude its study of Level \n     VI causation by April 2006. With a 270-day stay on exigent \n     cases and 2-year stay of all other cases, this has the \n     practical impact of the IOM study results being conclusive on \n     inclusion or exclusion of Level VI prior to any claim being \n     filed.\n       Therefore, the bill retains the Level VI tier pending the \n     IOM study conclusions but continues to provide extensive \n     safeguards to the fund against those individuals with these \n     diseases making claims against the asbestos trust fund. Any \n     Level VI claim must be based on findings by a board certified \n     pathologists accompanied by evidence of a bilateral asbestos-\n     related nonmalignant disease; evidence of 15 or more weighted \n     years of substantial occupations exposure to asbestos; and \n     supporting medical documentation establishing asbestos \n     exposure as a contributing factor in causing the cancer in \n     question. The claim must also be referred to a physicians \n     panel for a determination that it is more probable than not \n     that asbestos exposure was a substantial contributing factor \n     in causing the other cancer in question. Further, the bill \n     mandates that the physicians panel review the claimants \n     smoking history as opposed to ``claimant may request.''\n       This is a complicated bill, but one that is both integrated \n     and comprehensive and reflective of a remarkable will to \n     enact legislation. If this bill is rejected, I do not see the \n     agenda of this Senate Judiciary Committee revisiting the \n     issue. I cannot conceive of a more strenuous effort being \n     directed to this subject that has been done over the past two \n     years. This is the last best chance.\n       I remain confident that we can forge and enact a bill that \n     is fair to the claimants and to business and that will put an \n     end once and for all to this nightmare chapter in American \n     legal, economic and social history. If We can summon the \n     legislative will in a bipartisan spirit, it can be done.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent between the comments I have \nmade, which have not been made from a text, and the text of my language \nwhich I am currently stating, be included, so that those who read the \nCongressional Record, if anyone does, will know the repetition in the \nprepared text is occasioned by the fact that the initial statement was \nmade without reference to a text and there will necessarily be some \nrepetition in the prepared text.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 852\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Millions of Americans have been exposed to forms of \n     asbestos that can have devastating health effects.\n       (2) Various injuries can be caused by exposure to some \n     forms of asbestos, including pleural disease and some forms \n     of cancer.\n       (3) The injuries caused by asbestos can have latency \n     periods of up to 40 years, and even limited exposure to some \n     forms of asbestos may result in injury in some cases.\n       (4) Asbestos litigation has had a significant detrimental \n     effect on the country's economy, driving companies into \n     bankruptcy, diverting resources from those who are truly \n     sick, and endangering jobs and pensions.\n       (5) The scope of the asbestos litigation crisis cuts across \n     every State and virtually every industry.\n       (6) The United States Supreme Court has recognized that \n     Congress must act to create a more rational asbestos claims \n     system. In 1991, a Judicial Conference Ad Hoc Committee on \n     Asbestos Litigation, appointed by Chief Justice William \n     Rehnquist, found that the ``ultimate solution should be \n     legislation recognizing the national proportions of the \n     problem . . . and creating a national asbestos dispute \n     resolution scheme . . .''. The Court found in 1997 in Amchem \n     Products Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 595 (1997), that \n     ``[t]he\n\n[[Page S3909]]\n\n     argument is sensibly made that a nationwide administrative \n     claims processing regime would provide the most secure, fair, \n     and efficient means of compensating victims of asbestos \n     exposure.'' In 1999, the Court in Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., \n     527 U.S. 819, 821 (1999), found that the ``elephantine mass \n     of asbestos cases . . . defies customary judicial \n     administration and calls for national legislation.'' That \n     finding was again recognized in 2003 by the Court in Norfolk \n     & Western Railway Co. v. Ayers, 123 S. Ct. 1210 (2003).\n       (7) This crisis, and its significant effect on the health \n     and welfare of the people of the United States, on interstate \n     and foreign commerce, and on the bankruptcy system, compels \n     Congress to exercise its power to regulate interstate \n     commerce and create this legislative solution in the form of \n     a national asbestos injury claims resolution program to \n     supersede all existing methods to compensate those injured by \n     asbestos, except as specified in this Act.\n       (8) This crisis has also imposed a deleterious burden upon \n     the United States bankruptcy courts, which have assumed a \n     heavy burden of administering complicated and protracted \n     bankruptcies with limited personnel.\n       (9) This crisis has devastated many communities across the \n     country, but hardest hit has been Libby, Montana, where \n     tremolite asbestos, 1 of the most deadly forms of asbestos, \n     was contained in the vermiculite ore mined from the area and \n     despite ongoing cleanup by the Environmental Protection \n     Agency, many still suffer from the deadly dust.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to--\n       (1) create a privately funded, publicly administered fund \n     to provide the necessary resources for a fair and efficient \n     system to resolve asbestos injury claims that will provide \n     compensation for legitimate present and future claimants of \n     asbestos exposure as provided in this Act;\n       (2) provide compensation to those present and future \n     victims based on the severity of their injuries, while \n     establishing a system flexible enough to accommodate \n     individuals whose conditions worsens;\n       (3) relieve the Federal and State courts of the burden of \n     the asbestos litigation; and\n       (4) increase economic stability by resolving the asbestos \n     litigation crisis that has bankrupted companies with asbestos \n     liability, diverted resources from the truly sick, and \n     endangered jobs and pensions.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Before final regulations being promulgated relating to \n     claims processing, the Interim Administrator may prioritize \n     claims processing, without regard to the time requirements \n     prescribed in subtitle B of this title, based on severity of \n     illness and likelihood that the illness in question was \n     caused by exposure to asbestos.\n       (f) Stay of Claims; Return to Tort System.--\n       (1) Stay of claims.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, any asbestos claim pending as of the date of \n     enactment of this Act, other than a claim to which section \n     403(d)(2)(A) applies, shall be subject to a stay.\n       (2) Exigent health claims.--\n       (A) Procedures for settlement of exigent health claims.--\n       (i) In general.--Any person that has filed a timely exigent \n     health claim seeking a judgment or order for monetary damages \n     in any Federal or State court before or after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, may immediately seek an offer of \n     judgment of such claim in accordance with this subparagraph.\n       (ii) Filing.--\n\n       (I) In general.--The claimant shall file with the \n     Administrator and serve upon all defendants in the pending \n     court action an election to pursue an offer of judgment--\n\n       (aa) within 60 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, if the claim was filed in a Federal or State court \n     before such date of enactment; and\n       (bb) within 60 days after the date of the filing of the \n     claim, if the claim is filed in a Federal or State court on \n     or after the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n       (II) Stay.--If the claimant fails to file and serve a \n     timely election under this clause, the stay under \n     subparagraph (B) shall remain in effect.\n\n       (iii) Information.--A claimant who has filed a timely \n     election under clause (ii) shall within 60 days after filing \n     provide to each defendant and to the Administrator--\n\n       (I) the amount received or due to be received as a result \n     of all settlements that would qualify as a collateral source \n     under section 134, together with copies of all settlement \n     agreements and related documents sufficient to show the \n     accuracy of that amount;\n       (II) all information that the claimant would be required to \n     provide to the Administrator in support of a claim under \n     sections 115 and 121; and\n       (III) a certification by the claimant that the information \n     provided is true and complete.\n\n       (iv) Certification.--The certification provided under \n     clause (iii) shall be subject to the same penalties for false \n     or misleading statements that would be applicable with regard \n     to information provided to the Administrator in support of a \n     claim.\n       (v) Offer of judgment.--Within 30 days after service of a \n     complete set of the information described in clause (iii), \n     any defendant may file and serve on all parties a good faith \n     offer of judgment in an aggregate amount not to exceed the \n     total amount to which the claimant may be entitled under \n     section 131 after adjustment for collateral sources under \n     section 134. If the aggregate amount offered by all \n     defendants exceeds the limitation in this clause, all offers \n     shall be deemed reduced pro-rata until the aggregate amount \n     equals the amount provided under section 131.\n       (vi) Acceptance or rejection.--Within 20 days after the \n     service of the last offer of judgment, the claimant shall \n     either accept or reject such offers. If the amount of the \n     offer made by any defendant individually, or by any \n     defendants jointly, equals or exceeds 100 percent of what the \n     claimant would receive under the Fund, the claimant shall \n     accept such offer and release any outstanding asbestos \n     claims.\n       (vii) Lump sum payment.--Any accepted offer of judgment \n     shall be payable within 30 days and in 1 lump sum in order to \n     settle the pending claim.\n       (viii) Recovery of costs.--Any defendant whose offer of \n     judgment is accepted and has settled an asbestos claim under \n     clauses (vi) and (vii) may recover the cost of such \n     settlement by deducting from its next and subsequent \n     contributions to the Fund for the full amount of the payment \n     made by such defendant to the exigent health claimant, unless \n     the Administrator finds, on the basis of clear and convincing \n     evidence, that--\n\n       (I) the claimant did not meet the requirements of an \n     exigent health claim; and\n       (II) the defendant's offer was collusive or otherwise not \n     in good faith.\n\n       (ix) Indemnification.--In any case in which the \n     Administrator refuses to grant full indemnification under \n     clause (viii), the Administrator may provide such partial \n     indemnification as may be fair and just in the circumstances. \n     If Administrator denies indemnification, the defendant may \n     seek contribution from other non-settling defendants, as well \n     as reimbursement under the defendant's applicable insurance \n     policies. If the Administrator refuses to grant full or \n     partial indemnification based on collusive action, the \n     defendant may pursue any available remedy against the \n     claimant.\n       (x) Refusal to make offer.--If a defendant refuses to make \n     an offer of judgment, the claimant may continue to seek a \n     judgment or order for monetary damages from the court where \n     the case is currently pending in an amount not to exceed 150 \n     percent of what the claimant would receive if the claimant \n     had filed a claim with the Fund. Such a judgment or order may \n     also provide an award for claimant's attorneys' fees and the \n     costs of litigation.\n       (xi) Rejection of offer.--If the claimant rejects the offer \n     as less than what the claimant would qualify to receive under \n     section 131, the claimant may immediately pursue the claim in \n     court where the claimant shall demonstrate, in addition to \n     all other essential elements of the claimant's claim against \n     any defendant, that the claimant meets the requirements of \n     section 121.\n       (B) Pursual of exigent health claims.--\n       (i) Stay.--If a claimant does not elect to seek an offer of \n     judgment under subparagraph (A), the pending claim is stayed \n     for 9 months after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (ii) Defendant offer.--If a claimant does not elect to seek \n     an offer of judgment under subparagraph (A), the defendant \n     may elect to make an offer according to the provisions of \n     this paragraph, except that a claimant shall not be required \n     to accept that offer. The claimant shall accept or reject the \n     offer within 20 days.\n       (iii) Claims facility.--If a claimant does not elect to \n     seek an offer of judgment under subparagraph (A), the \n     claimant may seek an award from the Fund through the claims \n     facility under section 106 (c)(4).\n       (iv) Continuance of claims.--If, after 9 months after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator cannot \n     certify to Congress that the Fund is operational and paying \n     exigent health claims at a reasonable rate, each person that \n     has filed an exigent health claim before such date of \n     enactment and stayed under this paragraph may continue their \n     exigent health claims in the court where the case was pending \n     on the date of enactment of this Act. For exigent claims \n     filed after the date of enactment of this Act, by claimants \n     who do not elect to seek an offer of judgment under \n     subparagraph (A), the pending claim is stayed for 9 months \n     after the date the claim is filed, unless during that period \n     the Administrator can certify to Congress that the Fund is \n     operational and paying valid claims at a reasonable rate.\n       (C) Credit of claim and effect of operational fund.--If an \n     asbestos claim is pursued in Federal or State court in \n     accordance with this paragraph, any recovery by the claimant \n     shall be a collateral source compensation for purposes of \n     section 134.\n       (3) Pursual of asbestos claims in federal or state court.--\n       (A) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, if, not later than 24 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator cannot certify to \n     Congress that the Fund is operational and paying all valid \n     claims at a reasonable rate, any person with a non-exigent \n     asbestos claim stayed under this paragraph, except for any \n     person whose claim does not exceed a Level I claim, may \n     pursue that claim in the Federal district court or State \n     court located within--\n       (i) the State of residence of the claimant; or\n       (ii) the State in which the asbestos exposure arose.\n       (B) Defendants not found.--If any defendant cannot be found \n     in the State described in clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph \n     (A), the claim may be pursued in the Federal district court \n     or State court located within any State in which the \n     defendant may be found.\n       (C) Determination of most appropriate forum.--If a person \n     alleges that the asbestos exposure occurred in more than 1 \n     county (or Federal district), the trial court shall determine \n     which State and county (or Federal district) is the most \n     appropriate forum for the claim. If the court determines that \n     another forum would be the most appropriate forum for a \n     claim, the court shall dismiss the claim. Any otherwise \n     applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled beginning \n     on the date the claim was filed and ending on the date the \n     claim is dismissed under this subparagraph.\n       (D) State venue requirements.--Nothing in this paragraph \n     shall preempt or supersede any State's law relating to venue \n     requirements within that State which are more restrictive.\n       (E) Credit of claim and effect of operational or \n     nonoperational fund.--\n\n[[Page S3913]]\n\n       (i) Credit of claim.--If an asbestos claim is pursued in \n     Federal or State court in accordance with this paragraph, any \n     recovery by the claimant shall be a collateral source \n     compensation for purposes of section 134.\n       (ii) Operational fund.--If the Administrator subsequently \n     certifies to Congress that the Fund has become operational \n     and paying all valid asbestos claims at a reasonable rate, \n     any claim in a civil action in Federal or State court that is \n     not actually on trial before a jury which has been impaneled \n     and presentation of evidence has commenced, but before its \n     deliberation, or before a judge and is at the presentation of \n     evidence, may, at the option of the claimant, be deemed a \n     reinstated claim against the Fund and the civil action before \n     the Federal or State court shall be null and void.\n       (iii) Nonoperational fund.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this Act, if the Administrator subsequently \n     certifies to Congress that the Fund cannot become operational \n     and paying all valid asbestos claims at a reasonable rate, \n     all asbestos claims that have a stay may be filed or \n     reinstated.\n\n     SEC. 107.

If such \n     information is not received within 1 year after the date of \n     such notification, the claim shall be dismissed.\n\n     SEC. 114. ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS AND CLAIM AWARDS.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) Review of claims.--The Administrator shall, in \n     accordance with this section, determine whether each claim \n     filed under the Fund or claims facility satisfies the \n     requirements for eligibility for an award under this Act and, \n     if so, the value of the award. In making such determinations, \n     the Administrator shall consider the claim presented by the \n     claimant, the factual and medical evidence submitted by the \n     claimant in support of the claim, the medical determinations \n     of any Physicians Panel to which a claim is referred under \n     section 121, and the results of such investigation as the \n     Administrator may deem necessary to determine whether the \n     claim satisfies the criteria for eligibility established by \n     this Act.\n       (2) Additional evidence.--The Administrator may request the \n     submission of medical evidence in addition to the minimum \n     requirements of section 113(c) if necessary or appropriate to \n     make a determination of eligibility for an award, in which \n     case the cost of obtaining such additional information or \n     testing shall be borne by the Office.\n       (b) Proposed Decisions.--Not later than 90 days after the \n     filing of a claim, the Administrator shall provide to the \n     claimant (and the claimant's representative) a proposed \n     decision accepting or rejecting the claim in whole or in part \n     and specifying the amount of the proposed award, if any. The \n     proposed decision shall be in writing, shall contain findings \n     of fact and conclusions of law, and shall contain an \n     explanation of the procedure for obtaining review of the \n     proposed decision.\n       (c) Payments if no Timely Proposed Decision.--If the \n     Administrator has received a\n\n[[Page S3914]]\n\n     complete claim and has not provided a proposed decision to \n     the claimant under subsection (b) within 180 days after the \n     filing of the claim, the claim shall be deemed accepted and \n     the claimant shall be entitled to payment under section \n     133(a)(2). If the Administrator subsequently rejects the \n     claim the claimant shall receive no further payments under \n     section 133. If the Administrator subsequently rejects the \n     claim in part, the Administrator shall adjust future payments \n     due the claimant under section 133 accordingly. In no event \n     may the Administrator recover amounts properly paid under \n     this section from a claimant.\n       (d) Review of Proposed Decisions.--\n       (1) Right to hearing.--\n       (A) In general.--Any claimant not satisfied with a proposed \n     decision of the Administrator under subsection (b) shall be \n     entitled, on written request made within 90 days after the \n     date of the issuance of the decision, to a hearing on the \n     claim of that claimant before a representative of the \n     Administrator. At the hearing, the claimant shall be entitled \n     to present oral evidence and written testimony in further \n     support of that claim.\n       (B) Conduct of hearing.--When practicable, the hearing will \n     be set at a time and place convenient for the claimant. In \n     conducting the hearing, the representative of the \n     Administrator shall not be bound by common law or statutory \n     rules of evidence, by technical or formal rules of procedure, \n     or by section 554 of title 5, United States Code, except as \n     provided by this Act, but shall conduct the hearing in such \n     manner as to best ascertain the rights of the claimant. For \n     this purpose, the representative shall receive such relevant \n     evidence as the claimant adduces and such other evidence as \n     the representative determines necessary or useful in \n     evaluating the claim.\n       (C) Request for subpoenas.--\n       (i) In general.--A claimant may request a subpoena but the \n     decision to grant or deny such a request is within the \n     discretion of the representative of the Administrator. The \n     representative may issue subpoenas for the attendance and \n     testimony of witnesses, and for the production of books, \n     records, correspondence, papers, or other relevant documents. \n     Subpoenas are issued for documents only if such documents are \n     relevant and cannot be obtained by other means, and for \n     witnesses only where oral testimony is the best way to \n     ascertain the facts.\n       (ii) Request.--A claimant may request a subpoena only as \n     part of the hearing process. To request a subpoena, the \n     requester shall--\n\n       (I) submit the request in writing and send it to the \n     representative as early as possible, but no later than 30 \n     days after the date of the original hearing request; and\n       (II) explain why the testimony or evidence is directly \n     relevant to the issues at hand, and a subpoena is the best \n     method or opportunity to obtain such evidence because there \n     are no other means by which the documents or testimony could \n     have been obtained.\n\n       (iii) Fees and mileage.--Any person required by such \n     subpoena to attend as a witness shall be allowed and paid the \n     same fees and mileage as are paid witnesses in the district \n     courts of the United States. Such fees and mileage shall be \n     paid from the Fund.\n       (2) Review of written record.--In lieu of a hearing under \n     paragraph (1), any claimant not satisfied with a proposed \n     decision of the Administrator shall have the option, on \n     written request made within 90 days after the date of the \n     issuance of the decision, of obtaining a review of the \n     written record by a representative of the Administrator. If \n     such review is requested, the claimant shall be afforded an \n     opportunity to submit any written evidence or argument which \n     the claimant believes relevant.\n       (e) Final Decisions.--\n       (1) In general.--If the period of time for requesting \n     review of the proposed decision expires and no request has \n     been filed, or if the claimant waives any objections to the \n     proposed decision, the Administrator shall issue a final \n     decision. If such decision materially differs from the \n     proposed decision, the claimant shall be entitled to review \n     of the decision under subsection (d).\n       (2) Time and content.--If the claimant requests review of \n     all or part of the proposed decision the Administrator shall \n     issue a final decision on the claim not later than 180 days \n     after the request for review is received, if the claimant \n     requests a hearing, or not later than 90 days after the \n     request for review is received, if the claimant requests \n     review of the written record. Such decision shall be in \n     writing and contain findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n       (f) Representation.--A claimant may authorize an attorney \n     or other individual to represent him or her in any proceeding \n     under this Act.\n\n     SEC. 115.

and\n       (C) any additional asbestos exposure requirement under this \n     section.\n       (2) Proof of exposure.--\n       (A) Affidavits.--Exposure to asbestos sufficient to satisfy \n     the exposure requirements for any disease level may be \n     established by an affidavit of--\n       (i) the claimant; or\n       (ii) if the claimant is deceased, a co-worker or a family \n     member, if the affidavit of the claimant, co-worker or family \n     member is found in proceedings under this title to be \n     reasonably reliable, attesting to the claimant's exposure; \n     and is credible and is not contradicted by other evidence.\n       (B) Other proof.--Exposure to asbestos may alternatively be \n     established by invoices, construction or other similar \n     records, or any other reasonably reliable evidence.\n       (3) Take-home exposure.--\n       (A) In general.--A claimant may alternatively satisfy the \n     medical criteria requirements of this section where a claim \n     is filed by a person who alleges their exposure to asbestos \n     was the result of living with a person who, if the claim had \n     been filed by that person, would have met the exposure \n     criteria for the given disease level, and the claimant lived \n     with such person for the time period necessary to satisfy the \n     exposure requirement, for the claimed disease level.\n       (B) Review.--Except for claims for disease Level IX \n     (mesothelioma), all claims alleging take-home exposure shall \n     be submitted as an exceptional medical claim under section \n     121(f) for review by a Physicians Panel.\n       (4) Waiver for workers and residents of libby, montana.--\n     Because of the unique nature of the asbestos exposure related \n     to the vermiculite mining and milling operations in Libby, \n     Montana, the Administrator shall waive the exposure \n     requirements under this\n\n[[Page S3916]]\n\n     subtitle for individuals who worked at the vermiculite mining \n     and milling facility in Libby, Montana, or lived or worked \n     within a 20-mile radius of Libby, Montana, for at least 12 \n     consecutive months before December 31, 2004. Claimants under \n     this section shall provide such supporting documentation as \n     the Administrator shall require.\n       (5) Exposure presumptions.--\n       (A) In general.--The Administrator shall prescribe rules \n     identifying specific industries, occupations within such \n     industries, and time periods in which workers employed in \n     those industries or occupations typically had substantial \n     occupational exposure to asbestos as defined under section \n     121(a). Until 5 years after the Administrator certifies that \n     the Fund is paying claims at a reasonable rate, the \n     industries, occupations and time periods identified by the \n     Administrator shall at a minimum include those identified in \n     the 2002 Trust Distribution Process of the Manville Personal \n     Injury Settlement Trust as of January 1, 2005, as industries, \n     occupations and time periods in which workers were presumed \n     to have had significant occupational exposure to asbestos. \n     Thereafter, the Administrator may by rule modify or eliminate \n     those exposure presumptions required to be adopted from the \n     Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust, if there is \n     evidence that demonstrates that the typical exposure for \n     workers in such industries and occupations during such time \n     periods did not constitute substantial occupational exposure \n     in asbestos.\n       (B) Claimants entitled to presumptions.--Any claimant who \n     demonstrates through meaningful and credible evidence that \n     such claimant was employed during relevant time periods in \n     industries or occupations identified under subparagraph (A) \n     shall be entitled to a presumption that the claimant had \n     substantial occupational exposure to asbestos during those \n     time periods. That presumption shall not be conclusive, and \n     the Administrator may find that the claimant does not have \n     substantial occupational exposure if other information \n     demonstrates that the claimant did not in fact have \n     substantial occupational exposure during any part of the \n     relevant time periods.\n       (6) Penalty for false statement.--Any false information \n     submitted under this subsection shall be subject to section \n     1348 of title 18, United States Code (as added by this Act).\n       (d) Asbestos Disease Levels.--\n       (1) Nonmalignant level i.--To receive Level I compensation, \n     a claimant shall provide--\n       (A) a diagnosis of bilateral asbestos-related nonmalignant \n     disease;

Any appeal of a determination shall \n     be an expedited review to the United States Circuit Court of \n     Appeals for the circuit in which the bankruptcy is filed.\n\n[[Page S3920]]\n\n       (2) Proceeding with reorganization plan.--A bankrupt \n     business entity may proceed with the filing, solicitation, \n     confirmation, and consummation of a plan of reorganization \n     that does not comply with the requirements of this Act, \n     including a trust and channeling injunction described in \n     section 524(g) of title 11, United States Code, \n     notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act, if the \n     bankruptcy court makes a favorable determination under \n     paragraph (1)(B), unless the bankruptcy court's determination \n     is overruled on appeal and all appeals are final. Such a \n     bankrupt business entity may continue to so proceed, if--\n       (A) on request of a party in interest or on a motion of the \n     court, and after a notice and a hearing, the bankruptcy court \n     presiding over the chapter 11 case of the bankrupt business \n     entity determines that--\n       (i) confirmation is necessary to permit the reorganization \n     of that entity and assure that all creditors and that entity \n     are treated fairly and equitably; and\n       (ii) confirmation is clearly favored by the balance of the \n     equities; and\n       (B) an order confirming the plan of reorganization is \n     entered by the bankruptcy court within 9 months after the \n     date of enactment of this Act or such longer period of time \n     approved by the bankruptcy court for cause shown.\n       (3) Applicability.--If the bankruptcy court does not make \n     the determination required under paragraph (2), or if an \n     order confirming the plan is not entered within 9 months \n     after the date of enactment of this Act or such longer period \n     of time approved by the bankruptcy court for cause shown, the \n     provisions of this Act shall apply to the bankrupt business \n     entity notwithstanding the certification. Any timely appeal \n     under title 11, United States Code, from a confirmation order \n     entered during the applicable time period shall automatically \n     extend the time during which this Act is inapplicable to the \n     bankrupt business entity, until the appeal is fully and \n     finally resolved.\n       (4) Offsets.--\n       (A) Payments by insurers.--To the extent that a bankrupt \n     business entity or debtor successfully confirms a plan of \n     reorganization, including a trust, and channeling injunction \n     that involves payments by insurers who are otherwise subject \n     to this Act as described under section 524(g) of title 11, \n     United States Code, an insurer who makes payments to the \n     trust shall obtain a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the \n     amount otherwise payable by that insurer under this Act to \n     the Fund.\n       (B) Contributions to fund.--Any cash payments by a bankrupt \n     business entity, if any, to a trust described under section \n     524(g) of title 11, United States Code, may be counted as a \n     contribution to the Fund.\n       (d) Tiers II Through VI.--Except as provided in section 204 \n     and subsection (b) of this section, persons or affiliated \n     groups are included in Tier II, III, IV, V, or VI, according \n     to the prior asbestos expenditures paid by such persons or \n     affiliated groups as follows:\n       (1) Tier II: $75,000,000 or greater.\n       (2) Tier III: $50,000,000 or greater, but less than \n     $75,000,000.\n       (3) Tier IV: $10,000,000 or greater, but less than \n     $50,000,000.\n       (4) Tier V: $5,000,000 or greater, but less than \n     $10,000,000.\n       (5) Tier VI: $1,000,000 or greater, but less than \n     $5,000,000.\n       (e) Tier Placement and Costs.--\n       (1) Permanent tier placement.--After a defendant \n     participant or affiliated group is assigned to a tier and \n     subtier under section 204(i)(6), the participant or \n     affiliated group shall remain in that tier and subtier \n     throughout the life of the Fund, regardless of subsequent \n     events, including--\n       (A) the filing of a petition under a chapter of title 11, \n     United States Code;\n       (B) a discharge of debt in bankruptcy;\n       (C) the confirmation of a plan of reorganization;

ASSESSMENT ADMINISTRATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Each defendant participant or affiliated \n     group shall pay to the Fund in the amounts provided under \n     this subtitle as appropriate for its tier and subtier each \n     year until the earlier to occur of the following:\n       (1) The participant or affiliated group has satisfied its \n     obligations under this subtitle during the 30 annual payment \n     cycles of the operation of the Fund.\n       (2) The amount received by the Fund from defendant \n     participants, excluding any amounts rebated to defendant \n     participants under subsection (d), equals the maximum \n     aggregate payment obligation of section 202(a)(2).\n\n[[Page S3922]]\n\n       (b) Small Business Exemption.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this subtitle, a person or affiliated group that \n     is a small business concern (as defined under section 3 of \n     the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632)), on December 31, \n     2002, is exempt from any payment requirement under this \n     subtitle and shall not be included in the subtier allocations \n     under section 203.\n       (c) Procedures.--The Administrator shall prescribe \n     procedures on how amounts payable under this subtitle are to \n     be paid, including, to the extent the Administrator \n     determines appropriate, procedures relating to payment in \n     installments.\n       (d) Adjustments.--\n       (1) In general.--Under expedited procedures established by \n     the Administrator, a defendant participant may seek \n     adjustment of the amount of its payment obligation based on \n     severe financial hardship or demonstrated inequity. The \n     Administrator may determine whether to grant an adjustment \n     and the size of any such adjustment, in accordance with this \n     subsection. A defendant participant has a right to obtain a \n     rehearing of the Administrator's determination under this \n     subsection under the procedures prescribed in subsection \n     (i)(10). The Administrator may adjust a defendant \n     participant's payment obligations under this subsection, \n     either by forgiving the relevant portion of the otherwise \n     applicable payment obligation or by providing relevant \n     rebates from the defendant hardship and inequity adjustment \n     account created under subsection (j) after payment of the \n     otherwise applicable payment obligation, at the discretion of \n     the Administrator.\n       (2) Financial hardship adjustments.--\n       (A) In general.--A defendant participant may apply for an \n     adjustment based on financial hardship at any time during the \n     period in which a payment obligation to the Fund remains \n     outstanding and may qualify for such adjustment by \n     demonstrating that the amount of its payment obligation under \n     the statutory allocation would constitute a severe financial \n     hardship.\n       (B) Term.--Subject to the annual availability of funds in \n     the defendant hardship and inequity adjustment account \n     established under subsection (j), a financial hardship \n     adjustment under this subsection shall have a term of 3 \n     years.\n       (C) Renewal.--After an initial hardship adjustment is \n     granted under this paragraph, a defendant participant may \n     renew its hardship adjustment by demonstrating that it \n     remains justified.\n       (D) Reinstatement.--Following the expiration of the \n     hardship adjustment period provided for under this section \n     and during the funding period prescribed under subsection \n     (a), the Administrator shall annually determine whether there \n     has been a material change in the financial condition of the \n     defendant participant such that the Administrator may, \n     consistent with the policies and legislative intent \n     underlying this Act, reinstate under terms and conditions \n     established by the Administrator any part or all of the \n     defendant participant's payment obligation under the \n     statutory allocation that was not paid during the hardship \n     adjustment term.\n       (3) Inequity adjustments.--\n       (A) In general.--A defendant participant--\n       (i) may qualify for an adjustment based on inequity by \n     demonstrating that the amount of its payment obligation under \n     the statutory allocation is exceptionally inequitable--\n\n       (I) when measured against the amount of the likely cost to \n     the defendant participant net of insurance of its future \n     liability in the tort system in the absence of the Fund;\n       (II) when compared to the median payment rate for all \n     defendant participants in the same tier; or\n       (III) when measured against the percentage of the prior \n     asbestos expenditures of the defendant that were incurred \n     with respect to claims that neither resulted in an adverse \n     judgment against the defendant, nor were the subject of a \n     settlement that required a payment to a plaintiff by or on \n     behalf of that defendant;\n\n       (ii) shall qualify for a two-tier main tier and a two-tier \n     subtier adjustment reducing the defendant participant's \n     payment obligation based on inequity by demonstrating that \n     not less than 95 percent of such person's prior asbestos \n     expenditures arose from claims related to the manufacture and \n     sale of railroad locomotives and related products, so long as \n     such person's manufacture and sale of railroad locomotives \n     and related products is temporally and causally remote, and \n     for purposes of this clause, a person's manufacture and sale \n     of railroad locomotives and related products shall be deemed \n     to be temporally and causally remote if the asbestos claims \n     historically and generally filed against such person relate \n     to the manufacture and sale of railroad locomotives and \n     related products by an entity dissolved more than 25 years \n     before the date of enactment of this Act; and\n       (iii) shall be granted a two-tier adjustment reducing the \n     defendant participant's payment obligation based on inequity \n     by demonstrating that not less than 95 percent of such \n     participant's prior asbestos expenditures arose from asbestos \n     claims based on successor liability arising from a merger to \n     which the participant or its predecessor was a party that \n     occurred at least 30 years before the date of enactment of \n     this Act, and that such prior asbestos expenditures exceed \n     the inflation-adjusted value of the assets of the company \n     from which such liability was derived in such merger, and \n     upon such demonstration the Administrator shall grant such \n     adjustment for the life of the Fund and amounts paid by such \n     defendant participant prior to such adjustment in excess of \n     its adjusted payment obligation under this clause shall be \n     credited against next succeeding required payment \n     obligations.\n       (B) Payment rate.--For purposes of subparagraph (A), the \n     payment rate of a defendant participant is the payment amount \n     of the defendant participant as a percentage of such \n     defendant participant's gross revenues for the year ending \n     December 31, 2002.\n       (C) Term.--Subject to the annual availability of funds in \n     the defendant hardship and inequity adjustment account \n     established under subsection (j), an inequity adjustment \n     under this subsection shall have a term of 3 years.\n       (D) Renewal.--A defendant participant may renew an inequity \n     adjustment every 3 years by demonstrating that the adjustment \n     remains justified.\n       (E) Reinstatement.--\n       (i) In general.--Following the termination of an inequity \n     adjustment under subparagraph (A), and during the funding \n     period prescribed under subsection (a), the Administrator \n     shall annually determine whether there has been a material \n     change in conditions which would support a finding that the \n     amount of the defendant participant's payment under the \n     statutory allocation was not inequitable. Based on this \n     determination, the Administrator may, consistent with the \n     policies and legislative intent underlying this Act, \n     reinstate any or all of the payment obligations of the \n     defendant participant as if the inequity adjustment had not \n     been granted for that 3-year period.\n       (ii) Terms and conditions.--In the event of a reinstatement \n     under clause (i), the Administrator may require the defendant \n     participant to pay any part or all of amounts not paid due to \n     the inequity adjustment on such terms and conditions as \n     established by the Administrator.\n       (4) Limitation on adjustments.--The aggregate total of \n     financial hardship adjustments under paragraph (2) and \n     inequity adjustments under paragraph (3) in effect in any \n     given year shall not exceed $300,000,000, except to the \n     extent additional monies are available for such adjustments \n     as a result of carryover of prior years' funds under \n     subsection (j)(3) or as a result of monies being made \n     available in that year under subsection (k)(1)(A).\n       (5) Advisory panels.--\n       (A) Appointment.--The Administrator shall appoint a \n     Financial Hardship Adjustment Panel and an Inequity \n     Adjustment Panel to advise the Administrator in carrying out \n     this subsection.\n       (B) Membership.--The membership of the panels appointed \n     under subparagraph (A) may overlap.\n       (C) Coordination.--The panels appointed under subparagraph \n     (A) shall coordinate their deliberations and advice.\n       (e) Limitation on Liability.--The liability of each \n     defendant participant to pay to the Fund shall be limited to \n     the payment obligations under this Act, and, except as \n     provided in subsection (f) and section 203(b)(2)(D), no \n     defendant participant shall have any liability for the \n     payment obligations of any other defendant participant.\n       (f) Consolidation of Payments.--\n       (1) In general.--For purposes of determining the payment \n     levels of defendant participants, any affiliated group \n     including 1 or more defendant participants may irrevocably \n     elect, as part of the submissions to be made under paragraphs \n     (1) and (3) of subsection (i), to report on a consolidated \n     basis all of the information necessary to determine the \n     payment level under this subtitle and pay to the Fund on a \n     consolidated basis.\n       (2) Election.--If an affiliated group elects consolidation \n     as provided in this subsection--\n       (A) for purposes of this Act other than this subsection, \n     the affiliated group shall be treated as if it were a single \n     participant, including with respect to the assessment of a \n     single annual payment under this subtitle for the entire \n     affiliated group;\n       (B) the ultimate parent of the affiliated group shall \n     prepare and submit each submission to be made under \n     subsection (i) on behalf of the entire affiliated group and \n     shall be solely liable, as between the Administrator and the \n     affiliated group only, for the payment of the annual amount \n     due from the affiliated group under this subtitle, except \n     that, if the ultimate parent does not pay when due any \n     payment obligation for the affiliated group, the \n     Administrator shall have the right to seek payment of all or \n     any portion of the entire amount due (as well as any other \n     amount for which the affiliated group may be liable under \n     sections 223 and 224) from any member of the affiliated \n     group;\n       (C) all members of the affiliated group shall be identified \n     in the submission under subsection (i) and shall certify \n     compliance with this subsection and the Administrator's \n     regulations implementing this subsection; and\n       (D) the obligations under this subtitle shall not change \n     even if, after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     beneficial ownership interest between any members of the \n     affiliated group shall change.\n       (3) Cause of action.--Notwithstanding section 221(e), this \n     Act shall not preclude actions among persons within an \n     affiliated group with respect to the payment obligations \n     under this Act.\n       (g) Determination of Prior Asbestos Expenditures.--\n\n[[Page S3923]]\n\n       (1) In general.--For purposes of determining a defendant \n     participant's prior asbestos expenditures, the Administrator \n     shall prescribe such rules as may be necessary or appropriate \n     to assure that payments by indemnitors before December 31, \n     2002, shall be counted as part of the indemnitor's prior \n     asbestos expenditures, rather than the indemnitee's prior \n     asbestos expenditures, in accordance with this subsection.\n       (2) Indemnifiable costs.--If an indemnitor has paid or \n     reimbursed to an indemnitee any indemnifiable cost or \n     otherwise made a payment on behalf of or for the benefit of \n     an indemnitee to a third party for an indemnifiable cost \n     before December 31, 2002, the amount of such indemnifiable \n     cost shall be solely for the account of the indemnitor for \n     purposes under this Act.\n       (3) Insurance payments.--When computing the prior asbestos \n     expenditures with respect to an asbestos claim, any amount \n     paid or reimbursed by insurance shall be solely for the \n     account of the indemnitor, even if the indemnitor would have \n     no direct right to the benefit of the insurance, if--\n       (A) such insurance has been paid or reimbursed to the \n     indemnitor or the indemnitee, or paid on behalf of or for the \n     benefit of the indemnitee; and\n       (B) the indemnitor has either, with respect to such \n     asbestos claim or any similar asbestos claim, paid or \n     reimbursed to its indemnitee any indemnifiable cost or paid \n     to any third party on behalf of or for the benefit of the \n     indemnitee any indemnifiable cost.\n       (4) Treatment of certain expenditures.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of this Act, where--\n       (A) an indemnitor entered into a stock purchase agreement \n     in 1988 that involved the sale of the stock of businesses \n     that produced friction and other products; and\n       (B) the stock purchase agreement provided that the \n     indemnitor indemnified the indemnitee and its affiliates for \n     losses arising from various matters, including asbestos \n     claims--\n       (i) asserted before the date of the agreement; and\n       (ii) filed after the date of the agreement and prior to the \n     10-year anniversary of the stock sale,\n     then the prior asbestos expenditures arising from the \n     asbestos claims described in clauses (i) and (ii) shall not \n     be for the account of either the indemnitor or indemnitee.\n       (h) Minimum Annual Payments.--\n       (1) In general.--The aggregate annual payments of defendant \n     participants to the Fund shall be at least $3,000,000,000 for \n     each calendar year in the first 30 years of the Fund, or \n     until such shorter time as the condition set forth in \n     subsection (a)(2) is attained.\n       (2) Guaranteed payment account.--To the extent payments in \n     accordance with sections 202 and 203 (as modified by \n     subsections (b), (d), (f) and (g) of this section) fail in \n     any year to raise at least $3,000,000,000 net of any \n     adjustments under subsection (d), the balance needed to meet \n     this required minimum aggregate annual payment shall be \n     obtained from the defendant guaranteed payment account \n     established under subsection (k).\n       (3) Guaranteed payment surcharge.--To the extent the \n     procedure set forth in paragraph (2) is insufficient to \n     satisfy the required minimum aggregate annual payment net of \n     any adjustments under subsection (d), the Administrator may \n     assess a guaranteed payment surcharge under subsection (l).\n       (i) Procedures for Making Payments.--\n       (1) Initial year: tiers ii-vi.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 120 days after enactment of \n     this Act, each defendant participant that is included in \n     Tiers II, III, IV, V, or VI shall file with the \n     Administrator--\n       (i) a statement of whether the defendant participant \n     irrevocably elects to report on a consolidated basis under \n     subsection (f);\n       (ii) a good-faith estimate of its prior asbestos \n     expenditures;\n       (iii) a statement of its 2002 revenues, determined in \n     accordance with section 203(a)(2);

incomplete response.--If no response in \n     accordance with paragraph (5) is received from a defendant \n     participant, or if the response is incomplete, the initial \n     determination shall be based on the best information \n     available to the Administrator.\n       (C) Payments.--Within 30 days of receiving a notice of \n     initial determination requiring payment, the defendant \n     participant shall pay the Administrator the amount required \n     by the notice, after deducting any previous payment made by \n     the participant under this subsection. If the amount that the \n     defendant participant is required to pay is less than any \n     previous payment made by the participant under this \n     subsection, the Administrator shall credit any excess payment \n     against the future payment obligations of that defendant \n     participant. The pendency of a petition for rehearing under \n     paragraph (10) shall not stay the obligation of the \n     participant to make the payment specified in the \n     Administrator's notice.\n       (7) Exemptions for information required.--\n       (A) Prior asbestos expenditures.--In lieu of submitting \n     information related to prior asbestos expenditures as may be \n     required for purposes of this subtitle, a non-debtor \n     defendant participant may consent to be assigned to Tier II.\n\n[[Page S3924]]\n\n       (B) Revenues.--In lieu of submitting information related to \n     revenues as may be required for purposes of this subtitle, a \n     non-debtor defendant participant may consent to be assigned \n     to Subtier 1 of the defendant participant's applicable tier.\n       (8) New information.--\n       (A) Existing participant.--The Administrator shall adopt \n     procedures for requiring additional payment, or refunding \n     amounts already paid, based on new information received.\n       (B) Additional participant.--If the Administrator, at any \n     time, receives information that an additional person may \n     qualify as a defendant participant, the Administrator shall \n     require such person to submit information necessary to \n     determine whether that person is required to make payments, \n     and in what amount, under this subtitle and shall make any \n     determination or take any other act consistent with this Act \n     based on such information or any other information available \n     to the Administrator with respect to such person.\n       (9) Subpoenas.--The Administrator may request the Attorney \n     General to subpoena persons to compel testimony, records, and \n     other information relevant to its responsibilities under this \n     section.

A defendant participant may not file an action \n     under section 303 unless the defendant participant requests a \n     rehearing under this paragraph. The Administrator shall \n     publish a notice in the Federal Register of any change in a \n     defendant participant's tier or subtier assignment or payment \n     obligation as a result of a rehearing.\n       (j) Defendant Hardship and Inequity Adjustment Account.--\n       (1) In general.--To the extent the total payments by \n     defendant participants in any given year exceed the minimum \n     aggregate annual payments under subsection (h), excess monies \n     up to a maximum of $300,000,000 in any such year shall be \n     placed in a defendant hardship and inequity adjustment \n     account established within the Fund by the Administrator.\n       (2) Use of account monies.--Monies from the defendant \n     hardship and inequity adjustment account shall be preserved \n     and administered like the remainder of the Fund, but shall be \n     reserved and may be used only--\n       (A) to make up for any relief granted to a defendant \n     participant for severe financial hardship or demonstrated \n     inequity under subsection (d) or to reimburse any defendant \n     participant granted such relief after its payment of the \n     amount otherwise due; and\n       (B) if the condition set forth in subsection (a)(2) is met, \n     for any purpose that the Fund may serve under this Act.\n       (3) Carryover of unused funds.--To the extent the \n     Administrator does not, in any given year, use all of the \n     funds allocated to the account under paragraph (1) for \n     adjustments granted under subsection (d), remaining funds in \n     the account shall be carried forward for use by the \n     Administrator for adjustments in subsequent years.\n       (k) Defendant Guaranteed Payment Account.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to subsections (h) and (j), if \n     there are excess monies paid by defendant participants in any \n     given year, including any bankruptcy trust credits that may \n     be due under section 222(e), such monies--\n       (A) at the discretion of the Administrator, may be used to \n     provide additional adjustments under subsection (d), up to a \n     maximum aggregate of $50,000,000 in such year; and\n       (B) to the extent not used under subparagraph (A), shall be \n     placed in a defendant guaranteed payment account established \n     within the Fund by the Administrator.\n       (2) Use of account monies.--Monies from the defendant \n     guaranteed payment account shall be preserved and \n     administered like the remainder of the Fund, but shall be \n     reserved and may be used only--\n       (A) to ensure the minimum aggregate annual payment set \n     forth in subsection (h) net of any adjustments under \n     subsection (d) is reached each year; and\n       (B) if the condition set forth in subsection (a)(2) is met, \n     for any purpose that the Fund may serve under this Act.\n       (l) Guaranteed Payment Surcharge.--\n       (1) In general.--To the extent there are insufficient \n     monies in the defendant guaranteed payment account \n     established in subsection (k) to attain the minimum aggregate \n     annual payment net of any adjustments under subsection (d) in \n     any given year, the Administrator may impose on each \n     defendant participant a surcharge as necessary to raise the \n     balance required to attain the minimum aggregate annual \n     payment net of any adjustments under subsection (d), as \n     provided in this subsection. Any such surcharge shall be \n     imposed on a pro rata basis, in accordance with each \n     defendant participant's relative annual liability under \n     sections 202 and 203 (as modified by subsections (b), (d), \n     (f), and (g) of this section).\n       (2) Certification.--\n       (A) In general.--Before imposing a guaranteed payment \n     surcharge under this subsection, the Administrator shall \n     certify that he or she has used all reasonable efforts to \n     collect mandatory payments for all defendant participants, \n     including by using the authority in subsection (i)(9) of this \n     section and section 223.\n       (B) Notice and comment.--Before making a final \n     certification under subparagraph (C), the Administrator shall \n     publish a notice in the Federal Register of a proposed \n     certification and provide in such notice for a public comment \n     period of 30 days.\n       (C) Final certification.--\n       (i) In general.--The Administrator shall publish a notice \n     of the final certification in the Federal Register after \n     consideration of all comments submitted under subparagraph \n     (B).\n       (ii) Written notice.--Not later than 30 days after \n     publishing any final certification under clause (i), the \n     Administrator shall provide each defendant participant with \n     written notice of that defendant participant's payment, \n     including the amount of any surcharge.\n\n     SEC. 205. STEPDOWNS AND FUNDING HOLIDAYS.\n\n       (a) Stepdowns.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), the minimum \n     aggregate annual funding obligation under section 204(h) \n     shall be reduced by 10 percent of the initial minimum \n     aggregate funding obligation at the end of the tenth, \n     fifteenth, twentieth, and twenty-fifth years after the date \n     of enactment of this Act. The reductions under this paragraph \n     shall be applied on an equal pro rata basis to the funding \n     obligations of all defendant participants, except with \n     respect to defendant participants in Tier 1, Subtiers 2 and \n     3, and class action trusts.\n       (2) Limitation.--The Administrator shall suspend, cancel, \n     reduce, or delay any reduction under paragraph (1) if at any \n     time the Administrator finds, in accordance with subsection \n     (c), that such action is necessary and appropriate to ensure \n     that the assets of the Fund and expected future payments \n     remain sufficient to satisfy the Fund's anticipated \n     obligations.\n       (b) Funding Holidays.--\n       (1) In general.--If the Administrator determines, at any \n     time after 10 years following the date of enactment of this \n     Act, that the assets of the Fund at the time of such \n     determination and expected future payments, taking into \n     consideration any reductions under subsection (a), are \n     sufficient to satisfy the Fund's anticipated obligations \n     without the need for all, or any portion of, that year's \n     payment otherwise required under this subtitle, the \n     Administrator shall reduce or waive all or any part of the \n     payments required from defendant participants for that year.\n       (2) Annual review.--The Administrator shall undertake the \n     review required by this subsection and make the necessary \n     determination under paragraph (1) every year.\n       (3) Limitations on funding holidays.--Any reduction or \n     waiver of the defendant participants' funding obligations \n     shall--\n       (A) be made only to the extent the Administrator determines \n     that the Fund will still be able to satisfy all of its \n     anticipated obligations; and\n       (B) be applied on an equal pro rata basis to the funding \n     obligations of all defendant participants, except with \n     respect to defendant participants in Subtiers 2 and 3 of Tier \n     I and class action trusts, for that year.\n       (4) New information.--If at any time the Administrator \n     determines that a reduction or waiver under this section may \n     cause the assets of the Fund and expected future payments to \n     decrease to a level at which the Fund may not be able to \n     satisfy all of its anticipated obligations, the Administrator \n     shall revoke all or any part of such reduction or waiver to \n     the extent necessary to ensure that the Fund's obligations \n     are met. Such revocations shall be applied on an equal pro \n     rata basis to the funding obligations of all defendant \n     participants, except defendant participants in Subtiers 2 and \n     3 of Tier I and class action trusts, for that year.\n       (c) Certification.--\n       (1) In general.--Before suspending, canceling, reducing, or \n     delaying any reduction under subsection (a) or granting or \n     revoking a reduction or waiver under subsection (b), the \n     Administrator shall certify that the requirements of this \n     section are satisfied.\n       (2) Notice and comment.--Before making a final \n     certification under this subsection, the Administrator shall \n     publish a notice in the Federal Register of a proposed \n     certification and a statement of the basis therefor and \n     provide in such notice for a public comment period of 30 \n     days.\n       (3) Final certification.--\n       (A) In general.--The Administrator shall publish a notice \n     of the final certification in the Federal Register after \n     consideration of all comments submitted under paragraph (2).\n       (B) Written notice.--Not later than 30 days after \n     publishing any final certification under subparagraph (A), \n     the Administrator shall provide each defendant participant \n     with written notice of that defendant's funding obligation \n     for that year.\n\n                Subtitle B--Asbestos Insurers Commission\n\n     SEC. 210.

ESTABLISHMENT OF ASBESTOS INSURERS COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--There is established the Asbestos \n     Insurers Commission (referred to in this subtitle as the \n     ``Commission'') to carry out the duties described in section \n     212.\n       (b) Membership.--\n       (1) Appointment.--The Commission shall be composed of 5 \n     members who shall be appointed by the President, by and with \n     the advice and consent of the Senate.\n       (2) Qualifications.--\n       (A) Expertise.--Members of the Commission shall have \n     sufficient expertise to fulfill their responsibilities under \n     this subtitle.\n       (B) Conflict of interest.--\n       (i) In general.--No member of the Commission appointed \n     under paragraph (1) may be an employee or immediate family \n     member of an employee of an insurer participant. No member of \n     the Commission shall be a shareholder of any insurer \n     participant. No member of the Commission shall be a former \n     officer or director, or a former employee or former \n     shareholder of any insurer participant who was such an \n     employee, shareholder, officer, or director at any time \n     during the 2-year period ending on the date of the \n     appointment, unless that is fully disclosed before \n     consideration in the Senate of the nomination for appointment \n     to the Commission.\n       (ii) Definition.--In clause (i), the term ``shareholder'' \n     shall not include a broadly based mutual fund that includes \n     the stocks of insurer participants as a portion of its \n     overall holdings.\n       (C) Federal employment.--A member of the Commission may not \n     be an officer or employee of the Federal Government, except \n     by reason of membership on the Commission.\n       (3) Period of appointment.--Members shall be appointed for \n     the life of the Commission.\n       (4) Vacancies.--Any vacancy in the Commission shall be \n     filled in the same manner as the original appointment.\n       (5) Chairman.--The President shall select a Chairman from \n     among the members of the Commission.\n       (c) Meetings.--\n       (1) Initial meeting.--Not later than 30 days after the date \n     on which all members of the Commission have been appointed, \n     the Commission shall hold its first meeting.\n       (2) Subsequent meetings.--The Commission shall meet at the \n     call of the Chairman, as necessary to accomplish the duties \n     under section 212.\n       (3) Quorum.--No business may be conducted or hearings held \n     without the participation of a majority of the members of the \n     Commission.\n\n     SEC. 212. DUTIES OF ASBESTOS INSURERS COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Determination of Insurer Payment Obligations.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Definitions.--For the purposes of this Act, the terms \n     ``insurer'' and ``insurer participant'' shall, unless stated \n     otherwise, include direct insurers and reinsurers, as well as \n     any run-off entity established, in whole or in part, to \n     review and pay asbestos claims.\n       (B) Procedures for determining insurer payments.--The \n     Commission shall determine the amount that each insurer \n     participant shall be required to pay into the Fund under the \n     procedures described in this section. The Commission shall \n     make this determination by first promulgating a rule \n     establishing a methodology for allocation of payments among \n     insurer participants and then applying such methodology to \n     determine the individual payment for each insurer \n     participant. The methodology may include 1 or more allocation \n     formulas to be applied to all insurer participants or groups \n     of similarly situated participants. The Commission's rule \n     shall include a methodology for adjusting payments by insurer \n     participants to make up, during any applicable payment year, \n     any amount by which aggregate insurer payments fall below the \n     level required in paragraph (3)(C). The Commission shall \n     conduct a thorough study (within the time limitations under \n     this subparagraph) of the accuracy of the reserve allocation \n     of each insurer participant, and may request information from \n     the Securities and Exchange Commission or any State \n     regulatory agency. Under this procedure, not later than 120 \n     days after the initial meeting of the Commission, the \n     Commission shall commence a rulemaking proceeding under \n     section 213(a) to propose and adopt a methodology for \n     allocating payments among insurer participants. In proposing \n     an allocation methodology, the Commission may consult with \n     such actuaries and other experts as it deems appropriate. \n     After hearings and public comment on the proposed allocation \n     methodology, the Commission shall as promptly as possible \n     promulgate a final rule establishing such methodology. After \n     promulgation of the final rule, the Commission shall \n     determine the individual payment of each insurer participant \n     under the procedures set forth in subsection (b).\n       (C) Scope.--Every insurer, reinsurer, and runoff entity \n     with asbestos-related obligations in the United States shall \n     be subject to the Commission's and Administrator's authority \n     under this Act, including allocation determinations, and \n     shall be required to fulfill its payment obligation without \n     regard as to whether it is licensed in the United States. \n     Every insurer participant not licensed or domiciled in the \n     United States shall, upon the first payment to the Fund, \n     submit a written consent to the Commission's and \n     Administrator's authority under this Act, and to the \n     jurisdiction of the courts of the United States for purposes \n     of enforcing this Act, in a form determined by the \n     Administrator. Any insurer participant refusing to provide a \n     written consent shall be subject to fines and penalties as \n     provided in section 223.\n       (D) Issuers of finite risk policies.--\n       (i) In general.--The issuer of any policy of reinsurance \n     purchased by an insurer participant or its affiliate after \n     1990 that provides for a loss transfer to insure for incurred \n     asbestos losses and other losses (both known and unknown), \n     including those policies commonly referred to as ``finite \n     risk'', ``aggregate stop loss'', ``aggregate excess of \n     loss'', or ``loss portfolio transfer'' policies, shall be \n     obligated to make payments required under this Act directly \n     to the Fund on behalf of the insurer participant who is the \n     beneficiary of such policy, subject to the underlying \n     retention and the limits of liability applicable to such \n     policy.\n       (ii) Payments.--Payments to the Fund required under this \n     Act shall be treated as loss payments for asbestos bodily \n     injury (as if such payments were incurred as liabilities \n     imposed in the tort system) and shall not be subject to \n     exclusion under policies described under clause (i) as a \n     liability with respect to tax or assessment. Within 90 days \n     after the scheduled date to make an annual payment to the \n     Fund, the insurer participant shall, at its discretion, \n     direct the reinsurer issuing such policy to pay all or a \n     portion of the annual payment directly to the Fund up to the \n     full applicable limits of liability under the policy. The \n     reinsurer issuing such policy shall be obligated to make such \n     payments directly to the Fund and shall be subject to the \n     enforcement provisions under section 223. The insurer \n     participant shall remain obligated to make payment to the \n     Fund of that portion of the annual payment not directed to \n     the issuer of such reinsurance policy.\n       (2) Amount of payments.--\n       (A) Aggregate payment obligation.--The total payment \n     required of all insurer participants over the life of the \n     Fund shall be equal to $46,025,000,000.\n       (B) Accounting standards.--In determining the payment \n     obligations of participants that are not licensed or \n     domiciled in the United States or that are runoff entities, \n     the Commission shall use accounting standards required for \n     United States licensed direct insurers.\n       (C) Captive insurance companies.--No payment to the Fund \n     shall be required from a captive insurance company, unless \n     and only to the extent a captive insurance company, on the \n     date of enactment of this Act, has liability, directly or \n     indirectly, for any asbestos claim of a person or persons \n     other than and unaffiliated with its ultimate parent or \n     affiliated group or pool in which the ultimate parent \n     participates or participated, or unaffiliated with a person \n     that was its ultimate parent or a member of its affiliated \n     group or pool at the time the relevant insurance or \n     reinsurance was issued by the captive insurance company.\n       (D) Several liability.--Unless otherwise provided under \n     this Act, each insurer participant's obligation to make \n     payments to the Fund is several. Unless otherwise provided \n     under this Act, there is no joint liability, and the future \n     insolvency by any insurer participant shall not affect the \n     payment required of any other insurer participant.\n       (3) Payment of criteria.--\n       (A) Inclusion in insurer participant category.--\n       (i) In general.--Insurers that have paid, or been assessed \n     by a legal judgment or settlement, at least $1,000,000 in \n     defense and indemnity costs before the date of enactment of \n     this Act in response to claims for compensation for asbestos \n     injuries arising from a policy of liability insurance or \n     contract of liability reinsurance or retrocessional \n     reinsurance shall be insurer participants in the Fund. Other \n     insurers shall be exempt from mandatory payments.\n       (ii) Inapplicability of section 202.--Since insurers may be \n     subject in certain jurisdictions to direct action suits, and \n     it is not the intent of this Act to impose upon an insurer, \n     due to its operation as an insurer, payment obligations to \n     the Fund in situations where the insurer is the subject of a \n     direct action, no insurer subject to mandatory payments under \n     section 212 shall also be liable for payments to the Fund as \n     a defendant participant under section 202.\n       (B) Insurer participant allocation methodology.--\n       (i) In general.--The Commission shall establish the payment \n     obligations of individual insurer participants to reflect, on \n     an equitable basis, the relative tort system liability of the \n     participating insurers in the absence of this Act, \n     considering and weighting, as appropriate (but exclusive of \n     workers' compensation), such factors as--\n\n       (I) historic premium for lines of insurance associated with \n     asbestos exposure over relevant periods of time;\n       (II) recent loss experience for asbestos liability;\n       (III) amounts reserved for asbestos liability;\n\n[[Page S3926]]\n\n       (IV) the likely cost to each insurer participant of its \n     future liabilities under applicable insurance policies; and\n       (V) any other factor the Commission may determine is \n     relevant and appropriate.\n\n       (ii) Determination of reserves.--The Commission may \n     establish procedures and standards for determination of the \n     asbestos reserves of insurer participants. The reserves of a \n     United States licensed reinsurer that is wholly owned by, or \n     under common control of, a United States licensed direct \n     insurer shall be included as part of the direct insurer's \n     reserves when the reinsurer's financial results are included \n     as part of the direct insurer's United States operations, as \n     reflected in footnote 33 of its filings with the National \n     Association of Insurance Commissioners or in published \n     financial statements prepared in accordance with generally \n     accepted accounting principles.\n       (C) Payment schedule.--The aggregate annual amount of \n     payments by insurer participants over the life of the Fund \n     shall be as follows:\n       (i) For years 1 and 2, $2,700,000,000 annually.\n       (ii) For years 3 through 5, $5,075,000,000 annually.\n       (iii) For years 6 through 27, $1,147,000,000 annually.\n       (iv) For year 28, $166,000,000.\n       (D) Certain runoff entities.--\n       (i) In general.--Whenever the Commission requires payments \n     by a runoff entity that has assumed asbestos-related \n     liabilities from a Lloyd's syndicate or names that are \n     members of such a syndicate, the Commission shall not require \n     payments from such syndicates and names to the extent that \n     the runoff entity makes its required payments. In addition, \n     such syndicates and names shall be required to make payments \n     to the Fund in the amount of any adjustment granted to the \n     runoff entity for severe financial hardship or exceptional \n     circumstances.\n       (ii) Included runoff entities.--Subject to clause (i), a \n     runoff entity shall include any direct insurer or reinsurer \n     whose asbestos liability reserves have been transferred, \n     directly or indirectly, to the runoff entity and on whose \n     behalf the runoff entity handles or adjusts and, where \n     appropriate, pays asbestos claims.\n       (E) Financial hardship and exceptional circumstance \n     adjustments.--\n       (i) In general.--Under the procedures established in \n     subsection (b), an insurer participant may seek adjustment of \n     the amount of its payments based on exceptional circumstances \n     or severe financial hardship.\n       (ii) Financial adjustments.--An insurer participant may \n     qualify for an adjustment based on severe financial hardship \n     by demonstrating that payment of the amounts required by the \n     Commission's methodology would jeopardize the solvency of \n     such participant.\n       (iii) Exceptional circumstance adjustment.--An insurer \n     participant may qualify for an adjustment based on \n     exceptional circumstances by demonstrating--\n\n       (I) that the amount of its payments under the Commission's \n     allocation methodology is exceptionally inequitable when \n     measured against the amount of the likely cost to the \n     participant of its future liability in the tort system in the \n     absence of the Fund;\n       (II) an offset credit as described in subparagraphs (A) and \n     (C) of subsection (b)(4); or\n       (III) other exceptional circumstances.\n\n     The Commission may determine whether to grant an adjustment \n     and the size of any such adjustment, but adjustments shall \n     not reduce the aggregate payment obligations of insurer \n     participants specified in paragraph (2)(A) and subparagraph \n     (C) of this paragraph.\n       (iv) Time period of adjustment.--Except for adjustments for \n     offset credits, adjustments granted under this subsection \n     shall have a term not to exceed 3 years. An insurer \n     participant may renew its adjustment by demonstrating to the \n     Administrator that it remains justified.\n       (b) Procedure for Notifying Insurer Participants of \n     Individual Payment Obligations.--\n       (1) Notice to participants.--Not later than 30 days after \n     promulgation of the final rule establishing an allocation \n     methodology under subsection (a)(1), the Commission shall--\n       (A) directly notify all reasonably identifiable insurer \n     participants of the requirement to submit information \n     necessary to calculate the amount of any required payment to \n     the Fund under the allocation methodology; and\n       (B) publish in the Federal Register a notice--\n       (i) requiring any person who may be an insurer participant \n     (as determined by criteria outlined in the notice) to submit \n     such information; and\n       (ii) that includes a list of all insurer participants \n     notified by the Commission under subparagraph (A), and \n     provides for 30 days for the submission of comments or \n     information regarding the completeness and accuracy of the \n     list of identified insurer participants.\n       (2) Response required by individual insurer participants.--\n       (A) In general.--Any person who receives notice under \n     paragraph (1)(A), and any other person meeting the criteria \n     specified in the notice published under paragraph (1)(B), \n     shall respond by providing the Commission with all the \n     information requested in the notice under a schedule or by a \n     date established by the Commission.\n       (B) Certification.--The response submitted under \n     subparagraph (A) shall be signed by a responsible corporate \n     officer, general partner, proprietor, or individual of \n     similar authority, who shall certify under penalty of law the \n     completeness and accuracy of the information submitted.\n       (3) Notice to insurer participants of initial payment \n     determination.--\n       (A) In general.--\n       (i) Notice to insurers.--Not later than 120 days after \n     receipt of the information required by paragraph (2), the \n     Commission shall send each insurer participant a notice of \n     initial determination requiring payments to the Fund, which \n     shall be based on the information received from the \n     participant in response to the Commission's request for \n     information. An insurer participant's payments shall be \n     payable over the schedule established in subsection \n     (a)(3)(C), in annual amounts proportionate to the aggregate \n     annual amount of payments for all insurer participants for \n     the applicable year.\n       (ii) Public notice.--Not later than 7 days after sending \n     the notification of initial determination to insurer \n     participants, the Commission shall publish in the Federal \n     Register a notice listing the insurer participants that have \n     been sent such notification, and the initial determination on \n     the payment obligation of each identified participant.\n       (B) No response; incomplete response.--If no response is \n     received from an insurer participant, or if the response is \n     incomplete, the initial determination requiring a payment \n     from the insurer participant shall be based on the best \n     information available to the Commission.\n       (4) Commission review, revision, and finalization of \n     initial payment determinations.--\n       (A) Comments from insurer participants.--Not later than 30 \n     days after receiving a notice of initial determination from \n     the Commission, an insurer participant may provide the \n     Commission with additional information to support adjustments \n     to the required payments to reflect severe financial hardship \n     or exceptional circumstances, including the provision of an \n     offset credit for an insurer participant for the amount of \n     any asbestos-related payments it made or was legally \n     obligated to make, including payments released from an \n     escrow, as the result of a bankruptcy judicially confirmed \n     after May 22, 2003, but before the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (B) Additional participants.--If, before the final \n     determination of the Commission, the Commission receives \n     information that an additional person may qualify as an \n     insurer participant, the Commission shall require such person \n     to submit information necessary to determine whether payments \n     from that person should be required, in accordance with the \n     requirements of this subsection.\n       (C) Revision procedures.--The Commission shall adopt \n     procedures for revising initial payments based on information \n     received under subparagraphs (A) and (B), including a \n     provision requiring an offset credit for an insurer \n     participant for the amount of any asbestos-related payments \n     it made or was legally obligated to make, including payments \n     released from an escrow, as the result of a bankruptcy \n     confirmed after May 22, 2003, but before the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (5) Examinations and subpoenas.--\n       (A) Examinations.--The Commission may conduct examinations \n     of the books and records of insurer participants to determine \n     the completeness and accuracy of information submitted, or \n     required to be submitted, to the Commission for purposes of \n     determining participant payments.\n       (B) Subpoenas.--The Commission may request the Attorney \n     General to subpoena persons to compel testimony, records, and \n     other information relevant to its responsibilities under this \n     section. The Attorney General may enforce such subpoena in \n     appropriate proceedings in the United States district court \n     for the district in which the person to whom the subpoena was \n     addressed resides, was served, or transacts business.\n       (6) Escrow payments.--Without regard to an insurer \n     participant's payment obligation under this section, any \n     escrow or similar account established before the date of \n     enactment of this Act by an insurer participant in connection \n     with an asbestos trust fund that has not been judicially \n     confirmed by final order by the date of enactment of this Act \n     shall be the property of the insurer participant and returned \n     to that insurer participant.\n       (7) Notice to insurer participants of final payment \n     determinations.--Not later than 60 days after the notice of \n     initial determination is sent to the insurer participants, \n     the Commission shall send each insurer participant a notice \n     of final determination.\n       (c) Insurer Participants Voluntary Allocation Agreement.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the \n     Commission proposes its rule establishing an allocation \n     methodology under subsection (a)(1), direct insurer \n     participants licensed or domiciled in the United States, \n     other direct insurer participants, reinsurer participants \n     licensed or domiciled in the United States, or other \n     reinsurer participants, may submit an allocation agreement, \n     approved by all of the participants in the applicable group, \n     to the Commission.\n       (2) Allocation agreement.--To the extent the participants \n     in any such applicable group voluntarily agree upon an \n     allocation arrangement, any such allocation agreement shall \n     only govern the allocation of payments\n\n[[Page S3927]]\n\n     within that group and shall not determine the aggregate \n     amount due from that group.\n       (3) Certification.--The Commission shall determine whether \n     an allocation agreement submitted under subparagraph (A) \n     meets the requirements of this subtitle and, if so, shall \n     certify the agreement as establishing the allocation \n     methodology governing the individual payment obligations of \n     the participants who are parties to the agreement. The \n     authority of the Commission under this subtitle shall, with \n     respect to participants who are parties to a certified \n     allocation agreement, terminate on the day after the \n     Commission certifies such agreement. Under subsection (f), \n     the Administrator shall assume responsibility, if necessary, \n     for calculating the individual payment obligations of \n     participants who are parties to the certified agreement.\n       (d) Commission Report.--\n       (1) Recipients.--Until the work of the Commission has been \n     completed and the Commission terminated, the Commission shall \n     submit an annual report, containing the information described \n     under paragraph (2), to--\n       (A) the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate;\n       (B) the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of \n     Representatives; and\n       (C) the Administrator.\n       (2) Contents.--The report under paragraph (1) shall state \n     the amount that each insurer participant is required to pay \n     to the Fund, including the payment schedule for such \n     payments.\n       (e) Interim Payments.--\n       (1) Authority of administrator.--During the period between \n     the date of enactment of this Act and the date when the \n     Commission issues its final determinations of payments, the \n     Administrator shall have the authority to require insurer \n     participants to make interim payments to the Fund to assure \n     adequate funding by insurer participants during such period.\n       (2) Amount of interim payments.--During any applicable \n     year, the Administrator may require insurer participants to \n     make aggregate interim payments not to exceed the annual \n     aggregate amount specified in subsection (a)(3)(C).\n       (3) Allocation of payments.--Interim payments shall be \n     allocated among individual insurer participants on an \n     equitable basis as determined by the Administrator. All \n     payments required under this subparagraph shall be credited \n     against the participant's ultimate payment obligation to the \n     Fund established by the Commission. If an interim payment \n     exceeds the ultimate payment, the Fund shall pay interest on \n     the amount of the overpayment at a rate determined by the \n     Administrator. If the ultimate payment exceeds the interim \n     payment, the participant shall pay interest on the amount of \n     the underpayment at the same rate. Any participant may seek \n     an exemption from or reduction in any payment required under \n     this subsection under the financial hardship and exceptional \n     circumstance standards established in subsection (a)(3)(D).\n       (4) Appeal of interim payment decisions.--A decision by the \n     Administrator to establish an interim payment obligation \n     shall be considered final agency action and reviewable under \n     section 303, except that the reviewing court may not stay an \n     interim payment during the pendency of the appeal.\n       (f) Transfer of Authority From the Commission to the \n     Administrator.--\n       (1) In general.--Upon termination of the Commission under \n     section 215, the Administrator shall assume all the \n     responsibilities and authority of the Commission, except that \n     the Administrator shall not have the power to modify the \n     allocation methodology established by the Commission or by \n     certified agreement or to promulgate a rule establishing any \n     such methodology.\n       (2) Financial hardship and exceptional circumstance \n     adjustments.--Upon termination of the Commission under \n     section 215, the Administrator shall have the authority, upon \n     application by any insurer participant, to make adjustments \n     to annual payments upon the same grounds as provided in \n     subsection (a)(3)(D). Adjustments granted under this \n     subsection shall have a term not to exceed 3 years. An \n     insurer participant may renew its adjustment by demonstrating \n     that it remains justified. Upon the grant of any adjustment, \n     the Administrator shall increase the payments required of all \n     other insurer participants so that there is no reduction in \n     the aggregate payment required of all insurer participants \n     for the applicable years. The increase in an insurer \n     participant's required payment shall be in proportion to such \n     participant's share of the aggregate payment obligation of \n     all insurer participants.\n       (3) Financial security requirements.--Whenever an insurer \n     participant's A.M. Best's claims payment rating or Standard \n     and Poor's financial strength rating falls below A-, and \n     until such time as either the insurer participant's A.M. \n     Best's Rating or Standard and Poor's rating is equal to or \n     greater than A-, the Administrator shall have the authority \n     to require that the participating insurer either--\n       (A) pay the present value of its remaining Fund payments at \n     a discount rate determined by the Administrator; or\n       (B) provide an evergreen letter of credit or financial \n     guarantee for future payments issued by an institution with \n     an A.M. Best's claims payment rating or Standard & Poor's \n     financial strength rating of at least A+.\n       (g) Judicial Review.--The Commission's rule establishing an \n     allocation methodology, its final determinations of payment \n     obligations and other final action shall be judicially \n     reviewable as provided in title III.\n\n     SEC. 213. POWERS OF ASBESTOS INSURERS COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Rulemaking.--The Commission shall promulgate such rules \n     and regulations as necessary to implement its authority under \n     this Act, including regulations governing an allocation \n     methodology.

MANAGEMENT OF THE FUND.\n\n       (a) In General.--Amounts in the Fund shall be held for the \n     exclusive purpose of providing benefits to asbestos claimants \n     and their beneficiaries, including those provided in \n     subsection (c), and to otherwise defray the reasonable \n     expenses of administering the Fund.\n       (b) Investments.--\n       (1) In general.--Amounts in the Fund shall be administered \n     and invested with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence, \n     under the circumstances prevailing at the time of such \n     investment, that a prudent person acting in a like capacity \n     and manner would use.\n       (2) Strategy.--The Administrator shall invest amounts in \n     the Fund in a manner that enables the Fund to make current \n     and future distributions to or for the benefit of asbestos \n     claimants. In pursuing an investment strategy under this \n     subparagraph, the Administrator shall consider, to the extent \n     relevant to an investment decision or action--\n       (A) the size of the Fund;\n       (B) the nature and estimated duration of the Fund;\n       (C) the liquidity and distribution requirements of the \n     Fund;\n       (D) general economic conditions at the time of the \n     investment;\n       (E) the possible effect of inflation or deflation on Fund \n     assets;\n       (F) the role that each investment or course of action plays \n     with respect to the overall assets of the Fund;\n       (G) the expected amount to be earned (including both income \n     and appreciation of capital) through investment of amounts in \n     the Fund; and\n       (H) the needs of asbestos claimants for current and future \n     distributions authorized under this Act.\n       (c) Mesothelioma Research and Treatment Centers.--\n       (1) In general.--The Administrator shall provide $1,000,000 \n     from the Fund for each of fiscal years 2005 through 2009 for \n     each of up to 10 mesothelioma disease research and treatment \n     centers.\n       (2) Requirements.--The Centers shall--\n       (A) be chosen by the Director of the National Institutes of \n     Health;\n       (B) be chosen through competitive peer review;\n       (C) be geographically distributed throughout the United \n     States with special consideration given to areas of high \n     incidence of mesothelioma disease;\n       (D) be closely associated with Department of Veterans \n     Affairs medical centers to provide research benefits and care \n     to veterans who have suffered excessively from mesothelioma;\n       (E) be engaged in research to provide mechanisms for \n     detection and prevention of mesothelioma, particularly in the \n     areas of pain management and cures;\n       (F) be engaged in public education about mesothelioma and \n     prevention, screening, and treatment;\n       (G) be participants in the National Mesothelioma Registry; \n     and\n       (H) be coordinated in their research and treatment efforts \n     with other Centers and institutions involved in exemplary \n     mesothelioma research.\n       (d) Bankruptcy Trust Guarantee.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, the Administrator shall have the authority to \n     impose a pro rata surcharge on all participants under this \n     subsection to ensure the liquidity of the Fund, if--\n       (A) the declared assets from 1 or more bankruptcy trusts \n     established under a plan of reorganization confirmed and \n     substantially consummated on or before July 31, 2004, are not \n     available to the Fund because a final judgment that has been \n     entered by a court and is no longer subject to any appeal or \n     review has enjoined the transfer of assets required under \n     section 524(j)(2) of title 11, United States Code (as amended \n     by section 402(f) of this Act); and\n       (B) borrowing is insufficient to assure the Fund's ability \n     to meet its obligations under this Act such that the required \n     borrowed amount is likely to increase the risk of termination \n     of this Act under section 405 based on reasonable claims \n     projections.\n       (2) Allocation.--Any surcharge imposed under this \n     subsection shall be imposed over a period of 5 years on a pro \n     rata basis upon all participants, in accordance with each \n     participant's relative annual liability under this subtitle \n     and subtitle B for those 5 years.\n       (3) Certification.--\n\n[[Page S3929]]\n\n       (A) In general.--Before imposing a surcharge under this \n     subsection, the Administrator shall publish a notice in the \n     Federal Register and provide in such notice for a public \n     comment period of 30 days.\n       (B) Contents of notice.--The notice required under \n     subparagraph (A) shall include--\n       (i) information explaining the circumstances that make a \n     surcharge necessary and a certification that the requirements \n     under paragraph (1) are met;\n       (ii) the amount of the declared assets from any trust \n     established under a plan of reorganization confirmed and \n     substantially consummated on or before July 31, 2004, that \n     was not made, or is no longer, available to the Fund;\n       (iii) the total aggregate amount of the necessary \n     surcharge; and\n       (iv) the surcharge amount for each tier and subtier of \n     defendant participants and for each insurer participant.\n       (C) Final notice.--The Administrator shall publish a final \n     notice in the Federal Register and provide each participant \n     with written notice of that participant's schedule of \n     payments under this subsection. In no event shall any \n     required surcharge under this subsection be due before 60 \n     days after the Administrator publishes the final notice in \n     the Federal Register and provides each participant with \n     written notice of its schedule of payments.\n       (4) Maximum amount.--In no event shall the total aggregate \n     surcharge imposed by the Administrator exceed the lesser of--\n       (A) the total aggregate amount of the declared assets of \n     the trusts established under a plan of reorganization \n     confirmed and substantially consummated prior to July 31, \n     2004, that are no longer available to the Fund; or\n       (B) $4,000,000,000.\n       (5) Declared assets.--\n       (A) In general.--In this subsection, the term ``declared \n     assets'' means--\n       (i) the amount of assets transferred by any trust \n     established under a plan of reorganization confirmed and \n     substantially consummated on or before July 31, 2004, to the \n     Fund that is required to be returned to that trust under the \n     final judgment described in paragraph (1)(A); or\n       (ii) if no assets were transferred by the trust to the \n     Fund, the amount of assets the Administrator determines would \n     have been available for transfer to the Fund from that trust \n     under section 402(f).\n       (B) Determination.--In making a determination under \n     subparagraph (A)(ii), the Administrator may rely on any \n     information reasonably available, and may request, and use \n     subpoena authority of the Administrator if necessary to \n     obtain, relevant information from any such trust or its \n     trustees.\n       (e) Bankruptcy Trust Credits.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, but subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, \n     the Administrator shall provide a credit toward the aggregate \n     payment obligations under sections 202(a)(2) and 212(a)(2)(A) \n     for assets received by the Fund from any bankruptcy trust \n     established under a plan of reorganization confirmed and \n     substantially consummated after July 31, 2004.\n       (2) Allocation of credits.--The Administrator shall \n     allocate, for each such bankruptcy trust, the credits for \n     such assets between the defendant and insurer aggregate \n     payment obligations as follows:\n       (A) Defendant participants.--The aggregate amount that all \n     persons other than insurers contributing to the bankruptcy \n     trust would have been required to pay as Tier I defendants \n     under section 203(b) if the plan of reorganization under \n     which the bankruptcy trust was established had not been \n     confirmed and substantially consummated and the proceeding \n     under chapter 11 of title 11, United States Code, that \n     resulted in the establishment of the bankruptcy trust had \n     remained pending as of the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (B) Insurer participants.--The aggregate amount of all \n     credits to which insurers are entitled to under section \n     202(c)(4)(A) of the Act.\n\n     SEC. 223.

The positions taken or statements made by \n     the Administrator in any such proceeding shall not be binding \n     on or attributed to the insureds or cedents in any other \n     proceeding. The outcome of such a proceeding shall not have a \n     preclusive effect on the insureds or cedents in any other \n     proceeding and shall not be admissible against any subrogee \n     under this section. The Administrator shall have the \n     authority to settle or compromise any claims against a \n     nonpaying insurer participant under this subsection.\n       (e) Bar on United States Business.--If any direct insurer \n     or reinsurer refuses to furnish any information requested by \n     or to pay any contribution required by this Act, then, in \n     addition to any other penalties imposed by this Act, the \n     Administrator may issue an order barring such entity and its \n     affiliates from insuring risks located within the United \n     States or otherwise doing business within the United States. \n     Insurer participants or their affiliates seeking to obtain a \n     license from any State to write any type of insurance shall \n     be barred from obtaining any such license until payment of \n     all contributions required as of the date of license \n     application.\n       (f) Credit for Reinsurance.--If the Administrator \n     determines that an insurer participant that is a reinsurer is \n     in default in paying any required contribution or otherwise \n     not in compliance with this Act, the Administrator may issue \n     an order barring any direct insurer participant from \n     receiving credit for reinsurance purchased from the \n     defaulting reinsurer. Any State law governing credit for \n     reinsurance to the contrary is preempted.\n       (g) Defense Limitation.--In any proceeding under this \n     section, the participant shall be barred from bringing any \n     challenge to any determination of the Administrator or the \n     Asbestos Insurers Commission regarding its liability under \n     this Act, or to the constitutionality of this Act or any \n     provision thereof, if such challenge could have been made \n     during the review provided under section 204(i)(10), or in a \n     judicial review proceeding under section 303.\n       (h) Deposit of Funds.--\n       (1) In general.--Any funds collected under subsection \n     (c)(2) (A) or (C) shall be--\n\n[[Page S3930]]\n\n       (A) deposited in the Fund; and\n       (B) used only to pay--\n       (i) claims for awards for an eligible disease or condition \n     determined under title I; or\n       (ii) claims for reimbursement for medical monitoring \n     determined under title I.\n       (2) No effect on other liabilities.--The imposition of a \n     fine under subsection (c)(2)(C) shall have no effect on--\n       (A) the assessment of contributions under subtitles A and \n     B; or\n       (B) any other provision of this Act.\n       (i) Property of the Estate.--Section 541(b) of title 11, \n     United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (4)(B)(ii), by striking ``or'' at the end;\n       (2) in paragraph (5), by striking ``prohibition.'' and \n     inserting ``prohibition; or''; and\n       (3) by inserting after paragraph (5) and before the last \n     undesignated sentence the following:\n       ``(6) the value of any pending claim against or the amount \n     of an award granted from the Asbestos Injury Claims \n     Resolution Fund established under the Fairness in Asbestos \n     Injury Resolution Act of 2005.''.\n\n     SEC. 224.

and\n       (ii) the resolution of claims for reimbursement or coverage \n     of liability or paid or incurred loss for which notice was \n     provided to the insurer before the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (E) Scheduled payment amounts.--The term ``scheduled \n     payment amounts'' means the future payment obligation to the \n     Fund under this Act from a defendant participant in the \n     amount established under sections 203 and 204.\n       (F) Unearned erosion amount.--The term ``unearned erosion \n     amount'' means, in the event of any early sunset under \n     section 405(f), the difference between the deemed erosion \n     amount and the earned erosion amount.\n       (2) Quantum and timing of erosion.--\n       (A) Erosion upon enactment.--The collective payment \n     obligations to the Fund of the insurer and reinsurer \n     participants as assessed by the Administrator shall be deemed \n     as of the date of enactment of this Act to erode remaining \n     aggregate products limits available to a defendant \n     participant only in an amount of 38.1 percent of each \n     defendant participant's scheduled payment amount.\n       (B) No assertion of claim.--No insurer or reinsurer may \n     assert any claim against a defendant participant or captive \n     insurer for insurance, reinsurance, payment of a deductible, \n     or retrospective premium adjustment arising out of that \n     insurer's or reinsurer's payments to the Fund or the erosion \n     deemed to occur under this section.\n       (C) Policies without certain limits or with exclusion.--\n     Except as provided under subparagraph (E), nothing in this \n     section shall require or permit the erosion of any insurance \n     policy or limit that does not contain an aggregate products \n     limit, or that contains an asbestos exclusion.\n       (D) Treatment of consolidation election.--If an affiliated \n     group elects consolidation as provided in section 204(f), the \n     total erosion of limits for the affiliated group under \n     paragraph (2)(A) shall not exceed 59.64 percent of the \n     scheduled payment amount of the single payment obligation for \n     the entire affiliated group. The total erosion of limits for \n     any individual defendant participant in the affiliated group \n     shall not exceed its individual share of 59.64 percent of the \n     affiliated group's scheduled payment amount, as measured by \n     the individual defendant participant's percentage share of \n     the affiliated group's prior asbestos expenditures.\n       (E) Rule of construction.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this section, nothing in this Act shall be \n     deemed to erode remaining aggregate products limits of a \n     defendant participant that can demonstrate by a reponderance \n     of the evidence that 75 percent of its prior asbestos \n     expenditures were made in defense or satisfaction of asbestos \n     claims alleging bodily injury arising exclusively from the \n     exposure to asbestos at premises owned, rented, or controlled \n     by the defendant participant (a ``premises defendant''). In \n     calculating such percentage, where expenditures were made in \n     defense or satisfaction of asbestos claims alleging bodily \n     injury due to exposure to the defendant participant's \n     products and to asbestos at premises owned, rented, or \n     controlled by the defendant participant, half of such \n     expenditures shall be deemed to be for such premises \n     exposures. If a defendant participant establishes itself as a \n     premises defendant, 75 percent of the payments by such \n     defendant participant shall erode coverage limits, if any, \n     applicable to premises liabilities under applicable law.\n       (3) Method of erosion.--\n       (A) Allocation.--The amount of erosion allocated to each \n     defendant participant shall be allocated among periods in \n     which policies with remaining aggregate product limits are \n     available to that defendant participant pro rata by policy \n     period, in ascending order by attachment point.\n       (B) Other erosion methods.--\n       (i) In general.--Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the \n     method of erosion of any remaining aggregate products limits \n     which are subject to--\n\n       (I) a coverage-in-place or settlement agreement between a \n     defendant participant and 1 or more insurance participants as \n     of the date of enactment; or\n       (II) a final and nonappealable judgment as of the date of \n     enactment or resulting from a claim for coverage or \n     reimbursement pending as of such date, shall be as specified \n     in such agreement or judgment with regard to erosion \n     applicable to such insurance participants' policies.\n\n       (ii) Remaining limits.--To the extent that a final \n     nonappealable judgment or settlement agreement to which an \n     insurer participant and a defendant participant are parties \n     in effect as of the date of enactment of this Act \n     extinguished a defendant participant's right to seek coverage \n     for asbestos claims under an insurer participant's policies, \n     any\n\n[[Page S3935]]\n\n     remaining limits in such policies shall not be considered to \n     be remaining aggregate products limits under subsection \n     (a)(1)(A).\n       (4) Restoration of aggregate products limits upon early \n     sunset.--\n       (A) Restoration.--In the event of an early sunset, any \n     unearned erosion amount will be deemed restored as aggregate \n     products limits available to a defendant participant as of \n     the date of enactment.\n       (B) Method of restoration.--The unearned erosion amount \n     will be deemed restored to each defendant participant's \n     policies in such a manner that the last limits that were \n     deemed eroded at enactment under this subsection are deemed \n     to be the first limits restored upon early sunset.\n       (C) Tolling of coverage claims.--In the event of an early \n     sunset, the applicable statute of limitations and contractual \n     provisions for the filing of claims under any insurance \n     policy with restored aggregate products limits shall be \n     deemed tolled after the date of enactment through the date 6 \n     months after the date of early sunset.\n       (5) Payments by defendant participant.--Payments made by a \n     defendant participant shall be deemed to erode, exhaust, or \n     otherwise satisfy applicable self-insured retentions, \n     deductibles, retrospectively rated premiums, and limits \n     issued by nonparticipating insolvent or captive insurance \n     companies. Reduction of remaining aggregate limits under this \n     subsection shall not limit the right of a defendant \n     participant to collect from any insurer not a participant.\n       (6) Effect on other insurance claims.--Other than as \n     specified in this subsection, this Act does not alter, \n     change, modify, or affect insurance for claims other than \n     asbestos claims.\n       (b) Dispute Resolution Procedure.--\n       (1) Arbitration.--The parties to a dispute regarding the \n     erosion of insurance coverage limits under this section may \n     agree in writing to settle such dispute by arbitration. Any \n     such provision or agreement shall be valid, irrevocable, and \n     enforceable, except for any grounds that exist at law or in \n     equity for revocation of a contract.\n       (2) Title 9, united states code.--Arbitration of such \n     disputes, awards by arbitrators, and confirmation of awards \n     shall be governed by title 9, United States Code, to the \n     extent such title is not inconsistent with this section. In \n     any such arbitration proceeding, the erosion principles \n     provided for under this section shall be binding on the \n     arbitrator, unless the parties agree to the contrary.\n       (3) Final and binding award.--An award by an arbitrator \n     shall be final and binding between the parties to the \n     arbitration, but shall have no force or effect on any other \n     person. The parties to an arbitration may agree that in the \n     event a policy which is the subject matter of an award is \n     subsequently determined to be eroded in a manner different \n     from the manner determined by the arbitration in a judgment \n     rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction from which no \n     appeal can or has been taken, such arbitration award may be \n     modified by any court of competent jurisdiction upon \n     application by any party to the arbitration. Any such \n     modification shall govern the rights and obligations between \n     such parties after the date of such modification.\n       (c) Effect on Nonparticipants.--\n       (1) In general.--No insurance company or reinsurance \n     company that is not a participant, other than a captive \n     insurer, shall be entitled to claim that payments to the Fund \n     erode, exhaust, or otherwise limit the nonparticipant's \n     insurance or reinsurance obligations.\n       (2) Other claims.--Nothing in this Act shall preclude a \n     participant from pursuing any claim for insurance or \n     reinsurance from any person that is not a participant other \n     than a captive insurer.\n       (d) Finite Risk Policies Not Affected.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, except subject to section 212(a)(1)(D), this Act \n     shall not alter, affect or impair any rights or obligations \n     of--\n       (A) any party to an insurance contract that expressly \n     provides coverage for governmental charges or assessments \n     imposed to replace insurance or reinsurance liabilities in \n     effect on the date of enactment of this Act; or\n       (B) subject to paragraph (2), any person with respect to \n     any insurance or reinsurance purchased by a participant after \n     December 31, 1990, that expressly (but not necessarily \n     exclusively) provides coverage for asbestos liabilities, \n     including those policies commonly referred to as ``finite \n     risk'' policies.\n       (2) Limitation.--No person may assert that any amounts paid \n     to the Fund in accordance with this Act are covered by any \n     policy described under paragraph (1)(B) purchased by a \n     defendant participant, unless such policy specifically \n     provides coverage for required payments to a Federal trust \n     fund established by a Federal statute to resolve asbestos \n     injury claims.\n       (e) Effect on Certain Insurance and Reinsurance Claims.--\n       (1) No coverage for fund assessments.--No participant or \n     captive insurer may pursue an insurance or reinsurance claim \n     against another participant or captive insurer for payments \n     to the Fund required under this Act, except under a contract \n     specifically providing insurance or reinsurance for required \n     payments to a Federal trust fund established by a Federal \n     statute to resolve asbestos injury claims or, where \n     applicable, under finite risk policies under subsection (d).\n       (2) Certain insurance assignments voided.--Any assignment \n     of any rights to insurance coverage for asbestos claims to \n     any person who has asserted an asbestos claim before the date \n     of enactment of this Act, or to any trust, person, or other \n     entity not part of an affiliated group as defined in section \n     201(1) of this Act established or appointed for the purpose \n     of paying asbestos claims which were asserted before such \n     date of enactment, or by any Tier I defendant participant, \n     before any sunset of this Act, shall be null and void. This \n     subsection shall not void or affect in any way any \n     assignments of rights to insurance coverage other than to \n     asbestos claimants or to trusts, persons, or other entities \n     not part of an affiliated group as defined in section 201(1) \n     of this Act established or appointed for the purpose of \n     paying asbestos claims, or by Tier I defendant participants.\n       (3) Insurance claims preserved.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this Act, this Act shall not alter, affect, or \n     impair any rights or obligations of any person with respect \n     to any insurance or reinsurance for amounts that any person \n     pays, has paid, or becomes legally obligated to pay in \n     respect of asbestos or other claims, except to the extent \n     that--\n       (A) such person pays or becomes legally obligated to pay \n     claims that are superseded by section 403;\n       (B) any such rights or obligations of such person with \n     respect to insurance or reinsurance are prohibited by \n     paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (e); or\n       (C) the limits of insurance otherwise available to such \n     participant in respect of asbestos claims are deemed to be \n     eroded under subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 405.

The report shall include a description of changes in \n     the diagnostic, exposure, or medical criteria of section 121 \n     that the Administrator believes may be necessary to protect \n     the Fund from compensating claims not caused by exposure to \n     asbestos.\n       (d) Shortfall Analysis.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Analysis.--If the Administrator concludes, on the basis \n     of the information contained in the annual report submitted \n     under this section, that the Fund may not be able to pay \n     claims as such claims become due at any time within the next \n     5 years, the Administrator shall include in the report an \n     analysis of the reasons for the situation, an estimation of \n     when the Fund will no longer be able to pay claims as such \n     claims become due, a description of the range of reasonable \n     alternatives for responding to the situation, and a \n     recommendation as to which alternative best serves the \n     interest of claimants and the public. The report may include \n     a description of changes in the diagnostic, exposure, or \n     medical criteria of section 121 that the Administrator \n     believes may be necessary to protect the Fund.\n       (B) Range of alternatives.--The range of alternatives under \n     subparagraph (A) may include--\n       (i) triggering the termination of this Act under subsection \n     (f) at any time after the date of enactment of this Act; and\n       (ii) reform of the program set forth in titles I and II of \n     this Act (including changes in the diagnostic, exposure, or \n     medical criteria, changes in the enforcement or application \n     of those criteria, changes in the timing of payments, changes \n     in contributions by defendant participants, insurer \n     participants (or both such participants), or changes in award \n     values).\n       (2) Considerations.--In formulating recommendations, the \n     Administrator shall take into account the reasons for any \n     shortfall, actual or projected, which may include--\n       (A) financial factors, including return on investments, \n     borrowing capacity, interest rates, ability to collect \n     contributions, and other relevant factors;\n       (B) the operation of the Fund generally, including \n     administration of the claims processing, the ability of the \n     Administrator to collect contributions from participants, \n     potential problems of fraud, the adequacy of the criteria to \n     rule out idiopathic mesothelioma, and inadequate flexibility \n     to extend the timing of payments;\n       (C) the appropriateness of the diagnostic, exposure, and \n     medical criteria, including the adequacy of the criteria to \n     rule out idiopathic mesothelioma;\n       (D) the actual incidence of asbestos-related diseases, \n     including mesothelioma, based on epidemiological studies and \n     other relevant data;\n       (E) compensation of diseases with alternative causes; and\n       (F) other factors that the Administrator considers \n     relevant.\n       (3) Recommendation of termination.--Any recommendation of \n     termination should include a plan for winding up the affairs \n     of the Fund (and the program generally) within a defined \n     period, including paying in full all claims resolved at the \n     time the report is prepared. Any plan under this paragraph \n     shall provide for priority in payment to the claimants with \n     the most serious illnesses.\n       (4) Resolved claims.--For purposes of this section, a claim \n     shall be deemed resolved when the Administrator has \n     determined the amount of the award due the claimant, and \n     either the claimant has waived judicial review or the time \n     for judicial review has expired.\n       (e) Recommendations of Administrator and Commission.--\n       (1) In general.--If the Administrator recommends changes to \n     this Act under subsection (c), the recommendations and \n     accompanying analysis shall be referred to a special \n     commission consisting of the Attorney General, the Secretary \n     of Labor, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the \n     Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of Commerce, or \n     their designees. The Commission shall hold expedited public \n     hearings on the Administrator's alternatives and \n     recommendations and then make its own recommendations for \n     reform of the program set forth in titles I and II of this \n     Act. Within 180 days after receiving the Administrator's \n     recommendations, the Commission shall transmit its own \n     recommendations to the Congress in the same manner as set \n     forth in subsection (a).\n       (2) Referral.--If the Administrator recommends changes to, \n     or termination of, this Act under subsection (d), the \n     recommendations and accompanying analysis shall be referred \n     to the Commission. The Commission shall hold expedited public \n     hearings on the Administrator's alternatives and \n     recommendations and then make its own recommendations for \n     reform of the program set forth in titles I and II of this \n     Act. Within 180 days after receiving the Administrator's \n     recommendations, the Commission shall transmit its own \n     recommendations to Congress in the same manner as set forth \n     in subsection (a).\n       (f) Sunset of Act.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Termination.--Subject to paragraph (4), titles I \n     (except subtitle A) and II and sections 403 and 404(e)(2) \n     shall terminate as provided under paragraph (2), if the \n     Administrator--\n       (i) has begun the processing of claims; and\n       (ii) as part of the review conducted to prepare an annual \n     report under this section, determines that if any additional \n     claims are resolved, the Fund will not have sufficient \n     resources when needed to pay 100 percent of all resolved \n     claims while also meeting all other obligations of the Fund \n     under this Act, including the payment of--\n\n       (I) debt repayment obligations; and\n       (II) remaining obligations to the asbestos trust of a \n     debtor and the class action trust.\n\n       (B) Remaining obligations.--For purposes of subparagraph \n     (A)(ii), the remaining obligations to the asbestos trust of \n     the debtor and the class action trust shall be determined by \n     the Administrator by assuming that, instead of a lump-sum \n     payment, such trust had transferred its assets to the Fund on \n     an annual basis, taking into consideration relevant factors, \n     including the most recent projections made by the trust's \n     actuary before the date of enactment of this Act of the \n     amount and timing of future claim payments and administrative \n     and operating expenses.\n       (2) Effective date of termination.--A termination under \n     paragraph (1) shall take effect 180 days after the date of a \n     determination of the Administrator under paragraph (1) and \n     shall apply to all asbestos claims that have not been \n     resolved by the Fund as of the date of the determination.\n       (3) Resolved claims.--If a termination takes effect under \n     this subsection, all resolved claims shall be paid in full by \n     the Fund.\n       (4) Extinguished claims.--A claim that is extinguished \n     under the statute of limitations provisions in section 113(b) \n     is not revived at the time of sunset under this subsection.\n       (5) Continued funding.--If a termination takes effect under \n     this subsection, participants will still be required to make \n     payments as provided under subtitles A and B of title II. If \n     the full amount of payments required by title II is not \n     necessary for the Fund to pay claims that have been resolved \n     as of the date of termination, pay the Fund's debt and \n     obligations to the asbestos trusts and class action trust, \n     and support the Fund's continued operation as needed to pay \n     such claims, debt, and obligations, the Administrator may \n     reduce such payments. Any such reductions shall be allocated \n     among participants in approximately the same proportion as \n     the liability under subtitles A and B of title II.\n       (6) Sunset claims.--\n       (A) Definitions.--In this paragraph--\n       (i) the term ``sunset claims'' means claims filed with the \n     Fund, but not yet resolved, when this Act has terminated; and\n       (ii) the term ``sunset claimants'' means persons asserting \n     sunset claims.\n       (B) In general.--If a termination takes effect under this \n     subsection, the applicable statute of limitations for the \n     filing of sunset claims under subsection (g) shall be tolled \n     for any past or pending sunset claimants while such claimants \n     were pursuing claims filed under this Act. For those \n     claimants who decide to pursue a sunset claim in accordance \n     with subsection (g), the applicable statute of limitations \n     shall apply, except that claimants who filed a claim against \n     the Fund under this Act before the date of termination shall \n     have 2 years after the date of termination to file a sunset \n     claim in accordance with subsection (g).\n       (7) Asbestos trusts and class action trust.--On and after \n     the date of termination under this subsection, the trust \n     distribution program of any asbestos trust and the class \n     action trust shall be replaced with the medical criteria \n     requirements of section 121.\n       (8) Payment to asbestos trusts and class action trust.--The \n     amounts determined under paragraph (1)(B) for payment to the \n     asbestos trusts and the class action trust shall be \n     transferred to the respective asbestos trusts of the debtor \n     and the class action trust within 90 days.\n       (g) Nature of Claim After Sunset.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Relief.--On and after the date of termination under \n     subsection (f), any individual with an asbestos claim who has \n     not previously had a claim resolved by the Fund, may in a \n     civil action obtain relief in damages subject to the terms \n     and conditions under this subsection and paragraph (6) of \n     subsection (f).\n       (B) Resolved claims.--An individual who has had a claim \n     resolved by the Fund may not pursue a court action, except \n     that an individual who received an award for a nonmalignant \n     disease (Levels I through V) from the Fund may assert a claim \n     for a subsequent or progressive disease under this \n     subsection, unless the disease was diagnosed or the claimant \n     had discovered facts that would have led a reasonable person \n     to obtain such\n\n[[Page S3937]]\n\n     a diagnosis before the date on which the previous claim \n     against the Fund was disposed.\n       (C) Mesthelioma claim.--An individual who received an award \n     for a nonmalignant or malignant disease (except mesothelioma) \n     (Levels I through VIII) from the Fund may assert a claim for \n     mesothelioma under this subsection, unless the mesothelioma \n     was diagnosed or the claimant had discovered facts that would \n     have led a reasonable person to obtain such a diagnosis \n     before the date on which the nonmalignant or other malignant \n     claim was disposed.\n       (2) Exclusive remedy.--As of the effective date of a \n     termination of this Act under subsection (f), an action under \n     paragraph (1) shall be the exclusive remedy for any asbestos \n     claim that might otherwise exist under Federal, State, or \n     other law, regardless of whether such claim arose before or \n     after the date of enactment of this Act or of the termination \n     of this Act, except that claims against the Fund that have \n     been resolved before the date of the termination \n     determination under subsection (f) may be paid by the Fund.\n       (3) Venue.--\n       (A) In general.--Actions under paragraph (1) may be brought \n     in--\n       (i) any Federal district court;\n       (ii) any State court in the State where the claimant \n     resides; or\n       (iii) any State court in a State where the asbestos \n     exposure occurred.\n       (B) Defendants not found.--If any defendant cannot be found \n     in the State described in clause (ii) or (iii) of \n     subparagraph (A), the claim may be pursued only against that \n     defendant in the Federal district court or the State court \n     located within any State in which the defendant may be found.\n       (C) Determination of most appropriate forum.--If a person \n     alleges that the asbestos exposure occurred in more than one \n     county (or Federal district), the trial court shall determine \n     which State and county (or Federal district) is the most \n     appropriate forum for the claim. If the court determines that \n     another forum would be the most appropriate forum for a \n     claim, the court shall dismiss the claim. Any otherwise \n     applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled beginning \n     on the date the claim was filed and ending on the date the \n     claim is dismissed under this subparagraph.\n       (D) State venue requirements.--Nothing in this paragraph \n     shall preempt or supersede any State's law relating to venue \n     requirements within that State which are more restrictive.\n       (4) Class action trusts.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this section--\n       (A) after the assets of any class action trust have been \n     transferred to the Fund in accordance with section 203(b)(5), \n     no asbestos claim may be maintained with respect to asbestos \n     liabilities arising from the operations of a person with \n     respect to whose liabilities for asbestos claims a class \n     action trust has been established, whether such claim names \n     the person or its successors or affiliates as defendants; and\n       (B) if a termination takes effect under subsection (f), the \n     exclusive remedy for all asbestos claims (including sunset \n     claims and claims first arising or first presented after \n     termination of the Fund) arising from such operations will be \n     a claim against the class action trust to which the \n     Administrator has transferred funds under subsection (f)(8) \n     to pay asbestos claims, if necessary in proportionally \n     reduced amounts.\n\n     SEC. 406.

Ban of asbestos containing products.''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this day has been a long time in coming, \nand I am pleased to join the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Feinstein, and others in sponsoring bipartisan legislation to \naddress the serious problem of asbestos-related disease. It is the \nproduct of years of difficult and conscientious craftsmanship and \nnegotiation. Building on the Committee's work under Chairman Hatch, we \nhave striven to bring a fair and efficient plan to the Congress, a plan \nthat will ensure adequate compensation to the thousands of victims of \nasbestos exposure, but that also will give due consideration to the \nindustries and the insurers that should, and will, provide that \ncompensation. Our bipartisan legislation does that. Asbestos exposure \nhas created a maze of arduous problems, and we have worked hard to \nproduce a balanced bill that offers fair solutions.\n  Senator Specter, with whom I have worked so hard on this legislation, \nrightly calls this one of the most complex issues we have ever tackled. \nIt is not the bill that I would have written, were I alone responsible \nfor its drafting, nor is it the bill that Senator Specter might have \nproduced. Nor should anyone be surprised to hear that the interested \ngroups--the labor organizations, the industrial participants in the \ntrust fund, their insurers, the trial bar--are each less than pleased \nwith some portion of the bill or another. That is the essence of \nlegislative compromise: We have kept the ultimate goal of fair \ncompensation to victims as the lodestar of our efforts, and we have all \nhad to make sacrifices on a variety of subsidiary issues as we worked \ntogether to resolve this emergency. What we have achieved is important \nand a significant step toward a better, more efficient method to \ncompensate asbestos victims.\n  Asbestos is among the most lethal substances ever to be widely used \nin the workplace. Between 1940 and 1980, more than 27.5 million workers \nwere exposed to asbestos on the job, and nearly 19 million of them had \nhigh levels of exposure over long periods of time. We even know of \nfamily members who have suffered asbestos-related disease from washing \nthe clothes of loved ones. The ravages of disease caused by asbestos \nhave affected tens of thousands of American families. We need better \nhealth screening and swifter compensation for those affected. In light \nof the devastating damage it has wreaked, it is hard to believe that \nasbestos is still being used today, yet it is. This bill will change \nthat as well, protect against yet another generation of victims.\n  The economic harm caused by asbestos is also real, and the \nbankruptcies that have resulted are a different kind of tragedy for \neveryone--for workers and retirees, for shareholders, and for the \nfamilies that built these companies. In my home State of Vermont, the \nRutland Fire and Clay Company is among the more than 70 companies to \nhave declared bankruptcy.\n  As Chief Justice Rehnquist noted several years ago, ``the elephantine \nmass of asbestos cases cries out for a legislative solution.'' Ortiz v. \nFibreboard Corp., 527 U.S. 815, 865 1999). In another Supreme Court \nopinion, Justice Ginsburg declared that ``a nationwide administrative \nclaims processing regime would provide the most secure, fair, and \nefficient means of compensating victims of asbestos exposure.'' Amchem \nProducts v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 628-29, 1997). I agree, the Chairman \nagrees, Senator Feinstein agrees, and we hope that many others in the \nSenate will agree.\n  Weare encouraged by the favorable reception that this bill has \nalready generated from a wide array of interested parties. In the past \nweek, I have received letters of support from the International Union, \nUnited Automobile, Aerospace & Agricultural Implement Workers of \nAmerica, UAW, the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, VFW, \nthe Asbestos Study Group, and others. The UAW notes in its April 13th \nletter, ``[The Specter-Leahy Proposal] will provide more equitable, \ntimely and certain compensation to the victims of asbestos-related \ndisease.'' The VFW letter of April 14 declares: ``The national trust \nfund that you are proposing offers our members who are sick and dying \nthe opportunity to secure timely and fair compensation for the injury \nthey suffered in the course of serving their country.'' The National \nAssociation of Manufacturers also released a statement expressing their \nhope that this legislation will engender broad support.\n  These statements in many ways tell the story of what we have already \naccomplished: We have drafted a bill that has garnered a favorable \nresponse from labor, manufacturers, and companies with considerable \nasbestos liabilities. We have worked on this legislation for several \nyears now, and I can assure you that garnering this level of consensus \nhas been no small feat. I ask unanimous consent that the text of these \nletters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                          UAW,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 13, 2005.\n       Dear Senator: Senators Specter and Leahy recently put \n     forward a compromise asbestos compensation proposal, and have \n     indicated that they intend to introduce legislation \n     incorporating this proposal early next week. The UAW supports \n     the Specter-Leahy asbestos compensation proposal because we \n     believe it will provide more equitable, timely and certain \n     compensation to the victims of asbestos-related diseases.\n       There is widespread agreement that the current tort system \n     fails miserably in compensating asbestos victims. There are \n     often years of delay before victims receive any compensation. \n     Awards to victims are highly unpredictable, with similarly \n     situated individuals receiving vastly different amounts. Too \n     often compensation goes disproportionately to the less sick \n     at the expense of the most seriously ill victims. The \n     transaction costs, including lawyers' fees, are very high and \n     reduce the amounts received by victims. And even when victims \n     are awarded substantial compensation by the courts, these \n     judgments are often not collectable because the\n\n[[Page S3940]]\n\n     defendant companies have filed for bankruptcy, leaving the \n     victims with little effective recourse.\n       The Specter-Leahy proposal would address these serious \n     problems by replacing the current tort system with a national \n     asbestos trust fund to compensate the victims of asbestos-\n     related diseases. By creating a no-fault administrative \n     system for process claims, this approach would provide \n     victims with speedier compensation, while reducing the \n     substantial lawyers' fees and other transaction costs in the \n     current adversarial litigation system. By compensating \n     victims pursuant to a fixed schedule of payments for \n     specified disease levels, this approach would also provide \n     predictable awards to individuals with similar illnesses, and \n     ensure that the most compensation goes to the most seriously \n     ill victims. Perhaps most importantly, by providing \n     compensation through a national asbestos trust fund, this \n     approach would ensure that victims will receive the full \n     amount of their award regardless of whether a particular \n     company had filed for bankruptcy.\n       The UAW is especially pleased that the Specter-Leahy \n     proposal does not permit any subrogation against worker \n     compensation or health care payments received by asbestos \n     victims. This will ensure that awards are not largely offset \n     by worker compensation or health care payments to which \n     victims are otherwise entitled. In our judgment, the \n     provisions barring any subrogation are essential to ensuring \n     that victims receive adequate compensation.\n       The UAW also is pleased that the Specter-Leahy proposal \n     establishes a mechanism for defendant companies and insurers \n     to contribute to the national asbestos compensation fund, \n     thereby spreading the costs of compensating victims across a \n     broad section of the business and insurance community. We \n     believe this broad-based, predictable financing mechanism is \n     vastly preferable to the current tort system, which has \n     driven most asbestos manufacturers into bankruptcy and is \n     threatening the economic viability of many other companies \n     that used products containing asbestos, thereby jeopardizing \n     the jobs of tens of thousands of workers.\n       The Specter-Leahy proposal provides for reversion of \n     asbestos claims to the tort system in the event the national \n     asbestos trust fund does not have sufficient funds to pay all \n     claims, or in the event the compensation system does not \n     become operational quickly enough. Although the UAW hopes \n     that these reversion provisions will never be triggered, we \n     believe these provisions are essential to ensure that victims \n     will always have some effective recourse for receiving \n     compensation, and to give all stakeholders an incentive to \n     help make the compensation system operate properly.\n       The UAW recognizes that the Specter-Leahy proposal \n     represents a compromise that reflects countless hours of \n     negotiations with the key stakeholders in this issue. We \n     commend Senator Specter and Senator Leahy for their \n     leadership and persistence in moving forward with efforts to \n     fashion this compromise. We also understand that some issues \n     are still under discussion as the Specter-Leahy proposal is \n     translated into legislative language that will be introduced \n     next week. We look forward to reviewing the final details of \n     the legislation when it is available.\n       It is easy for critics who want to maintain the current \n     tort system to point to flaws or shortcomings in the Specter-\n     Leahy proposal. But the issue before the Senate is not \n     whether this proposal is perfect or solves all problems. \n     Rather, the issue is whether the Specter-Leahy proposal is \n     better than the current tort system. The UAW believes that \n     the answer to this question is clearly yes. In our judgment, \n     the Specter-Leahy proposal will provide the victims of \n     asbestos-related diseases with speedier, more equitable and \n     more certain compensation than the current tort system. For \n     this reason, we urge you to support the Specter-Leahy \n     proposal when it is considered by the Senate.\n       Thank you for considering our views on this important \n     issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Alan Reuther,\n     Legislative Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   April 13, 2005.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Ranking Democratic Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: We are writing today to implore you not \n     to forget about our Nation's veterans as you continue your \n     important work of fixing the broken asbestos litigation \n     system. A lot has been written on this issue in the media \n     recently. Yesterday, Senator Arlen Specter said he expects to \n     formally introduce an asbestos victims compensation fund bill \n     later this week. Even before Specter's announcement, some had \n     raised questions about whether an asbestos victims \n     compensation fund is the best solution to the asbestos \n     crisis.\n       But the critics often overlook one crucial element: what is \n     best for asbestos victims?\n       Clearly, the most important outcome for victims, many of \n     whom are veterans dying as a result of asbestos exposure, is \n     a system that provides timely, fair and certain compensation.\n       We believe the compensation fund approach is the only \n     solution that will provide veterans suffering from asbestos-\n     related illnesses with fair and certain compensation.\n       Asbestos has taken a heavy toll on our Nation's veterans. \n     This dangerous substance was widely used by the military \n     during and after World War II, particularly in insulation \n     aboard U.S. Navy ships. Because of the long latency periods \n     of asbestos-related diseases, many veterans are still being \n     diagnosed today with life-threatening diseases that are the \n     result of exposure that occurred during military service \n     decades ago.\n       Veterans are in a unique situation in that we have \n     virtually no avenue for compensation under the current \n     system. Veterans with asbestos-related illnesses are \n     prevented by law from seeking compensation from the U.S. \n     government through the courts. Since most of the companies \n     that supplied the U.S. military with asbestos are long gone, \n     seeking relief from the suppliers is also a dead end.\n       Some have suggested that a medical criteria bill might \n     provide a better solution to the asbestos problem. A medical \n     criteria bill, however, will do little, if anything, to \n     provide certainty for victims. And because it leaves asbestos \n     claims in the courts, the medical criteria bill certainly \n     wouldn't benefit veterans who are sick from asbestos. Under a \n     medical criteria bill, the asbestos litigation system will \n     remain unchanged for veterans.\n       The Senate Judiciary Committee shouldn't let special \n     interests hijack veterans' only chance to receive the just \n     compensation they deserve.\n       We urge the Senate Judiciary Committee to approve the \n     asbestos victims compensation fund as quickly as possible and \n     bring this critically important legislation to the floor. Our \n     Nation's veterans deserve fair compensation--and nothing \n     less.\n           Sincerely,\n         Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States\n         Military Order of the Purple Heart\n         Blinded Veterans Association\n         Veterans of the Vietnam War, Inc.\n         Women in Military Service for America\n         Non Commissioned Officers Association\n         National Association for Uniformed Services\n         Paralyzed Veterans of America\n         Jewish War Veterans of the United States\n         Fleet Reserve Association\n         The Retired Enlisted Association\n         National Association of State Directors of Veterans \n           Affairs\n         Military Officers Association of America\n         Marine Corps League\n         American Ex-Prisoners of War\n         National Association for Black Veterans, Inc.\n         Pearl Harbor Survivors Association.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         Asbestos Study Group,\n\n                                                   April 18, 2005.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Hart \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Specter: The Asbestos Study Group, a group of \n     U.S. companies representing over 1.5 million workers, is \n     greatly appreciative of the Chairman's tireless efforts in \n     working with all interested Senators and private stakeholders \n     to reach a bipartisan consensus that can bring a much needed \n     solution to the Nation's asbestos litigation crisis. We are \n     very pleased and encouraged that the revised April 12th draft \n     has earned bipartisan support. We believe it brings us \n     considerably closer to a long-overdue resolution. While our \n     analysis of the new draft is continuing, we look forward to \n     working with the Chairman and other Senators to obtain final \n     passage of this critically important legislation as soon as \n     possible.\n       In the last two decades Congress has debated asbestos \n     litigation reform, the opportunity now before us represents \n     our best chance for success. Too much progress has been made \n     and too much is at stake for our Nation to miss this unique \n     opportunity to finally solve the asbestos problem.\n       Thank you for your continuing leadership and commitment to \n     this critically important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Barry B. Direnfeld,\n     Counsel, Asbestos Study Group.\n                                  ____\n\n\n    [From the National Association of Manufacturers, April 14, 2005]\n\n  Engler Statement on Senator Specter's Latest Asbestos Bill Language \n                                 Draft\n\n       Washington, D.C.--National Association of Manufacturers \n     President John Engler today issued this statement in support \n     of Senator Arlen Specter's (R-PA) ongoing effort to end \n     America's asbestos litigation crisis:\n       ``Manufacturers and the business community more broadly are \n     grateful to Chairman Specter for the energy and determination \n     he has shown in working to craft a legislative solution to \n     our Nation's economy-sapping problem with asbestos \n     litigation.\n       ``The comprehensive Specter draft is now being reviewed by \n     the NAM and the members of the Asbestos Alliance. Since the \n     draft has already earned bipartisan support in the Senate, we \n     are hopeful it will engender similarly broad support in the \n     nationwide business community. When our review and those of \n     our Asbestos Alliance colleagues are complete, we hope a \n     solution will finally be at hand.\n       ``There is much to like in the Chairman's draft, I'm \n     encouraged by the renewed commitment on both sides of the \n     aisle, and I am more hopeful about prospects for consensus \n     than I have been in weeks.\n       ``We look forward to working with Chairman Specter and \n     other Senators toward final\n\n[[Page S3941]]\n\n     passage of a bill that fairly resolves compensation problems \n     and ends the scandal of asbestos lawsuit abuse once and for \n     all.''\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. The bipartisan efforts of the last 2 years have been \nproductive. With the help of Judge Edward Becker, the primary \nstakeholders have worked diligently and as a result we have reached a \ncompromise agreement on a national trust fund that will fairly \ncompensate victims of asbestos exposure. With the Chairman's \nleadership, the disparate interests have reached consensus on many \nissues such as overall funding of $140 billion and a streamlined \nadministrative process within the Department of Labor. Compensation \nwill be awarded and paid outside of the court system through a \nsimplified administrative claims process. There is no need to prove \nliability or identify a particular defendant. There is, instead, a \nclaims process wherein all those who exhibit certain medical symptoms \nand evidence of disease are compensated.\n  Last Congress I was disappointed by the bill reported by the \nJudiciary Committee and by the partisan bill, S. 2290, that was \nsubsequently introduced as a substitute for that legislation. As \ncompared to those efforts, our bipartisan bill includes significant and \nnecessary improvements: Our bill provides higher compensation awards \nfor victims, with $1.1 million for victims of mesothelioma, $300,000 to \n$1.1 million for lung cancer victims, $200,000 for victims of other \ncancers caused by asbestos, $100,000 to $850,000 for asbestosis, and \n$25,000 for what we call ``mixed disease cases.'' All likely asbestos \nvictims are eligible for medical monitoring, and unlike last year's \nbills, this bill provides for medical screening for high-risk workers, \na relatively low-cost way to help make sure that those most likely to \nbe harmed are diagnosed.\n  Another essential improvement is the important provision ensuring \nthat victims' awards under the new trust fund will not be subject to \nsubrogation by insurance companies. This means that victims will not \nhave to give up any of their much-deserved compensation just because \nthey received workers' compensation or other insurance benefits in the \npast. The initial funding of this trust is both more realistic and more \nsubstantial than the partisan bill from the last Congress, providing \nfor almost $43 billion of the total $140 billion in the first five \nyears. And unlike the earlier bill, this bill ensures that the \ncontributors into the fund will be a matter of public record, as are \ntheir obligations to the fund. Our bill also guarantees that court \ncases that are well under way, and certainly those that have reached \njudgment, will not be upset by the new trust fund. Similarly, last \nyear's bill would also have overridden all civil settlements that had \nany remaining conduct outstanding. Our bipartisan asbestos bill \nprotects those settlements between named defendants and named victims, \nand also protects settlements that provide for health insurance or \nhealth care.\n  There are other improvements to the trust fund plan over last year's \neffort. The previous legislation provided no incentive for the fund to \nstart processing claims. The Specter-Leahy-Feinstein bill creates an \nincentive for the fund to begin processing claims quickly: If it is not \noperational within 9 months, the sickest victims will be able to return \nto the tort system. If the fund is not operational within 24 months, \nall victims can return to the tort system.\n  In improving the way the asbestos legislation handles exigent \nclaims--those victims who are sickest and may not have long to live--\nSenator Feinstein was instrumental in developing a creative solution. I \nthank the senior Senator from California for her tireless efforts on \nbehalf of sick and dying asbestos victims. These victims should not be \nforced to wait a year while this new trust fund gets organized and \nready to process claims. Under Senator Feinstein's approach, which we \nadopted, exigent cases would receive an immediate lump-sum payment, \nand, as I noted earlier, if the fund is not operational in nine months, \nthese sickest victims will be able to continue their cases in court.\n  As part of this compromise legislation, a particular class of lung \ncancer sufferers, those who have had significant asbestos exposure but \nno markings of asbestos-related disease, are not treated as compensable \nvictims for purposes of the asbestos trust fund. Because of the absence \nof markings, it is not possible to establish asbestos as the cause of \ntheir disease. If they develop markings, however, they will become \neligible for compensation from the asbestos trust fund. As with many \nother administrative claims processes, this bill sets a limit on \nattorneys' fee. In connection with this asbestos fund, the limit is set \nat 5 percent on victims' awards within the fund. In addition, in order \nto prevent victims of asbestos exposure from retooling their complaints \nto circumvent the asbestos trust fund, the bill also imposes a higher \nburden of proof within the tort system for plaintiffs seeking damages \nresulting from exposure to silica.\n  The problems we are addressing are complex, this bill necessarily \nreflects these complexities, and its drafting was not easy. The \ncompromises we had to make were difficult but necessary to ensure that \nwe created a trust fund that would provide adequate compensation to the \nthousands of workers who have suffered, and continue to suffer, the \ndevastating health effect of asbestos. The history of asbestos use in \nour country must come to an end. Under a provision authored by Senator \nMurray that we have included, which was accepted during the last \nCongress by the Judiciary Committee, this bill will ban its use. We \nmust halt the harm asbestos creates, and ameliorate the harm it has \nalready caused. The industrial and insurer participants in the trust \nfund will gain the benefits of financial certainty and relief from the \nstresses of litigation in the tort system, and the victims will have a \nquicker and more efficient path to recovery.\n  I thank Chairman Specter, Senator Feinstein and others for working so \nhard with me on this bipartisan legislation. I urge Senators to support \nthis compromise legislation to, at long last, help solve the asbestos \nproblem by providing fair compensation to victims of asbestos exposure.\n  I think of the staffs who have worked so diligently on this. On my \nstaff, I single out Ed Pagano, who was a lead counsel of the Democrats, \nalong with Kristine Lucius on our side. On Senator Specter's side, we \nwere helped so much by Seema Singh.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/19/senate-section/article/S3941-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3941-S3942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 113--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE INTERNATIONAL HOME \n            FURNISHINGS MARKET IN HIGH POINT, NORTH CAROLINA\n\n  Mrs. DOLE (for herself and Mr. Burr) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. ROBERTS submitted an amendment intended to be proposed to \namendment SA 437 submitted by Mr. Rockefeller and intended to be \nproposed to the bill H.R. 1268, making emergency supplemental \nappropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2005, to \nestablish and rapidly implement regulations for State driver's license \nand identification document security standards, to prevent terrorists \nfrom abusing the asylum laws of the United States, to unify terrorism-\nrelated grounds for inadmissibility and removal, to ensure expeditious \nconstruction of the San Diego border fence, and for other purposes; \nwhich was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n\n                            sense of senate\n\n       Sec. __. (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) On September 11, 2001, terrorists hijacked and \n     destroyed four civilian aircraft, crashing two of them into \n     the towers of the World Trade Center in New York, New York, \n     and a third into the Pentagon outside Washington, District of \n     Columbia.\n       (2) The valor of the passengers and crew on the fourth \n     aircraft prevented it from also being used as a weapon \n     against the United States.\n       (3) The September 11, 2001, attacks stand as the deadliest \n     terrorist attacks ever perpetrated against the United States.\n       (4) By targeting symbols of American strength and success, \n     the attacks clearly were intended to assail the principles, \n     values, and freedoms of the United States and the American \n     people, to intimidate the Nation, and to weaken the national \n     resolve.\n       (5) On September 14, 2001, Congress, in Public Law 107-40, \n     authorized the use of ``all necessary and appropriate force'' \n     against those responsible for the terrorist attacks.\n       (6) The Armed Forces subsequently moved swiftly against Al \n     Qaeda and the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, whom the \n     President and Congress had identified as enemies of the \n     United States.\n       (7) In doing so, brave servicemembers and intelligence \n     officers left family and friends in order to defend the \n     Nation.\n       (8) More than three years later, many servicemembers and \n     intelligence officers remain abroad, shielding the Nation \n     from further terrorist attacks.\n       (9) Terrorists continue to attack United States \n     servicemembers and continue to plan attacks against the \n     United States and its interests.\n       (10) Terrorists continue to target civilians and military \n     personnel alike through such insidious and cowardly methods \n     as kidnappings and bombings.\n       (11) Intelligence information derived from the \n     interrogation of captured terrorists is essential to the \n     protection of servicemembers deployed around world, to the \n     protection of the homeland, and to the protection of United \n     States interests.\n       (12) It is the policy of the President and Congress that \n     the interrogation of terrorists conform to the Constitution, \n     laws, and treaty obligations of the United States.\n       (13) In those rare instances in which individuals have been \n     alleged to have violated the Constitution, laws, or treaty \n     obligations of the United States during the course of an \n     interrogation, the departments and agencies of the United \n     States Government, and the inspectors general of each \n     department or agency concerned, have investigated allegations \n     of such violations.\n       (14) In the few cases in which officers of the United \n     States intelligence community are determined to have actually \n     violated the Constitution, laws, or treaty obligations of the \n     United States, such officers have been, or should be, \n     punished.\n       (15) The Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate was \n     established, among other things, to provide vigorous \n     legislative oversight of the intelligence activities of the \n     United States in order to assure that such activities conform \n     to the Constitution, laws, and treaty obligations of the \n     United States.\n       (16) The Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate was \n     deliberately structured with a unified staff under the joint \n     supervision of the Chairman and the Vice Chairman of the \n     Select Committee through a single staff director in order to \n     avoid, to the maximum extent possible, the politicization of \n     oversight of the intelligence activities of the United \n     States. Because of its unique structure and rules, as \n     currently written, the Select Committee is ideally suited to \n     continue oversight of United States interrogation, detention, \n     and rendition operations.\n       (17) The Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Select Committee \n     on Intelligence of the Senate have directed the staff of the \n     Select Committee to continue to exercise the oversight \n     authority of the Select Committee to ensure that intelligence \n     activities of the United States relating to the detention, \n     interrogation, and rendition of terrorists conform to the \n     Constitution, laws, and treaty obligations of the United \n     States.\n       (18) As part of its ongoing review, the staff of the Select \n     Committee on Intelligence of the Senate have interviewed \n     individuals and reviewed documents relating to the detention, \n     interrogation, and rendition of terrorists, and have \n     inspected United States detention and interrogation \n     operations and facilities in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n       (19) The staff of the Select Committee on Intelligence of \n     the Senate continue to interview individuals, receive \n     information, and review documents relating to the detention, \n     interrogation, and rendition of terrorists.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) to recognize that terrorists continue to seek to attack \n     the United States at home and the interests of the United \n     States abroad;\n       (2) to stand with the people of the United States in great \n     debt to the members of the Armed Forces and officers of the \n     United States intelligence community serving at home and \n     abroad;\n       (3) to remain resolved to pursue all those responsible for \n     the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and their \n     sponsors, until they are discovered and punished; and\n       (4) to reaffirm that Congress will--\n       (A) honor the memory of those who lost their lives as a \n     result of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks; and\n       (B) bravely defend the citizens of the United States in the \n     face of all future challenges.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 560. Mr. COCHRAN (for Mr. Shelby (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \nDurbin, and Mr. Obama)) proposed an amendment to the bill H.R. 1268, \nmaking emergency supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30, 2005, to establish and rapidly implement regulations for \nState driver's license and identification document security standards, \nto prevent terrorists from abusing the asylum laws of the United \nStates, to unify terrorism-related grounds for inadmissibility and \nremoval, to ensure expeditious construction of the San Diego border \nfence, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 184, line 16, after ``$11,935,000,'', insert ``for \n     increased judicial security outside of courthouse facilities, \n     including priority consideration of home intrusion detection \n     systems in the homes of federal judges,''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 561.

Mr. President, I would like to announce for the \ninformation of the Senate and the public that the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations will hold a hearing entitled ``The \nContainer Security Initiative and the Customs-Trade Partnership Against \nTerrorism: Securing the Global Supply Chain or Trojan Horse?'' In light \nof the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, concern has increased \nthat terrorists could smuggle weapons of mass destruction in the \napproximately 9 million ocean going containers that arrive in the \nUnited States every year. As part of its overall response to the threat \nof terrorism, the Department of Homeland Security's Bureau of Customs \nand Border Protection (Customs) implemented the Container Security \nInitiative (CSI) to screen high-risk containers at sea ports overseas, \nthus employing screening tools before potentially dangerous cargoes \nreach our shores. Customs also implemented the Customs Trade \nPartnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) to improve the security of the \nglobal supply chain in partnership with the private sector.\n  Both CSI and C-TPAT face a number of compelling challenges that \nimpact their ability to safeguard our Nation from terrorism. The \nSubcommittee's April 26 hearing will examine how Customs utilizes CSI \nand C-TPAT in connection with its other enforcement programs and review \nthe requirements for and challenges involved in transitioning CSI and \nC-TPAT from promising risk management concepts to effective and \nsustained enforcement operations. These important Customs initiatives \nrequired sustained Congressional oversight. As such, this will be the \nfirst of several hearings the Subcommittee intends to hold on the \nresponse of the Federal Government to terrorist threats.\n  The Subcommittee hearing is scheduled for Tuesday, April 26, 2005, at \n9:30 a.m. in Room 562 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building. For \nfurther information, please contact Raymond V. Shepherd, III, Staff \nDirector and Chief Counsel to the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, at 224-3721.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/19/senate-section/article/S3956-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      committee on armed services\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I make this \nannouncement: Tomorrow, following morning business, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the Iraq-Afghanistan supplemental \nappropriations bill. We have invoked cloture on the bill, and therefore \nthe only amendments that qualify under the cloture rule will be in \norder to the bill.\n  There are still quite a few germane amendments that are pending, and \ntherefore we will need a number of rollcall votes prior to final \npassage. It is the leader's hope that we can finish tomorrow, and we \ncan finish if we can show restraint and not require votes on each of \nthese amendments. Senators should expect a late evening tomorrow as we \ntry to finish the bill on Wednesday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/19/senate-section/article/S3957-4", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
