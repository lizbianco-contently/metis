Mr. President, I welcome my colleagues back from the \nEaster/Passover recess. It was a 2-week recess, where many had the \nopportunity to spend time with our families and with our constituents \nback at home. I hope everybody had a rejuvenating and productive period \nof time because we have a lot to do.\n  We have before us a 5-week block of time, during which I intend to \nkeep the Senate focused on the big challenges facing America and on \ndelivering meaningful solutions to the problems Americans are seeing \nout there every day, some of which are very apparent and some of which \nare not very apparent in their everyday lives.\n  As we set out from the very start, the goal of this Republican-led \nSenate is to make America safer, stronger, more productive, and \nhealthier. That applies across the board, from the war on terror \nabroad--and we will have a lot of discussion on that on the \nsupplemental--to the family budget right here at home, and people are \nfeeling the pinch of gasoline prices and skyrocketing health care costs \nevery day.\n  Time is of the essence. We have serious issues to tackle in 5 short \nweeks. That means working together, pulling the very best out of both \nsides of the aisle, and recognizing that obstruction is not in order as \nwe proceed along this upward path of producing for the American people.\n  It is an election year. That always makes it challenging for \neverything we do every step along the way. But the American people \nexpect us to legislate, to govern, and not to get mired down in \npartisan obstruction and partisan politics. It is our obligation and \nresponsibility to deliver to them. We have the challenges out there. We \nhave to act and we need to act with solutions. That is what the \nAmerican people expect--challenge, action, solutions. That is what they \ndeserve.\n\n  We need to support our troops who are fighting in the field for our \nfreedom and safety. We need to address the skyrocketing health care \ncosts and make\n\n[[Page S3436]]\n\nhealth care more affordable, more accessible to every American, no \nmatter where they live. We need to put judges on the bench who \ninterpret and not make the law. We need to keep our economy strong and \ngrowing. We need to tackle that rising cost of gasoline. Right now it \nis up, teetering at the $3 level. That is too much to be paying per \ngallon.\n  Over the next 5 weeks, we are going to tackle each of these items. I \ncall upon my colleagues on both sides to work together to get this done \nfor the sake of our fellow citizens who have sent us here to work for \nthem, to represent them.\n  Unfortunately, before the Easter recess, obstruction from the other \nside got in the way of comprehensive border security and immigration \nreform. But as I have announced over the last couple of days, I intend \nto bring this issue back and to continue driving forward on this \nimportant issue to the American people. We need real border security. \nThat includes a fence along certain parts of the border, surveillance \nalong other parts of the border. But we have to get this border under \ncontrol. We took very positive steps last year in increasing the number \nof border agents and the number of detention facilities, and both are \nvery important in this supplemental bill over the next several days. We \nwill once again address border security.\n  We also need employer enforcement in a system that addresses the fact \nthat we have 12 million to 20 million individuals who right now are \nkept in the shadows. Building on last year's efforts, spearheaded by \nthe Senate, I will support an effort to put funds into the supplemental \nbill to make our next downpayment on securing the border.\n  Hiring more Border Patrol agents and giving them the tools they need \nto get the job done doesn't need to wait until we finish the overall \nimmigration bill. We can take important steps now and indeed we will. \nIt is part of the challenge, the action, and the solutions the American \npeople want; they want serious reform.\n  Keeping America strong also means keeping America healthy. Insurance \npremiums have risen--health insurance premiums--73 percent over the \nlast 5 years. It hits small businesses and their employees in \nparticular. Of the 20 million Americans who are working and are \nuninsured, don't have health insurance, 49 percent are self-employed or \nwork in firms with fewer than 25 employees. According to the Institutes \nof Medicine, nearly 18,000 Americans die prematurely each year due to \nlack of insurance. It is a fact. It has been proven again and again.\n  If you have health insurance--even if you do not have comprehensive \nhealth insurance, but you have any health insurance, you do better in \nterms of health outcomes. Last month, the HELP Committee reported out a \nbill to allow small businesses to band together all over a community to \nreach out and gain that purchasing clout which we know in the \nmarketplace can drive prices down. It can make those insurance policies \nless expensive and thus more accessible.\n  The Enzi legislation, when fully phased in, would reduce employer \npremiums by 12 percent and the number of uninsured workers by at least \na million. Voters are close to unanimous in their support for allowing \nself-employed workers and small business employees to band together to \nnegotiate lower insurance costs as spelled out in that Enzi bill.\n  Again, challenge, action, solutions. It is time to get it done.\n  We have also known for some time that the medical malpractice system \nis broken. It is driving up costs, driving my doctor colleagues out of \ntheir professions, from practicing medicine and delivering care. Nearly \nhalf of America's counties today lack an obstetrician/gynecologist, and \nthat is due in large part to excessive, skyrocketing medical \nmalpractice premiums. Three out of four neurosurgeons will no longer \noperate on children. When you ask why, it is because of medical \nliability. And 79 percent of doctors practice defensive medicine for \nfear of getting sued. That means when somebody comes in and they have a \nheadache, you get a whole barrage of unnecessary tests to protect \nyourself in the event there is a lawsuit. Health care costs have risen \nbetween $70 billion and $126 billion in defensive medicine costs.\n  I was in Texas the other day. Texas is fascinating to me as a \nphysician. They recently adopted liability reform measures. The largest \nmalpractice insurer in the State immediately began lowering premiums, \nand premiums in that State are now down by 22 percent. Indeed, there is \nan influx of doctors from all over the country moving to Texas because \nof this very effective, proven to be effective, malpractice reform. An \noverwhelming majority of Americans support a Federal law to limit jury \nawards to compensate for pain and suffering in medical malpractice \nsuits. Challenge, action, solutions. It is time to get this done.\n  Keeping America strong means keeping our economy thriving. That is \nwhy we passed the Tax Relief Act of 2005. We know that tax cuts work. \nWe know they grow the economy and help create jobs. In 2001, we passed \n$1.4 trillion in tax relief; 2 years later, another $350 billion. That \nis $1.7 trillion that goes into the pockets of everyday, hard-working \nAmericans for them to save, to spend, to invest. We cut taxes on income \nand marriage. We doubled the child tax credit and slashed taxes on \ncapital gains and dividends. Because we did, our economy has grown.\n  Right now, each month we are creating about 200,000 new jobs. Over \nthe last 32 months, we have created 5.1 million new jobs. Home \nownership is up. Minority home ownership is up at all-time highs.\n  Tax relief has led to 3 years of record economic growth. But we have \na lot more to do. In the next 5 weeks, I intend to bring legislation to \nthe floor to eliminate the death tax once and for all. The death tax is \nunfair, it is inefficient, and it taxes people for dying. It is double \nand triple taxation. The death tax drives hard-working people to spend \nbillions of dollars on complicated tax structures for the sole purpose \nof avoiding death taxes on income that has already been taxed.\n  Because of Katrina, we could not move forward on repealing the death \ntax last fall, but now is the time to bury that death tax once and for \nall. Keeping America strong, protecting the democratic process means \nprotecting the separation of powers. We need judges who interpret the \nlaw and who don't make law from the bench.\n  We have made substantial progress on judicial nominations. We put one \nChief Justice, one Associate Justice, six previously filibustered \ncircuit court nominees, 20 other circuit nominees, and 104 district \ncourt nominees on the bench since 2003. But we cannot rest on that \nprogress.\n  Terry Boyle is one example of a nominee who deserves our \nconsideration. He was nominated for a circuit court judgeship back in \n1991 and then again in 2001. He has been waiting 15 years for a fair \nup-or-down vote.\n  Another is Brett Kavanaugh, first nominated in July 2003. He has been \nwaiting ever since that date. He, too, deserves a fair up-or-down vote.\n  We need to keep up the momentum and keep driving forward so that each \nand every nominee gets a fair up-or-down vote on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  The weather is warming up and we are approaching the summer driving \nseason, and American families are being squeezed tighter and tighter by \nthese skyrocketing gas prices. We need to help them find relief. We \nknow there is no single magic bullet. We know it is an issue of supply \nand demand.\n  As a first step, Speaker Hastert and I have asked the President to \ndirect the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice to \ninvestigate if price gouging or speculation in the oil markets is \ncontributing to the current high prices.\n  We need to get to the bottom of it, and if we do so, we may have \nlegislative action required on the floor of the Senate, or we may not, \nbut only an investigation, only an examination by the FTC and DOJ can \ngive us that answer.\n  We need to find short-term solutions. In the long term, however, the \nanswer is to reduce America's dependence on foreign oil. The fact that \nwe are 60-percent dependent today on foreign sources of oil is simply \ninexcusable.\n  During our majority over the last 12 years, Democratic obstruction \nand delay has stopped measures to enhance domestic production, and \ndomestic production must be a part of any long-term solution for our \nenergy supply.\n  The President laid out a number of initiatives in his State of the \nUnion\n\n[[Page S3437]]\n\nAddress, and I hope we can pursue them in committees and then bring \nthem to the floor quickly. Again, challenge, action, solutions.\n  Those are some of the things we need to be doing over the next 5 \nweeks. There is a lot to do in a very short period of time, but I am \nconvinced that with determination and focus and by leading on \nprinciple, we can and we must govern with meaningful solutions on the \nissues that matter, and they can be delivered to the American people. \nWe can make America stronger, we can make America safer, and we can \nmake it more secure. We must keep America moving forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/25/senate-section/article/S3437-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this morning the leader touched on a lot of \nproblems we have before us as we come back from Easter break. I know \nmost of us have been home and listened to the folks at home. Most of us \nhave probably come back with more challenges than when we left. Here \nare a couple of issues.\n  I was glad to hear the leader bring up the situation on insurance \npremiums, especially for small businesses and the self-employed. \nSenator Enzi of Wyoming and I have been working on the small business \nhealth plans for almost a year now. That is nothing new. It is not a \nnew idea. Ever since I joined the Small Business Committee and even \nunder the chairmanship of my good friend from Arkansas, Senator \nBumpers, prior to 1994, we were working on the same issue, but we were \nunsuccessful then and have been unsuccessful up until now in striking a \nbalance. There is broad support for the approach being taken by the \nchairman of the HELP Committee.\n  If you talk with folks engaged in small business, Montana businesses \nwith 10 employees or less have little or no leverage when it comes to \nbuying group insurance or trying to broaden their pool to keep their \ninsurance premiums at a minimum. I look forward to that debate when the \nbill comes to the floor, and I look forward to final passage and \ngetting it to the President for his signature.\n  I took a drive across the State of Montana over Easter Recess, all by \nmyself. I just jumped into my pickup and took off and talked with rural \nMontanans. I fight awfully hard for rural Montanans for the simple \nreason that, right now, they are sort of being pushed into the \nbackground when we start talking about what is happening in our \neconomy. Even though our livestock prices are decent, the grain \nproducers, and many other folks, still have a real problem because they \ncannot get their arms around this business of containing costs, and the \ncost of energy is their main issue.\n  Whenever gas and diesel prices go up, it goes up on the farm also, \nand the cost of putting a crop in and getting it out has increased \nsubstantially due to these high energy costs.\n\n  We are a big State. We are a mobile State. We are 147,000 square \nmiles. Yes, we only have 900,000 people, and some could probably make \nthe case it is getting a little crowded up there. We have to drive long \ndistances just to do business around the State, and these energy prices \nare impacting all of us.\n  Everybody wants to stand around on the floor of the Senate pointing \nfingers, when we could be looking at the real case of cumulative \neffects--of what we have done in policy and what has to be done to \nproduce more energy for a growing society and a growing economy.\n  We are driven by agriculture in my State. Farmers and ranchers are \nprice takers; in other words, we sell wholesale, we buy retail, and we \npay the freight both ways. Any time we talk about freight, whether it \nis delivering or receiving, energy is involved.\n  So we are caught in what some would think is a perfect storm. We \nhaven't hit the $3 mark for gasoline in Montana yet, as other parts of \nthe country have, but we are nearing it. In fact, we are so close to it \nthat folks are afraid of what will happen if we do hit it.\n  I will tell you this: We have a situation in northeast Montana and \nnorthwest North Dakota called the Williston Basin. This area is quite a \nlarge producer of oil and gas. When we start quoting the price of oil \non the New York Mercantile Exchange, we are not really talking about \nwhat the cash or spot price of oil is costing today. Do you realize, \neven though everybody is talking about the price of $73 a barrel, that \nmarket price is not being paid to our oil producers today? It is a long \nway from that $73. In fact, it is from $25 to $35 lower than even the \nspot price. Why? We are finding more oil, we are doing a better job of \nfinding oil and lifting it, but the infrastructure of transportation--\nin other words, getting the crude to the refineries--and the \nrefineries' capacity to refine it has not kept pace even with our own \nproduction in the United States. Therein lies a problem, and it is one \nwe have to address.\n  We have not built a refinery in this country for 30 years--35 years, \nI think, if you want to get very particular. The ability to expand \nrefining capacity in the present-day facility is becoming very \nexpensive and cannot be done without expanding outside the boundary.\n  If anybody has the idea that the refiners are making a lot of money, \nlook at their return on investment. It is not very big. So people point \ntheir fingers at the refiners. Do they point their fingers at the big \noil companies? Yes, they do, and in some cases justifiably so. We can \nsit here and poke holes in that argument. But our basic problem is \nsiting and building facilities to satisfy a growing demand.\n  If you want to build a new refinery, or if you want to build a new \npipeline to move the crude to the refining areas, I will tell you, you \nare going to have sticker shock when you look at what it costs just in \npermitting and siting for that facility. It is unbelievable. 25 percent \nof the estimated construction cost of a new refinery now will be eaten \nup in permits and siting, and all because of some laws and regulations \nthat basically do not serve this country very well.\n  Am I justifying the prices today? Somewhat. But I think what we are \nseeing is a perfect storm of cumulative effects, of not keeping pace \nwith our ability to produce and lift oil from the ground.\n  Alternative fuels and renewable fuels are also an important part of \nour energy program.\n  In 2002, we actually got a title into the agricultural bill that \ndealt with renewables and agriculture. We knew that we were going to \nhave an energy bill and that title would dovetail into some of the \npolicies that we wanted to put forward in an energy bill. We knew that \nan energy bill should come pretty quick. However, it did not come \nquickly. It came some 4 years later. After dragging and stalling and \nputting up all kinds of barriers, we finally got an energy bill in \n2005, and we did dovetail some of the elements on renewables as it \nrelates to agriculture.\n  In 2007, we will renew the Agriculture bill. And I would not be a bit \nsurprised if we do not see energy even in the main title because we can \nproduce renewables and we can produce alternative fuels to make sure we \nwean ourselves off of our dependency on foreign oil. We have to do \nthat. We are going to get it done even though there are people who will \nobstruct and drag their feet in setting the policy.\n  I see my good friend from Utah is in the Chamber. Whenever you are \nproducing oil at post-1970 production in the State of Montana, that \nmeans we have crude oil, like the crude oil that could go to refineries \ntoday in his State of Utah, from pipelines that are fed out of Montana, \nas well as to refineries in Montana and also in Colorado. Do you \nrealize a 36-inch pipeline moves something like 86 thousand barrels a \nday? We can't even get on that pipeline. That pipeline is owned by \nCanada,\n\n[[Page S3438]]\n\nand it is full of tar sands oil moving to refineries in Utah and \nColorado. Meanwhile we are actually slowing down production at wells \nsince we can't get all the crude oil being produced in the Williston \nBasin area today out of the area. If we do manage to get some of the \ncrude oil on the pipeline, it is at a discounted price of around $25 to \n$30 a barrel.\n  What is wrong with this picture? The infrastructure isn't there to \nmove the oil. The refining capacity is not there to refine the oil. We \nare picking and choosing who gets the oil on the pipeline and who gets \nto sell their crude oil at prices that are far less than $73 a barrel. \nThe price that is going through the roof, that we hear so much about, \nis the oil futures price, which is set by speculators and expectations. \nThat is not the spot price. Americans have to understand the \ndifference.\n  So we need infrastructure, but we also need this ability to produce \nthe alternatives and the renewables and to get those energy products on \nline as well. And we can do just that if we don't have to chew up 25 \npercent of our construction costs just in permitting and selecting a \nsite in which to do the work.\n  I know that high costs affect people who have to drive automobiles to \nget to work and have to go places to make this economy grow. Yes, the \nPresident is right on. Let's take a look at the oil companies. Let's \nsee what is going on there. Let's get on the internal part of it and \nsee what the prices are all about today.\n  But I stand here today with the appeal that we need to look at our \nfood and fiber production across this country.\n  I will tell you something else I found out while driving around \nMontana. I would drive down the highway through a little town, and if I \nsaw a little restaurant there, a little cafe with six or seven pickups \nsitting there, I would go in and have a cup of coffee. You will get \nsome conversation going on in there, I guarantee you. When I hear of \nfarmers cutting back on the use of fertilizer by almost a third last \nfall and this spring when going in with their crops, that sends a \nmessage to the rest of the country that food and fiber production is \nbeing negatively impacted by these energy costs. Yields go down, the \namount of grain and food products that moves to the marketplace goes \ndown. The producers just can't afford the fertilizer. Then they go to \npay their diesel costs for putting the crop in and taking it out, and \nit makes for a very interesting discussion around the restaurant or the \ncafe in the coffee clutch. Usually those fellows have all the answers, \nif you will just listen. I hope most of our Members of this Senate \nwould do that: Just take off, sit down in a restaurant, listen to what \npeople are talking about, and then try to come up with some sort of \npolicy that would increase our ability to move and to be mobile and to \nfuel an economy that supports a very mobile society.\n  For alternative fuels, our technology is moving right along. We have \nmany technologies that are going to help us in ethanol production, \nespecially the cellulosic technology that uses plant residues. What we \nusually throw away, the waste, can now be turned into energy.\n  Biodiesel is viable. Genetically improved oilseeds are being produced \nand can be turned into a cleaner diesel. We were in Billings yesterday \nand saw an experiment of what can be done with biodiesel. We are the \nSaudi Arabia of coal in Montana. There are ways to turn that into \ndiesel. Basically, we haven't found any alternative to diesel in moving \nbig loads. We have to continue our research and development and our \neffort to turn what we grow every year, what is renewable every year, \ninto usable, practical renewables to fuel our every day lives.\n  So I hope that during this week policies which would increase \nproduction, whether hydrocarbon or renewable, could move out because \nthere is nothing in the short term that is going to take care of it. I \ntell you: we have to look at the long term of where we want to be in 20 \nyears and ask ourselves how we get there. To formulate that policy in 1 \nweek is asking a lot from this body or any other policymaking body. \nNonetheless, we have to take up that challenge and be aware of what is \nhappening on our farms and ranches across this country because the \nsecond thing every one of us does when we get up in the morning is eat \nbreakfast, and we know the cost of that is going to rise if we don't \naddress this business called high energy prices.\n  There is a cumulative effect here. We could point fingers at one, \ntwo, three, or four different contributing factors, but it is the \nperfect storm of all these factors that have come together. Finally we \nare being sent a message that policy has to be changed in order to \nincrease our ability to move Americans.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, today's papers are filled with stories \nabout energy prices and particularly gas costs and editorials demanding \nthat the Congress and the President do something about it. I think \nperhaps the best comment that appeared was in this morning's Wall \nStreet Journal in a story with the headline ``Bush Aims To Rein In Gas \nCosts,'' where there is a quote from Robert Ebel, who directs the \nenergy program at the Washington Center for Strategic and International \nStudies. All of us are familiar with CSIS and the good work that it \ndoes. I would like to quote Mr. Ebel because what he has to say is the \nclear understanding of where we are. He says:\n\n       A good politician never admits he's powerless in a \n     situation, but I don't see anything that the Congress can \n     propose that will make any difference. We don't stand in \n     isolation from the rest of the world oil market, and there \n     are events going on around the world that affect the world \n     price of oil.\n\n  I note that he uses the term ``world''--I could count how many times, \nbut multiple times--and we act as if this is a domestic problem. We act \nas if this is something we in Congress or the President in the White \nHouse can wave a magic wand and do something about.\n  I would like to point out a few facts and perhaps bring a little \nhumility into this body, something that is in fairly short supply but \nin great need.\n  As Mr. Ebel points out, the price of oil is set by a series of world \nevents. It is not set in the Congress. It is not set in the White \nHouse. People look at the cost of a gallon of gasoline and say to \nthemselves: You know, it only costs--picking numbers out of the air but \nbeing illustrative--$1.50 to put that gallon of gasoline in the tank at \nthe service station, yet the service station operator is charging me $3 \nto take it out; there is price gouging going on somewhere. The reality \nis that the price in the tank at the service station is not figured on \nthe basis of what did it cost to get that gallon there; the price at \nthe service station is figured on the cost of what will it cost to \nreplace that gallon there. So the reason a gallon of gas is at $3 at \nthe service station is that all of the forces involved in putting that \ngallon of gas in there assume that it will cost $3 to replace it; \ntherefore, they better charge $3 for it in the first place.\n  Now, they may be wrong. It may be that they can replace that gallon \nof gas for $2.50, and as soon as they come to that conclusion, that \ngallon of gas will come down to $2.50. It may be that the cost of \nreplacing that gallon of gas will be $3.50, and at that point, \neverybody will lose some money along the way. But whether it is the \nproduction of oil in the oilfield, the transportation of oil around the \nworld, the refinement of oil in the various refineries, the \ntransportation from the refinery to the service station, everyone is \nmaking a guess as to what it will cost for the next gallon of gas along \nthe way, and that shows up in what appears at the service station.\n  So when there is trouble in Nigeria, someone says, by virtue of that \ntrouble in Nigeria, the next gallon of gas is going to cost more than \nwe think, and that is why the price goes up. If there is trouble and \ndifficulty in Iran, well, that is going to cause the price to go up, \nand let's bet against that future. If there is trouble in Venezuela, \nthen that figures in. When it turns out that the trouble doesn't \nmaterialize, the price of gasoline drops dramatically, and we have seen \nthat in this past history.\n  The primary thing that started gas prices going up was Katrina. Why? \nBecause Katrina wiped out a good percentage of our refinery capability. \nAs the Senator from Montana has pointed out, we haven't built a \nrefinery in this country for several decades. We need to get about it. \nBut that is a 5- to 10-year\n\n[[Page S3439]]\n\nproblem. We can't instantly create a refinery out of nothing. As the \nrefineries were shut down as a result of Katrina, the price of gas \nspiked as people anticipated that there would not be enough supply. As \nthe refineries came back on line more rapidly than anybody anticipated, \nthe price of gasoline dropped.\n  Now refinery capacity is being shut down again. Why? Because we here \nin this Congress mandated the replacement of MTBE with ethanol, and the \nrefineries have to gear up to make that shift. When they do that, they \nshut down in order to retool. When they shut down, there is a lack of \ngasoline, and you have prices going back up again. Once they have made \nthe shift over, we will find those prices will start to come down, \nunless there is some other unsettling situation somewhere in the world.\n  The bottom line, to repeat a refrain I have stated ever since I have \nbeen in the Senate, is that we cannot repeal the law of supply and \ndemand. We engrave Latin phrases around here--and they are wonderful--\nto remind us of our history and our background, but if I could control \nwhat we carve in marble and see every day, it would be that statement: \nYou cannot repeal the law of supply and demand. If we had built the \nfacilities in ANWR in 2001 when there were sufficient votes in the \nHouse but was killed in the Senate, it is likely that oil would be \ncoming on line now, because at the time people said: Don't get excited \nabout ANWR; it is going to take at least 5 years. Well, 2001 was 5 \nyears ago. If we had done that, we would start to see that oil. Would \nit lower the price? Of course it would because it would change the \nequation of expectations of people who are involved in this whole \nsituation.\n  One last comment. I have talked about ethanol, and I have talked \nabout MTBE. These are additives to lower the emissions that come out of \ngasoline, and they are good things. They are, however, expensive, and \nwe cannot say on one hand: OK, let's get the price of gasoline as low \nas possible, and by the way, while we are doing it, let's put new \nburdens on the refineries that require this additive, that additive, \nand the other additive, that will require the creation of what are \ncalled boutique fuels, so that the refinery, instead of just putting \nout gasoline in regular or super high test, are putting out a boutique \nfuel for this part of the country and a boutique fuel for that part of \nthe country and a boutique fuel for the other part of the country. That \nmeans constantly retooling, shutting down, starting up, changing, and \nall of that adds to the cost.\n  We have added to the cost here in the Congress in the name of \nenvironmental protection. I am not saying environmental protection is \nbad, but I am saying it costs money. We should pay attention to that so \nwhen the time comes for us to say what can we do about the high \ngasoline prices, the answer is we can pay attention and be a little \nmore humble before the power of market forces. If we think Government \ncan intervene with market forces and produce long-term lower prices, \nall we need to do is dredge up memory of what happened the last time we \npanicked about this as a nation in the 1970s. Under the leadership of \nPresident Carter we created a synfuels corporation, created oil company \nwindfall taxes, and ended up in lines on separate days. You could only \nget your gas tank filled on alternative days. Ultimately, we saw all of \nthe effort collapse when market forces finally took hold and brought \nthe prices back in line.\n  I know it is not a message people want to hear. I, like Senator Burns \nand other Senators, have been out in my constituency during the break, \nand I heard people talking about: What are you going to do about gas \nprices? I had two choices. I could either tell them I will come back \nhere and I will fight to lower the gas prices--and make them feel \ngood--or I could tell them the truth. I chose to tell them the truth. \nThis is a long-term problem, it is a serious problem, and it can only \nbe solved by serious policies. The most intelligent serious policy that \nwe can adopt is to do whatever we can to facilitate the kinds of \ncompetition and market forces that ultimately will bring supply up and \nprices down and deal with the demand side as best we can through \nconservation.\n  It is not a quick fix. We can't pass a resolution and say, gee, look \nwhat we did and see something happen at the pump the day after \ntomorrow. It is time we recognize that fact and told our constituents \nthe truth.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/25/senate-section/article/S3439-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3439-S3442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FTC INVESTIGATION\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about gas prices \nand the energy situation in our country. First, to agree with my \ndistinguished colleague from Utah, in fact there are long-term issues \nwe have to address. There is no question about that. Alternative fuels, \nthe efforts to put forward very aggressive alternatives such as \nethanol, soy-based biodiesel, and other alternatives that create real \ncompetition, are critical, but there are short-term actions we can take \nright now that will help the families who are being squeezed on all \nsides by outrageous prices, along with outrageously high profits of the \noil companies.\n  Today our leader on the floor, our Republican leader, said there \nought to be an investigation going on, and the President said today we \nought to have an investigation going on as to possible price gouging. I \ncome to the floor today, as the author of the amendment that \nsuccessfully passed in the Energy bill last August, to say that we have \nan investigation going on. The Federal Trade Commission was authorized \nand charged with doing an investigation, which they are doing as a \ncriminal investigation, into possible price gouging. I was pleased to \nbe joined by Senator Dorgan and Senator Boxer and others in that \neffort.\n  Since that time, because they began to move extremely slowly last \nyear, I was pleased to coauthor an increase of $1 million in the budget \nin order to fund that investigation. We passed that last fall. There \nhave been bipartisan letters that have gone to the Chairman of the FTC \nsaying let's get going. That occurred last fall, last September. Now we \nare seeing from the Federal Trade Commission that they intend to have \nthis report done, this investigation done by May 21.\n  It is about time. First I would say: Mr. President, it is your FTC. \nYou appoint the majority of the members on the Federal Trade \nCommission. You should know that this is going on.\n  I encourage the President to be engaged with what his Federal Trade \nCommission is doing at this very moment. Hopefully, we are going to get \nthe right kind of investigation with tough recommendations that will \ntell it like it is. This is already occurring. Right now the \ninvestigation, as I said, is structured as a law enforcement case. They \nare working with the CFTC, with the States Attorneys General right now. \nI encourage everyone interested in this issue to give their input to \nthe Federal Trade Commission that is already doing an investigation.\n  In fact, one of the things they found doing this investigation, as \nthey sent out 200 investigation demands which are roughly the same as \nsubpoenas, ExxonMobil, back in January-February, filed a petition to \nquash the FTC subpoena for tax information. Fortunately, the Commission \ndenied the appeal and ExxonMobil had to subsequently comply. But now \nthey are looking at manipulation and gouging, whether or not that is \nhappening. They are confident, they say, that they found enough \ninformation for a solid determination in their final report, which is \nexpected on May 21.\n  I say, first to my Republican colleagues, to the leadership, to the \nPresident, this investigation is already going on. I am glad you now \nthink there ought to be an investigation. But we would appreciate it if \nyou would be involved in making sure what the FTC does is tough and \nsmart and tells it like it is in terms of what is really going on.\n  Gasoline is not a luxury for the families of Michigan or the families \nanywhere across the country. It is a necessity. Families are caught in \na bind because, on the one hand, this is not a regulated utility like \nelectricity, and there is not enough competition with basically five \ndifferent companies. We all know there is not enough competition \nbecause of the consolidations that have gone on. So what happens? \nAmerican consumers are stuck in the middle, squeezed on all sides.\n\n[[Page S3440]]\n\n  Now in Michigan it costs about $42 to fill up a tank. That is $4 more \nthan last month; $150 more than last year. We are told by the Energy \nInformation Administration there is going to be an average 25-cent \nincrease this summer. We already know that numbers are topping $3, in \nsome cases around the country $4 a gallon.\n  What this means on average to Michigan families is about $500 more in \nthe cost of gas for this year--about $500. For the average family that \nis a mortgage payment. That is the rent. That is a car payment. It is \npaying for food. It is the difference between helping your kids buy \nbooks when they need to go to college. This is a big deal. Yet we see \ncomments coming from the head of ExxonMobil, Mr. Raymond, who dismissed \nthe concerns between Exxon's record profits and out-of-control gas \nprices when he said on CNN that a single quarter or single year's \nprofits is not all that significant.\n  Mr. Raymond, it may not be significant to you. It is significant to \nthe people in Michigan. Five hundred dollars more is significant. It is \na big deal.\n  We also know that according to our businesses--for instance, General \nMotors executives say that every time there is a $1 increase in the \nprice of a barrel of oil it adds $4 million to GM's logistical costs. \nSo this is an issue of jobs. Petroleum costs equate with what is \nhappening on jobs. So this is a big deal.\n\n  It is also a big deal for the oil companies. As we all know, we have \nall been seeing the numbers, the total combined profit for the big five \noil companies last year was $111 billion. For 2005, ExxonMobil reported \nthe highest profits ever recorded in U.S. corporate history.\n  What adds insult to injury is when we look at the things like the CEO \ncompensation. He is being paid a total compensation package of $69.7 \nmillion. That is about $110,000 a day, by the way. Most people in \nMichigan don't make $110,000 a year, and we have the head of the \nlargest oil company making $110,000 a day, with a $400 million \nretirement package. Then we are to expect that this is just the global \nmarketplace happening, that there is nothing we can do? I don't accept \nthat.\n  In the short run we can do one thing and that is go back to the \ndrawing board on a bill that is in conference committee right now on \ntax cuts. That has over $5 billion in new tax cuts, tax breaks for oil \ncompanies, some of it based on their businesses overseas. We can say \nno. This industry does not need taxpayers to subsidize $5 billion-plus, \nplus another $2 billion in the Energy bill that passed last year. We \nare looking at $7 billion in increased tax breaks that American \ntaxpayers are subsidizing while we are paying the higher prices? No.\n  I have introduced a bill called the Oil Company Accountability Act \nthat says no to more tax breaks for oil companies and puts that money \nback into a $500 rebate per taxpayer in this country to pay the cost of \nhigher gas prices for the coming year. The average taxpayer is going to \npay $500 more. I think that is a better use of those dollars than \nputting it into more tax breaks for an industry that is already the \nmost profitable, with the most outrageous salaries, and that continues \nto price gasoline at a level that is out of control.\n  I am hopeful my colleagues will be offering this in various \ncapacities. It would be terrific to get this passed right away because \nfamilies could have their checks in the mailbox before Labor Day to \nhelp them pay the outrageously high gas increases that we are seeing: \n$500 tax rebate checks for families, no to the oil companies on more \ntax breaks, and that at least gets us on the right track while other \nlong-term efforts needed take place.\n  Mr. President, I yield.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to take 5 minutes to talk a \nlittle about the energy issues that are affecting us and challenging us \nas a nation and the high price of gasoline more specifically. I am \npersuaded that most of the increase in the price of gasoline that we \nare seeing at the pump is a result of the increase in the price of oil \nand that most of that increase in the price of oil is a result of \nsupply and demand factors. Not all of it, necessarily, but the majority \nof the cause is with supply and demand.\n  So the question comes down to what can we be doing to come to grips \nwith this supply and demand situation? To the extent that there is \nmanipulation of the price, what can we do to deal with that?\n  Let me talk about the manipulation first. I strongly support putting \nin place a Federal statute that prohibits price gouging. Many States \nhave similar statutes, and they have had some success in the \nenforcement of those statutes. But we have no Federal statute to that \neffect. We had a hearing. That was a joint hearing between the Energy \nCommittee and the Commerce Committee a couple of months ago. It was in \nNovember, so it has been more than a couple of months ago. We had the \nhead of the Federal Trade Commission, Deborah Platt Majoras, there \ntestifying. The Federal Trade Commission is the Federal agency that \nwould be the natural agency to have responsibility for enforcement of a \nFederal anti-price-gouging statute. She testified:\n\n       A Federal statute that makes it illegal to charge prices \n     that are considered to be too high as long as companies set \n     those prices independently would be a mistake. The omission \n     of a Federal price gouging law is not inadvertent. It \n     reflects sound policy choices.\n\n  The clear position of the Federal Trade Commission, as articulated by \nthe Chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission of this administration, \nis that they do not want a Federal anti-price-gouging statute, they do \nnot believe it would be good policy to have such a statute. They would \nfind it difficult to enforce and therefore they urge Congress not to \nproceed.\n  I think that is a mistake. I think we should bring an anti-price-\ngouging statute to the floor, and we should proceed to pass it as soon \nas possible. So that is on the manipulation issue.\n  What about supply and demand and the effect that is having on the \nprice of gasoline? Clearly, the supply is not what it needs to be to \nmeet demand today. Trying to increase simply over the short term is \nvery difficult. The most likely prospect we have for increasing supply \nin the next few years is legislation that I have cosponsored along with \nSenator Domenici to try to open up an area in the gulf coast for \ndrilling. That is lease sale 181. That legislation would open up for \ndevelopment an area that is estimated to contain 6 trillion cubic feet \nof natural gas, an area that is estimated to contain 1 billion barrels \nof oil. That would help. That is not an immediate fix, but over the \nnext few years that could begin to help with the supply situation.\n  What about demand? Frankly, that is the area where we could do the \nmost good. In the Energy bill we passed last year, we did some things \nto try to reduce demand, to try to encourage additional efficiency, to \ntry to encourage additional conservation, but we did too little, in my \nview.\n  There is more that can be done, particularly in the transportation \nsector. This is legislation that I am joining with others on in a \nbipartisan group to introduce this week which is called the Enhanced \nEnergy Efficiency Act of 2006. This legislation would try to set \ntargets and goals and requirements for the various Federal agencies to \nadopt, policies to save oil over the next several years--and it would \nput specific amounts of savings that we would work toward. They could \ndo that through a variety of initiatives, a variety of policy changes \nand regulatory changes to encourage more fuel-efficient vehicles, to \nencourage fleet conservation requirements, assistance to State programs \nto retire fuel-inefficient vehicles, assistance to States to reduce \nschoolbus idling.\n  There are a variety of provisions in this bill. These are provisions \nwhich were included in a bill that Senators Bayh, Brownback, Coleman, \nand various other Senators introduced earlier in this Congress. I think \nit was S. 2025. But these are provisions that would be under the \njurisdiction of the Energy Committee. These are provisions that I \nbelieve would begin the process of looking more seriously at ways we \ncan reduce demand.\n  We could encourage efficiency in our use of energy, and particularly \nin our use of oil. These are steps that could be taken--that need to be \ntaken.\n  I think we should pass a Federal anti-price-gouging law. We could do \nthat quickly. We can get that to the President for his signature.\n\n[[Page S3441]]\n\n  We can also pass this other legislation. We can pass the legislation \nthat opens lease sale 181 for development. That, again, would help \nsomewhat with the supply situation. Unfortunately, it is very difficult \nto affect the price of gasoline through legislation in the short term. \nI think we all need to acknowledge that. But I believe there are steps \nwe can take. I believe there are policies we can adopt. I hope we can \nwork in a bipartisan way to do that.\n  I hope we can come to the aid of the American consumers who are \nhaving to pay these very high prices for gasoline at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this morning the President of the United \nStates held a press conference and announced the following: Prices at \nthe pumps reflect our addiction to oil.\n  So it turns out it is our fault. It turns out it is the fault of the \nconsumers. It is the fault of families and businesses and farmers that \nthe prices have gone so high. I don't think so. I think the prices at \nthe pump reflect the oil companies' addiction to greed.\n  Let me give you a case to consider. Lee Raymond, CEO of Exxon, \nrecently retired. Did he get a gold watch for his service to Exxon? No. \nMr. Raymond was given a severance package of $400 million. And the \nprices at the pumps reflect the consumers' shortcoming?\n  ExxonMobil recorded the highest corporate profits in the history of \nthe United States of America. Money went straight from the credit cards \nof American families into the board rooms of ExxonMobil. They realized \nbillions of dollars in profit, and they turned around and gave Mr. \nRaymond, as a farewell gift for his fine tutelage over their company, \n$400 million as a going-away gift. And the President says the price at \nthe pumps reflects the consumers' addiction to oil? What choice do \nconsumers have?\n  You go shop around in your hometown, as I did in Springfield and \nChicago. There is some variation from pump to pump, from gas station to \ngas station. By and large, consumers have nowhere to turn.\n  What is happening is the price of gasoline is going up so fast, so \nhigh, that it is creating a hardship--not just for farmers and \nindividuals but for America's economy--for the farmers I represent who \nare trying to put a crop in the field, for businesses that depend on \nthe cost of energy as one of their input costs. That is a reality.\n  Let me say to the President that the prices at the pumps don't \nreflect our addiction to oil; they reflect a failure in leadership by \nthis White House.\n  It hasn't even been 1 year--not 12 months--since the President \nceremoniously signed the Energy bill for America's energy policy last \nAugust. What a great bill that has been. Since that bill was signed, \nwhat has happened to the price of energy and heating, and energy and \ngasoline? It has gone up dramatically across America. That bill was a \nfailure. It was a failure because this administration believes the \nprice at the pump is the fault of the consumers. It isn't. The \nconsumers have nowhere to turn. That bill that was passed was an \noutrage. There were some provisions in it that I supported--expanding \nthe use of alcohol fuels, alternative fuels--but the bill also \ncontained multibillion-dollar subsidies to the oil industry at a time \nwhen they are enjoying record-breaking profits.\n  We are going to take money away from taxpayers and give it to \nindustry? What in the world could we be thinking?\n  The bill also has had no meaningful conservation effort. How can we \nbe serious about an energy policy in America if we aren't moving toward \nmore fuel-efficient cars and trucks? We continue to import oil from \noverseas with abandon.\n  Why hasn't this administration set as a goal for America what the \nDemocrats argued for on the floor; that is, that we would reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil by more than 50 percent over the next 10 \nyears? We can do it with the vision and leadership of a White House \nthat is not wedded to the oil industry but wedded, rather, to an \neconomy that is being at this point seriously disadvantaged by the \nterrible increases in gasoline prices.\n\n  When the President wants to blame the consumer pulling up to the pump \nfor his addiction to oil, I have to ask the President: What have you \ndone? What has Congress done? What should we do?\n  Let me say this: Despite my serious misgivings about the energy \npolicy of this administration which believes the answer to our prayers \nis to drill for oil in a wildlife refuge in Alaska that we have \nprotected for 50 years, a refuge which at best will start producing oil \nin 10 years, and over its lifespan produce 6 months of energy for \nAmerica, as if this is the answer to our prayers, that is very \nshortsighted. We need to come together. We need to understand that when \nthe Republican leaders in Congress and the President of the United \nStates are saying we had better call the Federal Trade Commission \nbecause something is going wrong with gasoline stations--America, \nexcuse me; the Federal Trade Commission is part of this administration. \nWhy are they waiting until this moment in time when all the bells and \nwhistles and alarms are sounding to finally realize that we have to \nmove on price gouging and price fixing?\n  I think it is time to have a windfall profits tax. I introduced that \nbill. When ExxonMobil can realize billions of dollars of profit at the \nexpense of American businesses and families, it is time for us to step \nin and say that money is coming back to the Treasury and back to the \nconsumers. We have talked for a long time about tax cuts for average \nfamilies. How about a tax rebate from the windfall profits of these oil \ncompanies going right back to the families who are being flailed by \nthese high gasoline prices. That would send a message to the oil \ncompanies that their price gouging is not going to go without penalty. \nThey will pay a price for it. Those who would benefit from the windfall \nprofits tax are the very consumers who are paying these high energy \nprices.\n  I think that is what we need to do. We need to understand that if we \nare going to have an energy policy in America which keeps our economy \nmoving forward, we need to acknowledge the obvious. It is not the \nconsumers' fault. The consumer has nowhere to turn at this point but to \npay these high gasoline prices. It is the fault of leadership--the \nleadership at the oil companies that will take every last penny out of \nevery working family they can at the pump, and it is the fault of an \nadministration which comes from the oil patch and has been afraid to \nconfront their old friends when it comes to these rising gasoline \nprices.\n  It is time to start anew. It is time to start on a bipartisan basis \nto understand that this isn't just a temporary inconvenience. It is \nsomething which can seriously handicap this economy for a long time to \ncome.\n  I just returned from Illinois. I spent 2 weeks traveling all over the \nState, the city of Chicago, and suburban areas. I tell you that I \nexpected to hear a lot about the Iraqi war, a lot about immigration, \nhealth care, education, and I did hear about those, but the thing that \nis focusing the attention of the people in Illinois is the price at the \ngasoline stations.\n  These families understand that this is a hardship they never counted \non. It is bad enough in this country when these families struggle to \ntry to make a living, to put their kids through school, make that \nmortgage payment, but then to have these oil companies and their \nrapacious greed charging higher and higher prices for their product and \ntaking $400 million so Mr. Raymond can have a sweet retirement from \nExxonMobil, that is unconscionable.\n  It is time for the President to speak out. It is not a question of \nwhether our addiction to oil has caused this problem. It is not the \nconsumers' fault. No. It is the fault of the oil company executives and \nthis administration which needs to show real leadership so this economy \ndoesn't stall.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I would very much like to work on an energy \npolicy in a bipartisan way. I think we all understand that the only way \nto get anything important done in Washington, DC, is to work in a \nbipartisan way. Unfortunately, the same Bush administration that so \ntragically bungled the response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita has now \nbungled its way to $3-a-\n\n[[Page S3442]]\n\ngallon gasoline. And in particular, I am concerned that all of the \nevidence showed that this spring we would have these problems.\n  The administration, for example, has given Congress a variety of \nreports about how post-Katrina we would have evidence of a supply \nproblem. With respect to the changeover from MTBE to ethanol, all the \nevidence was available many months ago. The Wall Street Journal was \nwarning about it--that there would be huge logistical problems for \nservice stations and others to make that changeover.\n  We know that ethanol--and the Senator from Illinois has been one of \nthe leaders in this effort--is going to play an important role in \nAmerica's gasoline future. Given that, this should have been an all-\nhands-on-deck approach at the administration trying to watchdog the \ntransition from MTBE to ethanol. This is an administration with \nenormous expertise in the oil area. For all practical purposes, this is \nan administration that is almost marinated in oil. One official after \nanother has a history and a background in this sector. Yet where was \nthe Department of Energy? Where was the Environmental Protection \nAgency? Where was the Commodity Futures Trading Commission at a key \ntime in our country's energy future?\n  With all the problems overseas--Nigeria, Venezuela, and Iraq \nproducing a tiny fraction of what they were able to produce before the \nwar--we knew that this was going to be a difficult time this spring.\n  I talked to a gasoline station owner last night. I pulled up and was \nfaced with the prospect of $3.25 a gallon. That station owner said: \nNobody gave us any information at all about how to proceed in this \nsignificant switchover from MTBE to ethanol.\n  They have to clean their tanks. There are tremendous logistical \nproblems and a different role for transportation with respect to trucks \nand rails versus pipelines. Normally, you would have taken a much \nlonger period of time to make this changeover. That wasn't done.\n  So the administration should have been there working with the service \nstation owners and the oil companies and a variety of parties to try to \nminimize the problems when you are having this massive transition in \nthe energy area. So we are going to see instances where people try to \nexploit the situation. I hope we can get the Federal Trade Commission \noff the dime and finally go out and take the steps to protect the \npublic from this exploitation.\n\n  It was known a year ago that this was a time when we would have a \nperfect energy storm. We knew we were going to have the equivalent of \nwhat amounts to a level 5 hurricane in the gasoline market. Yet the \nfolks in the administration sat on their hands. It did not have to be \nthat way.\n  I want to work in a bipartisan way to turn this around. \nUnfortunately, the same kind of bumbling and bungling approach that was \ntaken in responding to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita has driven our \ngasoline prices over $3 a gallon. We ought to come together. I \nrecommended yesterday in a lengthy speech a variety of steps we could \ntake in the short term--for example, helping the States to make this \ntransition to ethanol easier. We can do it in a bipartisan way. If it \nwere not for the bungling of this administration over the last year and \nits failure to take the steps that could have prevented much of what we \nhave seen, we would not have to come to this point. That is \nunfortunate. The American people have been gratuitously hammered again. \nIt didn't have to be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have been listening to the debate in \nthe Senate. Senator Cornyn is going to respond in a little more detail. \nHonestly, it is very important we address the energy issue in a way \nthat suggests what we can do. The people of America are not interested \nin Democratic charges against Republicans and Republican charges \nagainst Democrats. They want more resources so the price of gasoline at \nthe pump will come down.\n  In my hometown of Dallas, there are shortages now in addition to the \nhigh prices. We need to do some things that diversify our resources so \nwe depend on our own resources for oil and natural gas. That means \ndrilling for oil in our country and trying to make sure we have \nconservation and alternative sources of energy, which is exactly what \nCongress has been trying to do. We have been held up in doing it.\n  I appreciate very much this opportunity. I am very pleased to work \nwith my colleague, Senator Cornyn.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I will use a few minutes to respond to \nsome of the voices that have been raised regarding the fuel prices. Of \ncourse, this is an issue that affects everyone. It is ironic that those \nwho have railed the loudest against high gasoline prices are the ones \nwho indeed are responsible for obstructing rational energy policy in \nthis country that would bring down the price of gasoline itself.\n  For example, we all know that the global competition for oil and gas \nis greater with the industrialization and growth of countries such as \nChina, with 1.3 billion people, with the growth and industrialization \nof countries such as India. But notwithstanding the need to diversify \nour energy sources to nuclear energy and use the 300 years of coal we \nhave in this country in a clean and environmentally sensitive way, we \nhave been met with nothing but obstruction when it comes to trying to \nboth diversify our energy sources and to undertake policies that would \nliterally bring down the price of gasoline at the pump.\n  It is no secret the single greatest factor in high gasoline prices is \nhigh oil prices. We have simply been denied every opportunity we have \ntried to undertake to expand domestic production at home by exploring \nplaces such as the Arctic Wildlife Refuge in an environmentally \nresponsible way and drilling offshore in America in a way that can \npreserve both the environment but also increase the supply of oil and \nhelp bring down the price of gas.\n  Congress can do a lot of things, but we cannot repeal the laws of \nsupply and demand. Without additional supply, we know with additional \ndemand, prices will continue to go up. Because of obstruction and \nunreasonable regulation we have not seen a new refinery built in this \ncountry in the last 30 years.\n  Our time would be used more productively if our colleagues across the \naisle would work with us to diversify and expand the sources of \ndomestic energy so we can help bring down the price at the pump. It \nwould be much more constructively used if we work together rather than \nattempting to score political points and to place the blame in a \npolitical season.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/25/senate-section/article/S3442-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to talk about \nGray Miller. Senator Cornyn and I are dividing this time because we are \nboth responsible for nominating this incredible person to serve on the \nFederal district bench from the southern district of Texas in his \nhometown of Houston.\n  Senator Cornyn and I have a process. We have a committee made up of \nRepublicans and Democrats, geographically diverse, lawyers respected in \ntheir fields, who interview all of the nominees for Federal benches. \nThere were quite a few nominees, probably 15 to 20, for this particular \nbench. They rank them. Senator Cornyn and I then talked to the top 3 or \n4 nominees. It has been a great system. We have gotten extremely \nqualified judges on the\n\n[[Page S3443]]\n\ndistrict benches in Texas doing it this way.\n  I appreciate the input of Senator Cornyn, a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, because he has been attorney general of Texas. His input is \nvery valuable and our system has produced a quality judge in Gray \nMiller.\n  Gray Miller is a senior partner at Fulbright & Jaworski. Gray has \nheaded the firm's admiralty department, starting in 1997. In fact, he \nis widely considered one of the leading maritime lawyers in the world \nand was included in Euro's Money Guide to the world's leading maritime \nlawyers. Included in his many professional honors are accolades as a \nTexas superlawyer by Texas Monthly Magazine and recognition as one of \nthe best lawyers in America.\n  Gray Miller is one of the most honorable, hard-working Americans I \nhave ever known. From 1969 to 1978 Gray worked his way through \nundergraduate and law school as a Houston police officer. He and his \nwife raised their two children during this time. While he has obtained \nexceptional skills and qualifications as a lawyer and with the \nadmiralty specialty, which is a big part of the practice in Houston, \nhis experience of serving as a Houston police officer brings a unique \nperspective to the Federal bench.\n  He was appointed by the Governor of Texas to serve on the board of \nthe Texas Department of Mental Health and Retardation. He is a lifetime \nmember of the 100 Club of Houston, an organization that assists the \nfamilies of police officers and firefighters who are killed or injured \nin the line of duty.\n  I am honored to recommend Gray Miller. He meets the high standards to \nwhich we hold all judicial nominees. He has an impressive record of \nservice. He has great judicial temperament. He shoots straight. He has \nan experience that is so diverse, from being an on-the-ground police \nofficer who is dealing with the criminal aspect in our society--we do \nnot have enough people with that background on the Federal bench--to \nadmiralty, which is an intellectual contract, and international law, \npart of the responsibility in the southern district of Texas.\n  With this array of experience and the integrity he holds, we have an \noutstanding nominee. I urge all of my colleagues to support the \nnomination of Gray Miller.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I join my colleague, Senator Hutchison, in \ncommending to our colleagues this fine nominee to the U.S. District \nCourt for the Southern District of Texas. Soon-to-be-Judge Miller will \nsucceed Judge Ewing Werlein, who assumed senior status early this year.\n  I add to all of Mr. Miller's outstanding credentials my recognition \nand our appreciation for Judge Werlein's service to his Nation and the \nlegal profession during his time on the bench.\n  First, I thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator \nSpecter, as well as the ranking member, Senator Leahy, for working with \nSenator Hutchinson and me to fill the important vacancy in the Houston \nDivision of the Southern District of Texas.\n  Mr. Miller has been nominated to fill the vacancy created when Judge \nEwing Werlein assumed senior status earlier this year. Judge Werlein \nhas served his country and the legal profession admirably, and I \ncommend him for his dedicated service.\n  The Houston division is one of the most important and diverse in the \nentire Federal judiciary as it is responsible for some of the Nation's \nmost complex, notable commercial disputes and criminal prosecutions. It \nis crucial that we fill this vacancy quickly and I thank the committee \nfor their vote to bring Mr. Miller's nomination to the Senate floor.\n  When I consider nominees for the Federal bench, there are certain \ncharacteristics that I value. In fact, I believe that many of my \ncolleagues also appreciate these same characteristics. First, nominees \nusually have a notable history of public service. In addition, nominees \nare often well-respected by their peers and have impeccable academic \nand/or professional records. Last, nominees usually have a long and \ndistinguished history of civil involvement. Mr. President, Gray Miller \npossesses these traits.\n\n  Mr. Miller has the necessary qualifications to serve on the Federal \nbench. He has been a long-time partner in the distinguished Texas law \nfirm of Fulbright and Jaworski. He has excelled at the practice of law \nand is well respected within the legal profession for his knowledge of \nadmiralty and maritime law. This nominee also enjoys the support of the \nAmerican Bar Association which has certified him as well-qualified \nafter a thorough review of his credentials.\n  Furthermore, he devotes a substantial amount of his time to public \nservice. Most notably, he spent 9 years as a Houston police officer, \nworking his way through his undergraduate and law degrees. Now, as a \nprivate practice attorney, he supports a variety of public service \ninitiatives, including the Houston Volunteer Lawyers Program and \nHabitat for Humanity. He also previously has served on the board of \ntrustees of the Mental Health/Mental Retardation Authority of Harris \nCounty and on the board of the Texas Department of Mental Health and \nMental Retardation. He and his wife actively support Houston schools \nfor students with learning disabilities and drug and alcohol problems. \nHis devotion to the greater Houston community is commendable.\n  From a congressional page in 1965 to a police officer in the 1970s to \nan accomplished trial advocate, Mr. Miller understands and respects the \nrole of our three branches of government. He has an unfailing respect \nfor the judiciary and the jury system. It is with this understanding \nthat I believe Mr. Miller will serve his country honorably as a Federal \ndistrict court judge should--by interpreting and applying the law and \nadhering to established precedent.\n  I am pleased that President Bush has nominated Gray Miller to serve \non the court of the Southern District of Texas. I look forward to his \nservice on the Federal bench in the Great State of Texas. I ask my \ncolleagues to support his nomination.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second? There \nis a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Gray Hampton Miller, of Texas, to be United States District Judge \nfor the Southern District of Texas? On this question, the yeas and nays \nhave been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Louisiana (Mr. Vitter).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Minnesota (Mr. Dayton), \nthe Senator from Vermont (Mr. Jeffords), the Senator from Massachusetts \n(Mr. Kerry), the Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Kohl), the Senator from \nIllinois (Mr. Obama), and the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nRockefeller) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``aye.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr. (Burr).

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is my pleasure and honor to describe \nfor the Senate the supplemental appropriations bill that has been \nreported by our committee. The President has requested supplemental \nappropriations for this fiscal year, which the committee has reviewed. \nThe House has passed a bill reporting and referring to the Senate this \nbill that is described as an emergency. The funds are needed primarily \nfor the global war on terror, which is included in title I of the bill.\n  The total committee substitute would provide $106,474,107,000 in \nsupplemental appropriations for this fiscal year, 2006. It is above the \nPresident's request by $14,253,522,000. It is also above the House-\npassed bill, and we have broken this down and presented it to the \nSenate in titles.\n  The first title provides money primarily for defense-related \nactivities, as I said, to carry out the global war on terror. It \nprovides funding for ongoing operations and reconstruction efforts in \nIraq and Afghanistan.\n  In title II, we have included funds above the President's request for \nrecovery from the damages caused by the hurricanes in the Gulf of \nMexico in 2005. The President requested $19.7 billion for this purpose. \nThe committee, in consideration of amendments offered by Senators \nduring the markup session, approved an additional $7.4 billion for this \npurpose. So the total of title II is $27,126,662,000.\n  Title III reflects the provision of an amendment that was offered in \ncommittee by Senators Dorgan of North Dakota and Burns of Montana \nrelating to agricultural disaster assistance for farmers and ranchers \nin States that are affected either by the hurricanes of 2005 or \ndrought, flood, wildfires, and other natural disasters that have \noccurred. That amendment provides exactly $3,944 million for emergency \nagricultural disaster assistance.\n  Title IV reflects an amendment that was approved by the committee for \nemergency drought assistance, more broadly defined, and is an amendment \noffered by the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, and agreed to by \nthe committee, with $12,500,000 for that purpose.\n  Title V is an appropriation of $648,050,000 for port security \nenhancements. This was requested by--and the committee approved the \nrequest--the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd.\n  Title VI includes funds for influenza pandemic preparation and \nresponse activities. The administration asked for this amendment. It \nwas included by the committee. It provides $2,300 million for that \npurpose.\n  Title VII is the part of the bill that has general provisions and \ntechnical provisions.\n  Overall, the bill can be described as having two major points of \nfocus. First, it provides needed funding for our military to continue \nto carry out operations overseas. It also includes the commitment to \nrebuild the gulf coast to permit inhabitants there to recover from the \ndevastation caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n  It is my opinion--and I think this reflects the action taken by our \ncommittee--that it is critical that these funds be provided \nexpeditiously, and we need the cooperation and support of all Senators \nto accomplish this goal. The committee recommendation has been \navailable to Senators for several weeks. I hope we can consider \namendments in an orderly fashion, that they can be brought up as early \nas possible so they can be considered without prolonged and unnecessary \ndelay.\n  I have to say that the individual subcommittee chairmen worked hard \nto identify the needs in the areas under their jurisdiction. Those who \nserve as ranking minority members of the subcommittees have had \nopportunities to participate. It has been a bipartisan effort made by \nour committee to bring to the bill a recommended appropriation amount \nthat would serve our national security interests as well as our \neconomic interests and other problems that were caused by natural \ndisasters.\n  At the appropriate time, I will move that the committee substitute be \nadopted and be treated as original text for the purpose of further \namendments. I have to say at this point that the work of this committee \nreflects bipartisan cooperation and mutual respect between the Members \non both sides of the aisle. It carries out a tradition that I believe \nhas been one of the hallmarks of the activity of the Senate. It has \nreflected credit, therefore, on the Senate.\n  I hope Members will understand that we are not addressing issues on \nthe basis of partisanship but on the basis of need to address problems \nthat confront our country and those which were unanticipated when the \nPresident submitted his initial budget request for this fiscal year. We \nhave had other events that have caused us to have to proceed to adopt \nemergency appropriations bills, and here again that is something we \nhave to deal with. We are presenting this bill as a good-faith effort \nto meet the needs of the country as we see them and as requested by the \nPresident.\n  I am happy to yield to my friend, the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, Mr. Byrd, who has provided very important assistance to me \npersonally and, through his service in the Senate, to the work of this \ncommittee for a long time. We appreciate his valuable assistance. All \nmembers of the committee have worked to be sure that this is a good \nbill and deserves the support of the Senate. I think it does.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the truly distinguished and able \nchairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Mr. Cochran, for all \nof his hard work on this bill. He is so diligent, so fair, so \nhonorable. I am proud to serve with him. Mississippi is so well \nrepresented in the Senate by this man. As a matter of great pride, I \ncall him my friend, my colleague, my chairman.\n  The President has asked the Congress to approve over $92 billion of \nemergency spending, including $72.5 billion\n\n[[Page S3474]]\n\nfor the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and $19.8 billion for the Federal \nresponse to the terrible hurricanes that struck the Gulf States in \nAugust and September of 2005.\n  When the committee opened its hearings on the supplemental on March \n7, I stated my belief that it is our duty to scrutinize the President's \nrequest not only for what is in the bill but also for what is not in \nthe bill. I said to the distinguished chairman and to Senator Landrieu \nand others that I would help them in every way I could in responding to \nthe terrible storms that hit their States.\n  My State of West Virginia is often hit by floods and other damaging \ndisasters, such as the recent accidents in West Virginia's coal mines. \nI am very sensitive to the ability of our Federal Government to prepare \nfor and respond to disasters promptly and with competence, which is \nwhat our citizens need and what our citizens deserve. Sadly, many of \nour Federal agencies are no longer up to these fundamental tasks.\n  Mr. President, the chairman of the committee has taken the bull by \nthe horns. Under his leadership, the recommendations of the committee \nfill in some of the gaps in the administration's request for funds \nrequired to respond to the hurricanes.\n  The committee added approximately $7.4 billion to the President's \nbudget request--that is not chickenfeed--$7.4 billion added to the \nPresident's budget request for Federal programs to respond to these \ndisasters.\n  I have to also note that the chairman of the committee included at my \nrequest--he would probably have done it, anyhow; perhaps I made it a \nlittle easier--and the request of others an amount of $35.6 million for \nimproved mine safety and health programs. In the wake of 18 coal mining \ndeaths in the State of West Virginia this year and another 16 mining \ndeaths in other States this year, it is imperative that the Congress \nact immediately to ensure that an adequate number of safety inspectors \nwill be provided for our Nation's mines and to expedite the \nintroduction of critical safety equipment.\n  It is simply, absolutely, positively inexcusable that our miners have \noxygen canisters that last only 1 hour--1 hour--when miners may be \ntrapped underground for several days, or that the miners may not have \nemergency communications equipment. Think of that. Miners may not have \nemergency communications equipment that can reach the surface in the \nevent of an extended rescue effort. I tell you, this is something to \ntalk about.\n  The chairman has my genuine appreciation for including these funds in \nthe committee-reported bill. I also thank Senator Specter, Senator \nHarkin, and Senator Rockefeller for their support of the initiative.\n  By the way, Senator Rockefeller is recuperating from a very serious \noperation. He may not get back in the harness here until June. I was \ntalking with him a couple of days ago. He probably won't get back until \nJune. John D. Rockefeller, my colleague from West Virginia.\n  The bill before the Senate also includes a provision to extend the \nabandoned mine land authority through fiscal year 2007. The AML program \nand combined benefits fund are very important programs that are needed \nby retired coal miners, by their families, and by coalfields \ncommunities throughout the country. I thank Chairman Cochran. I thank \nSenator Specter and Senator Domenici for supporting this effort.\n  The supplemental appropriations bill includes $67.8 billion for the \nDepartment of Defense to prosecute the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nUpon passage of this legislation, the total amount appropriated for the \nwar in Iraq, including the cost of reconstruction, will be $320 \nbillion. Mr. President, that is $320 for every minute since Jesus \nChrist was born 2,000 years ago. That is a lot of money. Man, think of \nthat.\n  That is a staggering figure, but what is even more unbelievable is \nthat the monthly cost of the war in Iraq has been steadily, steadily, \nsteadily escalating. In May 2004, the Defense Department reported to \nthe Armed Services Committee that the cost of operations in Iraq was \naveraging $4 billion per month. The Congressional Research Service \nreported this month that during fiscal year 2005, the cost of the war \nin Iraq had escalated to $5.6 billion per month. The Congressional \nResearch Service estimates that the cost of operations in Iraq during \nthe current fiscal year will grow to $6.8 billion per month.\n  I ask the Chair, can you comprehend how much money that is, $6.8 \nbillion? That is $6.80 for every minute since Jesus Christ was born. \nContemplate that.\n  The American people ought to be asking how on Earth has the monthly \ncost of the war in Iraq grown by 70 percent just in 2 years. Isn't \nthere any way to control the cost of the war while making sure that our \ntroops continue to get the support they need?\n  The truth is that the administration is out of control when it comes \nto asking for emergency spending. According to a Congressional Budget \nOffice report, the White House has requested $515 billion in emergency \nspending between 2001 and 2006. That is more than 3\\1/2\\ times the \ncombined total of all--all, a-l-l--all of the emergency spending bills \nin the previous 10 years.\n  Say that again. Did you hear me? More than 3\\1/2\\ times the combined \ntotal of all of the emergency spending bills in the previous 10 years.\n  The President refuses to include in his annual budget request a \nrealistic estimate of the cost of the wars. As a result, there is \nvirtually no debate about how our country is going to pay for these \nmassive bills. And what is more, these emergency spending requests mean \nthat Congress has only a limited opportunity to scrutinize the \nadministration's spending proposals. As a result, nobody--nobody--seems \nto be minding the store when it comes to controlling the escalating \ncost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I tell you, I was in favor of fighting the war in Afghanistan, but I \nwas not in favor of going into Iraq. No, man. No.\n  The failure of the President to heed the repeated calls by the \nSenate--by the Senate, that is this body--to budget for the wars in \nIraq and Afghanistan has resulted in more unnecessary spending that is \nhidden--hidden--from public view.\n\n  For example, the President requested $8.3 billion in military \nprocurement to replace wornout or battle-damaged equipment, but this is \nessentially forward funding of replacement equipment that should be \nbought using funds in the regular appropriations bill. Since we do not \nneed to buy the same equipment twice, future Defense spending bills \nneed not appropriate procurement funds that have already been approved \nin previously enacted emergency appropriations bills.\n  This forward funding of military procurement accounts should then \nmean savings in the regular Defense appropriations bill. But when will \nthese savings appear?\n  With the approval of this bill, the Department of Defense budget for \nfiscal year 2006 is $534 billion, an increase of 74 percent over fiscal \nyear 2001. Congress has rubberstamped much of this increase without \nindepth budget justification.\n  Until the President begins to include a real estimate of the cost of \nthe wars in his annual budget, American taxpayers will continue to see \nbillions more dollars spent without any true measure of accountability. \nThat is why I will again offer an amendment to the supplemental \nappropriations bill that calls for the President to budget for the cost \nof the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  The Senate has given its strong support to this amendment four \ntimes--four times--and the President continues to look the other way, \ncontinues to disregard this direction by the Senate. The Senate must \ninsist on a long overdue and responsible step of budgeting for the cost \nof the war.\n  I am also very disappointed that the White House limited the \nsupplemental request to the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan \nand in response to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. As the Senate \ndebates immigration and border security, it is rather astonishing, \nwouldn't you think, that no funding was included for border security. \nNor were any funds included for port security. Dubai Ports World is now \noperating terminals at six of our major ports.\n  The ``layered defense''--if I may put quotation marks around those \ntwo words--the ``layered defense'' that the\n\n[[Page S3475]]\n\nadministration claims is protecting our ports is, in fact, paper thin--\npaper thin. It is just that thin.\n  Nor did the President seek any supplemental funding for preparing for \nor preventing the outbreak of the avian flu or to help our farmers who \nhave been devastated by drought and by the hurricanes.\n  The Appropriations Committee, under the chairmanship of Senator \nCochran, has wisely approved funding for port security, wisely approved \nfunding for the avian flu, wisely approved funding for drought relief, \nand I hope that border security funding will be approved this week on \nthe floor.\n  I challenge the White House--it is easy to be brave from a distance; \nI am quite a ways up the avenue from the White House--I challenge the \nWhite House--come on--I challenge the White House to get serious about \nthese issues. These are also emergencies. The White House should be \nleading rather than opposing efforts to improve border security and \nport security, and it should be preparing for the avian flu and helping \nour farmers.\n  The administration has a huge credibility gap when it comes to \nhomeland security. There is a continuing drumbeat that another \nterrorist attack may occur or is even likely. The President, in his \nState of the Union Address, told the American people:\n\n       The enemy has not lost the desire or capability to attack \n     us.\n\n  That is true. One look at the budget reveals an odd complacency. The \nadministration's speech writers and his policy writers seem to be \nliving in different worlds.\n  In response to the administration's decision to allow Dubai Ports \nWorld to operate terminals in six major U.S. ports, it is asserted by \nthe administration that it has a robust, layered security system for \nour ports. And yet for the second straight year, the White House \nproposes to eliminate the Port Security Grant Program. Of the $816 \nmillion the Congress has appropriated since September 11 for port \nsecurity, only $46 million was requested by the President. There is \nnothing ``robust'' about that.\n\n  How serious are we about port security, when the President, the Vice \nPresident, the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity don't even know about the decision to sell the operation of \nsix U.S. ports to a State-owned foreign company?\n  How serious are we about port security when Customs and Border \nProtection inspects only 5 percent of the 11 million containers that \ncome into the country each year?\n  How serious are we when the Coast Guard Deepwater budget for \nreplacing its ships, planes, and helicopters will not be completed \nuntil 2026?\n  The administration has not requested one thin dime for port security \nin this $92 billion supplemental.\n  The committee-reported bill includes my amendment to provide $648 \nmillion to fill critical gaps in our paper-thin port security program. \nThe bill now provides resources for more radiation portal monitors, \nmore container inspections, more port inspections, and would fund port \nsecurity grants at the levels anticipated in the Collins-Lieberman and \nStevens-Inouye port security authorization bills.\n  The American people--our people, your people--yes, our people, the \nAmerican people--expect more than just a paper-thin--you can almost see \nthrough that--the American people expect more than just a paper-thin \nsecurity plan for our ports. The bill, as reported by the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, begins--and Senator Cochran, the chairman of \nthat committee, can take a lot of credit--begins to address this paper-\nthin port security program by including a total of $648 million to fill \ncritical gaps in our port security program. I thank Senators Dan \nInouye, Herb Kohl, and Tom Harkin for their support of my initiative in \ncommittee. Whose initiative? Mine, my initiative. Dizzy Dean says it is \nall right to brag if you have done it. Well, I have done it.\n  The White House should step to the plate and support this effort.\n  While the committee-reported bill has made some progress to address \nthe gaps in the Nation's port security defenses, it virtually ignores \nborder security. The Senate has recently been debating immigration and \nborder security legislation to authorize a whole host of items intended \nto secure our borders. The legislation would authorize the hiring of \nadditional Border Patrol agents. It would authorize the hiring of \nadditional immigration enforcement agents and detention officers. It \nwould authorize border surveillance, technology, and unmanned aerial \nvehicles, and fences.\n  I am very concerned--very concerned--about lax border security. In \nfact, together with our colleague, Senator Larry Craig, and with the \nsupport of my Homeland Security Subcommittee chairman, Senator Judd \nGregg, I led the effort in the Senate last year to appropriate hard \ndollars to begin to put real teeth--see these teeth? These are real \nteeth. They are just 88 years old. These are real teeth. Well, that is \nwhat we did. We put real teeth in our border security agenda. We did \nnot merely authorize the hiring of more Border Patrol agents; we \nappropriated hard dollars to hire 500 more Border Patrol agents, as \nwell as more immigration enforcement agents and detention officers. \nDon't you feel better about that? I do. I can sleep a little better. I \nwill bet Senator Harkin sleeps better at night because of it. Those 500 \nBorder Patrol agents have been hired and trained and are deployed on \nour borders. They are out there defending our borders while we are \nsleeping. Think about that.\n  As we hire more Border Patrol agents and other immigration \nenforcement officials, they must have the tools they need to do their \njob. We need to start paying for those tools now so that they will be \navailable as more and more Border Patrol and immigration enforcement \nofficials are hired and trained.\n  I will be talking again about this matter as the Senate proceeds to \nconsider this supplemental appropriations bill. Securing our borders \nrequires more than just hot air. Hot air is cheap. We must put real \ndollars to work for border security.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to report to the Senate that the \ncommittee-reported bill, under the strong leadership of Chairman \nCochran--hey, you people down there in Mississippi better hold on to \nthis man. He does a terrific job on this committee. This bill includes \nseveral other initiatives to deal with gaps in funding in the budget \nrequest.\n  I would suggest that principal among these gaps is an amount of $2.3 \nbillion required to prepare for and to respond to a potential influenza \npandemic such as the avian flu. My mother died during the great \ninfluenza epidemic of 1917 and 1918; the great influenza epidemic. So \nthere is money here to prepare for and to respond to a potential \ninfluenza pandemic. The World Health Organization recommends that \ncountries stockpile enough antiviral medications to cover 25 percent of \nthe population or 80 million Americans.\n  According to the Department of Health and Human Services, there is a \nshortfall of 30 million courses. HHS will not receive the antivirals it \nhas ordered until the end of this year.\n  We are also well short of the 20 million goal that has been set by \nHHS for purchasing prepandemic vaccine. Experts have said that a \nvaccine is the only effective way to stop the spread of a pandemic.\n  The availability of the vaccine and medicine is limited. The \navailability is limited. We should not wait to place our orders. The \nWhite House should support this effort.\n  The committee-reported bill also includes approximately $3.9 billion \nfor emergency agricultural disaster assistance for farmers and ranchers \nin States affected by recent hurricanes in the gulf, drought in the \nsouthern plains and throughout the western corn belt, and excessive \nrainfall in North Dakota--North Dakota: Do you know where that is? That \nis north of South Dakota. North Dakota--and the upper Midwest flood. \nNearly 80 percent of all U.S. counties were designated as primary or \ncontiguous disaster areas by the Secretary of Agriculture or the \nPresident in 2005.\n  So, Mr. President, the chairman and I look forward to a good debate \non this supplemental appropriations bill. It is a good bill, and it is \ntruly responsive--truly responsive--to the needs of the American \npeople.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I want to express my genuine heartfelt \nappreciation for the remarks of the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia\n\n[[Page S3476]]\n\nabout me and about the work of our committee. He has been a very \nvaluable tutor, friend, and companion during the work of our Committee \non Appropriations since I have been on the committee, since January of \n1981. I have learned a lot from him. I have learned to respect him in \nterms of the conscientious way he goes about carrying out his \nresponsibilities to the people of West Virginia and also to the people \nof the United States as a U.S. Senator. We can all study his career and \nhis dedication to public service with great profit for our own \ninterests. We can be guided by his example and be very proud of our \nwork product if we do.\n  Mr. President, at the appropriate time, I will ask unanimous consent \nthat the committee amendment be agreed to and the bill as thus amended \nbe considered as original text for the purpose of further amendment, \nand that no points of order be waived by the request. I give the Senate \nnotice that I will make that unanimous consent request in due course, \nand it probably will occur immediately after our break for the policy \nluncheons of the respective parties of the Senate. I am happy to yield \nto any other Senator who wishes to make any comments. I understand the \nSenator from Minnesota would like to speak as if in morning business, \nand I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Coleman pertaining to the submission of S.

The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3594\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we are now on the supplemental \nappropriations bill. One of the issues raised in the supplemental \nappropriations bill, of course, is national defense. The purpose of \nthis bill is primarily to fund efforts to fight terrorism and \nespecially to make sure that our troops in Iraq and in Afghanistan have \nwhat they need in order to effectively fight terrorism. A big part, \nhowever, of national defense is clearly border security--being sure \nthat we know who comes into this country, know what their purposes are \nwhen they come into this country, and whether they are coming into this \ncountry for the purpose of visiting us or maybe participating in our \neconomy or for the purpose of doing us harm.\n  Unfortunately, we have for a number of years experienced borders \nwhich are very porous. That is a function of our history--where we have \nalways believed in open borders, especially with our neighbors to the \nnorth and to the south.\n  That has been one of our great attitudes as a nation--that we are an \ninviting nation, and we have always felt strongly that we should have \nreasonably open borders. But in the post-9/11 world--and especially in \nlight of the dramatic number of people who have been coming into our \ncountry illegally--we can no longer tolerate that approach, \nunfortunately. We need to put more aggressive effort into making sure \nthat we know who is coming over the borders and limiting those folks \ncoming over our borders to people who want to come in here legally and \nwho do not want to do us harm.\n  As a result of that, we have undertaken for the last couple of years \nan aggressive effort to significantly increase the number and the \neffort of our Border Patrol agencies--Customs, Border Patrol, Coast \nGuard, and ICE. In fact, over the last 1\\1/2\\ years we have \ndramatically increased funding for all of these different agencies. \nThis chart lists those types of increases in those prior supplementals \nand in the last appropriations bill relative to border security. We \nincreased Border Patrol agents by 1,500. That is a lot. That is an \nincrease of over 10 percent in agents, an increase in detention \nofficers by 650 officers, investigators, and detention beds--again, by \nalmost 10 percent.\n  This is a significant ramping up of the number of, for lack of a \nbetter word, boots on the ground on our border--especially on our \nsouthern border. That is exactly what we needed to do. In fact, as we \nmove into the outyears, the administration--the President \nspecifically--has made a strong commitment to try to continue this \nincrease in our border security.\n  This chart reflects how many agents we intend to add every year so \nthat we can make sure we have the necessary personnel on the border in \norder to make sure that we can limit dramatically--in fact, basically \nstop--illegal immigration into this country, especially along the \nsouthern border.\n  The reason we have added 1,500 agents so far--and we intend to add \nanother 1,500 or 2,000--and the reason we are not adding more every \nyear is because the infrastructure can't handle any more, to be honest \nwith you. We can't train more, and we actually can't find more agents. \nIn many instances, people who qualify--I have forgotten the numbers. I \nthink it is something like 30,000 or 40,000 applications that we have \nto go through in order to get down to 1,500 agents.\n  It is actually hard to become a Border Patrol agent from a percentage \nstandpoint of the number of people applying for the job versus the \nnumber of people who actually end up getting the job. It is harder to \nbecome a Border Patrol agent than it is to get into Harvard. That is \nbecause Border Patrol agents require special skills. They are talented \npeople. And the type of folks we want to draw into this responsibility \nare people who have to have a tremendous amount of ability and \nexpertise, and they are very hard to find. But they are good people, \nand we are adding to them dramatically.\n  We intend to get the Border Patrol up to 20,000 agents and an \nincrease of detention beds of another 10,000. We will be literally able \nto control the southern border. We will no longer have this issue of \npeople coming cross the southern border in waves illegally. Literally, \nwe can stop that. We can do it, and we intend to do it. There is no \nissue about this. We intend to do this. However, we have found in \nramping up the number of Border Patrol agents they have run into a \nfairly significant problem.\n  As an aside, I note that the only reason we have been able to \nincrease these Border Patrol agents so dramatically is because Senator \nCochran, as chairman of the full Appropriations Committee, has allowed \nthe subcommittee, which I chair--the Homeland Security Subcommittee--\nto get special allocations in order to fund those.\n\n  It has really been out of his courtesy, his energy, and the support \nof Senator Frist in this effort that we have been successful in \nbasically increasing these numbers. We are on this path of basically \nbeing able to have enough boots on the ground in the Border Patrol area \nand Customs area and ICE area in order to adequately control the \nborder.\n  What we found going through this process of expanding dramatically \nBorder Patrol agents and Customs and ICE agents is that the \ninfrastructure to support these people isn't there. They are driving \nold cars. For the most part they are flying helicopters which are 20 \nyears over their useful life. Customs is actually flying airplanes that \nare 20, 30, or 40 years over their useful life. In fact, just recently \nthe Customs agency was forced to basically ground all its Customs \nplanes for a brief period of time, and the P-3 fleet, which is 40 years \nold, because these types of cracks developed in their wings. They \nobviously couldn't fly them. So they had to repair all of them--or not \nall but those that had this potential type of stress.\n  We have a very old fleet of aircraft. They are not able to do the \njob.\n  Equally important, in the technology area where we really should be \nmore aggressive and where we really have\n\n[[Page S3477]]\n\nthe capability of having a huge impact along the border through \nsurveillance capabilities--not necessarily require people, but it can \nbe done by electronics such as unmanned aerial vehicles--we only have \none flying the border. Regrettably, that one crashed today. It is \nironic that we have this amendment on the floor. The one UAV we have \nactually crashed. So we don't really have unmanned aerial surveillance. \nThis is in the Arizona area.\n  We think actually we should not only have one but that we should have \na fair number of UAVs on the border. The situation with the purchase \nand buildup of UAVs is that if we are to stay with the present budget \nprojections, we wouldn't have the full compliment that we would need \nfor 4 or 5 years.\n  The amendment I offer today is an amendment to try to address the \ncapital needs of border security in the Customs account, in the Coast \nGuard account, in the Border Patrol account, and in the ICE account--\nthe capital operational needs, not the people on the ground but the \ncapital needs which are deemed to be in an emergency distress \nsituation.\n  Why is this justifiable on this bill? Because this bill is about \ndefense, especially relative to terrorism. Yet fighting the war in Iraq \nis critical to this war on terrorism, and fighting the war in \nAfghanistan is critical to the war on terrorism, but I think equally \nimportant is making sure that our borders are secure.\n  That is as big an issue as we have today in the area of fighting the \nwar on terrorism. We can't be effective on that issue unless we have \nthe resources and the people in order to take care of securing the \nborder. We are moving toward getting the people, and we are bringing \nthem on line as fast as we can in the context of our capability to hire \nnew people. But what we do not have is the resources to be able to \nsupport these folks.\n  This amendment will essentially accomplish that. It will add money \nfor airplanes, and specifically to try to address the issue of flying \nall of these P-3s that are so old. The vast majority of this money will \nbe for aircraft--over $700 million of it. It will add money for \npurchasing more UAVs so we can get these UAVs in the air sooner rather \nthan later.\n  It cost about $30 million to put one of these up, to put the \nelectronics behind it and the command center behind it. It will add \nmoney for purposes of construction so that as we add these new Border \nPatrol agents and these other new agents in these other departments, \nthey will have the physical facilities to be able to handle their day-\nto-day operational needs.\n  It will add cars and SUVs, which are so critical, especially in some \nof these harsh frontier-type environments which they face along the \nborder. It adds helicopters. Almost all the helicopters they are flying \ntoday are 20 years over their useful life. We replace those.\n  In the area of the Coast Guard, it will put in the water the type of \nboats they need in order to chase down the boats that are basically \nbeing used for illegal transportation of people into this country. And \nit will also assist the Coast Guard in advancing their aircraft \ncapability in that area.\n  All of this is critical to putting in place the infrastructure to \nmake sure that as we put the people on the ground, they have the assets \nnecessary in order to effectively control the borders.\n  It is an emergency. These facilities are either not there today, such \nas in the case of UAVs, or they are not working well today, such as in \nthe case of the P-3s, or they simply have not been ungraded to the \npoint of being effective as we move forward with this larger basically \nhuman commitment on the ground, such as in the case of headquarters and \nfacilities for these folks to work out of, helicopters to move them \naround, and automobiles to move them around, or fast craft for the \nCoast Guard to use to get out there and do their job.\n  It needs to be stressed that this amendment is completely paid for. \nIt is paid for within the context of the President's initial \npresentation. The President sent up here initially a $92 billion \nproposal for emergency spending for the purposes of fighting the war on \nterror and addressing the issue of Katrina. Of that $92 billion, \napproximately $69 billion was specifically for fighting the war.\n\n  We have basically reallocated within that $69 billion money to pay \nfor this initiative. I feel very strongly, as do the cosponsors of this \nbill--and I will get to who the cosponsors are of this bill because it \nis important--that this issue be addressed sooner rather than later; \nthat we give our Border Patrol agents the tools they need, Customs the \ntools they need, the Coast Guard the tools they need, in order to \nsecure the border.\n  This will be a major step forward in making sure we accomplish this \ngoal. The goal is to make sure, at least on the southern border, that \nwe know who is coming across the border, that we can control that \nborder, and we do it in the near term rather than waiting for the long \nterm.\n  It is a fully paid-for amendment, keeping the proposal the President \nsent up here, keeping the integrity of that proposal, relative to the \ntop line number which was about $92.5 billion. So this amendment is \ndone in that context. It does not take money from the additions that \ncame out of committee. I happen to believe those additions were \ninappropriate. I am hopeful they will all fall by the wayside except \nfor the avian flu one which is a legitimate emergency, and that when \nthis bill is completed, either in the Senate or in the conference, it \nwill be back to the original number prepared by the President.\n  I suppose I could have gone into the additional funding and taken it \nright out of that, but that would not be a legitimate approach. I am \ntrying to make sure this offset is legitimate to the initial number \nwhich was $92 billion.\n  This amendment is cosponsored by myself, by the majority leader, \nSenator Frist, who has been a tremendous advocate for this type of \ninitiative, and by the senior Senator on the Democratic side, Senator \nByrd, who also happens to be the ranking member of the Committee on \nAppropriations and the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Homeland \nSecurity. I very much appreciate Senator Byrd's cosponsorship and \nobviously greatly appreciate Senator Frist's cosponsorship.\n  Again, I stress none of this would be able to be accomplished had it \nnot been for the efforts which were well beyond what one might have \nexpected from the Senator from Mississippi who a year and a half ago--\nafter the administration regrettably sent up a budget which was \nwoefully short because they allocated incorrectly for homeland \nsecurity--he came forward and gave us an allocation which allowed us to \nput in place the people on the ground, the extra 1,500 border people, \nthe extra beds which we are now trying to give to the backup facilities \nwith what I would call a capital funding initiative for emergency \ncapital needs of the Border Patrol. It was the Senator from \nMississippi, the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, who was \nable to get us on this path to a constructive and appropriate approach \nfor addressing the border issue.\n  I believe the amendment is at the desk and I ask it be reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg], for himself, \n     Mr. Frist, and Mr. Byrd, proposes an amendment numbered 3594.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide, with an offset, emergency funding for border \n                           security efforts)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n                       TITLE __--BORDER SECURITY\n\n       EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS FOR BORDER SECURITY\n\n                    Department of Homeland Security\n\n\n            office of the secretary and executive management\n\n       For an additional amount for the ``Office of the Secretary \n     and Executive Management'' to provide funds for the Office of \n     Policy, $2,000,000: Provided, That the entire amount is \n     solely for a contract with an independent non-Federal entity \n     to conduct a needs assessment for comprehensive border \n     security: Provided further, That the entire amount is \n     designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to section \n     402 of H.

I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Georgia has indicated he \nwishes to speak on the amendment and I defer to him.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I commend the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, \nthe chairman of the Committee on the Budget, on the offering of this \namendment for the emergency supplemental. This is so important.\n  We went through 2 weeks of debate prior to the Easter recess where we \nended up doing nothing on the issue of immigration and illegal \nimmigration. We did nothing because there was a fear in this country \nand there is a fear in this Senate that no matter what we do, if we do \nnot fix the borders first, secure the borders first, there is no way \nwhatever to have true, meaningful immigration reform legislation.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Committee on the Budget, in his \noriginal budget document and now again in this amendment, is proposing \nexactly what the United States of America must do; that is, appropriate \nthe money to fulfill the promises to secure the border so we can gain \ncontrol of our immigration system and return to a system where people \ncome to this country to work and to enjoy new lives and prosperity \nlegally, where our borders are secure and our Nation is more secure.\n  I rise for a moment to point out that this amendment in and of itself \nto this emergency supplemental is, without question, the most \nsignificant component to the issue of illegal immigration and gaining \ncontrol of our borders. I urge all of my colleagues in this Senate, \nwhen this amendment comes to a vote, to vote in favor of it. Only \nthrough appropriating the money and actually spending the money to make \nthe investment, to improve the eyes in the skies in terms of unmanned \naerial vehicles, to improve the boots on the ground, to more Border \nPatrol officers--the only way to do it is not with promises of \nauthorizations but with the commitment of appropriations.\n  I commend the Senator from New Hampshire. I thank the Chair for the \ntime. I urge all Senators to vote in favor of this amendment to secure \nthe borders of the United States of America.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee amendment be agreed to, that the bill as thus amended be \nconsidered as original text for the purpose of further amendment, and \nthat no points of order be waived by this request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The committee amendment in the nature if a substitute was agreed \nto.)\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the cooperation of Senators \nin laying this groundwork for the further consideration and debate of \nthis bill. I particularly appreciate the comments of the Senator from \nNew Hampshire with respect to the situation regarding funding for \nborder security activities, programs, and equipment necessary to help \nguarantee the strict enforcement of our laws and to ensure integrity of \nour borders. His suggestion in this amendment is going to result in a \nmajor step forward in achieving our goals.\n  His comments about our efforts when the Department of Homeland \nSecurity was initially established and funding for various activities \nunder the jurisdiction of that Department are appreciated very much, \nbut his leadership is demonstrating we can do a better job. He has made \nanother suggestion in the offering of this amendment that carries out \nthat past practice of identifying ways to use funds wisely, make \ninvestments in equipment, personnel, and strategies that will lead to a \nhigher level of security for our country.\n  The offset identified in the bill for adding this money takes it away \nfrom\n\n[[Page S3479]]\n\ncertain Defense appropriations activities. We have consulted with the \nchairman of that subcommittee, the distinguished Senator from Alaska, \nMr. Stevens, and this offset can be accommodated, I have been advised, \nand without doing detriment to any military activities funded in this \nbill.\n  Unless there is a Senator who wishes to be heard in opposition or \nrequesting a vote on this amendment, I recommend this amendment be \naccepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I have no objections to the amendment of the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire and would be fully supportive of it.\n  I will speak on another issue for about 5 minutes. I thank my \ncolleague from West Virginia, our great leader, for ceding the time.\n  From one end of New York to the other, all the talk this past week \nhas been on the high price of gasoline, the high price of oil, the high \nprice of all petroleum products. Oil prices went up to $75 a barrel. \nGasoline went up 40 cents in 1 month.\n  This is not only burning a hole in people's wallets and pocketbooks, \nbut it is also putting a real crimp in our economy. In upstate New \nYork, in New York City, we depend on tourism. Fewer people will drive, \nfewer people will come. People are making decisions not to buy that \nextra outfit of clothes for youngsters, not to take the trip to see the \ngrandkids because of the high price of gas and oil.\n  Yet, today, when the President spoke about this issue for the first \ntime, we did not hear what we needed to hear. The President seems to \nthink that gouging is a problem of the corner gas station. It is not. \nIt is a problem of the dwindling number of large behemoth oil \ncompanies. We did not hear from the President the five words we need to \nhear: Get tough with big oil.\n  That is the problem. Of course we have a supply and demand problem. \nWe know that. The big oil companies, faced with no competition, take \nadvantage of every twist and turn. Katrina occurs and the price \nnaturally would have gone up, but it goes up higher, stays high longer, \nand spreads to more areas than need be because the oil companies are \ntaking advantage.\n  Now we have had the changeover to summer fuels. Again, that cuts down \nproduction for a short period of time. But the big oil companies take \nadvantage and keep the price high for too long. Over the last 5 years, \nnever has production been as low as it has been today and stayed so \nlow.\n  The bottom line is simple. We let--and this happened under Republican \nand Democratic Presidents--we let 20 oil companies become only 5. When \nthere are so few, there is no competition. And who pays the price? The \nAmerican consumer and the American economy.\n  The record profits are not an accident or part of free market \ncapitalism. When you have so few energy producers, you are going to be \ntaken advantage of. That is what the average citizen has found.\n  To ask for an FTC investigation, as the President did, about gouging, \nwithout mentioning big oil, does not make sense because it sure as heck \nis not the corner gasoline station.\n  The bottom line is we need to do three things: First, we most \ndefinitely need to conserve much more than we have. The fact that \nChina's miles per gallon standards are higher than ours--and China is \nhardly an environmental country; they are doing it for economic \npurposes--should make us hang our heads in shame. We need a crash \nprogram to find new energy sources.\n  I, for one, am not averse to finding more fossil fuels while we wait \nfor the new energy source to come online. The amount of money the \nPresident has proposed in this budget to do that is paltry.\n  Finally, we should, for the first time, seriously consider breaking \nup the big oil companies. As long as they have a stranglehold on us, we \nare not going to solve this problem. As long as they want to have \nfossil fuels be the dominant way we power ourselves and keep the prices \nhigh as possible and work in cahoots with places such as OPEC, we are \nnot going to solve this problem. When there were 20 competitors, we \nalways faced the fact that 2 or 3 would say I am going to expand market \nshare by keeping the price a little lower. Not anymore. It does not \nhappen.\n  When you ask, why have things gotten so much worse with oil prices \nand gasoline prices, part of it is supply and demand, but part of it is \nwe let the antidote to collusion and gouging--good old-fashioned \nAmerican competition--go by the wayside in the oil industry.\n  At some point I will be offering an amendment that we do a serious \nstudy about whether to and how to break up big oil as was once done \nabout 100 years ago. I don't think there is any other solution that \nmakes sense.\n  From President Bush, we finally heard some talk. But talk is cheap. \nThe price of gasoline is not. We need serious action on conservation, \non new energy sources, and on dealing with big oil if we are going to \nsolve this problem and keep America as strong as possible.\n  I thank my colleague from West Virginia and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the very able Senator.\n  Last month, the Senate began debate on immigration and border \nsecurity legislation, part of which would authorize a whole host of \nitems intended to secure our borders. The legislation would authorize \nthe hiring of additional Border Patrol agents. The legislation would \nauthorize the hiring of additional immigration enforcement agents and \ndetention officers. The legislation would authorize border surveillance \ntechnology and unmanned aerial vehicles.\n  However, the immigration bill is just an authorization bill. Now, if \nwe are serious about border security, we must approve real dollars--\nreal dollars.\n  Together with our colleague, Senator Larry Craig, and with the \nsupport of my Homeland Security Subcommittee chairman, Senator Judd \nGregg, I led the effort in the Senate last year to appropriate hard \ndollars to begin to put real teeth into our border security agenda. We \ndid not merely authorize the hiring of more Border Patrol agents; we \nappropriated hard cash, hard dollars to hire 500 more Border Patrol \nagents as well as more immigration enforcement agents and detention \nofficers. The administration opposed this effort. But those 500 Border \nPatrol agents have been hired. They have been trained. They are now \ndeployed on our borders defending our Nation and making us more secure.\n  As we continue to hire more Border Patrol agents and other \nimmigration enforcement officials, we need to give them the tools they \nneed to do their job. Yes. We need to start paying for those tools now \nso they will be available as more and more Border Patrol agents and \nimmigration enforcement officials are hired and trained.\n  The Border Patrol needs new helicopters because the average age of \nits helicopters is nearly 40 years. The average age of our Customs \nprimary fixed-wing aircraft is 30 years. All of our border enforcement \nofficials, including the newly hired officials, need more vehicles, \nincluding all-terrain vehicles, high-endurance vehicles, and more buses \nto transport and remove illegal aliens. More radios are needed and \nother communications equipment, especially for those individuals \noperating in remote desert areas along our border.\n  Customs and Border Protection has a requirement for 18 unmanned \naerial vehicles or UAVs. The immigration bill authorizes more UAVs, but \nuntil this morning, we had only one UAV operating on our border.\n  At 5:49 a.m. this morning, where were you? I was asleep. I bet you \nwere, too. At 5:49 a.m. this morning, that one UAV crashed--get that, \nnow--it crashed in the Arizona desert. Clearly, one UAV system is not \nadequate.\n  The amendment that Homeland Security Chairman Gregg is offering this \nafternoon provides $1.9 billion--$1.9 billion--in real dollars for our \naging border security infrastructure. As ranking member on the Homeland \nSecurity Subcommittee, I support that funding. It provides $120 million \nfor fencing and tactical border infrastructure, including an additional \n$20 million for the fence being constructed in San Diego. It provides--\nhear me, now--$790 million for new helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, \nUAVs, and the facilities to house and maintain them. It provides $60 \nmillion for replacement vehicles for our border and immigration \npersonnel. It\n\n[[Page S3480]]\n\nprovides over $150 million for communications equipment and sensors and \ncameras and other technology along our border. That ain't all, either. \nThat ain't all. You better believe it. It provides $60 million to \nexpedite the interoperability of the FBI and Homeland Security \nfingerprint databases so that we can have greater confidence about whom \nwe allow to enter this country.\n  We know that as security at our land borders is tightened, illegal \naliens, drug runners, and, yes, terrorists also--terrorists--will turn \nto our waterways for entry into this country, our country.\n  According to Coast Guard statistics, the flow of illegal aliens \nthrough our waterways has more than doubled in the last 10 years, and \nit will continue to grow. It will continue to grow. The administration \nhas concluded that international migration ``will be one of the most \nimportant factors affecting maritime security through the next 10 \nyears'' and that ``a significant commitment of security resources'' is \nnecessary. Yet--could you believe it--the President did not request any \nsupplemental money for the Coast Guard to repair, replace, or enhance \nits ships, its planes, and its helicopters.\n  The Coast Guard secures our waterways, but the Coast Guard is doing \nit with ships and planes that, in some cases, date back to World War \nII. Man, that is a long time. How about that--doing it with ships and \nplanes that, in some cases, date back to World War II? This has \nresulted in a huge gap between operational commitments and operational \ncapabilities. For instance, total Coast Guard patrol boat hours were \nonly 75,000 in 2004, compared to 100,000 hours in 1998. Under the \nadministration's deepwater modernization plan, this gap will not be \nclosed until 2012. Now, I wonder if I will be around that long. This \ngap will not be closed until 2012, at the earliest. How about that? Do \nyou believe it? How about that?\n  Current Coast Guard maritime patrol airplanes can only provide half \nof the hours required to meet operational commitments. At the same \ntime, funding constraints require maintenance on Coast Guard ships and \nplanes to be deferred more and more every year. You may not be around \nthat long, either. No. Who knows? From fiscal years 2001 to 2005, the \nCoast Guard deferred over $121 million in maintenance needed for its \nsurface fleet and $159 million in maintenance needed for its air \nassets.\n  The administration has ignored this problem--ignored this problem--\nfor too long. Recent budget requests by this administration have \nallowed this crisis to fester, and fester. The pending amendment \nprovides $600 million to accelerate the Coast Guard's program to \nmodernize its fleet of ships and planes.\n  This funding will provide for seven additional maritime patrol \nairplanes and three new patrol boats. The funding in the amendment \nwould also allow the Coast Guard to retrofit and arm its helicopters, \nrefurbish existing medium endurance ships, accelerate the production of \nnew medium endurance ships, and provide the technology necessary for \ncommanders to speak to each other through a common operating \nenvironment. This level of funding is consistent with the recently \nfiled Coast Guard authorization conference report.\n  The President often says that we live in a post-9/11 world. Frankly, \nthe Coast Guard's fleet of ships and planes is fit for the last \ncentury. To properly secure the maritime domain, the Coast Guard needs \na fleet fit for this century--the here and now, this century.\n  If we are truly serious--and I hope we are--about securing our \nborders and not just engaging in rhetoric and hot air, then we will put \nreal dollars--real dollars--where the rubber hits the road.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Gregg \namendment, the amendment offered by Senator Judd Gregg, of which I am a \nprincipal cosponsor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I know of no further Senators seeking \nrecognition on this amendment. I, too, support it.\n  I am advised that the leader wants to speak on the amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand we are on the Gregg amendment \nnow, and that will proceed under some fashion or form. I wish to take a \nfew minutes to talk about an amendment I will offer when this amendment \nis dispensed with one way or the other.\n  I wish to announce my intention to offer an amendment to this \nsupplemental bill to ensure that Federal funding appropriated for \nworkforce investment is used to help people in genuine need and not to \npay exorbitant salaries or bonuses to program executives.\n  The amendment I will be offering would address a gross abuse of \nFederal funds that was exposed recently in a State audit of the Central \nIowa Employment and Training Consortium, or CIETC. The audit showed \nthat three executives of this program were paid nearly $1.8 million \nover the past 2\\1/2\\ years. The chief executive officer alone received \nalmost $800,000 in salary and bonuses over that period of time, which \nis nearly 8 times the salary paid to the Governor of Iowa.\n  Obviously, these levels of compensation are exorbitant and \noutrageous. What happened at CIETC is a scandalous abuse of the public \nfunds and of the public trust. It is also scandalous that these \ninflated salaries, technically speaking, may not be illegal under \ncurrent law. The law states that executives in workforce enactment \nprograms will be paid a ``reasonable'' salary. Unfortunately, that is a \nvery elastic definition. There will always be a few bad apples, people \nwho will stretch that definition in ways that are clearly unethical and \nwrong, even if not technically illegal.\n  On that score, CIETC is the only abuse that has come to light so far, \nto my knowledge. It is sort of the one bad apple in a program with an \notherwise outstanding track record. Even one case of abuse is one too \nmany. My amendment will ensure that there is no repetition of this very \nunfortunate incident.\n  To that end, my amendment encourages States to set maximum \ncompensation levels for individuals employed by programs funded under \nthe Workforce Investment Act, taking into account factors such as the \nState's cost of living, compensation levels for comparable State or \nlocal government employees, and the size of a State's job training \nprogram. In cases where a State fails to set a maximum salary, my \namendment would impose a nationwide maximum equal to the Federal \nexecutive level of salary.\n  After the State audit of the Central Iowa Employment and Training \nConsortium was released on March 31, I urged the U.S. Department of \nLabor inspector general to launch a thorough investigation, and that \ninvestigation is now in progress. In addition, Iowa's State government \nis conducting a parallel investigation. I asked both the Federal and \nState investigators to report back to me with recommendations for \npreventing a repeat of the abuse that has occurred at CIETC. However, \nwe can and should act now to fix the glaring problem here, which is the \nabsence of any fixed ceiling on executive compensation in Workforce \nInvestment Act programs.\n  Again, my preference, and the way the amendment is structured, would \nbe for each State to set their compensation level. In cases where \nStates fail to act, my amendment would set a maximum executive salary \nlevel across the Nation at executive level 2, which would be $165,000 a \nyear maximum; that is salary and bonuses, total compensation. As I \nsaid, that is equivalent to the Federal level 2 compensation.\n  Now, why did we pick that? Because that is the same maximum level \nthat was set a few years ago for salaries in the Head Start Program \nwhen we uncovered a similar kind of abuse that was going on in the Head \nStart Program. So that is the level there. There had been several \nisolated incidents of exorbitant salaries in the Head Start Program and \nthey have stopped, thanks to that salary cap.\n  Clearly, $165,000 a year is a very substantial salary, but it might \nbe appropriate in certain circumstances; for example, in the case of an \nexecutive who\n\n[[Page S3481]]\n\nis administering a very large Workforce Investment Act program, or one \nthat is located in a high-cost city or State.\n  We need to establish executive compensation caps in the WIA-funded \nprograms. As a ranking member of the Senate subcommittee that funds job \ntraining, I find it hard to get that funding. I fight hard because I \nknow that quality job training provides a ladder or ramp of opportunity \nto many thousands of hard-pressed Americans, including individuals with \ndisabilities and people who are laid off due to plant closings.\n  Workforce Investment Act programs have proved themselves to be \nenormously effective. They have earned broad bipartisan support.\n  There are four core programs under title I of the act:\n  No. 1, assistance to disadvantaged adults, including people with \ndisabilities, to assist them in entering the workforce;\n  No. 2, assistance to dislocated workers;\n  No. 3, training and placement services for job seekers; and\n  No. 4, assistance to low-income youths under the age of 21, including \ntutoring, dropout prevention, job training, and adult mentoring.\n  Funding for Workforce Investment Act programs is chronically scarce \nand inadequate. On the one hand, we want the discretion to pay salaries \nthat will attract talented administrators, and we need to keep in mind \nlocal cost of living considerations. But it is unacceptable--it is a \nbetrayal of the public trust--when unethical individuals use scarce WIA \nfunds to pay themselves inflated and totally unjustified salaries and \nbonuses. Current law creates an opening that makes this kind of abuse \npossible. But by setting a nationwide compensation cap that would \ninclude not only salaries but bonuses, we can prevent future abuse.\n  That is the purpose of my amendment. I think it is urgently needed. I \nhad a conversation a little bit ago with Senator Ensign, who has been \nworking on the Workforce Investment Act reauthorization bill. My staff \nis working together with his at this time to make sure that what we are \ntrying to do corresponds. Now, you might say maybe we should wait until \nWIA is reauthorized. I hope it is, but the year is clicking by and we \nhave a lot on our plate. It is a short work year. I am not sure if we \nare going to get it done. I might add that in the Job Corps Program \nthere is also a compensation cap, and that is a level 1. Head Start was \nlevel 2. So we thought for Workforce Investment Act job training \nprograms it ought to be probably at about level 2, maximum. Keep in \nmind, States can set it lower than that. It is based upon the size of \nthe job and the cost of living factors and other factors. But they \ncannot go over that. That is what happened in Iowa. Unethical people \nwere paying themselves, in one case, up to $800,000 per annum in \nsalaries and bonuses, which is 8 times what the Governor makes.\n  So I intend to offer this amendment at some point later on when the \nGregg amendment is disposed of in some fashion or another. I hope I can \nhave the support of my colleagues in adopting this salary cap on \nWorkforce Investment Act programs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are on the supplemental appropriations \nbill, I understand. I heard the presentations by the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee and the ranking member earlier today. I would \nbe remiss if I didn't first compliment both of them. This is not an \neasy job. It is difficult putting together legislation such as this and \nbringing it to the floor of the Senate. I compliment Senator Cochran \nand Senator Byrd for their diligent work.\n  I know that others will speak at some length about various pieces of \nthis bill. I know the bill itself is controversial. I know there will \nbe amendments perhaps to strip provisions that are in the bill. I wish \nto speak specifically about legislation that I added, along with \nSenator Burns and others on the Appropriations Committee, dealing with \nagricultural disasters. I wish to do that because I think there is a \nfeeling by some that somehow this extra money that is a part of this \nlegislation to try to respond to agricultural disasters or disasters \nfaced by family farmers is something called pork, as some would put it, \nor is unnecessary, is extraneous, is unworthy. I wish to talk about \nthat.\n  There is not a lot of talk on the floor of the Senate about family \nfarming because I think, with the exception of perhaps one person here, \nwe are not farmers. We don't get up in the morning on the farm. We \ndon't milk cows in the morning. We don't check the cattle at night. We \nare Senators. We work here on the floor of the Senate. We give \nspeeches, go to committee hearings, and travel back and forth on \nweekends, but we don't run a family farm.\n  Family farmers in this country by their very nature are risk takers. \nThey don't know what is ahead. They are going to plant a seed and hope \nit grows. They plant a seed in the spring, and they hope that somehow \nthey will harvest in the fall. They hope that after they plant that \nseed, they will get enough rain but, they hope, not too much rain. They \nhope they don't face a drought. If they get just enough rain, then they \nget a crop. Then they hope when they get the crop that between when the \nrains come and the crops are ready to harvest, they don't have bugs, \nthey don't have grasshoppers, they don't have disease on that crop. And \nthen if, by chance, they are able to harvest that grain, they truck it \nto the elevator, and they are told by the elevator: This is the price. \nThis is what the world price is. This is what the market price is. This \nis what the posted price is. If it is not what you expect, if it is \nbelow what it cost you to produce it, that is tough luck, that is the \nprice.\n  So farmers take all those risks. Because they are substantial, we \nhave decided for many decades in this country to build a bridge across \nthose price valleys, to say to farmers: When times get tough, you are \nnot alone. You are living out there on the land, under the yard light \nall by yourself taking those risks, and we want you to know when times \nget tough, this country wants to keep farmers on the farm. That is why \nwe have a farm program.\n  The farm program used to have a disaster title. It doesn't any \nlonger. I wish it did. I think it should, but it doesn't. We have had \nto do disaster programs now on an ad hoc basis. So we added a disaster \nprovision to this supplemental appropriations bill. We do that because \nwe have had weather-related disasters all around the country. In the \nGulf Coast we had a devastating disaster, perhaps the worst natural \ndisaster in the history of this country, called Hurricane Katrina. I \ncan't pretend to know what it did to the Gulf of Mexico, to the people \nwho live in the Gulf Coast region, in Louisiana and Mississippi and \nelsewhere. But my heart goes out to them, and I have wanted to be a \npart of everything that is done here in the Congress to extend our hand \nto them to say: You are not alone. This country wants to help. This \ncountry insists on helping in a time of need.\n\n  Family farmers in the gulf, I understand, got hit hard as well and, \nin many cases, lost their entire crops, just gone. We should and we \nwill, and with this legislation, we did provide help to them. With this \nlegislation, we say: If you planted a crop or if you couldn't plant a \ncrop and your crop was destroyed, we are going to help you with a \ndisaster plan. Our point was that there are farmers in the gulf who \ndesperately need help, and there are farmers in other parts of the \ncountry who need help as well.\n  I want to show you a couple of pictures. This is of a little town \ncalled Souris, ND. This town called Souris, ND, as you can see, was \ninundated with water in June of 2005, with torrential rains that were \njust devastating, torrential rains that came to this area and several \nother areas of my State. The result was over 1 million acres--over 1 \nmillion acres--couldn't even be planted. Those farmers who had those \nacres, they didn't have a crop. They had a building and a family and a \nyard light, but they had nothing to harvest because they couldn't get \nanything\n\n[[Page S3482]]\n\nplanted. Another nearly 1 million acres was planted and then washed \naway by these torrential rains.\n  Another scene in Souris, ND. I could show many pictures of exactly \nthe same circumstance in parts of my State that suffered devastating \nflooding. These farmers need help. Other farmers in States such as \nIllinois, for example, where they had the third driest year last year \nsince 1895, are facing a drought. They too need help.\n  Last December, I offered a disaster amendment to the Defense \nAppropriations bill when we were in conference. The Senate conferees \naccepted it, and the House conferees rejected it. That is what brought \nus to this position on this emergency supplemental of offering another \ndisaster bill. The support in bringing that package to the floor of the \nSenate by Senator Cochran, who has always been a very strong advocate \nand supporter of family farming and American agriculture, and the \nsupport by Senator Byrd and others when we offered this in the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, was very heartening. It was approved \nunanimously in the Appropriations Committee. So it now exists on the \nfloor of the Senate. It is, in many cases, the distance between being \nable to continue farming and being forced off the land for a good many \nfamilies in this country.\n  We have a fellow in North Dakota named Rodney Nelson who writes. He \nis a farmer and a rancher in Elmont, ND. He wrote a question once. He \nwrote a question on a piece of paper, and then asked this. He said: \nWhat is it worth?\n  He was talking about farming. He said: What is it worth? What is it \nworth for a kid to know how to weld a seam? What is it worth for a kid \nto know how to build a lean-to? What is it worth for a kid to know how \nto drive a tractor, grease a combine? What is it worth for a kid to \nknow how to butcher a hog? What is it worth for a kid to know all of \nthese things? What is it worth for a kid to know how to teach a calf to \nsuck milk from a pail? What is that worth? What is it worth to have a \nkid know how to plum a door? What is that worth?\n  We know what it was worth in the Second World War. This country sent \nmillions of young men, particularly off America's farms, all around the \nworld to fight. They could do anything. They could fix machinery, they \ncould overhaul an engine, they could do anything. They knew how to \nweld, they knew how to build, they could do anything. There is only one \nuniversity in America where they teach that, and that is the American \nfamily farm. It is the only place where you get that education. And the \nquestion is, What is it worth? What is it worth to a country?\n  That is the question I ask when we offer legislation to say that when \nfamily farmers get hit by torrential rains or drought, when family \nfarmers get hit by devastating occurrences of weather that destroy \ntheir crops, destroy their ability to make a living, the question then \nis, Will Congress want to help? Should Congress help?\n\n  The answer, in my judgment, is yes. It is important not just for \nthose families living out on the farm; it is important for the \ncharacter of this country.\n  There was a wonderful author who wrote some remarkable books about \nsmall towns and family farms, and he talked about the seedbed of family \nvalues in America, in American history coming from family farms. And \nthat seedbed of family values that comes from family farms and rolls on \nto small towns and big cities and nurtures and refreshes the character \nof this country is something that is very important to that which we \ncall America. That is why the desire that I and my colleagues, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike, have to offer a disaster piece on this \nemergency supplemental bill is so important. This isn't about words; it \nis about saying to families who were devastated by weather disasters, \nwho are living out on the farm, far from town, under a yard light, \nstruggling to try to make a living, raising a family, to say to them: \nWe understand what you are facing. You are not alone, and we want to \nhelp. That is why this piece is in this legislation.\n  Again, I compliment the chairman and I compliment the ranking member \nfor their work.\n  Let me mention one additional piece. A number of my colleagues today \nhave mentioned the energy issue, particularly with respect to the price \nof gas and oil and the price of fuel. There isn't anybody hurt much \nmore than family farmers with what is happening to the price of energy, \nand the price of gas and diesel, especially. Family farmers are heavy \nusers of fuel. It is the way they plant their crop in the spring, and \nit is the way they take their crop out in the fall, with the heavy use \nof fuel and the heavy use of nitrogen and fertilizer. So there is \nnobody that is hurt more by what is happening with the price of gas and \noil than family farmers. It is devastating to them.\n  This legislation also includes a partial offset with respect to a \npercent of direct payment that farmers receive as a result of what is \nhappening on energy prices. But with respect to that, I want to make \nanother point. We hear these days that what is happening with respect \nto the price of gas and oil is the function of the market. There is no \nmarket price that is a fair market price for oil. First, you have OPEC \nministers that sit around a table from OPEC countries and talk about \nhow much we should produce and how much we expect to get for it. That \nis No. 1. That is called a cartel; that is not a free market.\n  Second, we have oil companies. They used to have one name, now two \nnames, and sometimes three names. Why? Because they all got married, \ndecided to merge; big, blockbuster mega mergers, bigger and stronger, \nwith more raw muscle in the marketplace.\n  Third is the futures market which is supposed to be a market that \nestablishes pricing strategies, but the fact is it has become an orgy \nof speculation. It is an unbelievable orgy of speculation.\n  So you have three things: The OPEC ministers, the bigger oil \ncompanies, bigger by merger, and then a massive amount of speculation \non the futures market. Then we are told: Here is the price of oil, it \nis $73. If you don't like it, tough luck. If you don't like it, you do \nnot understand; it is the free market. That is total baloney. There is \nno free market here. All the pain is on the side of the consumers who \npay 50 bucks or 60 bucks for a tank of gas, and it is like hooking a \nhose right up to the pocketbook of the American people to suck money \nright into the treasury of Exxon. That is what this is about. I am not \nanti-oil. We produce oil in our State. We also are heavy users of \nenergy in our State. But what I am feeling strongly about is not about \nprofits, it is about profiteering.\n  When companies decide they are going to ride this price in a way that \ninjures the American people--and I believe what is happening today does \ndo injury to the American people and is unfair and is not part of the \nso-called capitalistic market system--then I think Congress has a \nresponsibility to act.\n  The President said this morning the Federal Trade Commission should \ndo an investigation. I and a couple of my colleagues wrote a piece of \nlegislation last year that became law as part of the Energy bill that \nrequires the Federal Trade Commission to do the investigation. If the \nPresident had called the FTC, he would have understood that they have \nbeen doing an investigation and will report sometime toward the end of \nMay.\n  I have to confess, however, that I believe the Federal Trade \nCommission has been dead largely from the neck up for some long while. \nI don't expect great results at the end of May, but, nonetheless, they \nare required and will be reporting the results of an investigation \nsometime in mid to late May.\n  I believe there should be investigations. I believe the issue of \nmarket manipulation is real. When you have market manipulation or \npotential price gouging, the way the system works in this country, \nthere ought to be a mechanism by which you investigate it and take \naction if necessary. But I believe in the meantime, when the price of \noil goes where it has gone, and where, with the historical circumstance \nthat in 2004, at $40 a barrel average price, the oil industry had the \nhighest profits in their history; and now with the price of oil at $65 \nand $70 and $72 a barrel, we have profits far in excess of that, \ndespite the fact that the oil companies haven't done anything to \ngenerate those profits. They have just come. I believe those profits \nabove the $40-a-barrel pricetag is a windfall.\n  The oil companies say: Well, we need all those profits because we are \nsinking\n\n[[Page S3483]]\n\nthat back into the ground to look for more energy. If they were doing \nthat, I wouldn't be here talking. But that is not what they are doing. \nThey are buying back their own stock. They are drilling for oil on Wall \nStreet. And, oh, by the way, there is no oil on Wall Street. That \ndoesn't come from me, that comes from Business Week: Drilling for oil \non Wall Street, and that is all about using the capital on Wall Street \nto become bigger through mergers, buying back stock, drilling for oil \non Wall Street, or paying a retired CEO, according to press reports, up \nto $400 million for a retirement package. That is not a golden \nparachute, that is a platinum parachute, one that I have not heard of \nbefore.\n\n  Does that anger the American people? It sure does, and they have a \nright to be angry. Something is wrong with this system.\n  My colleague, Senator Dodd, and I offered an amendment last year that \nwould have imposed a windfall profits rebate on profits above $40 a \nbarrel at which price the oil companies have the largest profits in \ntheir entire history, and then we said this: But if those profits are \nused to sink back into the ground for additional exploration or to \nbuild refineries above ground, if those profits are invested back to \nexpand the supply of energy which will inevitably, hopefully, reduce \nthe price of energy, the price of gasoline, then they will not be \nsubject to the windfall rebate. If the oil companies, in short, are \ndoing what they say they are doing, then they will not be affected. If \nthey are not, if they are buying back their stock and drilling for oil \non Wall Street and paying executives $400 million for a retirement \npackage, then they get hit with a windfall profits rebate. All of the \nmoney will be sent back to the American consumer as a rebate. All of \nit.\n  It is not a revenue-raising measure. It is not designed for the \npurpose of raising money for the Government. It is designed for the \npurpose of righting a wrong: Taking the windfall profits and sending it \nback to the consumers as rebates from whence it came.\n  We expect to offer that again. We didn't succeed last fall. I suppose \nsomeone could make the point that you didn't succeed because it wasn't \na very good idea. I would disagree strongly. I think it is the right \nidea. My hope would be that when we offer it again on this supplemental \nthat we will be successful. One way or another, I think the American \npeople want this Congress and this President to stand for their \ninterests.\n  I know we have larger energy problems, longer term energy problems; I \nunderstand all that. We have price-gouging legislation, and we have all \nkinds of issues that we need to deal with. A good start would have been \nin early 2001 with the meetings for which we still have not received \npublic information. Notwithstanding that, we are where we are today and \nwe need to find our way out of this. The point I was trying to make is \nthat no industry, no group of people are hurt more, in my judgment, \nthan family farmers. All Americans are facing pretty stiff penalties \nwith these prices, but family farmers are devastated by these gas and \ndiesel prices. For that reason, I think it is ever more important for \nus to support the disaster package that has come as a part of this \nemergency legislation brought to the floor of the Senate today.\n  Again, I will speak at another time on the floor about a couple of \nother pieces of this legislation. I am enormously proud to be a part of \nthe Appropriations Committee. I think we have a great committee. We \nwork well together. It is a bipartisan committee. I think the \nlegislation we have brought to the floor, while not perfect, and while \nwe might alter it in one way or another, I don't know, but I think \ngiven the President's request, this Senate is responding.\n  Let me make this final point. One of the responses with this \nlegislation is to replenish the accounts in the Department of Defense \nwith respect to what we are asking our men and women to do in the \nservice of our country. I think each time we have done that, the \nchairman and ranking member and every member of the Appropriations \nCommittee has indicated that when we ask men and women to wear \nAmerica's uniform and go abroad and serve in harm's way, we are going \nto do everything conceivable, everything possible to fund that which is \nnecessary for them to do their job. That is at least a part, a \nsignificant part, of this legislation as well.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, with the concurrence and approval of my \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, I ask unanimous consent to \nset the pending amendment aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3600\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself and Senator Grassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself and Mr. \n     Grassley, proposes an amendment numbered 3600.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To limit the compensation of employees funded through the \n                Employment and Training Administration)\n\n       At the end of page 248, line 22, insert the following:\n       Sec.   . None of the funds appropriated in Public Law 109-\n     149 under the heading Employment and Training Administration \n     shall be used to pay the compensation of an individual, \n     either as direct costs or any proration as an indirect cost, \n     at a rate in excess of Executive Level II. Where Employment \n     and Training Administration funds appropriated in Public Law \n     109-149 are used for compensation of an individual, the total \n     federal funding that may go to compensation of that \n     individual shall not exceed a rate in excess of Executive \n     Level II. States may establish a lower limit of total \n     compensation for those receiving compensation from Employment \n     and Training Administration funding employed in that state, \n     taking into account factors including the relative cost-of-\n     living in the state, the compensation levels for comparable \n     state or local government employees, and the size of the \n     organizations that administer federal programs involved \n     including Employment and Training Administration programs.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this is the amendment about which I spoke \na little while ago on the Senate floor regarding setting a maximum \nnational cap on salaries and bonuses for people employed in the \nWorkforce Investment Act programs across the United States. As I said \nearlier, States can set lower, but this would at least set a maximum \nwhich anyone could be paid in salaries and bonuses in any of those \nprograms.\n  I thank the chairman of the committee for being willing to let me set \naside the amendment and offer this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor and join my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle who have been here for the better \npart of today, discussing the President's comments this morning about \nenergy legislation and about price gouging and about the Department of \nJustice and Federal Trade Commission investigation of energy prices.\n  Many of my colleagues here in this body know how important this is, \nand how important it is that we move forward. Yet I think we have \nactually been investigating for months. The fact remains that we need \nto do a more aggressive job in looking at the issue of price gouging. \nFifty-seven Senators here supported legislation in November of last \nyear, giving the tools to the FTC, the attorneys general, and to \nindividuals who are responsible at the Department of Justice to \ninvestigate price gouging. It is that same legislation that I think \nwould help us in moving forward today, giving consumers confidence as \nthey head into the summer driving season that we are doing everything \nin our power to get serious about a Federal price gouging ban and that \nwe are going to make it a Federal crime.\n  This legislation would create a new ban on price gouging during \nnational energy emergencies, giving the President authority to declare \nthat emergency. It would give the Federal Trade Commission and State \nAGs and the Department of Justice the ability to levy civil and \ncriminal penalties for proven price gouging up to $3 million and 5 \nyears in jail. And, on an ongoing basis,\n\n[[Page S3484]]\n\nit would put in place a new ban on market manipulation and giving false \ninformation to the FTC or the Department of Justice.\n  If you think about it, it is similar to some of the requirements for \nthose involved with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission, and the standards they are \nrequired to meet. This bill also gives the FTC the authority to levy \nfines up to $1 million for each violation of market manipulation, that \nis the market manipulation and false information prohibitions in this \nlegislation.\n  Some people would say $1 million for price gouging doesn't sound like \na lot of penalties, but this is $1 million for each violation of the \nmarket manipulation ban. If you think about it, in the context of the \nmarket manipulation that is being discussed right now in the Enron \ntrials, on an ongoing basis there were probably hundreds of instances \nof market manipulation related to Enron.\n  My colleagues and I offered this price gouging legislation on the \nfloor and it received 57 votes, so I think it is time the Senate comes \ntogether on a very aggressive approach to tell consumers that we will \nprotect them this summer. The reason I say it is imperative we do this \nnow is because for the last 5 years in the West we have suffered \nthrough the aftershocks of the western energy crisis. That is, we have \nsuffered the consequences in my State of the market manipulation that \nEnron engaged in. And five years later, really, we have gotten very \nlittle relief from Federal regulators on that issue.\n  What happens during periods of dysfunctional markets, where there is \na lack of transparency, is that many people are hurt. Businesses are \nhurt, individual consumers are hurt, even school districts are hurt. We \nhad one school district in Washington state that basically had to pay \n$2 million in additional energy costs because of Enron and manipulated \nenergy prices, and thereby ended up not hiring teachers or buying \nbooks.\n  All this leads to a simple and inescapable conclusion. And that is, \nwhen it comes to energy commodities that power our economy, we have to \nbe very aggressive at protecting consumers. We need to do everything in \nour power right now at the Federal level to put us on the right course \nand to fashion legislation that will help protect consumers now.\n  If you think about the President's request, he is saying the \nDepartment of Justice and the FTC should investigate. We do not even \nhave the authorities and remedies in current law that would help in \npursuing these cases and bring these individuals or corporations to \njustice if market manipulation is found. So I encourage my colleagues \nto move quickly on legislation that would give the Federal government \nthe true tools we need to investigate market manipulation and to pursue \nremedies on behalf of consumers. Let's not wait several months into the \nsummer season, as consumers are already being hurt at the pump, to come \nto this conclusion.\n  Since we have already had 57 Senators, a majority of the Senate, \nsupport this legislation, why not pass it out of the Senate and give \nconsumers the confidence that, as they hear the earnings reports from \noil companies in which they are making billions in profits, we are not \ngoing to give them a pat on the back. Instead, we are going to give a \nhelping hand, to protect American consumers at the pump this summer, as \nthese prices are expected to continue to rise.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1735\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Commerce Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of S. 1735 and that the Senate \nproceed to immediate consideration of that legislation, that the \nCantwell amendment which I am sending to the desk be considered and \nagreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, that the \nbill be read three times and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid \non the table, without intervening action or debate.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will consider this. \nThis Senator will continue to be vocal on passing Federal legislation \nto make price gouging a crime. I hope this is legislation that we can \ntake up in the next several days, or at least in the next weeks, so we \nare giving consumers before the Memorial Day recess the confidence that \nwe have serious teeth in Federal legislation to protect them at the \npump.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, by way of explanation, the objection was \nlodged because we are currently considering a supplemental \nappropriations bill on the floor of the Senate to appropriate funds to \nthe Department of Defense, Department of State, and assist gulf states \nin recovery from the devastation cautioned by Hurricanes Rita and \nKatrina. The request posed by the distinguished Senator would have not \nonly required the Senate to turn immediately to the consideration of \nthe bill she is offering, but that it be considered read, the debate \nconcluded, no amendments be in order, and that it be passed and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  It is the judgment of the managers of the bill that the thing to do \nnow in the Senate is to complete action on this supplemental \nappropriations bill. Over $100 billion is being requested, approved by \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee, to fund these needed activities, \nmany of which are designed to protect our Nation's security. So under \nthose circumstances I felt compelled to object.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I will comment generally on the issue \nbefore the Senate, the issue of supplemental emergency spending.\n  Obviously, these last number of years we have had some emergency \nactivities. Whether they be the war on terror or Katrina, they are \nunusual expenditures. From time to time, everyone experiences that, \nwhether in your personal life or in business. After unusual \nexpenditures, we have to make some effort to make up for that special \nspending so we can get back within our budget, we can get back to \nholding down the deficit to do something about the financial situation \ncaused by the unusual expenditures. That is tough. Nevertheless, it \nseems to me that is a principle which is very important.\n  I will react a little bit to what seems to be the case in the Senate. \nWe are talking about emergency spending. The bill we are debating today \nis expected to be about emergency spending. It is important we give a \nlittle thought to what that means and not be inclined to use this \nopportunity to make expenditures that would be very hard to entitle \n``emergency spending.''\n  By definition, emergency spending is a supplement that breaks the \ncaps and authorizes spending we did not account for or do not account \nfor in the budget. Some expenditures are hard to justify. We have the \n``emergency'' regarding the war on terror; however, we have been in \nthis for 4 years. We have known about it for some time. It did not \nhappen instantly. Hurricane recovery ended almost 5 months ago. It is a \nlittle of a stretch to say these are emergencies we did not know about. \nWe did know about them, and we passed our budget resolution without \nincluding them. In that sense, there was no reason to exclude them from \nthe regular budget process.\n  I understand that--hopefully--these are temporary expenditures. I \nwill concede that a supplemental measure may be a more appropriate way \nto add the funds to the baseline budget. That said, the bill that \nresulted from emergency requests is then used to go beyond that scope, \nin some instances. Instead of narrowly controlling spending, this has \nbecome an overall opportunity for projects that have very little, if \nanything, to do with hurricane recovery or the war on terror but \ninstead is used for a number of other items.\n  Mr. President, $92.4 billion in additional spending was requested. We \nare now considering a bill of $106 billion. That is a substantial \nincrease. That is a substantial excess of what could be\n\n[[Page S3485]]\n\ntermed ``emergency spending.'' We ought to give it some consideration.\n  The original request was far from pocket change, of course. It was a \nvery large request in the beginning. Yet we apparently felt compelled \nto add significant new spending regardless of the size of that. Almost \nall spending can have an argument made for it. There is an endless \nneed. We have to follow a procedure that puts some limits on what we \ndo.\n  I don't think there is any Member who does not believe that spending \nhas gotten a bit out of control. If we look at the percentage of \nspending in our budgets over the last several years, it has gone up. \nThere are many factors, including the consideration of the role of the \nFederal Government with respect to the State government and local \ngovernment. Do we just continue to spend as if there is no end? I think \nnot. Certainly, when we take a look at the deficit we have created, it \nhas to be resolved.\n  As I said, I am sure everything included involves a need of some \nkind. However, we have to set priorities. It seems to me we have a \nresponsibility to the taxpayers to try to reconcile these unusual \nexpenses we have had over the last several years and deal with those \nexpenses so we get back to where we are with the budget, get back to \nwhere we are with a programmed movement toward reducing the deficit.\n  I cannot think of anything that is more important than to be fiscally \nresponsible for what we are doing. There is no end to requests for \nspending. I understand there are needs out there. However, I have come \nto the point where we have to take a look at where we are, what we are \ndoing, what our constraints are, what they should be, and begin to \nexercise a little more constraint and responsibility. I am very \nuncomfortable moving entirely over to emergency spending on these big \nitems and then coming up with the request for emergency spending and \nadding another $15 billion, or whatever the amount is, on top of that \nand putting it out there to deal with.\n  I hope we do have discussions on these items. Quite frankly, I hope \nwe can return to where we were so we can at least hold it to that \namount requested for what is called emergency spending. If needed, we \nmay have to offset something. I may offer an amendment that strikes \naltogether the spending earmarks that exceed the President's request. \nWe ought to talk about that in terms not only of each individual \nexpenditure, which we always do, but talk about it in terms of the \npolicy, in terms of the overall direction we are taking and how we are \ngoing to resolve this issue of increasing spending and deficits. It is \ntime to come to the hitching post and take a look at how we are going \nto do that. I look forward to the debate that will take place.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, as I understand the state of play on the \nfloor--I have been at meetings--it is that I should withhold offering \nany amendment now. But I am going to speak to an amendment I will be \noffering during the debate on the emergency supplemental bill.\n  When we last debated budget matters here on the floor, I came to the \nfloor to indicate I was going to attempt to repeal the $2.6 billion in \ntax breaks the Energy bill afforded the oil industry. I want to give my \ncolleagues the context in which I raised it then, raise it now, and \nwill raise it again.\n  It is very easy, I understand--I have been here a long while--to \ndemagog the oil prices and oil industries and big companies, and, when \nthings get tough, to talk about blaming everybody's problems on profits \nof companies.\n  Well, the President, today, spoke, as many of us have up to now, on \nthe need to investigate and determine whether there is any gouging \ngoing on with energy prices today by American oil companies. But that \nis not why I am here at this moment.\n  Senator Specter, the chairman of our Judiciary Committee, held a \nhearing in the Judiciary Committee a couple weeks ago, before the \nEaster recess, where he summoned, if I am not mistaken, the CEOs of the \nsix largest oil companies. It may have been only four oil companies and \none gas company and one energy company. But I think it was six. I will \nget for the Record exactly how many. But he included the chairman of \nthe board of Exxon and other major oil companies. And the issue was \nwhether there was some form of price fixing or gouging going on.\n  It came my turn to question. There had been a good deal of discussion \nabout how much money in annual profits and quarterly profits companies \nwere making. At that time, it was reported that ExxonMobil reported the \nhighest annual profits, $36 billion, of any corporation in American \nhistory. That was not a surprise in the sense that they have had a \ngreat windfall with oil prices.\n  We were at our conference lunch today and someone said: Oil is going \nto go to $4 a gallon. And Senator Boxer, sitting next to me, said: It's \nalready at $4 a gallon in my hometown in California.\n  Well, it is well over $3 a gallon in most of our constituencies, and \nwe are paying that money, in my view, because we lack an energy policy. \nWe lack an energy policy. And the one that has been written has been \nwritten basically to benefit big oil and big gas.\n  Since President Bush took office, oil prices have doubled, with at \nleast a 100-percent increase, and high gas prices, that make us uneasy \nat the pump, have been very good for major oil companies. They are more \nflush than they have been anytime in history. Prices went up during \nKatrina. Six months later, we learned that all three oil companies made \nrecord profits of a total of $111 billion.\n  So why am I on the Senate floor about this? Everybody knows this. I \nam stating the obvious. When it came my turn to question in the \nJudiciary Committee, I asked the question of the chairman of the board \nof Exxon--and Senator Specter had sworn all of the witnesses in, so \nthey were testifying under oath. And I said: May I ask you a question, \nMr. Chairman--the chairman of Exxon. Then I went down the line to the \nrest.\n  I said: Are you aware of the incentives in the Energy bill we passed \nlast year--that I voted against--which provided over $2.6 billion in \nincentives to oil companies in order for them to go out and find, \ninvest, drill, and seek new resources and increase their capability to \ndeliver to the market?\n  He said: Yes, I'm aware of that.\n  I said: Do you need that? In light of a $35 billion profit, is there \nanything you can tell me that would justify us giving the industry, \nincluding you, an extra $2.6 billion in incentives?\n  I might add, so we put this in proportion, for $1.4 billion, we could \nput portals at every single major port in the world that could detect \nwhether a cargo container had a radioactive device and/or a \nradiological device or a nuclear device in that cargo container. But it \nwould cost $1.4 billion. We are not doing that right now, in large part \nbecause of cost.\n  So just to put this in perspective, $2.6 billion to incentivize the \noil industry now, could be used for a whole lot of other things. I am \nsure other of my colleagues would suggest there are other ways to use \nthat money, not the least of which would be to reduce the deficit. But \nthere are other ways to do it. So it was not an idle question. We are \nnot just talking about a little bit of money.\n  I do not think the chairman of ExxonMobil liked my asking the \nquestion. But he indicated that, reluctantly, when I reminded him he--\nwell, in fairness, I probably did not have to remind him he was under \noath--but he indicated, no, he did not think that his company or the \nindustry needed that incentive in light of their economic circumstance.\n  Then I went down the line. And I will submit for the Record the names \nof each of the companies represented and the names of each of the CEOs \nsitting in the witness chair. Every one of them answered the exact same \nway. They all said: No, we do not need this $2.6 billion. We don't need \nany incentive in order to be able to proceed to maximize productivity, \nto maximize discovery, to maximize product now.\n  And then I went back to the chairman of Exxon--I worked my way down\n\n[[Page S3486]]\n\nagain--and I said: Would you support an amendment I would offer \nrepealing that incentive? And even more reluctantly, he said: Yes.\n  I then went and asked that question to all these oil company \nexecutives, and they all said: Yes.\n  So not only do they all acknowledge it is not needed, they all \nindicated, from the best of my recollection--and, again, I will submit \nfor the Record their exact statements--I may be wrong about one or two \nof them, but not on whether they needed it but whether they supported \nthe repeal. I think they all supported it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that relevant testimony before \nthe Judiciary Committee be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n       Senator BIDEN. Well, I mean, that is like saying--anyway, I \n     do not have time because of the 5-minute rule here. Let me \n     ask you, do any of you need, to be able to do what you are \n     doing now, $2.8 billion in incentives the Federal Government \n     is having other taxpayers pay for?\n       Mr. TILLERSON. Well, Senator, we did not lobby for any----\n       Senator BIDEN. I did not say you did. I am just asking, do \n     you need it?\n       Mr. TILLERSON. No.\n       Senator BIDEN. Because you all point out we have to find \n     alternative energy. It seems to me we should take the $2.8 \n     billion that you all are getting, and we should put it into \n     encouraging alternative energy. We should go out and do--\n     right? What do you think?\n       Mr. MULVA. Senator, most of those incentives are directed \n     towards energy in total, which is not necessarily the oil and \n     gas business.\n       Senator BIDEN. Oh, it is mostly you guys.\n       Mr. MULVA. And second, it goes to independent producers, \n     which are primarily the bedrock of most of our----\n       Senator BIDEN. But your company will not be upset if we \n     take those away, right?\n       Mr. MULVA. Correct.\n       Senator BIDEN. None of you will object to us taking away \n     those $2.8 billion of incentives as they apply to you, is \n     that right?\n       I note for the record, everyone is saying okay.\n       Mr. KLESSE. Senator, excuse me.\n       Senator BIDEN. Do it quickly, I only have 24 seconds.\n       Mr. KLESSE. Okay. Valero, we were interested in the \n     incentives to expand refining capacity. That's our business, \n     and we were interested in it.\n       Senator BIDEN. Do you still need it?\n       Mr. KLESSE. Do we need it?\n       Senator BIDEN. Do you need them to expand?\n       Mr. KLESSE. No.\n       Senator BIDEN. Good, okay, that is all I need. So they are \n     all for my bill. I want the record to show no one thought it \n     would be any problem withdrawing it for all of them. Even \n     though I only have 2 seconds left, I yield.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. I have a simple proposition I am going to present to the \nfloor. Although on a supplemental we cannot change tax policy--we all \nknow the blue slip rule, and to use the jargon my friend, the chairman \nof the committee, understands better than anybody here, I cannot, we \ncannot, legislate tax policy on this bill that does not originate in \nthe House, and so on--what I do want to do is, I want to get the Senate \non record with a sense of the Senate that the Senate Finance Committee \nreport back within 90 days a piece of legislation repealing--\nrepealing--this $2.6 billion in incentives provided to the oil \ncompanies.\n  Now, the fact is, there are going to be some on this floor--and I am \nprepared to listen to the argument because when I raised this before, \nsome argued: Well, smaller companies, companies producing less than \n500,000 barrels a year maybe need this incentive, that they may need \nthis incentive to maximize their capability of producing oil. I do not \nthink that is accurate, but I am prepared to listen to that. I am \nprepared to listen to that.\n  But for the time being, I want to put my colleagues on notice that \nthe last group in the world that needs a tax break now is the oil \ncompanies--the absolute last--not because they are bad guys, not \nbecause of anything else. I do not even know if they asked for it.\n  I often say to my friends on this side of the aisle that sometimes \nfolks on my side make a mistake. They don't realize that rich folks are \njust as patriotic as poor folks. When you are handed windfalls, even \npoor folks would not turn their nose up at them. I don't know whether \nthe oil companies insisted on this being in the Energy bill or not, but \nI know they think it is not needed. I do know they say they would \nsupport its repeal. So if there is anything--to use the phrase of a \nformer head of the Intelligence Committee--that has been a slam dunk in \nmy 33 years as a U.S. Senator, this should be it. We can reallocate \n$2.6 billion to needed, worthwhile initiatives and/or reduction of the \nnational debt or deficit, and we can do it with the very recipients of \nthat $2.6 billion saying they don't need it, they don't want it, and \nthey support us taking it away.\n  So I cannot think of anything at all that can justify us keeping in \nthe law a tax break for a group of folks who do not need a tax break at \nall. The American people need a break from these incredibly high \nprices. It seems to me that this is nonpartisan, and it is a no-\nbrainer.\n  In a speech today, the President finally stated that these companies \ndon't need these tax breaks. Senator Wyden has a provision currently in \nconference that would accomplish some of this. Senators Feinstein and \nSununu have tried to remove some unnecessary tax breaks for these \ncompanies as well, which are already rolling in profits. Numerous \ngroups have agreed, from the League of Conservation Voters, National \nEnvironmental Trust, Public Citizens, Taxpayers for Common Sense, and \nthe oil companies--they all agree these incentives are not needed.\n  We are not talking about $100,000 or $500,000 or a half billion \ndollars; we are talking about $2.6 billion. You can do an awful lot \nwith $2.6 billion. So I think we should take the first step in taking \ncontrol of our national energy policy and show the oil companies that \nwe are listening. They say they don't need it. They say they would \nsupport it being repealed. Let's not let them down. Let's, for one \ntime, vote on something that everybody, including the recipients, seems \nto be in agreement with--everybody from the President, to the Senator \nfrom Delaware, to the chairman of the board of ExxonMobil, to the \nNational Environmental Trust.\n  I will withhold doing it now, but I tell the chairman that at some \npoint, I will be here to introduce that amendment, which will call for \nthe sense of the Senate that the tax committee, the Senate Finance \nCommittee, the committee of jurisdiction, report back to the Senate \nwithin 90 days a repeal of these incentives.\n  I thank my colleague from Mississippi for listening and the Chair for \ngiving me the floor. Unless somebody else seeks the floor, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3598\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk and ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Menendez] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3598.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise with a series of colleagues to \noffer an amendment that provides much needed, immediate relief for \nAmerica's drivers. My amendment suspends the 18-cent Federal gas tax \nfor 60 days and makes up for the lost revenue by getting rid of \nunnecessary tax giveaways to oil and gas companies.\n  In 2005, the oil and gas industry made nearly $140 billion in \nprofits. The five largest oil companies made over $106 billion. \nExxonMobil alone made a staggering $36 billion. Put another way, \nExxonMobil's profit alone last year is more than the Federal Government \nspent on unemployment insurance,\n\n[[Page S3487]]\n\nmore than it spent on medical research, and more than it spent on the \nNation's highways. Their CEO just got a $350 million retirement \npackage. That is about $144,000 a day for every day he worked at the \ncompany. These record profits and gilded bonuses are occurring while \nthe American people struggle to get to work, to get home, to pick up \ntheir kids from school, to take them to a soccer match, or to go to a \ndoctor, all because of record gas prices.\n  Last year, the big oil companies hiked gas prices and blamed an act \nof God. But it is crystal clear that the current spike in gas prices is \nat least partly due to an act of greed--greed that has been enabled and \neven encouraged by the administration, greed that has been aided by an \nenergy bill that put the oil and gas companies first and the American \npeople second. The energy companies were already enjoying record \nprofits and massive tax breaks when the President signed an energy bill \nthat gave them billions more in taxpayer subsidies, plus additional \nrelief from having to pay royalties--in essence, the Nation's \ncollective patrimony for the oil and gas they produce in our oceans. \nThe last thing the oil companies need is more handouts. The first thing \nthe American people need is more help.\n  My amendment would give them that help by establishing a 60-day \nholiday on the Federal gas tax. As we head into the summer driving \nseason and its traditionally higher gas prices, we should not be \nburdening American consumers with additional taxes. Temporarily \nsuspending the gas tax will provide $100 million a day in relief to \nAmerica's drivers, America's consumers.\n  But we cannot starve the highway trust fund with the crucial money \nneeded to fix our Nation's roads. My amendment will repeal three \nunnecessary tax breaks currently enjoyed by the oil and gas companies, \nand it will also eliminate royalty relief and other production \nincentives enacted last year as part of the Energy bill.\n  With the price of oil as high as it is and unlikely to drop in the \nforeseeable future, companies don't need more incentive from the \nFederal Government to do their job.\n  This amendment, of course, is only a short-term fix. We need a real \nenergy policy that takes real steps toward ending our dependence on \noil, not the lipservice the President has given this issue before and \ngave again this morning.\n  I listened to what he had to say. The President talks about wanting \nto end our dependence on foreign oil, but instead of starting a \nManhattan-type project to lead us to energy independence, we propose \nbaby steps. The President's budget for fiscal year 2007 barely brought \nrenewable and clean energy research funding back to 2001 levels, and it \ncut energy efficiency programs by 13 percent. In all the President's \nspending, there was only 23 percent of what Congress requested in the \nEnergy Policy Act for energy efficiency programs and only 1 percent for \nrenewable energy programs.\n  The President continues to have the blinders on when it comes to real \nsolutions for our energy problems. He said that consumers should buy \nmore efficient cars, and we agree. But he remains opposed to higher \nfuel efficiency standards. The most recent CAFE standards will improve \nlight truck mileage by only 2.5 miles per gallon. That is simply not \nenough. Passenger cars have the same standards they had in 1985, over \ntwo decades ago. That is not enough.\n  The President also continues to expect the oil companies, out of the \ngoodness of their hearts, to spend substantial amounts of money on \nalternative energy technologies. Some of the more forward-thinking \ncompanies are doing that, but most are not. It is the Government's job \nto invest in these technologies, and the President's budget has shown \nthat he is not serious about doing that.\n  In short, he suggests and he wants the oil companies and the American \nconsumer to do the things he is unwilling to do.\n  Last month, I joined Senator Bingaman and the Senate Democratic \nleader and other Democrats in offering an amendment to fully fund \nenergy efficiency and renewable energy programs in the fiscal year 2007 \nbudget. Unfortunately, it was defeated.\n  Democrats in both Chambers have been at the forefront of proposing \nreal solutions to our energy problems, and we were the first to call \nfor the President to investigate price gouging by oil companies, a call \nhe appears to finally have heeded.\n  This amendment is another idea that this Congress and our President \nneed to adopt. It is about providing immediate relief to overburdened \nconsumers who cannot afford for us to wait much longer. This morning, \nthe President finally appears to be feeling the pressure families have \nbeen feeling at the pump for quite some time.\n  We heard what he had to say. The difference is that he doesn't make a \ncommitment. He says we should phase out all of those tax benefits we \nhave given the oil companies over the next decade, but he doesn't \ncommit it back to America's consumers. Our amendment does that in the \nshort term to give immediate relief to America's consumers while still \nmaintaining our transportation trust funds, the funds necessary to \ncontinue to keep America moving.\n  That is what this amendment is all about. It is about keeping America \nmoving, about keeping America rolling, and about helping the families \nof this country in a very significant way.\n  I think putting $6 billion in the hands and in the pockets of \nAmerica's consumers is ultimately giving them real relief at a critical \ntime. Obviously, putting that amount of money in their pockets at this \ntime as they try to deal with high gas prices will have a ripple effect \nin the economy, as is also realized in the money that will be saved by \nthose who bring to market produce which ends up on our tables, and the \ncosts of the transportation of products to market across a wide scale \nof different consumer needs are going to be affected as well.\n  We see consistently companies adding a fuel surcharge to the cost to \nthe consumer. So this will have a ripple effect in many different ways, \nand it is something we have the wherewithal to do and do now and by \ndoing so sending at the same time, I hope, a message to the world \nmarketplace and certainly to OPEC that we are not hostage to them \nwithout some options of our own.\n  Let's show American families that we are serious about addressing \ntoday's exorbitant gas prices. Let us adopt this amendment to provide \nreal relief now. I urge my colleagues to join me and adopt this \namendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, under rule XVI, I raise a point of order \nagainst the amendment. It is legislation on an appropriations bill.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained, and the \namendment falls.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I tried to seek recognition to speak to \nthe point of order. I simply wish to say this is consistent with what \nthe President proposed this morning, so I believe we should have a vote \non the Senate floor. If we don't have a vote today, we are going to \ncontinue to bring this measure before the body and will eventually get \na vote.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding the \npoints of order which lie against this amendment, the amendment still \nbe in order.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, there is no bigger issue facing the economy \nof the United States of America at the current time than the high cost \nof energy, and it has a ripple effect throughout the entire economy. In \nmy State of South Dakota, we have farmers who are getting ready to go \ninto the fields to plant. Obviously, agriculture is a very energy-\nintensive industry.\n  In my State of South Dakota, we rely heavily upon the travel \nindustry. People come to our State to see the Black Hills and Mount \nRushmore, so we are a very energy-intensive State. We have\n\n[[Page S3488]]\n\nlong distances to cover. So when gas prices come up and shoot through \n$3 a gallon or near that level in my State, it has a profound impact on \nthe economy of our State and on the pocketbooks of all South Dakotans. \nIt is important that this issue be addressed.\n  We have heard a lot of speechifying on the floor of the Senate today \nand a lot of news conferences held in front of gasoline pumps across \nthis country, everybody attacking and pointing fingers and playing the \nblame game as gas prices have steadily crept upward.\n  I will be the first one in this Chamber to say that if, in fact, the \noil companies have profiteered at the expense of hard-working consumers \nin this country, that they should be prosecuted to the full letter of \nthe law. If there is manipulation, collusion, price fixing, or any \nother form of anticompetitive behavior for which we have laws in this \ncountry, then they need to be held accountable under those laws.\n  Furthermore, I also happen to believe that if, in fact, they benefit \nfrom policies that are put in place, economic policies from which they \ncan benefit, whether that be a tax incentive in the Tax Code today, \nthat they have an accountability to us as Members of Congress to \nexplain why, for example, they can pay out $400 million to a retiring \nexecutive or CEO.\n  It seems to me at least that there are some very hard questions that \nneed to be asked and some very serious answers that need to be given by \nfolks in that industry. They need to be accountable to the American \npublic. As I said before, I believe we need that accountability. I \nbelieve we need to look at those policies in place today from which \nthose companies benefit. If, in fact, they are making such enormous \nprofits, then perhaps they don't need the support and the tax \nincentives that are given to them by the American taxpayers, by \nCongress. So I am not going to in any way defend what are the \npractices, I believe, of many of the big oil companies in this country.\n  Having said that, though, there is also a lot of hand wringing going \non and self-righteous politicking going on right now about the high \ncost of energy and attempts again to cast aspersions, cast blame, try \nand blame the President, blame the Republicans, and all these efforts \nthat are made by people who would rather have a political issue than \nthey would have a solution.\n  I have to say it seems to me that at the heart of this very issue is \nalso what I would call a decade of obstructionism. We have tried for \nmany years--I served for three terms as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives--to get legislation through that would allow us to \nlessen our dependence upon foreign sources of energy, to add to the \nsupplies we have in this country, to allow us to take advantage of the \nrich resources we have in America. Every time we have tried to do that \nsince I have been here as a member of the majority party in the House \nof Representatives and now in the U.S. Senate, we have been blocked. We \nhave been rebuffed by the folks on the other side of the aisle. In many \ncases, those have been tactics employed which haven't reflected the \nmajority in the Senate. There have been steps taken to create a \nsupermajority, a filibuster threshold over which we would have to get \nin order to get some of these policies put in place.\n\n  I go back to 1995 when, at that time, the Republicans had just taken \ncontrol of the Congress and they passed in the budget that year \nlegislation that would authorize exploration on the North Slope of \nAlaska. It passed the House and Senate, went to President Clinton's \ndesk, and it was vetoed. We hear this still being debated in the Senate \ntoday. We get up and talk about the importance of taking advantage of \nthe resources we have here in the United States of America, including \nthe North Slope of Alaska; we hear the Democrats on the other side get \nup and say: Well, you can't do that. It could take 10 years for us to \nget that production on line. Well, it is 10 years later. That was 1995. \nIt is now 2006, and we could have a million more barrels of oil in the \npipeline today addressing what is a very serious supply problem in this \ncountry, had that bill been signed into law back in 1995.\n  We have tried repeatedly since that time, a number of times as a \nMember of the House of Representatives, where we voted. We voted to \nallow for that development to occur, for that exploration to occur, and \nperhaps eventually production to occur, and, of course, again it was \nblocked and stopped.\n  Most recently in December, in the Senate, before we adjourned for the \nChristmas holiday, we had a vote on whether we were going to do \nsomething to help ourselves in the area of energy independence and to \ndevelop that rich resource we have, somewhere between 6 billion and 16 \nbillion barrels of oil on the North Slope of Alaska, or about a million \nbarrels a day. We get about a million and a half barrels a day from \nSaudi Arabia. Can you imagine how it would lessen the supply problem if \nwe were able to bring that energy on line in this country? Yet again it \nwas filibustered. We had 57, 58 votes in the Senate--a clear majority \nfor doing something about our supply problem. Yet the other side again \nblocked and now wants to blame, instead of doing what we ought to have \nbeen doing all along, and that is working in a bipartisan way to \naddress what is a very serious crisis in America.\n  I remember when I was growing up back in the 1970s, and people who \nwere around at that time also remember the gas lines, remember the talk \nat the time about we are way too dependent upon foreign energy; we have \nto do something to lessen our dependence on foreign sources of energy. \nAt that time, we were 50 to 55 percent dependent upon foreign sources \nof energy. Here we are some 30 years later, and 60 percent of our \nsupply comes from outside the United States. We have had opportunities \nthroughout the course of the time that I have been here to do something \nabout that. Every time I have voted to develop, explore, and to bring \non line many of those resources which are available to us for \ndevelopment, it has been blocked and stopped by those on the other side \nwho insist on having a political issue rather than a solution.\n  Just because I was interested in this debate, as a Member of the \nHouse--and as I said, I voted on energy exploration on the North Slope \nof Alaska, what we know as ANWR--I went up there last year because I \nwanted to find out what the debate was all about because in trying to \nunderstand these issues, when you come down here on the floor of the \nSenate, I believe it is important that you have a full perspective and \ninsight into the arguments that are made by those on the other side. So \nwe went to some of the development sites. We went to Prudhoe Bay, we \nwent to the Alpine site, we went to Kabarak, and we went to the section \n1002 area, which is the area which was proposed for development by an \nagreement that occurred way back in 1980, I believe between Senator \nStevens and someone on the other side of the aisle at that time. We \nlooked at that area. We took one of those little planes, and we flew \nout there and walked around in that particular area, and we looked at \nthe technology that is available today at some of those sites and how \nthey, with a very minimal footprint on the surface, are able to access \nenormous amounts of energy below the surface in an environmentally \nsound way. They use ice roads, and then during the summer months when \neverything melts, the roads disappear; they are gone.\n  It is a remarkable thing for anybody who wants to see it. You walk \naway from that saying: Hold on just a minute here. I don't understand \nwhat the big issue is. We have an opportunity to do something about \nwhat are the most pressing economic issues and one of the most pressing \nnational security issues facing our country, and that is energy and \nenergy independence, energy security, and we have this vast resource up \nthere and we can't get at it because it is consistently filibustered \nhere in the Senate even though there is majority support, 57, 58 votes \nin favor of that. Yet after it passed the House and it went through the \nSenate, it got to conference and it came back, and we had an \nopportunity to do something that would allow us finally--finally--to \nexplore and hopefully bring on line that incredible resource on the \nNorth Slope of Alaska.\n  For those who are concerned about the impact on the environment, you \nshould know that the caribou are doing fine. Caribou numbers have \nactually increased, and they have dramatically over the past 30 years \nin that area.\n  My point very simply is this: We as a nation have to do something to \nhelp ourselves. We cannot continue to be\n\n[[Page S3489]]\n\nheld over a barrel by the sheiks and the mullahs in the Middle East or \nby Venezuela or any of the other countries from which we derive the \nmajority or the vast majority of our energy supplies in this country. \nAmerica needs to be energy independent.\n\n  I believe that consists of many things. I have been a big proponent \nof renewable fuels. As a Member of the House and now as a Member of the \nSenate, I was delighted that we were able last summer in the Energy \nbill to include in there a renewable fuel standard for the first time. \nAs a matter of policy in this country, we have said we are going to \nguarantee a market for renewable fuels. Frankly, why would we not, when \nwe have all of these things which we raise and grow, take a bushel of \ncorn and be able to convert it into 2\\1/2\\ gallons of fuel we can use \nto run our economy here in this country, do that? It makes so much \nsense, and it lessens our dependence upon our addiction to oil, which, \nas the President said in his State of the Union Address, and I give him \ngreat credit for that, is something we need to do, a direction in which \nwe need to move. Renewable energy is an important component of that. I \nbelieve there are a number of things that we need to be doing in the \narea of conservation as well, but I want to see more partnerships \nbetween manufacturers and retailers and producers of ethanol and \nbiodiesel and other renewable energy so that we can begin to get away \nfrom that enormous amount of dependence we have on oil.\n  Even today, we hope to produce in the very near future 7.5 billion \ngallons of ethanol, which is what is called for in the renewable fuel \nstandard. I think we are going to have to increase that dramatically \nbecause we are going to be there very soon. We are already at the 4.5 \nbillion gallon level, on our way very quickly to 7.5 billion gallons, \nbecause we have a desperate need in this country, and production is \ncoming on line more and more all the time. But even at that level, we \nuse about 140 billion gallons of gasoline a year in this country. So \nethanol represents about 3 percent of what the total demand or total \nconsumption in America is for energy today. So it is important in this \nwhole debate that we continue to develop those other sources, those \ntraditional energy sources until such time as we can get where we begin \nthat transition toward renewable energy.\n  But in the short term, we have a need. We have a need for oil \nresources. As I said, in places such as Alaska, we have an opportunity \nto do some things offshore in this country. We have a lot of offshore \nresources and reserves that are available, not only of oil but of \nnatural gas, which is also a desperate situation which many people in \nmy part of the country, in farm country, depend upon because that is \nwhat fertilizer is made from.\n  Every time we have had an opportunity to do something to address the \nlong-term issue of supply in this country, we have met the politics of \nobstruction. I mentioned earlier going back to 1995 when Congress \npassed legislation that would authorize exploration of energy in \nAlaska. But if you look more recently than that, going back even to \n2003--when the President took office in 2001, they created an energy \ntask force, they made recommendations, they came up with an energy \nplan, and there was an energy bill that was debated up here on Capitol \nHill, several different permutations of that, and ultimately one \npassed. In 2003, an energy bill passed. It passed the House and Senate, \nand it went into conference. The conference came out with a report that \npassed overwhelmingly in the House, came back to the Senate in November \nof 2003, and it was filibustered.\n  It failed by two votes. Fifty-eight votes to shut off a filibuster \nhere in the Senate that would have gotten us an energy bill 2 years \nsooner, gotten us down the path toward a renewable fuel standard 2 \nyears sooner, and addressed some of those supply issues 2 years sooner. \nBut no, it was blocked. It was delayed, it was filibustered, and it was \nkilled in 2003 by that Congress.\n  So to have people getting up now and many of my colleagues on the \nother side going out and holding news conferences and getting up on the \nfloor of the Senate and beating their chests and making all these self-\nrighteous speeches, to me it seems to be the very essence of hypocrisy, \nif you look at a decade-long practice of obstructionism when it comes \nto putting in place sound energy policies that would have lessened our \ndependence upon foreign sources of energy and put us much closer on a \npath toward energy independence.\n  So as we get into this, I have a piece of legislation which I have \nintroduced along with Senator Obama from Illinois that would provide \nadditional incentives for fuel retailers to begin to install pumps that \nwould pump E-85, to build the demand and continue to create this \nmarket, this opportunity to work on the production side. On the retail \nside, again, we need to be working with the manufacturers when it comes \nto these flex fuel-type vehicles. I will continue to press forward on \nrenewable fuels. That legislation--it is a bipartisan bill--and I hope \nit is something we can move through this Chamber, along with other \ntypes of initiatives, including additional supply initiatives.\n  Frankly, there is one other issue which I should also mention \nbecause, there again, we ran into basically party-line resistance in \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee. We tried to pass through \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee earlier this year \nlegislation that would expand our refinery capacity. We have not built \na refinery since 1976. We had Katrina wipe out much of our refinery \ncapacity in the gulf and, as a consequence, we are having a difficult \ntime not only with the supply, but we are also having a difficult time \nwith refineries. We have what, in my view, we ought to be doing, and \nthat is waiving a lot of these requirements on these boutique fuels \nbecause right now, at this particular time of year, the refineries have \nto go through this exercise of remixing and coming up with all of these \ndifferent types of blends. It seems to me that at a minimum, we ought \nto be able to at least give them some temporary relief from that, but \nwe also need to be building more refineries in this country.\n  We voted on that in the Environment and Public Works Committee, and \nit went down for all intents and purposes on a party-line vote. There \nwas one Republican who voted with the Democrats. The fact is, that is \ntrue. But we had a wall of opposition from the Democrats on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee to even reporting the bill to \nthe floor so that we could engage in a debate so that all Senators have \nan opportunity to participate in that debate about whether we ought to \ndo something about the issue of refinery capacity in this country.\n  So my point again very simply is this: Since I have been here, in \nthree terms in the House and during my time in the Senate, I focused on \nenergy because it is important to my State, as I said earlier, and \nbecause I am a big proponent of increased use of renewable fuels. But \nevery time we have had a chance to vote, whether it is ANWR, whether it \nis offshore production, whether it is refineries, whether it is the \nEnergy bill in 2003, we run into the same arguments. And you will hear \nthe same arguments that we heard in December and that we heard back in \n1995 when we debated at that time the authorization of exploration in \nAlaska, and that is: It will take 10 years. Well, like I said, 10 years \nago, if President Clinton had signed that bill into law, that 10 years \nwould now be up. But the point is, we can't afford to wait another \ndecade. We can't allow another decade of obstructionism to prevent us \nfrom doing what we ought to be doing to make America's energy future \nmore secure. It is important that we focus as Senators, and I hope in a \nbipartisan way. But it doesn't help the issue to have all of this \npartisan hand-wringing and politicking. I know it is a year divisible \nby two. Whenever it is a year divisible by two, the rhetoric escalates \na lot, and when everything gets said and done, a lot more gets said \nthan done.\n  The reality is, we have an issue on which the American people want \naction. They should have had action 10 years ago. They should have had \naction 6 years ago. They should have had action 4 years ago. They \nshould have had action in November of 2003, when that particular Energy \nbill was filibustered by our colleagues on the other side. But it is \nnever too late to do the right thing.\n  We have an opportunity to do the right thing for the American people. \nIf\n\n[[Page S3490]]\n\nthat consists of, as I said earlier, taking on the oil companies if \nthere is any evidence whatsoever that there has been collusion or price \nfixing or gouging or any form of anticompetitive activity, then let's \nput the screws to them. Let's prosecute them to the full letter of the \nlaw. But let's also do something we should have done a long time ago, \nand that is begin to develop the resources that we have in this country \nand do something to help ourselves so 30 years from now, when my kids \nare my age, they are not saying the same thing that I am saying today, \nand that is that we have wasted 30 years and we are still as dependent \non foreign sources of energy.\n  Frankly, I don't think we can wait that long because I do believe \nenergy security is a matter of national security, and there is nothing \nthat has a more profound impact and effect on the pocketbooks of \nworking Americans. It is important that we do something about this. It \nis time to end the obstruction. It is time to end the block-and-blame \ngame. It is time to get down to the business of taking care of the \nneeds of the American people that they expect us to address.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, for the information of Senators who may \nbe interested in knowing what the plan of action is for the remainder \nof today, we have pending before the Senate an amendment offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, relating to border \nsecurity, to strengthen, tighten up the provisions of this bill with \nrespect to adequacy of funding to protect the security of our borders.\n  It is our understanding that the other side would like to have an \namendment also offered tonight, with debate on it, as much as whoever \nwants to discuss it would like to engage in, and then enter into some \nkind of agreement on having votes, back-to-back votes or close together \ntomorrow, on the two amendments, the Gregg amendment and whatever \namendment is offered on the other side.\n  That is the situation as I understand it. I am happy to see the \ndistinguished Democratic leader on the floor. He may be able to add to \nthat or clarify the intentions with respect to another amendment \ntonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the manager of the bill is absolutely right. \nWe have an amendment that has been laid down by the Senator from New \nHampshire. We are going to lay one down. Rather than do a second-\ndegree, we have talked to the floor staff, and it would be more \nappropriate to have two side by side.\n  Subject to the approval of your leader, we would have those two votes \naround noon tomorrow. We will debate. Anybody who wants to debate it \ntonight can do so and then we will come in in the morning and divide up \nwhat time is left over after morning business and have that vote. As I \nindicated, I only briefly talked to the majority leader about this. We \nhad a meeting down at the White House, so I didn't talk to him at any \ngreat length, but this sounds like a fair way to go forward and move \nthis bill along a little bit.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Democratic leader.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3604\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk. I call that \nup.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am going to briefly talk about this \namendment tonight and then we will have more time in the morning if \nnecessary.\n  I had the opportunity 3 weeks ago tomorrow to go to the border, the \nMexico-California border. We flew. We could see the Arizona border. I \nspent the day there and certainly got an understanding of some of the \nproblems that these valiant Border Patrol agents face.\n  San Ysidro, CA, is one of the entry points. It is hard to visualize \nthis, but think in your mind's eye of 24 lanes of traffic coming into \nAmerica from Mexico. That is what is at San Ysidro, 24 lanes of \ntraffic, one way; 24 lanes of traffic, 7 days a week, year round.\n  While I was there, the agent showed me some of the things they had \nbeen able to catch: a little utility truck, and hidden in it was \nnarcotics in a secret compartment; a car, a compact car, and they had \nbuilt a canvas drop in it under the back seat. Eight people were \nstuffed into that in the compact car, underneath so you couldn't see \nthem, but the dogs and agents were able to pick them up.\n  These were only two examples. All day long this goes on. I talked to \nthe agents about the walls that have been put up. These people, called \ncoyotes--call them whatever you want--these people, who are criminals, \nwho take money from Mexicans to bring them into the United States, sit \nup on one fence, which is a metal fence. On the other side there is a \nchain-link fence. If they see a Border Patrol agent, they have these \npowerful slingshots that have hospitalized our agents.\n  The Border Patrol agents say they can handle most of the traffic of \npeople coming across the border. But what they need is protection \nagainst automobiles coming across the border. That is what they need \nhelp with. In a few places they have big metal things, about this big, \nthat are stacked side by side to keep automobiles from coming across \nthe border.\n  The only reason I paint this very meager picture of some of the \nthings I saw is, as we speak, there is an emergency on the southern \nborder. I am happy for the $2 billion. I am happy to put it into border \nsecurity. That is important. I have talked about comprehensive \nimmigration reform, and I have done it often and I always start with: \nLet's protect our borders. Then we move into the guest worker program, \nthen we move into the path of legalization, and then we move into what \nwe are going to do to make sure employer sanctions are meaningful.\n  I am in favor of the $2 billion, but I am not in favor of the across-\nthe-board cut that is in the underlying Gregg amendment. That is not \nright. It is not right because it is robbing Peter to pay Paul. The \namendment I have offered will secure the border in the same way as the \nGregg amendment. It is the same amount of money. The difference is, I \nsay, on an emergency appropriations bill, which we have before us--if \nthere were ever an emergency, this is it--the Gregg amendment makes no \nsense. I have the greatest respect for Senator Gregg. I think he is one \nof the most principled people with whom I have ever dealt. But I say \nthis amendment makes no sense. It robs Peter to pay Paul at the end of \nthe day by taking vital resources away from who? Our military. And it \nfails to make us more safe. It makes us less safe.\n  There are lots and lots of examples of what an across-the-board cut \nwould do. In order to pay for border security, it cuts the military \npersonnel account, which includes cuts to pay and benefits for our \nActive Duty, our Guard and Reserve serving now in Iraq, Afghanistan, \nand elsewhere around the world. Do we want to have an across-the-board \ncut there? I don't think so. I hope not.\n  The underlying amendment, the Gregg amendment, makes cuts to \noperations and maintenance which provide for the body armor, for \nexample, and the other day-to-day needs of our troops fighting in Iraq \nand Afghanistan.\n  The underlying Gregg amendment makes cuts to the Iraqi security \nforces training. I had the good fortune to be invited to the White \nHouse today, and on the big TV screen there in the White House we had \nthe Ambassador to Iraq from the United States and General Casey telling \nus what is going on in Iraq.\n  One of the things General Casey and Khalilzad talked about was what \nis happening with the training of Iraqi forces. We are going to cut \nthis money down as a result of border security? I don't think that is a \ngood idea.\n  If we are going to succeed in Iraq, and that is very questionable at \nthis time, but if we are going to succeed in Iraq, and I hope we do, \none of the key areas of concern is the Iraqi security forces. If we are \ngoing to bring our troops home, we have to bring them up, and this \namendment, the Gregg amendment, cuts those moneys.\n  The Gregg amendment makes cuts to the Joint Improvised Explosive \nDevice Defeat Fund, which aids our troops in eradicating the deadly \nIEDs they confront daily. The reason that is so vitally important is \nwhen the war started, basically what the terrorists used were garage \ndoor openers. That is what they used, a garage door opener, basically. \nA vehicle comes by, they planted a bomb, they push that down, it blows \nup.\n  We have worked on ways to change that. But the Iraqis have also \nworked to stay ahead of us. That is why we still have these bombs going \noff. It is because we have to continually work with money from the \nImprovised Explosive Device Defeat Fund to have scientists and other \ntechnicians decide how we can defeat these explosive devices. The Gregg \namendment cuts these moneys.\n  The Gregg amendment makes cuts to the Defense Health Program which \nprovides medical assistance to our troops on the battlefield. One good \nthing about this war--and there are not a lot of good things about this \nwar--is the percentage of the soldiers who are wounded who end up dying \nis very much less than in any other war because we have such great \nmedical attention on the battlefield and we have protective equipment \nfor these soldiers.\n  So they are not dying at the rate they did in the first Iraqi war, \ncertainly not in Korea, and certainly not in the Second World War and \ncertainly not in Vietnam. But the Gregg amendment makes cuts to this \ndefense health program which provides medical assistance to our troops \nwho are in the battlefield, not after they have come home. And really, \nthe senseless nature of this amendment is that it makes cuts to the \nDeath Gratuity Fund which assists families of fallen soldiers.\n  Also, I think almost every Senator has been to Walter Reed or \nBethesda. You will see parents there with their wounded sons and \ndaughters, husbands and wives. There is a fund that helps bring these \npeople here. A lot of it is done through other charitable \norganizations, but we don't want to cut the Defense Health Program. And \nwe don't want to cut the Death Gratuity Fund.\n  The Gregg amendment forces us to take from our troops to fortify our \nborders. That is a false choice. We do not have to choose between a \nsecure border and a secure military, especially at a time when we are \nin a war. We can secure our borders and support our military.\n  As I have indicated, I am 100 percent for securing our borders. But \nwe can find a better way to do it than cutting necessary resources from \nthe men and women who keep us safe. This is an emergency appropriations \nbill. If there were ever an emergency, it is our border with Mexico and \nat times the northern border.\n  So I hope we can go forward with these resources but, as with the \nother things in this bill, this is an emergency. Our amendment calls \nfor spending the $2 billion, but it would fall in line with the other \nmatters in this bill. It would be an emergency.\n  I hope Senators will vote for this, what we call a side-by-side that \nI have offered. This is the right way to do this. I don't think anyone \nshould have on his or her conscience voting an across-the-board cut on \na defense bill. This is basically a defense bill, this supplemental. We \nshould not have this on our conscience. Border security is an emergency \nwithout any question in my mind. I hope Senators will agree.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I would like to make a few comments on what \nis on the forefront of most people's minds today, especially if they \nhave been in their automobiles or their trucks or driving their \ntractors, and that is the rising oil prices. As the weather heats up \nand families plan their summer vacations, many are getting increasingly \nfrustrated by the rising price of gas. Every day it seems gas prices \nare ticking up, and some areas of the country gas prices have already \ntopped a whopping $3 per gallon. Experts tell us that these already \nhigh prices only threaten to get worse as we head into the summer \ndriving months.\n  While we understand global supply and demand pressures around the \nworld, especially China and India, are the main culprits, it really \ndoesn't\n\n[[Page S3493]]\n\nseem fair to the average American consumer that they are having to pay \nso much at the pump each time they fill up their vehicle. It simply \ncan't go on indefinitely. We can't continue to rely on foreign oil that \ncomes from governments that are unstable or are directly hostile to \nAmerica's interests. Just this week, Iran's hard-line President \nthreatened that ``the global oil price has not reached its real value \nyet.''\n  We need to find short- and long-term solutions to America's dangerous \ndependence on these foreign sources of oil. We need to find ways to \nstrengthen and diversify our own domestic supply.\n  On Monday, Speaker Hastert and I sent the President a letter. In that \nletter we urged an effort to direct the Federal Trade Commission, as \nwell as the Department of Justice, to examine, investigate possible \nprice gouging and other anticompetitive practices that may be unfairly \ndriving up gas prices. Price gouging, price fixing, and other forms of \ncollusion are wrong. They are immoral. They should be prosecuted to the \nfull extent of Federal and State law. I am pleased that the President \nannounced yesterday that the investigations we asked for are underway. \nI also urge consumers to report any suspicious activity directly to the \nDepartment of Energy's Web site so that we can track down any \nwrongdoers and bring them to justice.\n  Meanwhile, Senator Stevens and others have developed an anti-price-\ngouging bill in response to my request last fall following the hearing \nwith the CEOs of the major oil companies. I anticipate that the Senate \nwill take up the Stevens proposal. In addition, the President has \nwisely called for suspending additions to the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve this summer. We have enough oil in the reserve to get through \nany major short-term supply disruptions. While it is not a lot, this \nbrief halt will leave a little more oil on the market and, as the \nPresident said, every little bit helps.\n  These are important first steps in bringing relief to millions of \nAmericans being pummeled with high prices at the pump. But there is \nmuch more to be done. We need to think long term and strategically on \nhow to move the supply and demand equation in our favor by breaking \nAmerica's addiction to oil and diversifying our energy supply. Instead \nof looking for scapegoats, as the other side is doing now, we need to \nlook for solutions and provide long-term security for the American \npeople.\n  Last summer, after a decade of partisan obstruction, Congress passed \na comprehensive energy bill. We doubled the amount of ethanol and \nbiodiesel in our gasoline. By 2012, this should reduce oil consumption \nby 80,000 barrels a day. We passed a hybrid car tax credit of up to \n$3,400 per vehicle. There is more that we can do to encourage consumers \nto purchase fuel-efficient hybrid cars, and we will pursue those \noptions vigorously. The Energy bill also allocated significant funding \nfor research and development of hydrogen fuel cells. If just 20 percent \nor one out of five cars used fuel cell technology, we would cut oil \nimports by 1.5 million barrels a day.\n  We need to build on these initiatives and encourage American \nconsumers, the producers, and entrepreneurs to think beyond oil. I \nbelieve, as does the President, that America's future lies with \ntechnology that will allow Americans to use environmentally safe and \ndiverse energy sources. Instead of driving into a gas station, we will \npull up to a fueling station where we might plug in or fill up with \nethanol, electricity, or hydrogen or some combination that technology \nhas made possible.\n  Political instability in Venezuela won't send our energy prices \nsoaring. Foreign dictators won't be able to use oil to hold the world's \npolicies hostage. America will be safer and more secure with American \nenergy coming from American sources.\n\n  The Energy bill we passed last year is a good start. We can \naccomplish a whole lot more if we can get bipartisan cooperation. \nUnfortunately, when it comes to energy security, bipartisanship has \nbeen hard to come by, and that makes solving the energy problem even \nmore difficult.\n  Developing new energy sources takes time and research. For example, \nhad President Clinton not vetoed ANWR a decade ago, the reserve would \nbe producing a million barrels of oil a day right now. That is about \nthree-fourths of what we currently import from Saudi Arabia.\n  I hope to be able to work with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to find fair and effective ways to strengthen and diversify \nAmerica's energy supply.\n  Challenge, action, solutions--that is what the American people sent \nus here to do. By staying focused on our long- term goals, we can keep \nAmerica moving forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/25/senate-section/article/S3493-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3493-S3494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            METHAMPHETAMINE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the growing problem of meth has been \nparticularly personal to me. As I have traveled across my home State of \nTennessee, I have heard the heart-wrenching stories of how meth is \ntearing families apart and about the unique challenges that meth abuse \npresents to law enforcement and social services.\n  I would like to commend Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Baucus \nof the Finance Committee for holding a hearing earlier today to discuss \nthe social and economic impact of methamphetamine on our Nation's child \nwelfare system.\n  Law enforcement ranks the number one drug problem--above cocaine, \nmarijuana, and heroin. I am proud that the Senate listened to law \nenforcement and that we acted earlier this year by passing the Combat \nMeth Act. Because of this legislation, meth users in all 50 States are \nnow restricted from purchasing large quantities of ingredients, like \npseudoephedrine, used to make meth. This law is a step in the right \ndirection. However, as we heard today in the Finance hearing, there is \nmuch left to be done.\n  One particular aspect of meth abuse that was addressed in the hearing \ntoday is the impact that this poisonous drug is having on our Nation's \nchildren. The hazards to children living in meth homes are numerous. \nFirst, when meth is being cooked, children are exposed to dangerous \ngases and hazardous waste which spread throughout the house, \ncontaminating everything, including the children's clothes and toys. A \nrecent study shows that the amount of exposure children living in meth \nlab homes have is about the same as if they were using meth directly. \nSecondly, these labs often explode, resulting in serious injuries, \nburns, and even death to innocent children.\n  Children living in homes where meth is being made are also more \nlikely to be severely neglected and physically, mentally, and sexually \nabused by members of their own family as well as other individuals who \nmay be present. Meth causes users to become paranoid and irritable, \noften leading to child abuse. Once the drug wears off, users tend to \nsleep for long periods and sometimes days, leaving children to fend for \nthemselves.\n  One individual testifying today told the committee about a mother who \nwas on a meth binge and literally forgot she had a baby. Child \nprotective services was called when the woman did not pick up her 2-\nmonth-old from a babysitter. Three weeks later when the mother was \nlocated, she admitted that she had been on a meth binge.\n  Child welfare services throughout the Country have seen a sharp \nincrease in the number of children removed from meth homes in the last \nseveral years. Two weeks ago in Knoxville, TN, a 18-month-old boy was \nrescued from a meth home when law enforcement raided the house and \narrested his mother and her boyfriend for manufacturing meth. Sadly, \nthis is just one example of a much larger problem.\n  In the last 2 years, over 1,000 children have been removed from homes \nin Tennessee due to meth-related investigations. And, nationwide, \nthousands more children were rescued from homes where meth was being \ncooked. Dr. Nancy Young testified today that in the last 5 years, over \n15,000 children have been impacted by meth manufacturing nationwide. \nShe added that this number was very low because many incidents go \nunreported.\n  The methamphetamine epidemic continues to place a tremendous strain \non an already overburdened child welfare system. Child protective \nservices and welfare officials are struggling to cope with the \nstaggering increase in meth-related cases and the subsequent challenges \nassociated with this particular addiction. Social workers in rural\n\n[[Page S3494]]\n\nareas, where meth use is particularly prevalent, are rarely trained to \ndeal with the unique issues related to this drug. They put themselves \ninto harm's way every time they go into a home to rescue a child, both \nbecause of the toxic chemicals to which they are exposed, as well as \nthe combative and sometimes violent state of the addicted parents.\n  As was highlighted by Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus this \nmorning, the current funding structure for America's child welfare \nsystem is outdated and ill-equipped to respond to the challenges of the \nmethamphetamine epidemic. We need to look at how we can better help \nStates and communities respond to the spike in the number of meth-\nrelated child welfare cases, and I am pleased that the Finance \nCommittee will continue to investigate the Federal role in healing \nchildren and families who are plagued by this dangerous and highly \naddictive drug.\n  Again, I thank Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus for holding the \nhearing today. And, I commend the individuals who shared their stories \nof recovery with the committee. From their testimony, we saw first hand \nthat treatment can work. We heard that education about the devastating \nconsequences of meth use can help to prevent potential users from going \ndown this path of destruction. And, we learned that far too many of our \nNation's children are being put at risk in homes where meth is being \ncooked.\n  As we continue to address the important issue of combating \nmethamphetamine abuse, we need to do more to protect America's \nchildren, to educate our citizens about the dangers of drug use, and to \nsupport effective drug abuse treatment methods.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/25/senate-section/article/S3494-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     NATIONAL CRIME VICTIMS' WEEK AND LAS VEGAS TAKE BACK THE NIGHT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize National Crime \nVictims' Week, which began April 23 and runs through April 29. This \nyear's theme is Victims' Rights: Strength in Unity. Victims of violent \ncrime may never be able to forget the trauma they have suffered, but \nwith unity and support, they will have a chance to heal.\n  That is why I would also like to acknowledge a powerful event that \nwill take place in my home State of Nevada on April 28--the Take Back \nthe Night March.\n  Take Back the Night started in the late 1970s as a way to recognize \nand protest the concerns women had about walking outside at night due \nto threats of assault, rape, and murder. Since then, the event has \nspread to almost every corner of the United States and around the globe\n  Hundreds, if not thousands, of Take Back the Night marches and \nrallies are held each year--often in late April--to coincide with \nNational Crime Victims' Week. We have had events in Nevada before, \nespecially on our university campuses, but this year is the first \ncommunity-wide march in Las Vegas.\n  I am pleased to see this event expanding into the entire Las Vegas \ncommunity. Take Back the Night marches are positive events that bring \ntogether communities and empower victims of domestic violence and \nsexual assault. The women and men who have survived these crimes can \nsee they are surrounded by strong and supportive friends, neighbors, \nfamily members, and advocates. As organized by the Rape Crisis Center, \nthis Take Back the Night includes activities for children and families, \nmusic, food, an open microphone, and a peace rally.\n  I have been a longtime supporter of legislation to combat violence \nagainst women, including the landmark Violence Against Women Act, VAWA. \nI voted for VAWA in 1994 and its reauthorization in 2000 and 2005. Our \nsociety can never be strong unless all its members feel safe in their \nown homes and on their own streets. We must do more to stop domestic \nviolence and sexual assault.\n  I appreciate the time and effort of every Nevadan who is taking part \nin this year's Take Back the Night March. I would especially like to \nthank the Rape Crisis Center and its dedicated staff for organizing \nthis wonderful event. I look forward to working with them in the future \nto make our streets safer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/25/senate-section/article/S3494-2", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3494-S3498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIP TO COLOMBIA, PERU, BRAZIL AND DOMINICAN REPUBLIC\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, during the period of April 7-16, 2006, my \ncolleague on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Jeff Sessions, and \nI traveled to Colombia, Peru, Brazil, and the Dominican Republic for a \nfirsthand view on issues of immigration, drug enforcement, and trade.\n  On April 7, 8, and 9, we traveled to Bogota and Cartagena, Colombia. \nUpon exiting the plane, we immediately met with Ambassador William \nWood, who has been U.S. Ambassador to Colombia since August 13, 2003, \nand is a graduate of Bucknell University.\n  I was looking forward to returning to Colombia in that I had not had \nan opportunity to visit there since December 1999. At the time, \nPresident Pastrana was the President of Colombia, and I had the \nopportunity to discuss with him my concerns about the forcible \neradication of the supply of narcotics and the status of peace talks \nbetween the Colombia Government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of \nColombia, FARC.\n  Traveling to Colombia this time, I was aware that Colombia was still \nfacing many serious challenges. Many of these suspicions were \ncorroborated by Ambassador Wood. Ambassador Wood stated that the United \nStates sent Colombia $600 million in aid in 2005. The purpose of this \naid is to assist Colombia against various drug cartels and guerilla \ngroups which threaten Colombia's security. Colombia faces two leftist \nand one rightwing insurgent group that wage guerilla warfare, carrying \nout kidnappings, hijackings, attacks on civilians, and political \nassassinations. The primary threat that Colombia faces is from FARC. \nAmbassador Wood estimated that FARC is composed of 17,000 members and \noperates in approximately 40 percent of Colombia.\n  Senator Sessions and I were also made aware of some recent changes \nthat have occurred to Colombia's justice system. Ambassador Wood stated \nthat the new Colombian Justice system has instilled in the Colombian \npeople a new level of confidence in the prosecution of criminals. The \nnew system provides for live testimony through the implementation of an \noral accusatorial system, whereas the previous system was \nnonadversarial and operated almost exclusively on the basis on written \ntestimony. Ambassador Wood stated that the new system is now in Bogota \nand three other municipal areas. Over 17,000 prosecutors and judges \nhave received intensive training in the new accusatory system in 2005 \nfrom various U.S. agencies. The implementation of this new justice \nsystem demonstrates that the Colombian Government is serious about \ncracking down on crime and will no longer serve as a kangaroo court for \nthe benefit of the cartels.\n  Ambassador Wood also noted several other significant areas where the \nColombian Government has improved in the area of law enforcement. \nSpecifically, Ambassador Wood noted that the number of annual homicides \nwere at their lowest number in 18 years. The number of kidnappings is \ndown 39 percent, and terror attacks are down 42 percent under President \nUribe's administration.\n  Later during the trip to Colombia, we had the opportunity to meet \nPresident Alvaro Uribe and Colombia's Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, \nCamilo Reyes. I came away extremely impressed with President Uribe and \nhis agenda for Colombia. President Uribe is a true Colombian patriot \nwho has elected to take the battle to FARC and to try to eliminate the \ncultivation of illegal narcotics in his country. Based primarily on his \nsuccess against narcotic groups, President Uribe was reelected \nPresident of Colombia on March 12, 2006, on a platform to defeat \nguerillas, eliminate paramilitary organizations, end narcotrafficking, \nand enhance Colombia's domestic security.\n  The first issue that Senator Sessions and I broached with President \nUribe was the issue of narcotics. Approximately 90 percent of the \ncocaine that enters the United States and 80 percent of the heroin east \nof the Mississippi comes from Colombia. President Uribe agreed with us \nthat the biggest problem in the war on drugs was lowering the \nconsumption of drugs. President Uribe believes, as do I, that so long \nas\n\n[[Page S3495]]\n\nthere are consumers of drugs, people will keep producing it. Despite \nthis concern, President Uribe was adamant that Colombia, with continued \nassistance from the United States, would be able to win the war on \ndrugs. President Uribe felt that so long as the United States supplied \nfinancial aid to Colombia for another 5 years, they will have taken \nsignificant steps towards eliminating cocaine production from his \ncountry.\n  During our meeting with President Uribe, Senator Sessions and I also \ndiscussed the recent actions that the U.S. Senate and House of \nRepresentatives have taken on the issue of illegal immigration to the \nUnited States. I was very curious to hear President Uribe's opinion on \nhow we might deal with the issue. President Uribe stated his belief \nthat it was important for the United States to legislate carefully in \nthis area in order to maintain a positive relationship with Colombia. \nPresident Uribe noted that the United States needed friends in South \nAmerica in order to serve as a counterweight to Venezuela and President \nChavez. The comprehensive Senate bill that originated in the Judiciary \nCommittee, President Uribe noted, appears preferential to the House \nbill.\n  Senator Sessions and I also asked President Uribe about the problem \nof seasonal workers that emigrate from Colombia to the United States in \norder to work temporarily on farms and don't return to Colombia once \ntheir appointed working time period has elapsed. I was interested to \nhear President Uribe state that he understood the concerns that the \nUnited States has with seasonal workers that overstay the work period \nin the United States. President Uribe stated that Colombia currently \nhas a good working relationship with both Canada and Spain and that he \nwould like to implement that same system with the United States. I \nasked President Uribe to explain how Colombia was able to get their \nseasonal workers to return from Canada and Spain after their designated \nwork period had elapsed. President Uribe stated that whenever Colombia \nsends seasonal workers to Canada or Spain, they keep very close track \nof where the temporary worker is working and for what time period he is \npermitted to stay. Seasonal workers also have learned that if they \ndon't return to Colombia at the conclusion of the seasonal work period, \nthen they will never be permitted to participate in an overseas work \nprogram again.\n  Despite President Uribe's approach on this topic, I still expressed \ngrave concerns whether this incentive of returning to seasonal work \nwould be enough to have seasonal workers return from the United States \nat the conclusion of their work period. President Uribe said he would \nconsider having Colombian workers have microchips implanted into their \nbodies before they are permitted to enter the United States to work on \na seasonal basis. I doubted whether the implantation of microchips \nwould be effective since the immigrant worker might be able to remove \nthem.\n  I also asked President Uribe what new policies he would like to see \nthe United States enact. President Uribe stated that the five nations \nof the Andean community, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Venezuela, and \nBolivia, are going through trying times. President Uribe felt that it \nwas important that the United States maintain a good relationship with \nColombia, Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia to combat the anti-American \ninfluence of Venezuela's President Chavez. I had the opportunity to \nvisit President Chavez in December of 2005 and agree that he does pose \na threat to U.S. interests in South America. I still believe, however, \nthat it would be prudent for the United States to deal directly with \nPresident Chavez in order to reach an understanding on some of our \nNation's differences.\n  Finally, President Uribe discussed with us a recent vote that had \njust taken place concerning the protection of intellectual property \nrights among the Andean nations. By way of background, in 2003, \nPresident Bush announced the intentions of the United States to begin \nnegotiating a free-trade agreement, FTA, with Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, \nand Bolivia. Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru currently benefit \nfrom the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act, ATPDEA. This \ntrade pact, which is set to expire on December 31, 2006, authorizes the \nPresident to grant duty-free treatment to certain products, with more \nthan half of all U.S. imports in 2004 from the Andean countries \nentering under these preferences.\n  In a recent vote which just took place in the Andean community, the \ncommunity voted three to two to protect intellectual property rights in \ntrade agreements with the United States. Colombia, along with Peru and \nEcuador, voted in favor of the protection of intellectual property \nrights, whereas Venezuela and Bolivia voted against the protection of \nthese rights. President Uribe is concerned about whether or not Peru \nwill still support the protection of intellectual rights once they \nelect a new President in the summer of this year.\n  Later in Colombia, Senator Sessions and I met Susan Reichle, Deputy \nDirector of the USAID mission in Bogota, and Guillermo Del Coilitto, \nJorge Droujo and Rosano de Riccardi, board members on Project Unidad \nPedagogica Productiva Agroindustrial de Turbaco. During our visit to \nthe project, we were told that the project was started in order to \nteach 300 displaced Colombian families how to generate income and \ngarner employment through agricultural and agribusiness activities in \nNorthern Bolivar, Colombia. This and other USAID projects in Colombia \nprovide income and employment opportunities to rural communities which \nagree to give up the growth of narcotic crops and for those that are \ndisplaced by the country's continued conflict. These projects serve to \ninstill these employment skills which they can market outside of the \ncultivation of narcotics. I left Project Unidad Pedagogica Productiva \nAgroindustrial de Turbaco with a favorable opinion of the work that \nUSAID is performing in Colombia.\n  When we visited the U.S. Embassy in Bogota, Colombia, on April 8, \n2006, we reviewed the incident of February 13, 2003, when a small U.S. \nplane crashed in Colombia resulting in FARC taking hostage Marc \nGonsalves, Keith Stansell, and Tom Howes, who were under contract with \nthe Department of Defense in the war against drug traffickers. Despite \nthe best efforts by President Uribe to rescue these hostages, all \nefforts, as of now, have been unsuccessful. During our visit to the \nEmbassy we were told that, if there were sufficient Department of \nDefense resources applied, the hostages could be located. As a result \nof this meeting, Senator Sessions and I sent a letter to Secretary of \nDefense Rumsfeld on April 10, 2006, requesting that he allocate \nadditional resources toward the location of these men. In discussing \nthis matter with the personnel at the Embassy, it was obvious that they \nwanted more resources for this effort as a successful outcome would \nclearly have a positive impact on morale and national credibility. One \nof the men at the Embassy said he thinks about the hostages every day. \nThe Embassy people talk about these men as POW and MIA and there are \nplaques and signs displayed throughout the Embassy.\n  Senator Sessions and I also met with Robert Taylor, Assistant \nRegional Director in the Drug Enforcement Agency, DEA, and Admiral \nAlfonzo Diaz of the Colombian Navy. Mr. Taylor and Admiral Diaz \ndiscussed the methods by which the Colombian cartels use to smuggle \ncocaine and other drugs out of the country. We were advised that the \nprimary way that drugs are shipped out of Colombia is via the use of \ngo-fast boats. Go-fast boats can carry up to 3 tons of cocaine and can \nreach high rates of speed. They are frequently used to transport drugs \nto Mexico, Central American and Caribbean transshipment countries, \nusing refueling vessels to extend their range. Despite the advent of \ngo-fast boats, the Colombian navy, in conjunction with U.S. agencies, \nwas able to intercept $25 billion in cocaine in 2005 as a result of \ntheir own faster go-fast midnight express boats, which can reach speeds \nin excess of 60 knots.\n\n  Both Admiral Diaz and Mr. Taylor stated that Colombian law \nenforcement has an excellent working relationship with the United \nStates and all of its agencies. One of the primary examples of this is \nthe sharp increase in the number of extraditions of Colombians to the \nUnited States. Since President Uribe took office in 2002, Colombia had\n\n[[Page S3496]]\n\nextradited 304 Colombian nationals and 11 non-nationals to the United \nStates. In early 2005, Colombia extradited FARC leader Nayibe Rojas \nValderama and Cali Cartel leader Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela. The zeal \nwith which President Uribe's administration is waging the war on drugs \nleft little doubt that it is in the interests of the United States to \ncontinue to assist him.\n  Senator Sessions and I arrived in Peru on April 10, 2006. I have had \nthe opportunity to travel to Peru on four previous occasions, the last \nof which was on January 4, 2002. This was an optimum time to be in \nPeru, as they are in the midst of Presidential elections which had \ntaken place the day before our arrival. We first met with Ambassador \nCurtis Struble, who was confirmed as Ambassador to Peru on December 9, \n2003. He and his staff gave us a country briefing and informed us that \nPeru's poverty rate is approximately 50 percent, but that Peru's \neconomy is starting to rebound and per capita growth rate rose in 1 \nyear from $2,100 a year to $2,800.\n  Soon after our meeting with Mr. Struble, we were met by Oscar \nMarutua, Peru's Foreign Minister, and Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, Peru's \nPrime Minister. I was especially impressed with Mr. Kuczynski, who is a \ngraduate of Princeton University and worked in New York City for 20 \nyears. He reminded me of our squash match 4 years earlier and commented \non my ``drop'' shots.\n  One of our primary concerns was the status of Peru's recent \nPresidential elections. Prime Minister Kuczynski advised us that there \nwere a total of 23 separate candidates running for President in Peru. \nOut of these 23, only 3 were viewed as serious candidates. Ollanta \nHumula, a leftwing candidate who had been receiving significant \nmonetary support from President Chavez, was leading in the early \nelection return with 30 percent of the vote. The other two primary \ncandidates, Ms. Lourdes Flores Nano and Alan Garcia, were characterized \nby Mr. Kuczynski as moderates and were in a dead heat, each capturing \nabout 25 percent of the votes.\n  Mr. Kuczynski explained that under Peru's political system, if no \ncandidate receives 50 percent of the vote, then a run-off vote between \nthe top two candidates occurs on May 7, 2006. Without question, it will \nbe in the interest of the United States that either Ms. Flores Nano or \nMr. Garcia prevails in Peru's election for President.\n  Foreign Minister Maurtua stated that there are approximately 1 \nmillion Peruvians living in the United States. Of these, he estimated \nthat 50 percent were residing in the United States illegally. Kuczynski \nsuggested breaking the issue of immigration down into two parts: what \nto do with the people already in the United States and what to do with \nthose who would like to go there.\n  Senator Sessions and I also met with Susan Keogh, Director of \nNarcotics Affairs in Peru. Ms. Keough discussed the current \ndifficulties the Peruvian Government was having in combating narcotics \nand the deleterious effect that narcotic cultivation has on the \nenvironment. Ms. Keough stated that approximately 400,000 acres are \nbeing deforested annually for the cultivation of coca and other plants. \nOn average, there are approximately 40,000 to 100,000 coca plants per 2 \nacres, which require about 2 tons of chemicals to be used for their \nproduction. Since coca is very vulnerable to diseases, coca growers \ncover the coca with pesticides which are very deleterious to the \nenvironment. Some portions of these chemicals almost always find their \nway into rivers and streams, as coca must be cultivated close to a \nwater supply.\n  I asked what efforts the Peruvian Government is taking to combat \nthese problems. Ms. Keough remarked that the Peruvian Government hardly \nfocuses on this issue and that the growth of cocaine and the effects on \nthe environment was rarely mentioned during the current Presidential \ncampaign. We suggested to Ms. Keough that she and her colleagues, who \nwere concerned about protecting the environment, should write letters \nto the editor of respected Peruvian newspapers expressing their concern \nover the growth of cocaine in Peru and the deleterious effects that \nthis cultivation is having on the environment.\n  Senator Sessions and I arrived in Brazil on April 12, 2006. \nImmediately upon our arrival, we met with acting U.S. Ambassador and \nDeputy Chief of Mission to Brazil, Phillip Chicola, a Cuban-American \nwho came to the United States in 1961 and graduated from Florida \nAtlantic University. Mr. Chicola stated that, although Brazil views the \nUnited States as an ally, the Brazilian administration has made \nbuilding relations with neighboring countries in the southern \nhemisphere its first priority. He said that Brazil is seeking to \nredress U.S. influence by strengthening ties with nontraditional \ntrading partners such as India and China.\n\n  Senator Sessions and I also asked Mr. Chicola about narcotics \ntrafficking throughout South America. Mr. Chicola stated that, although \nBrazil is not a significant drug-producing country, Brazil does serve \nas a conduit for cocaine moving to Europe and Africa. Specifically, \nboth Colombian and Bolivian drug smugglers attempt to transport cocaine \nover the Brazilian borders. Although Colombian drug smugglers have had \nsome success in bringing narcotics across the border, the Amazon rain \nforest and various rivers provide natural boundaries against drug \nsmuggling. As a result of these natural boundaries, drug smugglers have \nattempted to fly drugs out of Colombia and into Brazil. Mr. Chicola \nstated that the majority of drug smugglers now ship their cocaine \nthrough Venezuela as a result of Brazil's shootdown law, which \nauthorizes the Brazilian Air Force to use lethal force in the \ninterdiction of aircraft suspected of involvement in drug trafficking.\n  Later during the trip we met with Under Secretary for South American \nAffairs Ministry for External Relations, Jose Eduardo Felicio. Mr. \nFelicio was an articulate, impressive man, who spent several years of \nhis life working in New York City. One of the first questions we asked \nMr. Felicio was how the United States can limit the destabilizing \neffect that President Chavez has been having on South America. Mr. \nFelicio stated that the Brazilian Government views Chavez as the \nlegitimately elected President of Venezuela even though they do not \napprove of everything he says publicly. Mr. Felicio stated that, \ndespite Chavez's harsh rhetoric against the United States, Brazil does \nnot believe there is sufficient proof that Chavez is a disrupting force \nin South America.\n  I also asked Mr. Felicio what steps the United Nations Security \nCounsel should take in regards to Iran's attempts to develop nuclear \narms in violation of the nonproliferation treaty. Mr. Felicio stated \nthat, while Iran should cooperate with requests made by the \nInternational Atomic Energy Association, Brazil does not believe that \nIran is being treated fairly because there is a double standard against \nIran. While certain countries like Israel, Pakistan, and India are \npermitted to develop nuclear programs in violation of the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty, Iran has been unfairly singled out.\n  The next portion of the CODEL took us to Manaus, where we spoke with \nMr. Francisco Ritta Bernardino, the owner of many hotels throughout the \nAmazon and noted author of several books dealing with the importance of \nthe Amazon ecosystem. A lawyer and entrepreneur, Mr. Bernardino told us \nof his meeting with Jacques Cousteau, the famous diver and undersea \nexplorer who documented life in the Amazon from December 1981 to \nNovember 1982. Mr. Bernardino stated that it was during this time \nperiod that Jacques Cousteau convinced him that the greatest threat to \nmankind was not nuclear war, but the destruction of nature. Cousteau \nbelieved that if the destruction of the Amazon was not halted, mankind \nwould be sacrificing the future of their children and grandchildren.\n  Soon after Mr. Bernardino's meeting with Mr. Cousteau, he set about \nthe construction of the Ariau Amazon Towers. Mr. Bernardino stated that \nhe built the hotel in the middle of the Amazon in order to help people \nbecome acquainted with the Amazon in a region untouched by people. The \nAriau Amazon Towers are built upon seven wooden towers interconnected \nby raised walkways over portions of the Amazon River. These walkways \nconnect the towers with various docks and paths that lead throughout \nthe Amazon.\n\n[[Page S3497]]\n\n  During our meeting with Mr. Bernardino, we inquired about the origin \nof the Amazon River flow. Mr. Bernardino explained that the Amazon \nRiver is created at the junction of the Negro and Solimoes Rivers near \nManaus. He stated that the water of the Negro River runs approximately \n3,200 kilometers, originating from the various tributaries that spill \nout of the Andes Mountains of Colombia and Peru. The water of the Negro \nRiver is completely black, colored from the collection of minerals and \norganic materials that it collects from hundreds of tributaries that \nempty into it from the rock beds of the Andes. Mr. Bernardino explained \nthat, although the Negro River is full of acid and poor in oxygen, it \nfertilizes the surrounding shores with its rich minerals. In contrast \nto the Negro River, Mr. Bernardino stated that the water of the \nSolimoes River is colored light blue and flows from the Brazilian-\nPeruvian border. The Solimoes River runs for about 1,600 kilometers, \nuntil it meets the black Negro waters where it merges to form the \nAmazon River in a floodplain about 80 kilometers wide.\n  The Amazon River runs 5,904 kilometers in length; its basins widening \nduring the rainy seasons to as much as 100 kilometers. Mr. Bernardino \nexplained that approximately 1,100 tributaries empty their waters into \nthe Amazon and that the Amazon average width ranges from 2 to 30 \nkilometers, until it reaches a width of 230 kilometers when it empties \ninto the Atlantic Ocean. The flow of the Amazon river is so forceful \nthat the waters of the Atlantic Ocean are pushed approximately 2 to 5 \nkilometers away from the shoreline of the Amazon basin by its free-\nflowing fresh water.\n\n  We also met with the National Aeronautical Space Administration, \nNASA, Project Liaison to Large Scale Biosphere Atmosphere Experiment, \nJosefine Durazo, about the effects the deforestation of the Amazon is \nhaving on global warming. Ms. Durazo explained that the Large Scale \nBiosphere Atmosphere Experiment, LBA, is an international cooperative \nresearch program led by Brazil and dedicated to the study of \nInternational Geosphere-Biosphere studies regarding the deforestation \nof the Amazon. She further stated that she worked with the LBA-ECO, \nwhich is a subproject operating under the LBA, funded entirely by NASA. \nThe LBA-ECO is dedicated to gaining an understanding of how the \necosystem of the Amazon functions as a system and what effects the \ndeforestation of the Amazon are having on climate control.\n  Ms. Durazo explained that NASA began funding the program in 1998 by \nconstructing tower sites which measure carbon flux in various \ngeographic areas within the Amazon. These towers, in conjunction with \nextensive support by Brazilian researchers, enable NASA to measure the \nflux of carbon levels during forest fires and lumbering projects. As a \nresult of this research, NASA and LBA have discovered that current \nlogging efforts in the Amazon cover an area nearly equal to that of the \nportions that have already been deforested. Ms. Durazo stated that by \nusing these techniques, NASA and the LBA will soon be able to determine \nthe effect that the continued logging of the Amazon will have on the \nlevel of carbon dioxide being emitted to the atmosphere.\n  After our meeting with Ms. Durazo, I had my staff reach out to \nMichael Keller a physical scientist working at the International \nInstitute of Tropical Forestry. According to Mr. Keller, carbon dioxide \nis responsible for the largest portion of the manmade greenhouse \neffect. Each year, there are eight gigatons, 1 billion tons, of carbon \nadded to the atmospheric burden of carbon dioxide. Of those 8 gigatons, \n1.6 result from land use change processes, such as the clearing of \nforest and savanna in the tropics. Mr. Keller estimates that .3 \ngigatons of the carbon emitted to the atmosphere occurs as a result of \nthe deforestation of the Amazon. Accordingly, Mr. Keller and other \nexperts believe that the deforestation of the Amazon is playing a \nsignificant role in the manmade greenhouse effect. NASA is continuing \nto study the data that they have collected in the Amazon.\n  Senator Sessions and I arrived in the Dominican Republic on April 15, \n2006, and met for a team briefing with Peter Reilly of the DEA, Andy \nDiaz of the FBI, Michael Garuckis of the State Department, Jeff \nRadgowski of the Coast Guard and Timothy Tubbs of the Department of \nHomeland Security regarding issues of drug trafficking and immigration.\n  We were told at this briefing that the Dominican Republic's long \nborder with Haiti, combined with its overstretched law enforcement \nagencies and geographic location in the Caribbean, make the country a \nprime location for drug traffickers. Although the Dominican Republic is \nnot a major drug-producing country, it nonetheless acts as a transit \npoint for cocaine and heroin bound for the United States from Colombia \nand Venezuela. The main trafficking points are by sea from Colombia, \nwhich lies just 360 nautical miles from the coast of the Dominican \nRepublic.\n  We were also informed at this briefing that there are approximately \n1.6 million Dominicans residing in the United States. In 2005, U.S. \nimmigration authorities repatriated 4,918 Dominicans. Most of those \nreturned to the Dominican Republic had served 4 to 9 years in jail in \nthe United States.\n  After our country briefing, we traveled to see a training program run \nby the Hotel Association with assistance from USAID and the Peace Corp \nat La Romana Bayahibe Tourism Cluster, Romana Cluster. The Hotel \nAssociation is attempting to educate and train the local populace in \norder to make the Dominican Republic more attractive to tourists. The \nRomana Cluster is a community of homes built by USAID for displaced \nindividuals on land purchased by the Hotel Association for displaced \nDominicans.\n  While there, we met with Lisette Gill, the executive director of the \nRomana Cluster, and Rosa Garza of the Peace Corps. Ms. Gill explained \nthat the Romana Cluster was started in 2001 by USAID to train the local \ncommunity in marketable skills so that the area would be more \nattractive to tourists. Ms. Gill stated that the Romana Cluster \nreceives approximately $250,000 annually from the Hotel Association. \nMs. Gill took us to a high school that was constructed by the Hotel \nAssociation for 120 students living in the Romana Cluster. Before the \nconstruction of this high school, we were told that Dominicans living \nin the area could not attend high school, as there was no public \nschooling available in the area.\n  Later that evening, we met with the Foreign Minister for the \nDominican Republic, Mr. Carlos Morales Troncoso. I told the Foreign \nMinister that I had spoken to President Uribe about the problem of the \nUnited States of getting guest workers to return to their native \ncountry after they had finished working, and I was interested to hear \nhis thoughts on the subject. Mr. Troncoso stated that the Dominican \nRepublic had just begun a guest worker program with Spain. The \nDominican Republic guest worker program was a 2-year program whereby \nthe government would keep a log of where the worker would be working in \nSpain and where they could find him. Mr. Toncoso explained that, so \nlong as the worker performed well and returned to the Dominican \nRepublic at the end of the working season, then it would be permissible \nfor the worker to work in Spain the following year. He stated that if \nthe worker does not come back, that worker would be barred from being \neligible for any future participation in a guest worker program.\n  Mr. Troncoso admitted that there is always the problem of some guest \nworkers not wanting to return to the Dominican Republic, but \nnonetheless, the current system seems to be working well. Mr. Troncoso \nstated that, in 2005, Dominican Republic citizens working in the United \nStates sent approximately $2.8 billion back to their families in the \nDominican Republic.\n  Senator Sessions and I also had the opportunity to meet with \nPresident Leonel Fernandez Reyna. President Reyna was a very impressive \nman who was born in Santo Domingo in 1953 and moved to New York City in \n1956 where he attended elementary and junior high school. President \nReyna returned to the Dominican Republic in 1969 and served as \nPresident from 1996-2000 but was not permitted to run again as a result \nof term limits. In 2003, however, the Dominican Republic constitution \nwas changed, permitting President\n\n[[Page S3498]]\n\nReyna to become President for a second time in 2004.\n  President Reyna spoke to us about the border problems that the \nDominican Republic was having with illegal Haitian immigrants entering \nthe Dominican Republic. President Reyna explained that, while the \nDominican Republic's unemployment rate was 17.4 percent, Haiti's was \napproximately 50 percent. As a result of this, the Dominican Republic \nmust constantly contend with Haitian citizens coming across the border \nlooking for work. President Reyna stated that it was imperative for the \nDominican Republic to encourage the expansion of democratic \ninstitutions in Haiti, in the hope that this would lead to political \nstability.\n  We returned to Washington on April 16 to use the second week of the \nrecess to work on the immigration bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/25/senate-section/article/S3498-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     Staff Sergeant Kevin P. Jessen\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to SSG Kevin \nP. Jessen of Paragould, AR. To those who knew him best, he was a loving \nhusband and proud father whose life was filled with love and laughter. \nTo his fellow soldiers serving on the battlefields of Iraq, he was a \nhero who, in the course of saving countless American and Iraqi lives, \nsacrificed his own.\n  His lifelong interest in military history and explosives led him to a \ncareer as an explosive ordnance disposal technician. It came as no \nsurprise to friends and family that the young Arkansan, who spent \ncountless hours as a child playing with G.I. Joe toys and bottle \nrockets, would become a soldier. He joined the ROTC while in high \nschool and upon graduation enlisted in the National Guard before \nultimately joining the U.S. Army.\n  Staff Sergeant Jessen's first of three tours in Iraq occurred shortly \nafter Operation Desert Storm when he helped dispose of explosives left \nover from the war. In 2004, he returned through service in Operation \nIraqi Freedom, only to return for a third tour 6 months after his \nsecond was completed. While serving in a foreign land seemingly worlds \naway from home, his heart and thoughts were undoubtedly never far from \nhis wife Carrie and his 2-year-old son, Cameron. Between tours of duty, \nthis battle-hardened soldier was often found changing diapers or \nhandling bottle feedings in the middle of the night. It was the proud \nduty of a man who loved his family so very much, and it was symbolic of \nhis devotion to them.\n  Throughout his time in Iraq, Staff Sergeant Jessen's role as an \nexplosives ordnance disposal technician ensured that he was often \ncalled upon to disarm roadside bombs. Although it continually placed \nhim in the line of danger, he selflessly saw it as his duty to help \nprotect the lives of his fellow soldiers as well as the lives of Iraqi \ncivilians. Tragically, while serving on a postblast investigation on \nMarch 4, 2006, he was killed by a secondary explosion in Rawah, Iraq.\n  At Staff Sergeant Jessen's memorial service, he was laid to rest with \nfull military honors. Hundreds of family, friends, and those wishing to \npay their respects joined together to remember this young Arkansan and \nto honor the life he led. Along his funeral procession, members of a \ngrateful community endured the cold weather to honor this fallen hero, \nmany with hands held over the hearts and waving American flags. At the \ncemetery, the American flag that had draped Staff Sergeant Jessen's \ncasket was folded and presented to Carrie and Cameron as a token of \nremembrance of the man they loved and the sacrifice he made on behalf \nof us all.\n  Although the 28 years that Kevin Jessen spent with us were far too \nshort, I am hopeful that his friends, family, and loved ones find some \nsolace knowing that he touched the lives so many. He set examples of \ndevotion to family and country that we should all follow, and he led an \nhonorable life of love and selflessness that will continue to serve as \nan inspiration to us all.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with Carrie, Cameron, and all those who \nknew and loved this fallen hero.\n\n\n                       Staff Sgt. Brock A. Beery\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from Warsaw, \nIN. SSG Brock Beery, 30 years old, died on March 23 when his armored \nvehicle struck a land mine 80 miles west of Baghdad. With his entire \nlife before him, Brock risked everything to fight for the values we \nAmericans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  Brock decided to pursue a career in the Army in 1994, immediately \nfollowing his graduation from Tippecanoe Valley High School. Remembered \nas a good student and a good husband, Brock took great pride in his \nwork. He remained close to his family throughout his time in Iraq and \nplanned to attend his younger sister's high school graduation in June. \nHis father recounted to a local newspaper, ``[Brock] liked his job. He \nliked challenges; he put his best foot forward every time. He gave his \nbest to his family, too.''\n  Brock was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. He was a member of the Headquarters Company, 2nd Battalion, \n123rd Armored Division, based in Bowling Green, KY. This brave young \nsoldier leaves behind his mother and father, Pamela and Roger Beery; \nhis wife and 7-year-old daughter, Sara and Elissa; his sister, Hope; \nand his brothers, Joel and Tobey. He was serving his third overseas \ntour of duty.\n  Today, I join Brock's family and friends in mourning his death. While \nwe struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride \nin the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Brock, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Brock was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, Brock will be remembered by family members, \nfriends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero and we honor the \nsacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Brock's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of Brock's actions will live on far longer that any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Brock A. Beery in the official \nrecord of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his \nprofound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I think \nabout this just cause in which we are engaged and the unfortunate pain \nthat comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like \nBrock's can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, \n``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away \ntears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Brock.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/25/senate-section/article/S3498-2", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3498-S3499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  In March 2006, Gregory Pisarcik was sentenced to life in prison in \nSanta Ana, CA for the murder of Narciso Leggs, a gay man. During the \nattack, Pisarcik repeatedly hit Leggs over the head with a champagne \nbottle. When police later found his body one ear had been cut off and \nanti-gay slurs were written all over his body. According to sources, \npolice feel that sexual orientation was a motivation for the attack.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend\n\n[[Page S3499]]\n\nthem against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law Enforcement \nEnhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that \nby passing this legislation and changing current law we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/25/senate-section/article/S3499-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3499-S3500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           GENOCIDE IN SUDAN\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today is Holocaust Remembrance Day. Each \nyear, our Nation commemorates this tragic event with a week-long period \nof remembrance, and this Thursday, I will join several of my colleagues \nin a ceremony honoring the victims of the Holocaust in the Capitol \nRotunda. The theme for this year's ``Days of Remembrance,'' the \n``Legacies of Justice,'' honors the courage and fortitude of those who \ntestified during the trials of Nazi war criminals.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I have a personal connection to those \ntrials. My father, Senator Thomas Dodd, then a young lawyer, was asked \nby the chief counsel for the United States at Nuremberg, U.S. Supreme \nCourt Justice Robert Jackson, to join his prosecutorial team. My father \nserved as vice-chairman of the Review Board and as executive trial \ncounsel, and his experiences at those trials greatly influenced his \nthinking on human rights and the importance of international justice \nfor the rest of his life.\n  One of the major accomplishments of the prosecutors and witnesses at \nNuremberg was publicly exposing the scope of depravity of Nazi crimes. \nMy father and his colleagues went to great lengths to meticulously \nrecord that evidence, and their efforts formed the basis of much of our \ncurrent knowledge about the Holocaust. According to the U.S. Holocaust \nMemorial Museum, for example, it was during the Nuremberg trials that \nthe world first heard the estimate of 6 million Jewish deaths.\n  I believe that my father and his colleagues placed so much emphasis \non revealing the extent of Nazi crimes in large part because they \nunderstood that the Nuremberg proceedings had the potential to reach an \naudience that far exceeded the four members and four alternate members \nof the Tribunal sitting in judgment of the defendants. These trials \nwould reveal to the world and to future generations that such \nunthinkable crimes were possible, and that the international community \nmust, therefore, stand up to injustice and abuse wherever they occur.\n  The evidence uncovered by the Tribunal was truly horrific. Indeed, \nthe crimes committed by the Nazis were so heinous that they required a \nnew lexicon to describe them. These crimes were prosecuted under the \nlegal terminology of ``crimes against humanity,'' but later, an \nentirely new word describing them was formalized: genocide. Genocide \nrefers to certain actions committed with the ``intent to destroy, in \nwhole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group.''\n  Sadly, the crime of genocide is not unique to the Holocaust. In \nBosnia, Cambodia, and, of course, Rwanda, too many innocents died while \nthe world looked away. And today, in Darfur, Sudan, escalating violence \nis claiming thousands of additional lives in a conflict that the \nCongress unanimously declared genocide almost 2 years ago, in July \n2004. Secretary of State Colin Powell made that same declaration in \nSeptember of that year.\n  Several weeks ago, I received a DVD about the situation in Darfur \nmade by a group of Danbury, CT, high school students. The DVD, entitled \n``The Promise,'' is truly a wake-up call. The title, of course, refers \nto the promise made by the world after the Holocaust--the promise of \n``Never Again.''\n  Yet, as these students so vividly portray, the people of Darfur \ncontinue to suffer while the world takes too little notice. By some \nestimates, as many as 300,000 people, many of them civilians, may have \nlost their lives in Darfur since the start of the conflict. The \nGovernment of Sudan has refused to curtail, and in many instances has \nactively supported, the activities of Jingaweit militias that have \nattacked and targeted tribal groups of African decent.\n  In a particularly moving segment of their DVD, the Danbury students \ndisplay some of the artwork of children who have fled their homes in \nDarfur. As the students say, so much can be learned through the eyes of \na child, and these images, produced by the children without any \nprompting, are of war, fire, and death. I think of my own children and \nshudder to imagine them suffering through the terror that afflicts the \nchildren of Darfur every day. Indeed, despite all that we have learned \nsince Nuremberg, I am sad to say that the promise of ``Never Again'' \nremains a promise unfulfilled.\n  But while the story of Darfur is clearly one of tragedy, it is also \none of hope. Since the start of the conflict, I have been impressed by \nthe dedication and advocacy demonstrated by the people of Connecticut \non this issue. If we are ever to fulfill ``the promise,'' it will be \ndue to the extraordinary efforts of dedicated individuals such as these \nDanbury High School students. I am proud that these students, just like \nthe brave individuals who stood up to testify at the Nuremberg \nTribunals 60 years ago to demand justice, are standing up to demand \naction in Darfur today.\n  In their DVD, the Danbury High School students cite a famous \nstatement by Ghandi: ``Be the change you wish to see in the world.'' I \ncan think of no greater compliment to these students and the numerous \nindividuals in Connecticut and across this country who have advocated \nfor increased international action in Darfur, than to say that they \nhave lived up to that admonition. I ask unanimous consent that the \nnames of the Danbury students who made this DVD be included in the \nrecord following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DODD. Today is a day of remembrance, but in remembering, we are \nalso called to action. This week, we are debating the President's \nemergency supplemental request. To his credit, the President has \nincluded in that request substantial funds to support the African Union \npeacekeeping operation in Darfur and new humanitarian assistance.\n  Moreover, the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations is \nscheduled to brief the Security Council tomorrow, on potential U.N. \nmissions in Darfur. It is my hope that they will advocate a strong \nUnited Nations Peacekeeping force, despite Sudanese objections. It is \nalso my fervent hope that we in the Senate actively support an \nincreased international role in Darfur. Because only with our support \ncan any international force hope to meet the enormous challenge of \nprotecting the civilian population and providing a safe environment to \nsupply humanitarian relief.\n  Finally, just as at Nuremberg the international community enforced \njustice where justice had too long been blind, I call on the Bush \nadministration to actively support the work of the International \nCriminal Court in prosecuting those individuals who have committed \ncrimes against the people of Darfur and against all humanity. I know \nthe ICC is not popular in some circles of the Bush administration, but \nI believe it is the best tool we have to enforce the vision of \nuniversal justice that was inspired by Nuremberg.\n  Following the trials of the major war criminals before the \nInternational Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, President Truman \ndeclared: I have no hesitancy in declaring that the historic precedent \nset at Nuremberg abundantly justifies the expenditure of effort, \nprodigious though it was.\n  Individuals such as my father expected that the historic precedent \ndescribed by President Truman would long inspire nations to take action \nagainst crimes such as those prosecuted at Nuremberg. The lesson of \nNuremberg to these individuals was indeed the promise of ``Never \nAgain.'' I hope that on this somber day of remembrance, we will commit \nourselves to renewing that promise.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n               Background--A Danbury High School Project\n\n       ``The Promise'' is a Danbury High School student video \n     about genocide in the Darfur region of Sudan. After school \n     for three months at the end of 2005, a group of students \n     worked with assistant principal Tim Salem on the project. The \n     result is an eight minute documentary meant to raise \n     awareness about the genocide and motivate action. The name \n     ``The Promise'' is a reminder of the promise the United \n     Nations and the world made in 1945 to hold people accountable \n     for crimes against humanity. With the backdrop of the \n     Holocaust, narration, images and quotations, the focus is on \n     the plight of\n\n[[Page S3500]]\n\n     the children of Darfur. The world was promised ``never \n     again''.

Mr. President, I rise to express concern about the \nconsideration of comprehensive immigration reform legislation. As a \nmember of the Judiciary Committee, I have been involved in the \ndemocratic process of reviewing, amending, and voting on this year's \nimmigration bill. I was one of six Republicans who opposed the \nlegislation in the committee on March 27.\n  When the bill was brought to the floor of the U.S. Senate, a select \ngroup of Members forged a ``compromise'' that drastically changed title \nVI of the bill that deals with the 11 million illegal aliens currently \nin the United States.\n  The Senate had very little time to review the bill. Moreover, some \nMembers opposed any amendment that would change the Hagel-Martinez \ncompromise. I had numerous amendments that would have improved the \nbill. However, the other side of the aisle refused to let our \ndeliberative body do its job.\n  As a representative of the people of Iowa, I believe amendments \nshould be debated. Therefore, I have asked the majority leader to make \nme aware of any unanimous consent agreements that both sides aim to \nenter into before unanimous consent is agreed to. I ask unanimous \nconsent that my letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             United States Senate,\n\n\n                                          Charles E.

Mr. President, this month people around the world are \njoining together to remember and honor the men, women, and children who \nperished in the Armenian genocide. One and a half million Armenians \nwere systematically massacred at the hands of the Ottoman Empire, and \nover 500,000 more were forced to flee their homeland of 3,000 years. It \nis important that we note this terrible tragedy.\n  When the Armenian genocide occurred, from 1915 to 1923, the \ninternational community lacked a name for such atrocities. In January \n1951, the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of \nGenocide entered into force to affirm the international commitment to \nprevent genocide and protect basic human decency. Today, we have the \nwords to describe this evil, and we have an obligation to prevent it. \nBut we must also have the will to act.\n  The Armenian genocide may have been the first instance of what \nWinston Churchill referred to as ``the crime without a name,'' but it \nwas certainly not the last. During the Holocaust, and later in the \nformer Yugoslavia and Rwanda, the world has seen the crimes of ethnic \ncleansing and genocide recur again and again. Too often, the \ninternational will to stop atrocities has been lacking, or far too late \nin coming. Today, as the genocide in Darfur, Sudan, continues to \nunfold, we have to muster the will and the sense of urgency required to \nsave innocent lives.\n  The international community has made the first steps, but it has a \nlong way to go in punishing and, particularly, preventing genocide. As \nwe move forward, we must learn the lessons of Armenia's genocide. We \ncannot be misled by the rhetoric of scapegoating, denial, and \nobfuscation used by murderous leaders to disguise their agenda. And we \ncannot respond to evidence of methodical, brutal violence by wringing \nour hands and waiting for some definitive proof that these events \nqualify as genocide. Enforcing a collective, international commitment \nto prevent and stop genocides from occurring is imperative. We owe the \nvictims of the Armenian genocide this commitment.\n  This is why we must remember the Armenian genocide. To forget it is \nto enable more genocides and ethnic cleansing to occur. We must honor \nits victims by reaffirming our resolve to not let it happen again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/25/senate-section/article/S3500-3", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3500-S3501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL VOLUNTEER MONTH\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

I introduced the National and Community Service \nAct to establish the Corporation for National and Community Service to \noversee and coordinate our national volunteer efforts and to create a \ndemonstration program that has evolved into what we know today as \nAmeriCorps. As one of the founders, I have been its chief advocate in \nthe Senate. I fought to create AmeriCorps, I fought to strengthen \nAmeriCorps, and I will continue to fight to save key AmeriCorps \nprograms.\n  Hundreds of members of the AmeriCorps National Civilian Community \nCorps, NCCC, have set up camp in the gulf region. They have provided \nmore than 250,000 service hours valued at $3.8 million to Hurricane \nKatrina recovery projects. They are helping thousands get their homes, \ntheir communities, and their lives back.\n  Their help is needed now more than ever.

Mr. President, I rise today to convey my deep \ngratitude and everlasting appreciation to my Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee staff director, Joyce A. Rechtschaffen, \nwho is leaving the Senate after 10 years of service in my personal \noffice and 7 on the committee to head Princeton University's \ngovernmental affairs office here in Washington.\n  Benjamin Franklin once said: ``Energy and persistence conquer all \nthings.''\n  That six-word sentence sums up a career of accomplishments that could \nfill volumes.\n  Joyce was on the front lines of many of the challenges of the century \njust past and the century just begun. And through her energy and \npersistence she accomplished great things for the American people.\n  I hired Joyce in 1989, shortly after I was sworn in as a freshman \nSenator, and the two of us learned the ropes of this institution \ntogether.\n  She worked for me on the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nlater moving to my personal office as my environmental legislative \nassistant and counsel.\n  Joyce, a graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Law School, \ndeveloped a reputation as a tiger early on, contributing significantly \nto the Clean Air amendments of 1990, working passionately to preserve \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and proposing innovative solutions \nto stemming harmful greenhouse gases.\n  It is a reputation she not only never lived down but made a point of \nearning time and time again on issue after issue.\n  In 1999, I became ranking member of the former Government Affairs \nCommittee, and I appointed Joyce as minority staff director. In 2001, I \nbecame chairman when Democrats regained control of the Senate, and \nJoyce became majority staff director through the following year.\n  Whether in the majority or minority, Joyce never let up. With her \nbrilliant mind, near photographic memory, and absolute dedication to \nthe job, Joyce has seen this committee through 6 years of profound \naccomplishment.\n  She brought her knowledge of environmental issues to bear by \nlaunching principled and studied investigations into the Bush \nadministration's regulatory actions and energy policies.\n  Joyce helped this committee run its investigation of the demise of \nthe Enron Corporation, establish the 9/11 Commission, and write \nlegislation creating the Department of Homeland Security and the \nreorganization of our intelligence systems--among the most significant \nreorganizations of Government in half a century.\n  And in her final mission for the committee and the American people, \nJoyce helped shepherd our bipartisan investigation and report on the \nGovernment's failed response to Hurricane Katrina.\n  Leading by example, Joyce helped assemble and retain a loyal staff \nwhose work ethic and dedication have been tested time and time again \nwith late nights on tight deadlines handling mighty challenges for the \nAmerican people. They are the envy of the Senate.\n  But this is all in Joyce's nature. Shaking things up was just part of \nJoyce's nature. To Joyce, the status quo was often a barrier to \nprogress that must fall as the constant casualty of time as we advance \nthe cause of making our Nation safer, fairer, and more just for each \nand every American.\n  I am sorry to lose Joyce's vast knowledge and expertise, and I will \nmiss her sound advice, strict attention to every aspect of an issue, \nand most of all her faithful service to me through 17 years.\n  But Joyce, you can walk away knowing that it was a job well done.\n  Robert F. Kennedy said: ``Few will have the greatness to bend history \nitself. But each of us can work to change a small portion of events, \nand in the total of all those acts will be written the history of this \ngeneration.''\n  Joyce, through her energy, persistence, and selflessness, has written \nherself silently into the history of the great challenges of this \ngeneration and left a legacy of achievement that will be both the envy \nand inspiration for all those who follow.\n  Unfortunately, our committee has not had a markup since Joyce \nannounced her retirement; our next one will be next week, after Joyce \nhas left us. But because we owe her so much, I will be asking the \ncommittee at next week's markup to report an original resolution \nthanking her. Chairman Collins has said she will join me in this \nresolution, the text of which follows these remarks. But let me close \nby saying thank you Joyce. I owe you more than I can say, and I wish \nyou all the best.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of a proposed resolution be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Thanking Joyce Rechtschaffen for Her Service to the Senate and to the \n      Committee on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs\n\n       Whereas Joyce Rechtschaffen, an accomplished environmental \n     lawyer, joined the staff of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman upon \n     his entry into the Senate in 1989 and served as his \n     legislative assistant and counsel for environmental issues \n     for almost ten years;\n       Whereas during her tenure in Senator Lieberman's office, \n     Joyce Rechtschaffen contributed significantly to the \n     protection of the nation's environment, most significantly \n     through important contributions to the landmark 1990 \n     amendments to the Clean Air Act, ceaseless efforts work to \n     protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and innovative \n     proposals to stem the harmful effects of greenhouse gasses;\n       Whereas in 1999, upon Senator Lieberman becoming the \n     Ranking Member on the then-named Governmental Affairs \n     Committee, Joyce Rechtschaffen took on the new challenge of \n     serving as Democratic Staff Director;\n       Whereas during her more than seven years in that position, \n     Joyce Rechtschaffen has worked tirelessly to advance the work \n     of the Committee and of the nation;\n       Whereas Joyce Rechtschaffen has played a leading role in \n     every accomplishment of the Committee since 1999, from the \n     2002 creation of the Homeland Security Department, to the \n     establishment of the 9/11 Commission that same year, to the \n     2004 reorganization of the Intelligence Community, to the \n     Committee's 2006 investigation into the governmental response \n     to Hurricane Katrina, among many other things;\n       Whereas Joyce Rechtschaffen has shown the same focus and \n     dedication to all of the work of the Committee no matter how \n     significant the issue at hand;\n       Whereas Joyce Rechtschaffen has been a model manager, \n     staffer, employee and colleague to all who have worked with \n     her;\n       Whereas Joyce Rechtschaffen has worked tirelessly and \n     selflessly for the Committee these past seven years, often at \n     great personal sacrifice:\n       Whereas Joyce Rechtschaffen has been a model of integrity, \n     intelligence, compassion and commitment to building a better \n     America and has shown herself to be the very best and \n     brightest of both civil and Congressional service; Now \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Committee on Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs thanks Joyce Rechtschaffen for her years \n     of work for and dedication to the Senate and to the Committee \n     and wishes her every success in her future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/25/senate-section/article/S3501-2", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3501-S3502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       UNIVERSITY OF MONTANA GRIZ\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in Montana, we have a long and \nproud athletic heritage, and the University of Montana men's basketball \nteam has added yet another chapter to this great legacy.\n  The Griz finished their Cinderella season with a 24-to-7 record. \nAmong their many great achievements this season was beating perennial \nbasketball powerhouse Stanford, upsetting the top-seeded Northern \nArizona Lumberjacks to win the Big Sky tournament, and shocking the No. \n5 seeded Nevada Wolfpack in the first round of the NCAA tournament.\n  This truly was a magical season for our Griz. By advancing to the \nsecond round of the NCAA tournament, the Griz accomplished a feat no \nGriz team had in over 30 years. Yet this season was about more than \njust wins and losses, it was about a team that is a true class act--\nboth on and off the court.\n  This team's dedication to their school, their fans, their studies, \nand their community is a direct reflection of the man who leads them. \nCoach Larry Krystkowiak is truly the epitome of what it means to be a \nMontanan. Growing up in a small town, Coach ``K'' went on to play \nbasketball at the University of Montana, where he\n\n[[Page S3502]]\n\nstill holds the record for the most points and rebounds in a career. \nOnce he completed his collegiate career, he went on to a successful \ncareer in the NBA.\n  After his retirement from professional basketball, Coach ``K'' moved \nto the other side of the bench and became an assistant coach. \nEventually he found himself back home, as coach of the Griz. As head \ncoach, Coach ``K'' instilled in his team that being a college athlete \nis about more than just playing a sport, it is about being a role model \nfor a community. Nothing exemplifies this mentality more than when \nCoach ``K'' himself offered to have his head shaved in order to show \nsupport to a friend who had recently been diagnosed with cancer and to \nraise money for children who were battling the disease.\n  I want to take this opportunity to publicly congratulate each player \non the roster, the coaching staff, Coach ``K'', and the entire \nUniversity of Montana community for their magical season.\n  I ask that the list of coaches and team members be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The information follows:\n\n         2005-2006 University of Montana Men's Basketball Team\n\n       Coaches: Larry Krystkowiak, Head Coach; Andy Hill; Brad \n     Huse; and Wayne Tinkle.\n       Players: Mike Chavez; Kevin Criswell; Matt Dlouhy; Bryan \n     Ellis; Jordan Hasquet; Matt Martin; Virgil Matthews; Stuart \n     Mayes; John Seyfert; Kyle Sharp; Greg Spurgetis; Andrew \n     Strait; Austin Swift; and Eric Van Vliet.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/25/senate-section/article/S3502-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO VICTOR FONTANEZ\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Mr. Victor \nFontanez of Platte City, MO. Mr. Fontanez is a World War II veteran who \nserved with distinction in Europe from 1942 to 1945.\n  Mr. Fontanez joined the Army in January of 1941, 11 months before the \nattacks on Pearl Harbor. He recognized the need for soldiers to answer \nthe call, and swiftly volunteered for service wherever he could be \nused. Joining Company B, 47th Infantry Battalion, 9th Division, Mr. \nFontanez was quickly shipped to North Africa where he participated in \nthe larger Battle of Tunisia against German Field Marshal Erwin \nRommel's vaunted Afrika Korps.\n  In April of 1943, near the town of El Guettar, his battalion was \ngiven orders to go over the top of an important hill. As he ran down \nthe hill towards the enemy, a mortar shell exploded close to him, \nsending shrapnel into the left side of his body. Despite profuse \nbleeding, he continued on to the bottom of the hill and took cover near \na large rock. Another mortar hit the rock, sending concussions through \nhis body and making it difficult to breathe. After the attack, his \nfellow heroes helped him back to the headquarters, where he was patched \nup quickly and evacuated to an American hospital in Oran.\n  For the wounds he suffered that day, he was awarded the Purple Heart.\n  After his recovery, he was assigned to the 36th Infantry Division as \na combat engineer. He was a crucial part of the landing forces at \nSalerno Bay, Italy. After securing their positions, they were given \norders to help reinforce the Anzio beachhead, and then to take \nVelletri, one of the key cities that the Germans used in the defense of \nRome. After the Nazis fell, his division marched through the streets of \nRome to a hero's welcome. After the liberation of Rome, his division \nwas sent off on ships to another crucial mission: the invasion of \nsouthern France.\n  It was during Operation Dragoon on the beaches of France that Mr. \nFontanez would earn his highest award for valor. While the troops \nadvanced inland from the landing area, a low-flying plane dropped a \nbomb onboard one of the ships in the bay, causing explosions and major \nfires.\n  After seeing a number of badly burned men jump from the ship with \ntheir clothes on fire--and with total disregard for his own safety--he \nentered the water and was able to swim several safely to shore.\n  For this selfless act of bravery, he was awarded the Soldier's Medal.\n  Later he rejoined his company and was able to help drive the Germans \nout of Cannes and Grenoble. Moving through the cold snow, they rested \nwhere they could. As Christmas 1944 approached, the 36th was hoping for \na lull in fighting, but German forces launched an attack to the north. \nAfter successfully defending their positions, the 36th renewed the \noffense and crossed the Rhine River into Germany in late March 1945. It \nwas shortly after this that Mr. Fontanez got his well-deserved rest, \nand was expedited home for extended leave.\n  Like so many of his generation, Mr. Fontanez's success extended \nbeyond the battlefield. He fathered two children: a son, Victor, Jr., \nwho is now a retired military officer; and a daughter, Edith, who \ncurrently lives in Platte City and works with Support Our Troops & \nVets.\n  He is the proud grandfather of six grandchildren and great-\ngrandfather of four, and counts a military chaplain, two Army soldiers, \na Guardsman, an attorney, and a social worker in his lineage. Nearing \n90 years of age, Victor Fontanez is a proud member and example of our \n``greatest generation,'' and should be commended for his bravery in \nhelping secure the freedoms we all enjoy. On this day, I encourage my \ncolleagues to stand with me in praising the service of this true hero, \nVictor Fontanez.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/25/senate-section/article/S3502-2", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN MEMORY OF MARCO ANTONIO FIREBAUGH\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, California has lost a fine, young \nleader. Marco Antonio Firebaugh, former California Assembly majority \nfloor leader, representing the 50th assembly district, and chair of the \nCalifornia Latino Legislative Caucus, recently passed away. I would \nlike to take a few moments to recognize Marco Antonio Firebaugh's many \nimportant accomplishments and the tremendous impact he made as a leader \nin California.\n  Born in Baja California, Mexico, Firebaugh served three terms as a \nmember of the California State Assembly and one term as the majority \nfloor leader. In 1998, he was first elected to the California State \nAssembly, representing the 50th assembly district. During his tenure, \nhe fought for the rights of all Californians, including immigrants and \ntheir children, with passion and great success. Under his leadership, \nthe California State Assembly passed legislation that focused on \nincreasing the availability of education to all California residents.\n  He led the effort to appoint more qualified Latinos and Latinas to \nhigh-level positions in State government, including the appointment of \nonly the second Latino to serve on the California Supreme Court, the \nfirst Latina to serve as chancellor of a University of California \ncampus, and two additional Latino presidents at the California State \nUniversities at Fresno and Sacramento.\n  Firebaugh worked strenuously to protect and defend the dignity of his \nconstituents, regardless of their immigration status, and remained \ninvolved in community affairs after his departure from the California \nState Assembly. He served as a visiting professor and policy fellow at \nthe UCLA School of Medicine, Center for the Study of Latino Health and \nCulture. Most recently, he decided to reenter public life, as a \ncandidate for the California State Senate, 30th district, and gained \nthe support of many local community leaders, including current 30th \ndistrict State senator Martha Escutia. His dedication to his fellow \nCalifornians will be missed.\n  I invite all of my colleagues to join me in recognizing and honoring \nMarco Antonio Firebaugh for his guidance and leadership in fighting to \nimprove the lives of all Californians. He is survived by his mother, \nCarmen Ramos Garcia; his children, Ariana and Nicolas; brothers, Carlos \nand Jesse; and sisters, Cecilia and Esmeralda.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/25/senate-section/article/S3502-3", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3502-S3503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO MARGARET SULLIVAN WILSON\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I rise to honor one of \nConnecticut's finest educators: Margaret Sullivan Wilson.\n  Peg Wilson is a lifelong resident of Norwich, CT. Throughout her \nlife, she has been dedicated to serving the people of her native city, \nas well as improving educational opportunities for children in \nConnecticut and, indeed, in America.\n\n[[Page S3503]]\n\n  A 1944 graduate of Willimantic State Teachers College--now Eastern \nConnecticut State University--Peg received a bachelor's degree in \neducation. She also attained a master's degree from the University of \nConnecticut. Between 1945 and 1950, she taught at Norwich Elementary \nSchool and was a reading supervisor in the Greenwich Public Schools. \nReturning to Eastern in 1950, Peg devoted herself to improving early \nchildhood education.\n  In particular, Peg has dedicated herself to changing the way young \nstudents are taught. She advocated providing an individual approach to \nearly childhood education, which was considered radical by many \neducators in the early 1950s. However, over the ensuing decades this \napproach has become widely accepted as the best method of preparing \nyoung children for success in school and life.\n  Peg Wilson was ahead of her time in recognizing the importance of \nproviding children a comprehensive and demanding curriculum that \nconsiders each child's strengths and weaknesses. Her determination to \nimprove early education was the driving passion of her career. As both \na teacher and administrator, Peg imparted her ``radical'' theory to \nthousands of prospective teachers and parents during her nearly 40 \nyears at Eastern. This knowledge undoubtedly improved the lives of even \nmore children in Connecticut and throughout the country. For that, we \nshould all be grateful.\n  During, and after her illustrious career at Eastern, Peg remained \nactive in her community. While working at Eastern, Peg served on the \nNorwich Board of Education for 18 years. In addition, she is an \noriginal cofounder of the Norwich Historical Society, which is \ndedicated to promoting the history of that great New England town. In \naddition, she remained active in local politics, even running for city \ncouncil president and State senate. Her contributions to her community \nhave long been acknowledged; Peg received the Norwich Citizen of the \nYear Award in 1970.\n  Although Peg Wilson retired from Eastern in 1989 as vice president \nfor administration and fiscal affairs, her dedication to early \nchildhood development has continued undiminished. Never losing sight of \nher dream of individualized, comprehensive education for young \nchildren, Peg returned to Eastern as an assistant to the president. In \nthis role, she spent nearly 4 years attempting to gain support for a \nfacility on Eastern's campus dedicated to early childhood development. \nHer hard work, alongside that of the president and senior staff of \nEastern, finally paid off. On February 28, 2006, Eastern University \ndedicated the Margaret S. Wilson Child and Family Development Complex. \nThis new complex currently serves 14 children, ages 3 and 4, in a new \ncomprehensive preschool, implementing many of the ideas Margaret Wilson \nhas espoused for almost 60 years. As the center grows, a limited number \nof infants and up to 60 toddlers will be served. In addition, the \ncenter will eventually offer onsite services such as health, education, \nand financial services to the participating families. Peg's vision of \ncomprehensive child development is truly being realized.\n  I would be remiss if I did not mention Peg's family: her late \nhusband, W. Robert Wilson; her daughter, Margaret-Ellen Wilson; and her \nson, Dr. William Wilson, a recipient of Norwich's Native Son Award in \n1999. Their love and support has been instrumental in allowing Peg to \ndevote her career to promoting early childhood development.\n  As a Senator and a father of two young daughters, I am reminded every \nday of the importance of providing quality education early in a child's \nlife. Throughout my career, I have strived to ensure that our country \nmakes early childhood development a national priority. Today, I am \nhonored to praise the work of someone who shares that commitment with \nme.\n  Margaret Wilson has played an integral role in improving thousands of \nyoung students' lives and reshaping early childhood education. The \nMargaret S. Wilson Child and Family Development Complex stands as a \ntestament to one of Connecticut's most admired and visionary educators. \nThis complex will help ensure that future generations of Connecticut \nchildren are provided with a quality education early in life, which is \ncritical for our Nation's future. On behalf of a grateful state and \nnation, I say thank you, Peg Wilson, for all that you have done and \ncontinue to do for the children of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/25/senate-section/article/S3503-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CELEBRATING THE 125TH ANNIVERSARY OF ST.

A bill to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets \nAct of 1968 to clarify that Indian tribes are eligible to receive \ngrants for confronting the use of methamphetamine; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Native \nAmerican Meth Enforcement and Treatment Act of 2006.\n  Unfortunately, when Congress passed the Combat Methamphetamine \nEpidemic Act, tribes were unintentionally left out as eligible \napplicants in some of the newly-authorized grant programs. The bill I \nam introducing today, along with Senators Smith, Baucus, Cantwell, \nInouye, Johnson, Feinstein, Feingold, Murray, and Salazar, would simply \nensure that tribes are able to apply for these funds and give Native \nAmerican communities the resources they need to fight scourge of \nmethamphetamine use.\n  The recently-enacted Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005 \nauthorized new funding for three grant programs. The Act authorized $99 \nmillion in new funding for the COPS Hot Spots program, which helps \nlocal law enforcement agencies obtain the tools they need reduce the \nproduction, distribution, and use of meth. Funding may also be used to \nclean up meth labs, support health and environmental agencies, and to \npurchase equipment and support systems.\n  The Act also authorized $20 million for a Drug-Endangered Children \ngrant program to provide comprehensive services to assist children who \nlive in a home in which meth has been used, manufactured, or sold. \nUnder this program, law enforcement agencies, prosecutors, child \nprotective services, social services, and health care services, work \ntogether to ensure that these children get the help they need.\n  In addition, the Combat Meth Act authorized grants to be made to \naddress the use of meth among pregnant and parenting women offenders. \nThe Pregnant and Parenting Offenders program is aimed at facilitating \ncollaboration between the criminal justice, child welfare, and State \nsubstance abuse systems in order to reduce the use of drugs by pregnant \nwomen and those with dependent children.\n  Although tribes are eligible applicants under the Pregnant and \nParenting Offenders program, they were not included as eligible \napplicants under either the Hot Spots program or the Drug-Endangered \nChildren program. I see no reason why tribes should not be able to \naccess all of these funds.\n  Meth use has had a devastating impact in communities throughout the \ncountry, and Indian Country is no exception. Last month there was an \narticle in the Gallup Independent newspaper about a Navajo grandmother, \nher daughter, and granddaughter, who were all arrested for selling \nmeth. There was also a one-year-old child in the home when police \nexecuted the arrest warrant. It is absolutely disheartening to hear \nabout cases such as this, with three generations of a family destroyed \nby meth.\n  I strongly believe that we need to do everything we can to assist \ncommunities as they struggle to deal with the consequences of meth, and \nensuring that Native American communities are able to access these \nfunds is an important first step. I hope my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting this important measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Graham, and Mr. Frist):\n\n[[Page S3509]]\n\n  S. 2644. A bill to harmonize rate setting standards for copyright \nlicenses under sections 112 and 114 of title 17, United States Code, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nPlatform Equality and Remedies for Rights-holders in Music Act, or the \nPERFORM Act, along with Senators Graham and Frist.\n  The need to protect creative works has been an important principle \nrecognized in our country since its inception.\n  The founding fathers accurately understood the importance of \nintellectual property by including protective language in our \nConstitution, and in doing so they established a principle that would \nstand the test of time.\n  However, they could not have predicted that the path of innovation \nwould eventually produce the amazing new technologies that we now take \nfor granted.\n  While many of us still enjoy traditional analog radio, this, too, is \nrapidly changing. We now have music radio programs provided over the \nInternet, cable, and satellites. Even traditional radio is changing \nwith the advent of new digital radio.\n  With the entry into the marketplace of these new music providers \nconsumers are receiving the songs and artists they enjoy in new and \ninnovative ways.\n  Yet, as these new business models and technologies are developed we \nmust ensure that the artists and musicians who create and perform the \nmusic continue to be fairly compensated for their works.\n  Unfortunately, some of the new innovations have been used to supplant \nmusic sales and avoid fair compensation to the songwriters and \nperformers.\n  From 1999 to 2004, total music sales have declined by 30 percent. \nOver the same period, CD sales declined 18 percent. The decline \ncontinued in 2005 as total album sales fell 7.2 percent year-over-year.\n  Some of this decline is due to outdated business models and \ncompetition from other entertainment products, some due to illegal \nactions and piracy, and some is due to outdated music licensing laws.\n  I believe our laws must strike the proper balance between fostering \nnew business models and technology and protecting the property rights \nof the artists whose music is being broadcast.\n  I strongly support advancements in technology and I encourage \ningenuity. The birth of the digital music place has been a boon for \nbusinesses and consumers. It is important that these new forums succeed \nand grow.\n  However, these new technologies and business models have become so \nadvanced that the clear lines between a listening service and a \nreproduction and copying service has been blurred.\n  Historically, a radio service simply allowed music to be performed \nand listened to by an audience. However, many new services using the \nnew digital transmissions and new technological devices have allowed \nconsumers to also record, manipulate, and collect individual music \nplay-lists off their radio-like services.\n  Thus, what was once a passive listening experience has turned into a \nforum where consumers can record, manipulate, reprogram and save songs \nto create their own personalized playlists.\n  As the modes of distribution change and the technologies change, so \nmust our laws change. The government granted a compulsory license for \nradio-like services by Internet, cable, and satellite providers in \norder to encourage competition and new products.\n  However, as new innovations alter their services from a performance \nto a distribution the law must respond.\n  In addition, as the changing technology evolves, the distinctions \nbetween the services become less and less, and the differences in how \nthey are treated under the statutory license make less sense.\n  Therefore I am introducing a bill that will begin to fix the \ninequities currently in the statute and open the door to further debate \nabout additional issues that need to be addressed.\n  The bill I am introducing today with Senators Graham and Frist would: \ncreate rate parity--all companies covered by the government license \ncreated in Section 114 would be required to pay a fair market value for \nuse of music libraries rather than having different rate standards \napply based on what medium is being used to transmit the music; and \nestablish content protection--all companies would be required to use \nreasonably available, technologically feasible, and economically \nreasonable means to prevent music theft. In addition, a company may not \nprovide a recording device to a customer that would allow him or her to \ncreate their own personalized music library that can be manipulated and \nmaintained without paying a reproduction royalty.\n  This does not mean such devices cannot be made or distributed. It \nsimply means that the business must negotiate the payment for the music \nthrough the market rather than under the statutory license.\n  The bill also contains language to make sure that consumers' current \nrecording habits are not inhibited. Therefore, any recording the \nconsumer chooses to do manually will still be allowed. In addition, if \nthe device allows the consumer to manipulate music by program, channel, \nor time period that would still be allowable under the statutory \nlicense.\n  For example, if a listener chooses to automatically record a news \nstation every morning at 9:00; a jazz station every afternoon at 2:00; \na blues station every Friday at 3:00; and a talk radio show every \nSaturday at 4:00; that would be allowable. In addition, that listener \ncould then use their recording device to move these programs so that \nall programs of the same genre are back to back.\n  What a listener cannot do is set a recording device to find all the \nFrank Sinatra songs being played on the radio-service and only record \nthose songs. By making these distinctions this bill supports new \nbusiness models and technologies without harming the songwriters and \nperformers in the process.\n  Unfortunately, anytime legislation is introduced there is a lot of \nmisinformation about what it does. Often criticisms are lobbed without \nreviewing the actual text of the bill. So, let me be clear about some \nof the concerns I have heard.\n  The bill would not apply to over-the-air broadcasting. Terrestrial \nradio, i.e. traditional radio distributed by the broadcasters is not \ncovered under this bill. This legislation only covers businesses that \nare under the 114 license--Internet, cable, and satellite.\n  The only application to broadcasters would be if they were to act as \nwebcasters and simulcast their programs over the Internet, in which \ncase they would be treated the same as all other Internet radio \nproviders.\n  The bill would not inhibit technological advances. It would place \nlimits on the types of recording devices cable, Internet and satellite \nproviders may offer, IF they want to enjoy the benefit of a government \nlicense.\n  If, however, a company wants to offer new technologies that allow for \nmanipulation of music so that a consumer may create their own music \nlibraries, similar to a downloading service, they may. There is nothing \nin this bill prohibiting the use or creation of new technologies the \ncompany would simply lose the benefit of a government license.\n\n  The bill simply states that if a company wants to change its service \nfrom a performance to a distribution then they no longer are covered by \nthe government license and must go to the record companies directly to \nnegotiate a licensing agreement through the market.\n  The bill would not be discriminatory. Some argue that changing the \nrates or establishing content protection is discriminatory. However, \nunder current law some businesses are required to pay higher licensing \nrates than others even though they provide essentially the same \nservices.\n  In addition, if a new satellite company were to be formed today they \nwould be required to pay a higher rate than the current two companies \nin the market--that is not fair. Instead this bill would establish the \nsame rates and protections for all companies.\n  The argument that this bill is discriminatory ignores the inequities \nof current law as it applies to Internet, cable, old and new satellite \nproviders and instead focuses on the differences between these new \nradio providers versus terrestrial or traditional over-the-air radio.\n\n[[Page S3510]]\n\n  The argument is that there are already devices available and new \ntechnologies that allow consumers to capture and manipulate music being \nplayed by over-the-air broadcasters. Yet this bill does not apply to \nbroadcasters and instead only applies to Internet, cable and satellite.\n  The conclusion being that by not covering broadcasters we are giving \nthem a free pass and being unfair to the new businesses.\n  While the obvious argument is that the Judiciary Committee does not \nhave jurisdiction to regulate over-the-air broadcasters, I think it is \nimportant to acknowledge that the Commerce Committee is actively \nlooking into this issue right now. In addition, I am aware that there \nare active negotiations occurring between broadcasters and the record \nlabels to develop similar protections for their services.\n  Thus, while some may be frustrated that jurisdiction may lie in \ndifferent committees, efforts are on-going in each to address these \nissues. I do not believe we, in the Judiciary Committee, should wait \nand do nothing to protect artists and songwriters simply because the \nCommerce Committee has not yet moved legislation to deal with the same \nconcern for terrestrial radio.\n  Having said that, let me be clear, this is the beginning of a process \nto address a very specific problem. I believe that as the process \nunfolds there will be additional improvements or other issues that may \nneed to be added.\n  Already, some have raised questions about language in the bill and \nadditional modifications to Section 114 that I believe should be looked \nat more closely.\n  I understand there is some concern about what fair market value \nmeans, especially under a government licensing scheme where there is \nnot an actual competitive market. I think it makes sense to look into \nthis issue and see if there is a definition that can be developed.\n  In doing this, I believe we should look at all the different models \nthat have been used. We should look at what the courts have held, what \nthe copyright office has used, what a real competitive market would \nentail, as well as other factors that may not have been considered.\n  The bill as introduced does not address the other conditions applied \nto Internet, cable, and satellite services in order for them to get the \nbenefit of the statutory license. The one that I am most concerned with \nis interactivity.\n  I think there is real confusion about what is and what is not allowed \nunder the current statute. How much personalization and customization \nmay these new services offer?\n  Currently licensing rates are higher for interactive services. \nHowever, there are clear disagreements as to what constitutes an \ninteractive service.\n  I tried to have the parties meet to negotiate a solution to this \nissue so that we could include new language this in the bill.\n  However, after two weeks and hours and hours of negotiations the \nparties were so far apart that a solution could not be reached. Despite \nthis, I still believe this is an important issue that must be \naddressed.\n  Therefore, I put a placeholder in the bill that calls for the \ncopyright office to make recommendations to Congress, but I am hopeful \nthat through the process of moving this bill through the Senate we can \ndevelop a solution sooner rather than later.\n  I am hopeful that the parties will again meet and try to develop a \ncompromise, however, if that does not occur I may try to work with my \ncolleagues to develop a legislative solution independently.\n  Finally, some have raised concerns that applying content protection \nto all providers is unfair. They argue that if there is no connection \nbetween the distributor of the music and the technology provider that \nallows for copying and manipulating of performances then they should \nnot be required to protect the music that they broadcast.\n  In general, I do not agree. We know that there are websites out there \nnow that provide so-called stream-ripping services that allow an \nindividual to steal music off an Internet webcast. It is not enough to \nturn a blind eye to this type of piracy and do nothing simply because \nthere is no formal connection between the businesses.\n  At the same time, I am sympathetic to the concerns that if the type \nof technology a company uses is inadequate or ineffective, through no \nfault of their own, they can be saddled with huge mandatory penalties. \nI am willing to look at this issue more closely and see if there is \nsome way to address this concern and find a compromise solution.\n  As I have said, this is the beginning of the process. I think this \nlegislation is a good step forward in addressing a real problem that is \noccurring in the music industry.\n  Changes or additions may be necessary as the bill moves forward, but \nI believe to wait and do nothing does a disservice to all involved.\n  Music is an invaluable part of all of our lives. The new technologies \nand changing delivery systems provide exciting new options for all \nconsumers. As we continue to move forward into new frontiers we must \nensure that our laws can stand the test of time.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord along with letters of support for the legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2644\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The bill--introduced \n     today by Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Lindsey Graham (R-\n     SC)--would reform the appropriate section of copyright law to \n     assure satellite services play by the same rules as Internet \n     music services--both in rate setting and content protection \n     standards.\n       ``There is a critical need for the government to harmonize \n     the current protections and rate regimes that make for the \n     haphazard patchwork covering digital music services today,'' \n     said RIAA Chairman and CEO Mitch Bainwol. ``This patchwork is \n     allowing satellite radio to morph into something altogether \n     different--a digital distribution service--with the creators \n     of music left in the lurch. This legislation seeks to right \n     that wrong and ensure a marketplace where fair competition \n     can thrive. We're extremely grateful for the leadership of \n     Senators Feinstein and Graham. This bill moves us far closer \n     to achieving the platform parity that is so key to the health \n     of the music industry in years to come.''\n       The digital music marketplace is undergoing a convergence \n     across all platforms--a convergence creating arbitrary \n     advantages for certain services over others at the expense of \n     creators. While offering great opportunities for the music \n     community, satellite broadcasters and music fans, the \n     convergence of radio-like services and downloading capability \n     requires changes in the law to protect against a satellite \n     company transforming its model into a download service \n     without the appropriate license.\n       The RIAA and others in the music community have made it \n     clear that satellite radio services should be required to \n     obtain a license in the marketplace to offer the capability \n     to cherry pick individual songs and then permanently store \n     them in a digital library. Legislation--such as the \n     Feinstein-Graham bill--is needed to ensure that satellite \n     services play by the same set of rules everyone else does and \n     not profit from becoming a download/subscription model \n     without acquiring the appropriate license and compensating \n     artists and songwriters.\n       Because traditional terrestrial radio is not covered by the \n     government license or this legislation, private market \n     negotiations on measures to similarly protect high-definition \n     (HD) radio are currently in progress. The RIAA has also \n     praised the introduction of legislation by Rep. Mike Ferguson \n     (R-NJ) that requires users of free government spectrum to \n     protect content delivered through HD radio receivers through \n     private market agreements.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 2646. A bill to create a 3-year pilot program that makes small, \nnonprofit child care businesses eligible for loans under title V of the \nSmall Business Investment Act of 1958; to the Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as Congress comes back in session for a \nfive-week work period, it is high time we put partisan bickering aside \nand take up real issues that will improve the lives of America's hard-\nworking families. Today, I rise to address one such problem--the \ngrowing shortage of quality child care for our country's future \ngenerations. Over the past 50 years, the United States has witnessed a \n43 percent increase in the number of dual-\n\n[[Page S3512]]\n\nearner and single-parent families. Furthermore, the Census Bureau \nestimates that more than six million children are left home alone on a \nregular basis. Nationwide, more households than ever are struggling to \nmake ends meet, while providing safe, nurturing environments for their \nchildren to grow up in. For many, child care is not a choice, but a \nnecessity in this endeavor. That is why we owe it to our Nation's \nfamilies to increase the availability of quality child care--because \nstrong, healthy families build a stronger America.\n  As the Ranking Member on the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I firmly believe that we can work with the Small \nBusiness Administration (SBA) to cultivate and expand existing child \ncare facilities. In light of this, I rise today to introduce the Child \nCare Lending Pilot Act of 2006, which establishes a three-year pilot \nprogram enabling small, non-profit child care businesses to be eligible \nfor the SBA's 504 loans.\n  With affordable fixed low interest rates and long terms, 504 loans \nplay a vital role in spurring economic development and the rebuilding \nof communities. Current law permits for-profit child care small \nbusinesses to finance building repairs and expand existing facilities \nthrough these 504 loans. However, their non-profit counterparts are \nunable to access the same financing through the SBA. Given that the \nmajority of child care centers in many States across the country \noperate as non-profits, this system is shutting out the lion's share of \nfacilities from obtaining necessary funds to provide quality care for \nthe families they serve. The Child Care Lending Pilot Act of 2006 \nreverses this trend. By allowing non-profit child care businesses to \napply for 504 lending, the legislation enables these entities to put \ndown only 10 to 20 percent of the loan with a term of up to 20 years. \nWith low, predictable monthly payments, these non-profit centers can \nthen invest in the families they provide services to, by updating and \nimproving their buildings and materials without breaking the bank or \nraising fees.\n  Since the industry is not high-earning overall, a majority of child \ncare centers do not have an abundance of easily accessible capital. \nProposals that call for centers to simply charge less or cut back on \nemployees are not the way to make child care more affordable for \nfamilies and do not serve in the children's best interests. An adequate \nstaff is crucial in ensuring that children receive proper supervision \nand support to foster their development and learning. Furthermore, if \ncenters are asked to decrease operating costs in order to lower costs \nabsorbed by families, the safety and quality of the child care provided \nwould most likely be in jeopardy.\n  In recent years, the Children's Defense Fund estimated that in all \nbut one State, the average annual cost of child care in urban area \nchild care centers is more than the average annual cost of public \ncollege tuition. Additionally, they projected that child care can \neasily cost between $4,000 to $10,000 per year in cities and States \nacross the Nation. Clearly, these high costs pose virtually \ninsurmountable hurdles for low-income families in need of quality care \nfor their children. Although many States have implemented grant and \nloan programs to help these child care small businesses, more must be \ndone--not only to improve the quality of care, but also the overall \nsupply of child care facilities for the Nation's neediest families.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation and allow \nnon-profit child care providers to access SBA 504 financing for their \nfacilities and the children they serve. Funded entirely through fees, \nthis legislation requires no appropriation. Additionally, it is \nconsistent with the three-year SBA reauthorization cycle. This \nlegislation is the product of work on this issue in both the 107th and \n108th Congresses. Similar legislation was introduced in 2002, S. 2891, \nhowever the four year provision made this program inconsistent with the \ncycle of SBA reauthorization. To remedy this, I reintroduced the \nmeasure in 2003 as S. 822, making the act a three-year pilot program \nconsistent with the cycle of reauthorization. This pilot program was \nalso part of the larger Senate Small Business reauthorization \nlegislation in the last Congress, S. 1375. Unfortunately, this \ninnovative proposal to expand child care, which had bipartisan support, \nwas cut out of the final authorization package when a scaled-back \nversion of the reauthorization legislation, without most Democratic \ninitiatives, was added to the FY2005 omnibus appropriations bill.\n  Although there is no quick-fix solution for the Nation's child care \nshortage and lack of quality facilities, this bill marks an important \nstep in the right direction by allowing non-profit child care centers \nto receive SBA loans. I hope that my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle will recognize the vital role that early education plays in the \ndevelopment of fine minds and productive citizens, and realize that in \nthis great Nation, child care should be available to all families in \nall income brackets. The Child Care Lending Pilot Act of 2006 is a \nsound investment in our Nation's future--our children.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2646\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Education to make \ngrants to educational organizations to carry out educational programs \nabout the Holocaust; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Simon \nWiesenthal Holocaust Education Assistance Act.'' This important \nlegislation would provide competitive grants for educational \norganizations to make Holocaust education more accessible and available \nthroughout this Nation.\n  And I would like to thank my colleague Senator DeWine for \ncosponsoring this legislation and my former colleague in the House, \nCongresswoman Maloney, for her leadership on this issue.\n  This legislation could not come at a more important and solemn day in \nour lives. Today is Yom Hashoah, a day when we commemorate the \napproximately six million men, women and children of Jewish faith, as \nwell as millions of others who were persecuted and murdered 65 years \nago in a systematic, state sponsored genocide. Today, we also honor \nthose who stood up against the genocide and risked their own lives to \nsave others.\n  Today we stand in solidarity with Israel and the Jewish faith, and \nwith all people throughout the world, in remembering these tragic \nevents.\n  And today we honor Simon Wiesenthal who dedicated his life to making \nsure that those who perpetrated the horrors of the Holocaust were \nbrought to justice.\n  Sixty-five years may seem like a lifetime away, and generations may \nhave been raised thinking that the Holocaust, and events like it, is \nfrom a distant past. But let me be clear--these events are not so \ndistant and are not in the past. In fact, they are in our present.\n  Just recently, Iran's president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad hatefully and \noutrageously declared the Holocaust a ``myth'' and Israel a ``fake \nregime'' which ``cannot continue to live.''\n  And just two months ago, an anti-Semitic gang that calls themselves \n``the Barbarians'' tortured 23-year-old Ilan Halimi, a young Jewish \nman, for three weeks before leaving him for dead near a train station \nin Paris.\n  It is these events that make us aware of the destructive messages of \nhate and violence that arise from Holocaust denial. It is these events \nthat show us the importance of Holocaust education, abroad and in our \nown Nation.\n  For although some States now require the Holocaust to be taught in \npublic schools, this legislation goes further and makes grants \navailable to organizations that teach students, teachers, and \ncommunities the dangers of hate and the importance of tolerance in our \nsociety. This legislation would give educators the appropriate \nresources and training to teach accurate historical information about \nthe Holocaust and convey the lessons that the Holocaust provides for \nall people.\n  We must recognize that by remembering the millions who were murdered \nin the Holocaust, we create a sense of responsibility to stop genocide \nwherever it takes place. But we must also remember that hate crimes and \ngenocide could, and are still, happening today.\n  We are reminded, through the deplorable comments made by Iranian \nPresident Ahmadinejad against Israel and through the murder of young \nIlan Halimi in France that anti-Semitism still exists even 65 years \nafter the Holocaust. The awful acts of murder and rape in Darfur are a \nhorrific example of genocide in the 21st century.\n  And those who believe that anti-Semitism is an attack that need not \nbe answered by those who are not Jewish do not recognize the \nconsequences of history. In fact, an attack against anyone simply \nbecause of race or religion is ultimately the beginning of the \nunraveling of civilization. It is in our common interest to raise our \nvoices against anti-Semitism and against all hatred and discrimination.\n  We must fight the chorus of anti-Semitism and fight the fear and the \nhate. As a Nation proud of our diverse heritage, we must, each of us, \ntake a stand. With our words, but most importantly with our actions, we \nwill turn the tide against this new wave of anti-Semitism. And funding \naccurate educational programs on the Holocaust is a step toward winning \nthis battle.\n  In the words of Samantha Power, a renowned expert on genocide, ``the \nsharpest challenge to the world of bystanders is posed by those who \nhave refused to remain silent in the age of genocide.''\n  So today, the United States of America stands with Israel and all \nfollowers of the Jewish faith in commemorating Yom Hashoah, and \ncondemning all anti-Semitism and hatred. And I am proud to join in the \nstand against anti-Semitism here and around the world.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Reed):\n  S.J. Res. 34. A joint resolution expressing United States policy on \nIraq; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe\n\n[[Page S3514]]\n\njoint resolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the joint resolution was \nordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 34\n\n       Whereas there has been a strong consensus among the senior \n     United States military commanders that a broad-based \n     political settlement involving the three main Iraqi groups is \n     essential for defeating the insurgency;\n       Whereas the two parts of that political settlement are (1) \n     agreement on a national unity government that serves the \n     interests of all Iraqis, and (2) compromises to amend the \n     Iraq Constitution to make it an inclusive document;\n       Whereas such a two-part political settlement is also \n     essential to prevent all-out civil war and is a critical \n     element of our exit strategy for United States military \n     forces in Iraq;\n       Whereas the Iraqi Council of Representatives' approval on \n     April 22, 2006, of the Presidency Council consisting of Jalal \n     Talabani as President and two Vice Presidents, and the \n     election of a Speaker and two Deputy Speakers is a \n     significant step, as is the decision by the Iraqi political \n     leadership to select Jawad al-Maliki as the Prime Minister \n     designate;\n       Whereas the Council of Representatives still needs to \n     consider the nomination of Jawad al-Maliki and his still-to-\n     be-chosen Cabinet, including an Interior Minister and a \n     Defense Minister, and still needs to form a committee to \n     recommend changes to the Iraq Constitution;\n       Whereas under the Iraq Constitution, Prime Minister \n     designate Jawad al-Maliki has 30 days from April 22, 2006, to \n     choose and present a Cabinet to the Council of \n     Representatives for its approval;\n       Whereas under the Iraq Constitution, the Council of \n     Representatives, at the start of its functioning, is required \n     to appoint a committee from its members which will have four \n     months to present recommendations to the Council for \n     necessary amendments to the Iraq Constitution;\n       Whereas while the three main Iraqi groups have differing \n     views about the duration of the presence in Iraq of the \n     United States-led Coalition forces, none of them favor the \n     immediate withdrawal of United States military forces from \n     Iraq;\n       Whereas section 1227 of the National Defense Authorization \n     Act for Fiscal Year 2006 (Public Law 109--163; 119 Stat. \n     3465; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note) provides in part that ``[t]he \n     Administration should tell the leaders of all groups and \n     political parties in Iraq that they need to make the \n     compromises necessary to achieve the broad-based and \n     sustainable political settlement that is essential for \n     defeating the insurgency in Iraq, within the timetable they \n     set for themselves'';\n       Whereas the United States Ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay \n     Khalilzad, has done an exceptional job in working with Iraqi \n     political, religious, and tribal leaders in an effort to \n     achieve consensus on the prompt formation of a national unity \n     government; and\n       Whereas the American public has become increasingly and \n     understandably impatient with the failure of the Iraqis to \n     form a national unity government: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That it is \n     the sense of Congress that the Iraqi political, religious, \n     and tribal leaders should be told by the Administration \n     that--\n       (1) the continued presence of United States military forces \n     in Iraq is not unconditional;\n       (2) whether the Iraqis avoid all-out civil war and have a \n     future as a nation is in their hands;\n       (3) the Iraqis need to seize that opportunity and only they \n     can be responsible for their own future; and\n       (4) completing the formation of a government of national \n     unity and subsequent agreement to modifications to the Iraq \n     Constitution to make it more inclusive, within the deadlines \n     the Iraqis have set for themselves in the Iraq Constitution, \n     is--\n       (A) essential to defeating the insurgency and avoiding all-\n     out civil war; and\n       (B) a condition of the continued presence of United States \n     military forces in Iraq.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/25/senate-section/article/S3514-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3514-S3515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 441--EXPRESSING THE SUPPORT OF THE SENATE FOR THE \n RECONVENING OF THE PARLIAMENT OF NEPAL AND FOR AN IMMEDIATE PEACEFUL \n                        TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY\n\n  Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Biden, and Mr. Leahy) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                              S. Res. 441\n\n       Whereas, in 1990, Nepal adopted a constitution that \n     enshrined multi-party democracy under a constitutional \n     monarchy, ending 3 decades of absolute monarchical rule;\n       Whereas, since 1996, Maoist insurgents have waged a violent \n     campaign to replace the constitutional monarchy with a \n     communist republic, which has resulted in widespread human \n     rights violations by both sides and the loss of an estimated \n     12,000 lives;\n       Whereas the Maoist insurgency grew out of the \n     radicalization and fragmentation of left wing parties \n     following Nepal's transition to democracy in 1990;\n       Whereas, on June 1, 2001, King Birendra, Queen Aishwarya \n     and other members of the Royal family were murdered, leaving \n     the throne to the slain King's brother, the current King \n     Gyanendra;\n       Whereas, in May 2002, in the face of increasing Maoist \n     violence, Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba dissolved the \n     Parliament of Nepal;\n       Whereas, in October 2002, King Gyanendra dismissed Prime \n     Minister Deuba;\n       Whereas, in June 2004, after the unsuccessful tenures of 2 \n     additional palace-appointed prime ministers, King Gyanendra \n     reappointed Prime Minister Deuba and mandated that he hold \n     general elections by April 2005;\n       Whereas, on February 1, 2005, King Gyanendra accused Nepali \n     political leaders of failing to solve the Maoist problem, \n     seized absolute control of Nepal by dismissing and detaining \n     Prime Minister Deuba and declaring a state of emergency, \n     temporarily shut down Nepal's communications, detained \n     hundreds of politicians and political workers, and limited \n     press and other constitutional freedoms;\n       Whereas, in November 2005, the mainstream political parties \n     formed a seven-party alliance with the Maoists and agreed to \n     a 12 point agenda that called for a restructuring of the \n     government of Nepal to include an end to absolute monarchical \n     rule and the formation of an interim all-party government \n     with a view to holding elections for a constituent assembly \n     to rewrite the Constitution of Nepal;\n       Whereas, since February 2005, King Gyanendra has \n     promulgated dozens of ordinances without parliamentary \n     process that violate basic freedoms of expression and \n     association, including the Election Code of Conduct that \n     seeks to limit media freedom in covering elections and the \n     Code of Conduct for Social Organizations that bars staff of \n     nongovernmental organizations from having political \n     affiliations;\n       Whereas King Gyanendra ordered the arrest of hundreds of \n     political workers in January 2006 before holding municipal \n     elections on February 8, 2006, which the Department of State \n     characterized as ``a hollow attempt by the King to legitimize \n     his power'';\n       Whereas the people of Nepal have been peacefully protesting \n     since April 6, 2006, in an attempt to restore the democratic \n     political process;\n       Whereas on April 10, 2006, the Department of State declared \n     that King Gyanendra's February 2005 decision ``to impose \n     direct palace rule in Nepal has failed in every regard'' and \n     called on the King to restore democracy immediately and to \n     begin a dialogue with Nepal's political parties;\n       Whereas King Gyanendra ordered a crackdown on the protests, \n     which has left at least 14 Nepali citizens dead and hundreds \n     injured by the security forces of Nepal;\n       Whereas the people of Nepal are suffering hardship due to \n     food shortages and lack of sufficient medical care because of \n     the prevailing political crisis;\n       Whereas King Gyanendra announced on April 21, 2006, that \n     the executive power of Nepal shall be returned to the people \n     and called on the seven-party alliance to name a new prime \n     minister to govern the country in accordance with the 1990 \n     Constitution of Nepal;\n       Whereas the seven-party alliance subsequently rejected King \n     Gyanendra's April 21, 2006 statement and called on him to \n     reinstate parliament and allow for the establishment of a \n     constituent assembly to draw up a new constitution;\n       Whereas on April 24, 2006, King Gyanendra announced that he \n     would reinstate the Parliament of Nepal on April 28, 2006, \n     and apologized for the deaths and injuries that occurred \n     during the recent demonstrations, but did not address the \n     issue of constitutional revision;\n       Whereas political party leaders have welcomed King \n     Gyanendra's April 24th announcement and stated that the first \n     action of the reconvened parliament will be the scheduling of \n     elections for a constituent assembly to redraft the \n     Constitution of Nepal.\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses its support for the reconvening of the \n     Parliament of Nepal and for an immediate, peaceful transition \n     to democracy;\n       (2) commends the desire of the people of Nepal for a \n     democratic system of government and expresses its support for \n     their right to protest peacefully in pursuit of this goal;\n       (3) acknowledges the April 24, 2006 statement by King \n     Gyanendra regarding his intent to reinstate the Parliament of \n     Nepal;\n       (4) urges the Palace, the political parties, and the \n     Maoists to immediately support a process that returns the \n     country to multi-party democracy and creates the conditions \n     for peace and stability in Nepal;\n       (5) declares that the transition to democracy in Nepal must \n     be peaceful and that violence conducted by any party is \n     unacceptable and risks sending Nepal into a state of anarchy;\n       (6) calls on security forces of Nepal to exercise maximum \n     restraint and to uphold the highest standards of conduct in \n     their response to the protests;\n\n[[Page S3515]]\n\n       (7) urges the immediate release of all political detainees \n     and the restoration of full civilian and political rights, \n     including freedom of association, expression, and assembly;\n       (8) urges the Maoists to lay down their arms and to pursue \n     their goals through participation in a peaceful political \n     process; and\n       (9) calls on the Government of the United States to work \n     closely with other governments, including the governments of \n     India, China, the United Kingdom, and the European Union, and \n     with the United Nations to ensure a common and coherent \n     international approach that helps to bring about an immediate \n     peaceful transition to democracy and to end the violent \n     insurgency in Nepal.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, as Members are aware, Nepal has been \ngripped by demonstrations in support of democracy for the past 20 days. \nAt least 14 Nepali citizens have been killed in these protests and \nhundreds more injured. The demonstrations follow 14 months of direct \nrule by King Gyanendra and February 8, 2006, municipal elections that \nthe State Department characterized as a ``hollow attempt by the King to \nlegitimize his power.''\n  I am submitting today a resolution expressing the Senate's support \nfor the reconvening of the Nepali parliament and for an immediate, \npeaceful transition to a democratic political process in the country. \nThis resolution urges the King, political parties, and Maoists to \nsupport a process that returns the country to multi-party democracy and \ncreates the conditions for peace and stability in the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/25/senate-section/article/S3515-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3515-S3516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 442--EXPRESSING THE DEEP DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE SENATE \n WITH RESPECT TO THE ELECTION OF IRAN TO A LEADERSHIP POSITION IN THE \n UNITED NATIONS DISARMAMENT COMMISSION AND REQUESTING THE PRESIDENT TO \nWITHHOLD FUNDING TO THE UNITED NATIONS UNLESS CREDIBLE REFORMS ARE MADE\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 442\n\n       Whereas the United Nations has continuously failed to meet \n     minimal reform expectations, including those outlined in the \n     September Summit Outcome Document;\n       Whereas the United Nations has allowed member states acting \n     in defiance of their obligations to the United Nations to \n     enjoy full participatory rights and leadership positions in \n     all bodies of the United Nations;\n       Whereas the mandate of the charter of the United Nations \n     that protects international peace and security is \n     significantly hindered by the placement of pariah states in \n     leadership positions within various commissions;\n       Whereas the credibility of the United Nations has been \n     further crippled by the fact that Iran was elected to serve \n     as the vice chair of the Asia regional group of the United \n     Nations Disarmament Commission;\n       Whereas Iran has committed many acts of malfeasance with \n     respect to its nuclear program that makes it an unacceptable \n     candidate for the United Nations Disarmament Commission, \n     including--\n       (1) developing a clandestine nuclear program for 18 years \n     prior to 2003;\n       (2) repeatedly deceiving the International Atomic Energy \n     Agency about a variety of nuclear-related activities;\n       (3) failing to provide inspectors from the International \n     Atomic Energy Agency with access to various nuclear sites;\n       (4) refusing to answer questions related to its nuclear \n     program;\n       (5) reneging on its commitments under the Paris Accords of \n     November 2004, which included the suspension of uranium \n     enrichment activities; and\n       (6) announcing its success in achieving uranium enrichment \n     capabilities, which represented a brazen affront to the \n     international community;\n       Whereas other actions and rhetoric by Iran have perpetuated \n     its record of terror and tyranny, and warranted its isolation \n     from the international community at the United Nations, \n     including--\n       (1) continuing its calls for the annihilation of Israel, \n     which is a member state of the United Nations;\n       (2) actively sponsoring terrorism through groups including \n     Hezbollah, Hamas, and Islamic Jihad, which prompted the \n     Department of State to classify Iran as the ``most active \n     state sponsor of terrorism in 2004''; and\n       (3) continuing its efforts to destabilize neighboring \n     countries by meddling in the affairs of those countries, \n     including Iraq, Israel, and Lebanon; and\n       Whereas, while Iran continues to enjoy full participatory \n     rights and privileges as a member state of the United \n     Nations, the overall conduct of Iran is a direct threat to \n     world security and violates numerous fundamental principles \n     on which the United Nations is based: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses its deep disappointment with respect to the \n     failure of the Asia group members of the United Nations \n     Disarmament Commission to stop the election of Iran as the \n     vice chair of that body;\n       (2) asserts that the United Nations Disarmament Commission \n     has no credibility on disarmament issues due to the \n     participation of Iran, particularly in light of the defiance \n     of Iran in disregarding resolutions passed by the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency and the Security Council \n     Presidential Statement relating to its nuclear program;\n       (3) calls on the United States to reject all resolutions \n     passed by the discredited United Nations Disarmament \n     Commission;\n       (4) condemns the continued intransigence of Iran with \n     respect to its--\n       (A) nuclear program;\n       (B) treatment of Israel;

and\n       (B) any commission of the United Nations in which the worst \n     violators of the principles it claims to promote are included \n     in its membership, including the new Human Rights Council;\n       (6) calls on the United Nations to deny Iran from \n     participating in any commission of the United Nations until \n     it--\n       (A) complies with its obligations under the Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty and International Atomic Energy Agency \n     resolutions;\n       (B) halts--\n       (i) all uranium enrichment activities;

and\n       (B) exercise the option of the President to withhold \n     funding unless credible reforms are made prior to discussions \n     on the biannual budget.\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise to submit a sense-of-the Senate \nresolution expressing the deepest disappointment of the Senate with \nrespect to the election of Iran to a leadership position on the United \nNations Disarmament Commission and request the President to withhold \nfunding to the United Nations unless credible reforms are made.\n  A couple of observations, Mr. President. In light of the Oil-For-Food \nscandal, it was my great hope that we would see a movement toward \nreform in the United Nations. The Secretary General had put forth some \nproposed reforms. There was some discussion about whether the U.N. \nCommission on Human Rights was going to be reformed. Unfortunately, the \nenergy was there, the hope was there, and we seemed to be moving in the \nwrong direction.\n  On May 9, for the new Human Rights Council, elections will be held. \nIt appears that Cuba may be appointed to the new Human Rights Council.\n  The recommendations from the Secretary General for minimum reform are \nnow coming under attack by something called the G-77, the underlying \nnations, which may dismantle those. A little tremor occurred just about \na week ago, and to some people it may be a little thing, but it is not. \nIt is symbolic of some of the things we face with the United Nations.\n  Just recently, Iran was elected to the U.N. Disarmament Commission. \nSome may say that this is a very minor commission; it is an inactive \nforum; it only meets 3 weeks a year, the U.N. Commission on \nDisarmament. We have Iran out there thumbing its nose at the \ninternational community hell-bent on getting a nuclear weapon. And by \nthe way, they said what they are going to do with it. They said they \nwant to destroy Israel. That is what they said they are going to do. \nHitler told us what he wanted to do and the world didn't listen. God \nforbid there is an explosion of an atomic weapon in Tel Aviv or Haifa. \nThey have already said where it is going to come from, this is what we \nare going to do.\n  So Iran gets elected to the U.N. Commission on Disarmament. In some \nways it doesn't make sense. In some ways it is absurd, but it does \nrequire comment. It does require a response. It does require folks to \nsay: I don't care whether it meets 3 weeks a year or 1 week a year or \n50 weeks a year. This is something that highlights the absurdity of \nwhat is happening today in this international body.\n  It is interesting that, as expected, Iran is already making efforts \nto convert the Disarmament Commission into yet another forum for \nantisemitism. Last week, at a working group meeting, Iran's \nrepresentative to\n\n[[Page S3516]]\n\nthe Disarmament Commission stated that the suggestion that Iran had a \nnuclear weapons program was Jewish propaganda fabricated by the Jewish \nlobby in the United States. These brazenly antisemitic comments were \nobjected to by our American representative, but other members, \nincluding the chair of the working group, remained silent.\n  I am disturbed by the moral indifference that the U.N. has reached \nwhere you have a member state seeking nuclear weapons with the \nexpressed intention of destroying another member state, and that member \nstate, Iran, is allowed to serve as the Vice Chair of the Disarmament \nCommission. That is completely unacceptable, to say the least. I am \ndisappointed that the Asian member states did not step up to contest \nthe candidacy of Iran.\n  This is what is happening: You have regional groupings, so each \nstate, regional groupings, pick their members. The United States \ndoesn't get involved in this. It is up to the member states, the Asian \nmembers. But somebody has to be thinking this doesn't make sense. This \nis going to cast a negative pall over the international community's \nreflection about what the United Nations community is all about. It is \nanother step back at a time when we need to be moving forward.\n  It is the responsibility of member states at the U.N. to step up and \nprevent the system from being manipulated by pariah states such as Iran \nthat are looking to pursue their destructive agendas. Iran is probably \nthe major state sponsor of terrorism in the world today. Iran says they \nwant to destroy Israel. Iran supports terrorism and Iran is intent on \ngetting a nuclear weapon.\n  We do not control what other member states do, but we should make the \nposition of the United States clear. The United States should not be \nfunding institutions that not only undermine the very principles they \nclaim to promote but directly harm U.S. interests. A disarmament \ncommission with Iran in a leadership position should be condemned by \nthe United States and we should make a statement. I have been very \nhesitant to talk about holding back funding, but we are going in the \nwrong direction. I will be back on the floor if Cuba gets appointed, \ngets elected to this new human rights council. I will be back on the \nfloor. At a certain point in time you have to expect something. Much is \ngiven, much is received. We have given the U.N. a lot of money. We have \ngiven a lot of support. There are expectations then and they are not \nbeing met.\n  Lest someone has failed to be aware of Iran's deeds, let me review \nsome of the credentials for being excluded from the commission. Iran \nhas repeatedly deceived the IAEA about a variety of nuclear-related \nactivities, failed to provide IAEA inspectors access to various nuclear \nsites, and refused to answer outstanding questions that led to its \nnuclear program. It reneged on its commitments under the Paris Accord \nof 2004, which included the suspension of uranium enrichment \nactivities.\n  Again, I talked about the actions and rhetoric of the Iranian regime \nto perpetuate a record of terror and tyranny which also warrants \nisolation from the international community at the U.N., including calls \nfor the annihilation of Israel, active sponsorship of terrorism through \ngroups including Hezbollah, Hamas, and Islamic Jihad, meddling in the \naffairs of neighboring countries such as Iraq and Israel and Lebanon.\n  The overall conduct of Iran is a direct threat to world security. It \nviolates numerous fundamental principles on which the United Nations is \nbased. Yet it continues to enjoy full participatory rights and \nprivileges as a member state of the U.N. In fact, it gets rewarded by a \nleadership position on the disarmament commission. Such a situation is \nbeyond comprehension.\n  The resolution I plan to submit does the following. It expresses deep \ndisappointment in the failure of the Asian group members of the \ndisarmament commission to stop Iran's election as the vice chair of the \nbody. It asserts the disarmament commission has no credibility on \ndisarmament issues due to Iran's participation, particularly in the \nlight of Iran's defiance of the IAEA resolutions and the Security \nCouncil presidential statement regarding its nuclear program. It calls \non the U.S. to reject all resolutions passed by the discredited \ndisarmament commission, condemns Iran's continued intransigence with \nregard to the treatment of Israel and sponsorship of terror and, \nfinally, works to ensure that U.S. funding is withheld from the U.N. in \nthe amount that is directed toward the disarmament commission's \nactivities from its regular budget.\n  We are not talking about a lot of money here. What we are talking \nabout is making a statement--making a statement. We call upon the \nPresident to closely monitor U.N. progress on reform and to exercise \nhis option to withhold funding unless credible reforms are made prior \nto the discussions of the biannual budget in June.\n  What do you do? In the U.S. we ask the question, What shall we do \nwhen those who enforce the law break the law? In the international \ncontext we are asking, What do we do when a key voice in disarmament is \ngiven to one of the world's most willful sponsors of terrorism at a \ntime when they are ignoring the international community in their quest \nfor nuclear weapons?\n  The response is just to say no. Civilized nations must speak with one \nvoice. That statement should begin right here with the passage of my \nresolution.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this resolution. The \nerror of the United Nations is serious. To be silent in the face of it \nwould be far worse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/25/senate-section/article/S3516-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 443--RELATIVE TO THE DEATH OF FRANCIS R.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 445, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 445) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate in commemorating Holocaust Remembrance Day.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, earlier today, this body voiced its support \nfor a resolution commemorating the Holocaust--the Shoah--Nazi Germany's \nsystematic effort to exterminate the Jewish people.\n  For anybody who questions the existence of evil, the Nazi regime's \ndeliberate murder of 6 million Jewish men, women, and children should \nsettle all doubts.\n  Today, people all over the world will mark Yom HaShoah, Holocaust \nRemembrance Day. At 10 o'clock local time today in Israel, a loud siren \nsounded throughout the country. Motorists pulled their cars aside and \noffice workers stepped away from their computers. Everyone in the \nnation paused for a moment of silence in commemoration of the \nHolocaust.\n  Beginning with the Kristallnach Pogram on November 8 and 9, 1938, the \nNazi government embarked on a systematic, deliberate campaign of cold-\nblooded murder. Families were stripped of their possessions and killing \nsquads roamed the countryside. Millions upon millions of Jewish people \nwere brought to concentration camps where the Nazi regime killed most \nimmediately and sent some to work as slave laborers.\n  The Jewish people did not meekly submit to the Nazi onslaught. They \nfought back: 63 years ago this month, a group of 750 lightly armed \nJewish partisans began the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Knowing that the \nNazis planned to deport and murder them, the Jewish residents remaining \nin Warsaw staged occupied Europe's first ever organized urban rebellion \nagainst Nazi tyranny. They fought heroically and delayed the \ndeportation for over a month.\n  During the Holocaust's 7 years, the Nazis did incalculable damage to \nancient Jewish communities within Europe. In many parts of central \nEurope, few Jews remain today. But Hitler's evil plan failed utterly. \nHe did not destroy the Jewish people. Millions survived. Many came to \nthe United States. And many settled in what is now the prosperous, \nthriving, and democratic State of Israel.\n  Over the past year, 5 year olds who survived the Nazi death camps \nbecame eligible to receive Social Security benefits. Eighteen-year-old \nGIs who took part in the camps' liberation will turn 80 next year. \nPersonal memor1es of the Holocaust are quickly disappearing.\n  We have an obligation to keep these memories alive even after these \npeople pass on.\n  Through the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Tennessee's own \nHolocaust Memorial in Nashville, and Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust \nMartyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority we have established places \ndedicated to making sure that we remember the Holocaust.\n  It is the least we can do. We owe this debt of memory to ourselves, \nto our children, to the Nation, and to the world.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
