Mr. President, today we will have a 1-hour period for \nmorning business, which will follow the remarks of the two leaders. \nAfter morning business, the Senate will begin consideration of the \npension security bill under the time agreement which was reached last \nnight. Under that order, there will be 2 hours of general debate on the \nbill and substitute, with two additional amendments in order limited to \n30 minutes each. We will finish that bill today with probably three \nrollcall votes. We will also vote on the adoption of the conference \nreport to accompany the Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bill \nthat was debated yesterday. The vote on final passage will be stacked \nwith the pension votes that we will have a little bit later this \nmorning.\n  In addition, yesterday the Finance Committee reported the tax \nincrease prevention bill. That is the tax reconciliation bill, and we \nwill begin that measure today as well. Hopefully, we will be able to \nget to that bill as soon as possible in order to begin the clock \nrunning on the 20-hour statutory time agreement and, hopefully, we will \nbe able to facilitate a very busy schedule this week by beginning that \ntax measure early this afternoon and using some of that time to get the \nclock started.\n  In addition, we have conference reports that will be coming over from \nthe other side. We will continue to consider any of those available \nconference reports as they arrive from the House. I will be back to the \nfloor to update Members on the schedule for the remainder of the week \nas these conference reports become available.\n  As I have mentioned, we have a lot of business to do today. Although \nwe have made huge progress over the course of yesterday, much of which \nis seen on the floor, and we had a very successful day, there is much \nof which people do not see that is occurring in these conferences that \nare ongoing. We do have a lot to do. I know there are a lot of Members \nwho are asking about their schedules, whether we will be out Friday, \nSaturday, Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday. Again, things are coming along \nnicely to be out at a reasonable time, but a lot depends on how \nefficiently we can work together. I am pleased with the progress that \nhas been made over the last 48 hours.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/16/senate-section/article/S12873-8", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12873-S12874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ASBESTOS LITIGATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I have been working with my colleagues for \n3 years to reform our asbestos litigation system. It is a system that \ntoday is unfair and unjust. Because of that, people suffer, jobs are \nlost, and bankruptcies occur. The day has come for us to fix it.\n  I am pleased to inform my colleagues that asbestos reform will be the \nfirst major legislation that we consider in late January when we \nreturn. In January, asbestos reform will be the first major legislation \nthat we consider.\n  I commend my friend, Senator Specter, chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee. Rarely a day goes by that we\n\n[[Page S12874]]\n\nhave a conversation that he does not mention the importance of this \nbill that he, working with the ranking member, Senator Leahy, has spent \nso much time and focus on. I commend them for those tireless efforts to \nforge a bipartisan--and we do not hear that word very much around \nhere--consensus.\n  I had hoped that the Senate would be able to bring the legislation to \nthe floor some time in the last several weeks or months and that we \ncould debate it and pass asbestos litigation reform this year. \nUnfortunately, as we all know, there have been a number of \ncircumstances, with Katrina, the fact that we have indeed taken each of \nthe appropriations bills across the floor individually, the Supreme \nCourt nominations, all of which have slowed down our work on asbestos \nin terms of bringing it to the floor.\n  Now that wait is over. No more delay. After 4 hearings--10 including \nmarkups--2 years of intense negotiations, the Senate will finally \nresolve the asbestos litigation crisis that currently is clogging our \nNation's courtrooms and threatening America's economic health. There is \nwide agreement that the current asbestos litigation system is \ndisastrous. It is disastrous for everybody. It is disastrous for \nvictims who suffer from asbestosis or mesothelioma. It is disastrous \nfor an ever-widening circle of companies that it bankrupts. It is \ndisastrous for the tens of thousands of jobs that are lost, and it is \ndisastrous ultimately for the American people.\n  More than 700,000 individuals have filed claims with at least 8,400 \ndefendant companies. More than 300,000 claims are currently pending. \nMore than $70 billion has already been spent trying to resolve these \nclaims that have bankrupted nearly 80 companies. It is time to fix the \nsystem. The system is out of control. It is time for commonsense \nreform.\n  According to the 2002 study by Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, \nasbestos bankruptcies have cost nearly 60,000 jobs and $200 million in \nlost wages. That is wrong. Employees' retirement funds have shrunk by \n25 percent. Meanwhile, the sickest victims of asbestos exposure are not \ngetting their efficient compensation or their fair compensation. \nInstead, they are waiting in line behind thousands of claimants who are \nthemselves unimpaired.\n  A recent RAND study put the number of unimpaired claimants at 60 \npercent--6-0 percent. Even if after years of waiting and an ill \nclaimant finally does get a court settlement, that award is whittled \ndown, gets smaller and smaller because of lawyer's fees and other \nexpenses until it is less than half of the original sum that was \nawarded. It is too little too late for far too many people.\n  We do have a solution, and we will bring that to the floor. The $140 \nbillion fund that is on the table will ensure that victims receive \nproper compensation without delay. Unlike the tort system, the $140 \nbillion trust fund--and this is not taxpayer money--will provide \ncertainty and fair relief. The money will go to the victims instead of \nto the trial lawyers.\n  Mesothelioma, just to give an example, is a devastating disease. In \nthe mid-1980s I spent almost a year in England operating, doing \nthoracic surgery, chest surgery, lung surgery, at South Hampton \nHospital in South Hampton, England. It was not unusual to see \nmesothelioma, which is an asbestos-related disease that encases the \nlung with thick fibrous plaques which restrict the expansion of the \nlung, and people end up suffocating to death.\n  Under this bill, a victim suffering from mesothelioma will get $1.1 \nmillion within months to help pay for medical expenses and the \nsuffering. It will not be delayed 6 months, 1 year, or 2 years. The \nentire $1.1 million will go to the victim instead of half of it going \nto a system that is out of control.\n  A person suffering from asbestosis, which is a manifestation of \nasbestos exposure, will receive as much as $850,000 under this bill. \nThe fund provides significant compensation because we recognize that \nthese are serious illnesses. These are dire illnesses that can be \ncaused by asbestos exposure. They are life threatening and life \naltering and the victims deserve that fair, just, and timely \ncompensation which they are not getting today.\n  I commend both Chairman Specter, Senator Leahy, and all of my \ncolleagues on the Judiciary Committee for tackling asbestos reform. \nAgain, we will bring that to the floor in late January. The committee \nis holding a hearing on asbestos on Thursday, tomorrow. I applaud them \nfor moving forward on this bill to help people understand what is at \nstake.\n  I call upon my colleagues to work directly with Senator Specter and \nSenator Leahy over the next few weeks so that this bill can be \nconsidered and approved expeditiously in January. I know there is \nbipartisan support for S. 852 in this Chamber. I understand that it \nwill involve debate and amendment, and that is appropriate. Yet I am \nconfident that by pulling together we can pass S. 852 and put the \nasbestos crisis where it belongs, and that is behind us.\n  I look forward to getting this done, and I look forward to continuing \nto deliver meaningful solutions to the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/16/senate-section/article/S12874-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12874-S12875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE NOMINATION OF JUDGE ALITO\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago the President nominated Judge \nSamuel A. Alito to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States. I \ncongratulate Judge Alito on this high honor. I pledge that the Senate \nDemocrats will help ensure a thorough and dignified confirmation \nprocess. While I approach the confirmation process with an open mind, \neven at this early stage I have a number of significant concerns I want \nto share with my colleagues.\n  First, the President's selection of Judge Alito was not at all the \nproduct of consultation with Senate Democrats, as envisioned by the \nFounding Fathers. On two prior occasions President Bush spoke with me. \nHe invited Senator Leahy and me to the White House to discuss the \nfuture of the Supreme Court. The President listened seriously to our \nviews and appeared to understand that the job of filling judicial \nvacancies is a constitutional responsibility that he shares with the \nSenate.\n  But this time, instead of an invitation to the White House, I \nreceived nothing more than a pro forma telephone call from the \nPresident's Chief of Staff, telling me he had selected Judge Alito \nabout an hour before he announced the nomination. In fact, the \nPresident did consult about the Alito nomination but with the wrong \npeople. It wasn't with me and it wasn't with Senator Leahy. According \nto widely recognized press reports, the White House consulted with \nconservative activists to make sure the President would not disappoint \nthem with his selection. I think the term conservative activists is \nprobably very broad, too broad; with some extremes--extreme on the \nright wing. Some of these extreme Web sites received word of the Alito \nnomination before any Senate Democrat was even consulted or informed.\n  Consultation is not just a courtesy; it is a way for the President to \nensure that a candidate for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court \nreceives broad bipartisan support in Congress. That was what our \nFounding Fathers talked about. That is why that provision is in the \nConstitution. The constitutional design commands a partnership in this \nendeavor, not mere notification of the coequal branch of Government.\n  The second reason I have early concerns about this nomination is that \nit represents an abandonment of the principle that the Supreme Court \nshould be comprised of highly qualified individuals with diverse \nbackgrounds, experiences, and heritages. It is so striking that \nPresident Bush has chosen a man to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, \nthe first of only two women ever appointed to the Supreme Court. Today, \nunlike 24 years ago, when Sandra Day O'Connor herself was nominated, \nmore than half of the Nation's law students are women. There are \ncountless qualified women on the bench, in elective office, in law \nfirms, and serving as law school deans and law professors. I cannot \nbelieve the President searched this country and was unable to find a \nqualified female nominee. But maybe he was unable to find a qualified \nfemale nominee who happened to satisfy the extreme right wing of the \nRepublican Party.\n\n[[Page S12875]]\n\n  Meanwhile, for the third time the President has turned down the \nopportunity to make history by nominating the first Hispanic to the \nSupreme Court. How much longer must Hispanics wait before they see \nsomeone on the Nation's highest Court who shares their ethnic heritage \nand their shared experiences?\n  At the same time, the appointment of Judge Alito largely fails to \ndiversify the Court in terms of professional experience. Judge Alito is \na long-serving Federal appellate judge who would join eight other \njustices with that very same professional credential. While his prior \nservice as a Federal prosecutor is commendable and worthwhile, he was \nessentially an appellate lawyer like a number of the sitting justices.\n  We have come a long way from the days when Senators, bar leaders, \ntrial lawyers, leading professors and others with a wide range of life \nexperiences were routinely appointed to the Supreme Court. If Judge \nAlito is confirmed, the range of professional diversity on the Court \nwill extend all the way from those who served on the D.C. Circuit to \nthose who served on the First, Third, Seventh, or Ninth Circuit before \ntheir promotions.\n  The third and most important basis for my early concern about the \nAlito nomination is the fact that he was nominated following the forced \nwithdrawal of White House Counsel Harriet Miers. Harriet Miers received \na raw deal from her critics. This woman had been the managing partner \nof a major American law firm, the first female president of the Dallas \nBar Association--which, by the way, is larger than most State bar \nassociations. She was the first female president of the Texas Bar \nAssociation. She had been one of the Nation's leaders in promoting \nopportunities for women lawyers and minority lawyers. She has been a \nchampion of ensuring legal representation for the poor. She was a trial \nlawyer. The one-dimensional portrait her opponents painted of her was \nmalicious and unfair.\n  Let's not sugarcoat the truth. The nomination of Harriet Miers was \nderailed by the overwhelming opposition of the extreme right wing. They \ncampaigned against her, they ran paid advertising against her, and they \nfinally succeeded in having the President cave in to these radical \nright wing activists. They succeeded in defeating her nomination even \nbefore this fine woman was afforded an opportunity to make her case to \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  Earlier this year we heard Senator after Senator on the other side of \nthe aisle, and conservative commentators across the airwaves, declare \nthat every judicial nominee is entitled to an up-or-down vote. I have a \nquestion for those Senators, those commentators: When exactly will \nHarriet Miers receive her up-or-down vote?\n\n  The White House made a half-hearted effort to argue that the Miers \nnomination was withdrawn in the face of an impasse over what documents \nwould be provided to the Senate. That is a pretext, a laughable cover \nstory.\n  She was forced to withdraw by conservative activists who want to \nchange the legal landscape of America. They decided she was \ninadequately radical or insufficiently aggressive for their purposes, \nso they gave her the boot. You don't have to take my word for it. \nListen to the words of John Danforth, our former colleague, Senator \nfrom Missouri and, until recently, President Bush's Ambassador to the \nUnited Nations. He was asked on CNN recently who he thought were the \nwinners in the Miers episode. I quote his answer:\n\n       The big winner is the right wing of American politics. They \n     have scored a big victory. This was a power play on their \n     part. And they won it . . . they took on Harriet Miers for no \n     explainable reason. It was really an outrage, in my opinion, \n     that this happened.\n\n  Senator Danforth is himself a pro-life Republican and an ordained \nEpiscopal priest, but listen to what he says about his fellow \nRepublicans:\n\n       I am very concerned about the ascendancy of the political \n     right, particularly in the Republican Party. It's very \n     obvious that nobody can do enough to please them. The \n     President certainly can't. . . . They gave him a kick in the \n     teeth. I think [the Republican Party has] been taken over by \n     people I feel uncomfortable with and a lot of Republicans \n     feel uncomfortable with . . . They want a political judge. \n     They want a judicial activist.\n\n  Senator Danforth has revealed an important truth about today's \nRepublican Party. His warnings are precisely why the Senate needs to \ntake a long, hard look at the Alito nomination.\n  Even in the first 2 weeks of the confirmation process, a picture of \nSam Alito is emerging that may explain why the extreme right wing is \npopping champagne corks. Earlier this week we learned of the 1985 memo \nin which Alito said, ``I am, and always have been a conservative.'' He \nalso spoke proudly of his work on behalf of an extremely conservative \nagenda of the Reagan Justice Department.\n  We don't have to guess whether Judge Alito's description of himself \nin that memo would predict what kind of a judge he would be. For the \npast 15 years, Judge Alito has been one of the most conservative judges \nin the country--some would say extreme. For example, in civil rights \ncases he has often dissented to argue for higher barriers to recovery \nfor people with claims of discrimination. In Bray v. Marriott Hotels, \nhis colleagues said Title VII of the Civil Rights Act ``would be \neviscerated'' if Judge Alito's approach were followed. In Nathanson v. \nMedical College of Pennsylvania, he dissented in a disability rights \ncase where the majority said, ``few if any Rehabilitation Cases would \nsurvive'' if Judge Alito's views were the law. And in Sheridan v. \nDuPont, he was the only one of 11 judges on the court who would apply a \nhigher standard of proof in sex discrimination cases.\n  In another area of law, Judge Alito has been quick to limit the \nauthority of Congress, even when it is working to help people solve \nreal problems. In Chittester v. Department of Community Development, he \nheld that the Constitution did not allow a State employee to enforce \nthe Family and Medical Leave Act. The Supreme Court effectively \nrepudiated that view 3 years later in the Hibbs case from my own State \nof Nevada.\n  These are a few of Judge Alito's many judicial opinions which merit \nclose review by the Senate. By all accounts, Sam Alito is a decent man, \nwell liked by his colleagues. He has devoted his entire legal career to \npublic service, and for that I admire him. Throughout the confirmation \nprocess I will work to ensure that Judge Alito is treated with civility \nand respect. But there is nothing disrespectful about an open and fair-\nminded review of a nominee's approach to the Constitution and his \ncommitment to the core American values such as equality, privacy, \nfairness.\n  One final point. This nomination will be governed by the 200-year-old \nrules of the Senate. I was very dismayed to read an essay by the \nmajority leader in the Chicago Tribune last week in which he threatened \nto change the rules of the Senate to ensure that Judge Alito would be \nconfirmed. Think about that. My friend, the majority leader, wrote:\n\n       If members of the Democratic minority persist in blocking a \n     vote on Alito's nomination, the Senate will have no choice \n     but to change the rules.\n\n  The majority leader's accusation is baseless. Democrats can hardly \npersist in an activity in which we are not engaged. No Democrat has \neven raised the issue of extended debate. At this early stage of the \nprocess, 2 months before committee hearings on this nomination will \nbegin, it is silly to argue about the terms of floor debate. Earlier \nthis year, the entire Senate breathed a sigh of relief when the so-\ncalled ``nuclear option'' was averted by an agreement of a bipartisan \ngroup of Senators. We don't know what is going to happen on this \nnomination. The majority leader should put his sword back in its sheath \nand let the Senate move forward on this nomination without idle \nthreats. Let's not talk about changing the Senate rules illegally. \nLet's not start talking about blaming the Democrats for something in \nwhich they are not engaged.\n  I am confident the Senate Judiciary Committee, under the able \nleadership of the senior Senators from Pennsylvania and Vermont, will \ndo a good job of illuminating Judge Alito's record and views. The rest \nof the Senate and the rest of our Nation will pay close attention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/16/senate-section/article/S12875-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12875-S12876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE ASBESTOS BILL\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to comment briefly on the statement \nof the distinguished majority leader this\n\n[[Page S12876]]\n\nmorning that the first piece of legislation we will consider in January \n2006, after we return from the winter recess, will be the asbestos \nbill. What a mistake. I know Senator Specter has worked hard on this \nissue. In fact, Senator Specter and his good friend and former school \nroommate Judge Becker, a judge from Pennsylvania, have worked together \non this bill for countless hours. However, whatever that personal \nrelationship and despite how long and hard they may have worked on this \nbill, is not acceptable in its current form. It is not even close.\n  All you have to do is look at a bipartisan letter that was sent to \nSenators Frist and this Senator, Senator Reid, two days ago, dated \nNovember 14, 2006. The letter was sent by both the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, and the ranking member, \nKent Conrad from North Dakota, and stresses that this asbestos bill is \nnot ready for floor action.\n  They write:\n\n     . . . we are in the process of gathering data and evaluating \n     available studies in order to provide Senate Members a better \n     understanding of the likely budgetary implication of S. 852. \n     . . .\n       There are potentially serious costs to Federal taxpayers in \n     this legislation. S. 852 would create a national trust fund \n     to compensate victims of asbestos exposures in lieu of those \n     victims pursuing compensation through the tort system. The \n     legislation was reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee on \n     May 26, 2005. There remain, however, major unresolved \n     questions about the budgetary impact of this bill. These \n     include: the actual cost of the program; whether proposed \n     funding will be sufficient to compensate all claims; clarity \n     on the allocation of assessments to business and insurance \n     entities, including the balance of those assessments and \n     whether these assessments will generate adequate revenues to \n     satisfy the program's costs; the amount that will be borrowed \n     from the Federal Government under the bill's Federal \n     borrowing authority. The legislation proposes a fund of $140 \n     billion. CBO has advised that this amount could be sufficient \n     to satisfy the program's claims and costs. CBO also \n     cautioned, however that this amount could be insufficient, \n     depending on a number of issues. . . .\n       Following the release of the CBO report, the Bates White \n     economic consulting firm released a study demonstrating the \n     fund could experience additional costs beyond the proposed \n     amount between $161 billion and $421 billion.\n\n  Mr. President, $421 billion in additional costs. The letter \nconcludes:\n\n       Because of the major adverse impact the legislation could \n     have on the Federal budget deficit if there are funding \n     shortfalls, we ask that at least until these issues are fully \n     resolved, that the Senate not take any further action on the \n     legislation.\n\n  Mr. President, this bill is not ripe for floor debate and will not be \nin January. This bill does not adequately address the needs of the \ndying victims who cannot wait for this trust fund to be established. \nThe bill doesn't address the needs of victims if the trust fund runs \nout of money, which it clearly seems destined to do. The bill provides \nspecial benefits for victims at one asbestos site but ignores the needs \nof victims at another site. In another letter to Senators Frist and \nthis Senator, Senator Reid, dated yesterday, November 15, 2005, from \nthe Asbestos Victims Groups United, the victims write:\n\n     . . . [W]e write to express our continued and unified \n     opposition to S. 852. We strongly believe that the bill is \n     unfair to victims and is unworkable. . . . We believe it \n     would be wholly irresponsible for Congress to proceed with \n     consideration and passage of this legislation without \n     accurate and complete information concerning the funding \n     issue and the critical factors associated with it. Please do \n     not allow the families who have lost so much to be victimized \n     again.\n\n  This legislation will victimize asbestos victims and it will drive \nAmerican companies out of business. I had a meeting not long ago with \nthe only company in America that still makes wire. They said if this \nbill goes into effect they will go into bankruptcy. They are able to \nhandle the situation now, but this bill demands that they contribute to \na fund for which they have no responsibility. They are willing to take \ntheir lumps in the business world as they know them, but they will not \nbe able to sustain themselves if they are told they have to contribute \nhuge amounts of money to this fund.\n  Another company representative I have met said they spend $1 million \na year on asbestos litigation, but if this bill goes into effect, they \nwill go bankrupt because they can't afford the contributions they will \nbe called on to make.\n  Let us not rush into asbestos legislation. Let us not do it fast; let \nus do it right. We owe it to the American taxpayers, to our American \nbusinesses and we certainly owe it to our asbestos victims to take the \ntime to get it right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from North Carolina \nis recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could, I am confident the Chair \nrecognizes that I used leader time for my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are today at war--in Iraq, Afghanistan, \nand so many other places in the world, with an enemy who knows no \nborders. The recent bombings in Amman, Jordan during a wedding \ncelebration are a strong reminder that terrorists know no limits to \ntheir ambitions and the means by which they would achieve those \nambitions, however violent and horrific.\n  Our dedicated American service men and women have answered a noble \ncalling to defeat terrorism, taking the fight to the terrorists abroad, \nso that we do not have to fight them here at home. The central \nbattleground in the war on terror is Iraq. It has been just 3 years \nsince Iraq was liberated from the brutal regime of an evil dictator, \nand in that time, we have made tremendous progress. A constitutional \ndemocracy is taking hold, and the Middle East is moving towards greater \nstability. It is integral to the continued progress in this region and \nto the overall war on terror that we not allow the cowardly acts of \ninsurgents to derail our efforts. America must stand firm with the \nIraqis and see that this danger is defeated and freedom prevails.\n  Last January, the world watched as Iraqis voted for a new government. \nRejecting intimidation and embracing the foundations of freedom, 8.5 \nmillion Iraqis went to the polls to vote in a free national election. \nJust last month, Iraqis returned to the polls once again for a \nreferendum on a new constitution. This time, we saw significantly fewer \ninsurgent attacks, with nearly 9.8 million Iraqis voting, and 79 \npercent supporting the approval of the new constitution. Iraqis have \nshown great courage by participating in the democratic process. They \nhave walked for miles to the polls, stood in line for hours, and \nliterally put their lives on the line to cast a vote for peace. Eighty-\nthree-year-old Qadir Abdullah, seen here, made his way to the polls--on \ncrutches. He said, ``I wish I were young. This is the first time in my \nlife that I've voted freely in Iraq. When I was young, there were \nalways wars and misery.'' After decades of tragedy, there is a new \noptimism, as shown by the willingness of Iraqis to step forward and \nvote for a brighter future. And the success of the referendum indeed is \na powerful milestone on Iraq's road to democracy.\n  In another sign of progress toward democracy, the Sunnis, who in \nlarge measure refused to even participate in the January elections, \nturned out in great numbers to vote in the constitutional referendum, \nexercising their right to engage in the democratic process. And in \nrecent weeks, three major Sunni political groups have united to \nparticipate in the December 15 elections, in which Iraqis will elect a \nnew national assembly to pass legislation and implement the \nconstitution.\n  And Iraq has seen tremendous progress toward freedom in the new \npublic services, infrastructure, free press, economic activity, and \nlegal institutions that are critical to the longterm success of this \ndemocracy.\n  Over 3,400 public schools have been built; Hundreds of water and \nsewage projects, 149 new health facilities, and over 250 fire and \npolice stations have been completed.\n  Before the war, Iraq's media was tightly controlled by Saddam \nHussein's\n\n[[Page S12877]]\n\npropaganda machine. The country had no commercial TV or radio stations, \nand no independent newspapers or magazines. Today, Iraq has a thriving, \ncompetitive, free press, with 44 commercial TV stations, 72 commercial \nradio stations, and more than 100 independent newspapers and magazines. \nIraqis can now make up their own minds, based on varying viewpoints in \na marketplace of ideas, about the future of their new democracy.\n  And another foundation of freedom is taking hold--Iraq is \nexperiencing the beginnings of a competitive financial market, with a \nmodernized Iraqi stock exchange.\n  And Iraqis are for the first time experiencing the rule of law at \nwork in their legal system, with an independent judiciary free to judge \ncases on their merits, not under the orders of Saddam Hussein and his \nhenchmen.\n  Ever more, Iraqis are seeing the insurgents for the thugs, thieves, \nand indiscriminate killers that they are. In just the past nine months, \nthere has been an astonishing 500 percent increase in the number of \ntips regarding insurgents that Iraqi civilians are providing to \nsecurity forces.\n  Iraq is the central battleground in the war on terror. And yet \ndespite the evident progress, some want to cut and run. They claim that \nour troops have simply done all that they can do, and that the United \nStates should set arbitrary timelines for withdrawing our forces. Mr. \nPresident, I strongly disagree and believe that setting such a timeline \nwould only embolden the terrorists and send the message that the United \nStates has lost its resolve in the war on terror. This is the wrong \nmessage. Any timeline for withdrawal must be driven by success--not \nartificially tied to a calendar.\n  This is not the first time in our history when cynics and skeptics \nhave balked in the face of landmark challenges. A few years may have \npassed since I had the pleasure of serving President Ronald Reagan in \nhis Cabinet, but I can still remember the naysayers attacking him for \nhis fixed resolve in fighting the cold war. They questioned President \nReagan's reasoning, they questioned his strategy, and they questioned \nAmerica's chances of coming away victorious in a battle to free Russia \nand other countries from the grasp of communism. President Reagan \nrejected communism, he rejected the iron curtain, and he refused to \nconcede that freedom would not prevail. While the Soviet Union was \nextending its influence and doctrine throughout the world, President \nReagan, in the face of severe criticism, pursued a different vision. He \nknew that the enemy must be defeated, not tolerated. We now know he was \nright in his actions to bring an end to communism--millions were freed \nand that global threat no longer exists.\n  Today, naysayers are at it again. Their droning doubt is all too \nfamiliar. Much of this defeatist criticism is being leveled by the very \nsame people who, having access to the same intelligence as the \npresident, agreed that Iraq posed a real and immediate threat. And \nthese very same people supported going into Iraq to fight the war on \nterror. Now they want to throw up their hands and walk away before the \njob is done.\n  No one ever said this would be easy, and mistakes have certainly been \nmade. This is a war--and it is painful and horrific. Every life lost is \none tragic loss too many. But we must ensure that their sacrifice was \nnot in vain.\n  We must honor our fallen heroes, heroes like Major Jeffrey \nToczylowski, by completing the job they set out to do. Major \nToczylowski, seen here, was a Special Forces detachment commander \nassigned to the 10th Special Forces Group. Two weeks ago in Anbar \nprovince, he made the ultimate sacrifice for his country. In his last \nemail home to his family and friends, he wrote how they should respond \nif he were to lose his life in battle: And I quote:\n\n       Don't ever think that you are defending me by slamming the \n     global war on terrorism or the U.S. goals in that war. As far \n     as I am concerned, we can send guys like me to go after them, \n     or we can wait for them, to come back to us again. I died, \n     doing something I believed in and have no regrets, except \n     that I couldn't do more.\n\n  What a powerful testament to the commitment of our service members \nfighting the war on terror.\n  Just yesterday, we debated an amendment to the Defense authorization \nbill that would have forced the administration to set an arbitrary date \nfor the withdrawal of U.S. troops. I am pleased the Senate rejected \nthis proposal. The Frist-Warner amendment we accepted--79-19--sent a \nmessage--a forward-looking message--that we expect the Iraqis to \ncontinue their progress--and the Congress, in its oversight, will \ncontinue to receive reports on the progress being made. The timeline we \nshould focus on is December l5 the election of a parliamentary \ngovernment. The establishment of a constitutional democracy, coupled \nwith the continued training of Iraqi security forces--now exceeding \n210,000 personnel--will in time allow the Iraqis to defend themselves, \nand the United States to bring our troop levels down.\n  Around the country, Iraqi forces are now overseeing 72 percent of \nsecurity checkpoints and leading 43 percent of all combat patrols. Two \nIraqi brigades have been assigned their own battle space in Baghdad in \nan area once a haven for insurgents.\n  Freedom and democracy in Iraq are the terrorists' worst nightmare. \nThey know what is at stake and try desperately to derail our success. \nIn a letter intercepted last month from Bin Laden's deputy Zawahiri to \nal-Qaida's leader in Iraq--the terror network's plan was exposed: to \nexpel the Americans from Iraq, establish radical Islamist authority in \nthe country, and extend the terrorists' jihad into neighboring \ncountries and around the world. They seek to destroy our very way of \nlife. We cannot cut and run--we know all too well what is at stake in \nthis global war against terror. To our men and women in uniform who are \nprotecting our freedom and our security, I say thank you and God bless \nyou. You make us so very proud.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Carolina \nfor her comments. Certainly I agree with what she has had to say.\n  Having spent the last weekend, as most of us did, celebrating various \nevents on Veterans Day, I was very much impressed with what we did in \nmy State of Wyoming where we had ceremonies at cemeteries, recognizing \nall that our veterans have done throughout the years for this country, \nand the sacrifices that were made by many people over many years to \nallow us to continue to have the freedoms which we have in our country.\n  I was particularly impressed by one of the events we had at a school \nwhere kids--junior high youngsters--sat there listening to the events \nthat had gone by, and I think probably mostly unaware of the fact that \nthere had been years of sacrifice by so many people to maintain and to \nprotect the freedom of this country.\n  I think it is appropriate, as we look at all that has been done over \nthe years, that we again focus on those who are now continuing to \nprotect the freedoms of this country--those who are now in the Middle \nEast doing the things we need to be done to ensure that in this country \nwe have our freedom and that this freedom will be expanded to others. I \nthink it is appropriate that we talk about this at this time. It is \nappropriate also that we continue to support our troops who are there \ndoing these things for us.\n  One of the most difficult things that could happen in terms of our \nsuccess and accomplishing our goals there would be to erode the support \nwe have here--and that is not going to happen. We know we will support \nour troops doing the jobs they are doing.\n  The war on terror is being fought in Afghanistan and Iraq to \nfundamentally change the environment that has given rise to Islamic \nextremism and, of course, brought about, among other things, the terror \nattacks of 9/11. It is one to bring justice to not only the \nperpetrators of those horrific attacks but also to change the \nconditions in the Middle East that brought them about. That is the \ntest. That is the job we must finish. The introduction of a stable \ndemocracy and freedom to that oppressed region of the world is the best \nway to address long term that program and problem.\n\n[[Page S12878]]\n\n  The ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan are necessary to \nneutralize and eliminate the elements that produced extreme terrorism. \nWe have made great steps since the liberation in Iraq and Afghanistan \nfrom the brutal regimes of Saddam Hussein and the Taliban. Both \ncountries, as we all know, have reached major milestones in recent \nmonths by dramatically electing their own governments. The Iraqi people \nturned out again in great numbers and voted for a new constitution; 79 \npercent of Iraqi voters accepted in that vote, including a Sunni \nminority. This is real progress.\n  On the 15th of December, Iraqis will go to the polls once again to \nvote on parliamentary elections. This is an unmistakable shift from \ntyranny and is being replaced with democracy.\n  The Iraqi troops and forces have shouldered a great deal of the \nsecurity efforts, as they should. I was very impressed when I was in \nIraq at the training taking place for the troops. I was impressed \nriding around in military vehicles when the little kids on the street \nwaved and cheered when they would see U.S. forces. I am very impressed, \nalso, at the normalcy, day to day, for most Iraqis. Unfortunately, we \nhave insurgents and the terrorists who disturb citizens on a daily \nbasis. However, the normalcy there is relatively calm, surprisingly so, \non the streets of Baghdad.\n  There are a good many Iraqi army operation specialists and battalions \nin the regular military but also looking into the policing aspect. It \nis not in many cases a regular military operation as much as it is a \nsecurity operation for insurgents. They are doing both of these things. \nI am impressed with that.\n  Thirty-six of the units are taking leave with their coalition \npartners in operating independently; 28 special police battalions are \ncapable of these operations. More than 87,000 soldiers and sailors have \nbeen trained. That is a very good thing.\n  It is fair to say we are making significant progress in the war on \nterror and creating a stable and democratic Iraq and Afghanistan that \nwill no longer be the breeding ground for aggression. President Bush's \nvision is clear. Our work in Iraq and Afghanistan is essential to our \nown security.\n  There has been great debate, discussion, and questions about why we \nare there. The fact is, we are there. The fact is, we had reason to be \nthere. The fact is, all the folks who are now grumbling had the same \ninformation and helped make the decision at the time and agreed with \nthe decision at the time. We need to complete our task.\n  By taking the fight to the enemy, we have protected America at home. \nWe have to remember for years terrorists attacked the United States \nwith little or no reaction from the United States. In 1993, terrorists \nbombed the World Trade Center, killing 6 people and wounding more than \n1,000. In 1996, terrorists bombed the U.S. military living quarters at \nthe Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, killing 19. In 1998, followers of \nOsama bin Laden attacked U.S. Embassies in Kenya, killing and wounding \nhundreds. In 2000, Osama bin Laden's followers attacked the USS Cole in \nthe harbor of Yemen, killing 17 and wounding 39. Nearly 3,000 innocent \nAmericans were killed September 11 before we resolved we were under \nattack.\n  In Afghanistan, United States and British forces joined the ally, \nanti-Taliban troops in the assault. We are fighting beside those \npartners over there and moving forward. We have a number of activities \ngoing on.\n  In September 2005, Afghanistan held the first parliamentary election \nin Afghanistan in more than 30 years. Five hundred eighty-three men and \nwomen previously regarded as third-class citizens campaigned for 25 of \nthe available seats. Afghan women received ballots in September 2005. \nIn a country of nearly 30 million voting age people, more than 12 \nmillion registered to vote. It is a substantial change.\n  In 2003, the forces we have talked about already in Iraq went on with \nvotes. In June the Iraqi people assumed full sovereignty and moved \nforward and more than 8 million people voted.\n  This is where we are. We are making real progress. We have a goal. No \none knows exactly what the date will be for accepting that goal. I \ndon't think anyone ever knows a date in wars. We do have to describe \nmore clearly our purpose. We are doing that. We have to understand more \nclearly we are making a good deal of progress.\n  The special inspector general's most recent report indicates service \nmen and women completed work on 762 out of 834 schools. I was there, \nand we toured some of the schools. They had such a change, brought \nabout largely by our troops. We put 5 out of 12 major airports back in \nplace, 66 railroad stations, and so on.\n\n  A great deal of progress is being made. We have had a good many \nchanges. In terms of the leadership that used to be all around Osama \nbin Laden, much of that is gone. Much of that leadership is no longer \nthere. We are changing.\n  People understand the people of that country can defend and take care \nof themselves. We are moving in that direction.\n  Our fighting men and women continue to help in Iraq. We will continue \nto help. I remain concerned about the violence. I agree the cost is \nhigh. I agree clearly that as soon as we complete our task, we should \ndo that and turn this over to the Iraqis. The important thing is they \nare prepared to begin to go ahead and operate their country for which \nwe have helped provide the opportunity.\n  It is very important to complete the mission. I believe we are \nsucceeding. The stakes are very high. I believe it is terribly \nimportant as Americans we understand what has happened is similar to \nwhat has happened through the years where people have given so much to \nbe able to move and change the world so that our freedoms and other \nfreedoms can exist, and we have the kind of world we all would like. \nThe stakes are very high. Certainly, we want to continue to complete \nour task. It is important we do that. It is important we stay attached.\n  I have no problem asking for more information with regard to where we \nare. I am very opposed to the idea of insisting on the date set by the \nPresident. That is not reasonable in this situation. I am very proud \nand very pleased of what our folks are doing there. I am glad we are \ndoing the job that needs to be done. There is real progress being made. \nWe want to continue that progress.\n  I say, again, as many Members are saying, we have engaged in a very \nnecessary activity. We are making real progress. It is terribly \nimportant we support the people who are there, that we support the \ncompletion of this task that we have set about of freedom for all.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will spend a few minutes talking about \nthe Commerce-Justice-State-Science appropriations bill and about my \nreasons for voting against it when it comes up today.\n  This year we added $538 billion to our debt as of September 30 for \nthe last year. That translates into $1,783 for every man, woman, and \nchild in this country. The cost of every project or program that we \ncannot afford will be borne with compounding interest by our children \nand our grandchildren. The American people choose every day to \ndetermine their financial priorities. It should be not too much for \nthem to ask Congress to do the same thing.\n  There are multiple projects that are funded in this bill that should \nnot be considered within the priorities of what we have. The first is, \nas we are fighting a war, we have a Katrina, Rita, and Wilma disaster, \nwe have $538 billion that we could not pay for last year that we added \nto the debt, and we are going to put $680 million into a program at \nNASA to go to Mars? I believe Mars should wait. I don't believe we \nshould be spending $680 million to go to Mars. I believe we should \nspend $680 million to help our neighbors and our friends in the \nhurricane-ravaged States.\n\n[[Page S12879]]\n\n  We are going to spend $80 million for the Advanced Technology \nProgram. Granted, that is less than what we spent before, but since \n1990 the American taxpayers have given over three-quarters of a billion \ndollars to Fortune 500 companies for technology programs where they, in \nfact, could have financed those things themselves.\n\n  We are going to spend $1.5 million to study highly migratory sharks, \n$825,000 to study Hawaiian monk seals, and $235,000 to study yellow-\nfinned tuna. We are going to spend $7 million on the Alaska Fisheries \nMarketing Board, which this year just spent $500,000 to paint an \nairplane to have a salmon on it.\n  The priorities are wrong. We need to readjust the priorities. I hope \nmy colleagues will look at that and make the effort.\n  The other thing I think is critical with this bill and is \nunderfunded----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be informed the majority's \ntime has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield 2 minutes from the \nminority time to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois.\n  Byrne-JAG funding is cut in this bill. If there is anything we know \nthat our sheriffs, our police departments, our drug courts, our drug \nrehabilitation programs need, it is help in terms of fighting the \nbattle on drugs. I am very disappointed. The Senate passed $900 million \nfor Byrne-JAG grants. It was paid for. It was offset when we passed it \nthrough the Senate. It came with full offsets to prioritize, to meet \nthe needs of those people who are presently caught up in drugs.\n  In Oklahoma, we have had fantastic results with drug courts and drug \nrehabilitation. Eighty-one percent of the people who now come through \nthese drug courts have a full-time job and never regress back to drugs. \nWhat we know is drug treatment works. What we know is drug courts work. \nIt is time for us to reconsider our priorities.\n  I ask the Members of this body to reconsider this conference report \nin light of the lack of priorities that should be there.\n  With that, I yield the remainder of my time and thank the Senator \nfrom Illinois for his courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this morning's newspapers across America \nhave lead stories that I think are a grim reminder to us of the reality \nof life in Washington and the challenges we face. The lead stories in \nmost newspapers across America relate to a vote on the Senate floor \nyesterday. I believe it was a historic vote. By a vote of 79 to 19, \nRepublican and Democratic Senators said it is time for change in this \nadministration's policy in Iraq.\n  Certainly, when you look at the statistics, it is understandable: \nOver 2,060 of our best and bravest soldiers have lost their lives in \nIraq. Over 15,000 have been gravely wounded, some of them with injuries \nthat will change their lives. And, of course, 25,000 or 30,000 innocent \nIraqis--innocent Iraqis--have died during the course of this war.\n  This war has gone on for over 3 years, after the administration \npromised us, in the words of Secretary Rumsfeld, that he could not \nimagine we would be there for more than 6 months. It is now beyond 3 \nyears; no end in sight.\n  The American people are frustrated, as they should be; frustrated by \nthe fact that this administration made a case for the war in Iraq that \nwas false. You can recall it, as I do, the President, the Vice \nPresident, the Secretary of Defense, Condoleezza Rice, even Secretary \nof State Powell, making statements about the existence of weapons of \nmass destruction in Iraq that were a threat to the Middle East and to \nthe world that could easily fall into the hands of terrorists; \nstatements over and over again about nuclear weapons, Condoleezza Rice \ntalking about mushroom clouds that we could fear if we did not invade \nIraq and stop Saddam Hussein; and, of course, linking our national \ntragedy of 9/11 with Saddam Hussein, saying that somehow he had \nconnections with al-Qaida.\n  Well, it turned out all of those things were false--every single one \nof them--so false to the point where the President had to do something \nI do not think has ever been done in the history of this Nation. He had \nto apologize and recant a remark he made in his State of the Union \nAddress about this yellow cake coming from Niger in Africa so the \nIraqis could use it to make nuclear weapons. It turned out it was a \nphony. It was not true.\n  So we were drawn into a war under false pretenses. We all knew how \nterrible Saddam Hussein was, but we certainly came to understand that \nthe specific reasons given for the invasion of Iraq turned out not to \nbe true, one after the other. Weapons of mass destruction, nuclear \nweapons, connections with al-Qaida, yellow cake from Niger, so-called \nmobile biological weapons laboratories--all of these things turned out \nto be totally false.\n  It is understandable the American people are concerned about it \nbecause if you measure an abuse of power by a government, could there \nbe an abuse of power any worse than misleading the people of a country \ninto believing that a war is necessary?\n  That is, of course, why the Senate Democrats took to the floor just 2 \nweeks ago and demanded that the promised investigation of this \nadministration for the potential misuse of intelligence be completed by \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee. It has been over 20 months--20 \nmonths--since we were promised that this honest investigation would \ntake place, and nothing has happened.\n\n  There have been small parts of it that have been addressed, but I \nthink we all know what the story is. The Senate Intelligence Committee, \nunder the control of the President's party, does not want to open that \ndoor and look inside. Well, why should we? Why should we reflect and \ndwell on the past? Some say: Let's look forward. But if we do not get \nto the heart of this issue, the truth of the matter, if we are not \nhonest with the American people and straightforward as to what happened \nleading up to that invasion of Iraq, then I think we are derelict in \nour constitutional responsibilities.\n  This Congress is designed as one branch of Government to serve as \noversight of the executive branch of Government. The failure of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee, for more than 20 months, to produce this \nintelligence analysis, which they promised, is proof positive they are \ndragging their feet, unwilling to accept the responsibility which they \nhave publicly proclaimed.\n  So yesterday we passed on the floor, by a vote of 79 to 19, a clear \nstatement to this administration that the policy in Iraq must change. \nNo. 1, we said the year 2006 will not just be another year in Iraq, \nanother year of casualties, another year of death, another year of our \ndespondency over whether this is going to end well. It will be a year \nof significant transition. That is what the Democratic amendment said. \nThat is what was adopted.\n  Secondly, we served notice on Iraqis that it is their responsibility, \nnot the American responsibility, to secure their own country and to \nbuild a political coalition that can defeat the insurgency. I had hoped \nwe would have even stronger language to say to the Iraqis: We are not \nhere indefinitely. We want to bring our troops home. The Republican \nside watered down that language, but the message was still clear.\n  The third element is important as well. Accountability is essential. \nThis administration must be held accountable for whether we were \nprepared not only for the invasion of Iraq but for what occurred \nafterwards. You know what happened afterwards. Secretary Rumsfeld \nvisited with our troops, and a soldier came forward, held up his hand \nto ask a question, and said: Mr. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, why is \nit that we soldiers have to scavenge through junk piles to find pieces \nof armor to stick on these humvees to protect ourselves? A moment of \ngreat embarrassment for the Secretary, but I am glad that soldier had \nthe courage to stand up and say what we already knew.\n  We were not prepared. We sent our troops into combat without the \nnecessary humvee armor, without the necessary body armor, without the \nnecessary protection for our helicopters. It was done, and in some \nrespects too late\n\n[[Page S12880]]\n\nand too little. We lost American soldiers' lives and many were injured \nbecause we did not have the right equipment in place.\n  So now what we are saying is that this administration must be held \naccountable, to report to Congress every 90 days to tell us in Congress \nthe progress that is being made in protecting our troops, in preparing \nthe Iraqis to defend their own country, in moving that country toward \nstability, and in moving us to the point where American soldiers can \nstart coming home. That was passed yesterday, 79 to 19.\n  As the President stood on Veterans Day and in an unprecedented \npolitical speech attacked his Democratic critics for saying they did \nnot agree with his war policy, this Senate, on a bipartisan basis \nyesterday, 79 to 19, said to the President: Your policy in Iraq must \nchange. We need to start looking to bring American soldiers home. And \n2006 is the year to begin that process in earnest.\n  That is why it was a historic vote. Of course, as we look at the \nstatements made in the lead-up to the invasion of Iraq, there is a \nrecurring theme. It turns out that the major sources of intelligence \nthat were passing through the administration and to the American people \nwere passing across the desk of Vice President Cheney.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Wilkerson, chief of staff to Secretary of State \nColin Powell, referred to a cabal, a cabal led by Vice President Cheney \nand Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, a cabal which set the stage for the \ninvasion of Iraq. The man speaking was not a partisan Democrat. He was \nthe chief of staff to the Secretary of State in the Bush \nadministration, Colin Powell. I think it makes clear that throughout \nthe lead-up to the invasion of Iraq, our Vice President, Richard \nCheney, was making statements that did not reflect the truth of what \nwas occurring in Iraq.\n  Repeatedly, he said Iraq had links to al-Qaida, and that was proven \nfalse. Repeatedly, he said Iraq was an imminent threat to the United \nStates, and that was proven false. Repeatedly, Vice President Cheney \nsaid Iraq was trying to acquire nuclear weapons, and that was proven \nfalse.\n  On ``Meet the Press,'' on March 16, 2003, the Vice President said: \n``And we believe he [Saddam Hussein] has, in fact, reconstituted \nnuclear weapons.'' False.\n\n  In addition, there were statements made about whether Iraq was trying \nto acquire uranium from Africa, statements made by the Vice President \nwhich turned out to be false, and statements, of course, relative to \naluminum tubes. I knew something about that debate because as a member \nof the Senate Intelligence Committee, I listened as the Department of \nDefense and the Department of Energy debated whether these aluminum \ntubes were really all about nuclear weapons. There was a real division \nwithin the administration, and I would walk outside the Senate \nIntelligence Committee room and hear statements made by the Vice \nPresident saying: There is no debate. It is all about nuclear weapons.\n  Now, I could not repeat what I had heard in the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee. I was prohibited from saying it publicly. I knew what he \nsaid was false. It is one of the reasons I voted against that \nresolution to go to war in Iraq.\n  But again and again the Vice President was taking information, \nintelligence information, giving it to the American people selectively, \nmaking certain that it was always the strongest spin toward the \nimmediate need for a war, and that is how we ended up in the position \nwe are in today.\n  It is a lot easier to get into a war than it is to get out of one. \nAnd we have learned that with the cost in human lives and the cost to \nAmerica's Treasury.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/16/senate-section/article/S12880-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AMERICA'S ENERGY CRISIS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the second story on the front pages of \nthis morning's newspapers relates to the energy crisis in America. You \ndo not have to describe that to any American who has filled up their \ngas tank in the last several months. And in the weeks ahead, when you \nstart paying your home heating bills, if you live in one of the colder \nparts of America, you will see the energy problems we are facing.\n  Of course, it reflects the fact we have no energy policy in this \ncountry. In the White House, with the President and Vice President, we \nhave two men who have long careers with the energy industries and with \noil companies, and the energy policy they are pushing reflects it.\n  What did we have in the so-called Energy bill signed by the President \njust in August of this year? A $9 billion subsidy to oil companies, a \n$9 billion subsidy to companies which are realizing record-breaking \nprofits at this very moment.\n  Why in the world would we be sending subsidies, Federal taxpayers' \ndollars, to these oil companies at a moment in time when they are \nrealizing the largest profits in history? I think every American knows \nwhy. When you go to the gas station to fill up your car or your truck, \nand you put that charge on your credit card, the money from your credit \ncard is going directly to the boardrooms of these oil companies that \nare realizing more money than they ever have in history.\n  We wanted to know who wrote the administration's energy bill, and we \ncould not find out. Neither the President nor the Vice President, who \nwas leading the effort to create this energy policy, would tell the \nAmerican people who was part of it.\n  This morning's front page story in the Washington Post tells us who \nwas part of it. A document obtained by the Washington Post this week \nshows that officials from ExxonMobil, Conoco before its merger with \nPhillips, Shell Oil, and BP America met in the White House complex with \nCheney aides who were developing the national energy policy, parts of \nwhich became law and parts of which are still being debated.\n  It comes as no surprise. We suspected as much. A lawsuit was filed to \nspecifically determine whether the oil company executives wrote this \nEnergy bill. That lawsuit was fought all the way to the Supreme Court, \nand the Supreme Court ruled that the White House didn't have to tell \nthe American people who was involved. Now this memo tells us.\n  The reason it is important is that last week the executives of these \noil companies came before Congress. You probably heard about the \nhearing before the Senate Commerce Committee. Senator Maria Cantwell of \nWashington insisted that these oil company executives be sworn in and \ntestify under oath, as the tobacco company executives did a few years \nago. But Senator Stevens, chairman of the committee, refused to allow \nthem to be sworn in. Why? So they couldn't be held accountable if they \ndidn't tell the truth.\n  Unfortunately, some of the statements made in responses to questions \nby Senator Lautenberg raised serious questions as to whether those oil \ncompany executives were candid and forthcoming in terms of their \ninvolvement in this very bill, the Energy bill, which this memorandum \ntells us was prepared with the oil company executives. Once again, the \nspecial interests trumped America's families and consumers, businesses \nand farmers. The Energy bill was written with the Vice President's \ndirection that rewarded oil companies at a time when we should have \nbeen sensitive to protecting American consumers. Unfortunately, it \nreflects what has been happening in this capital for too long.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/16/senate-section/article/S12880-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12880-S12881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         LEWIS LIBBY INDICTMENT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. The third issue is one which everyone is aware of; that \nis, the fact that for the first time in over a century, some high-level \nstaffer in the White House has been indicted. Lewis ``Scooter'' Libby \nwas indicted a few weeks ago, charged with perjury and obstruction of \njustice related to the Valerie Plame affair. Everyone is aware of it \nnow. Joe Wilson, former Ambassador, sent to Africa to determine whether \nassertions by the administration about yellow cake uranium coming from \nAfrica to Iraq were true, reached the conclusion they were not. When he \npublished that conclusion, he was attacked in the press by Robert Novak \nin a column where Mr. Novak said two White House sources had told him \nthat Joseph Wilson's wife Valerie Plame was a CIA agent.\n  In fact, she was an undercover agent whose identity was being \nprotected. But the White House, in an effort to discredit its critics \nand to silence\n\n[[Page S12881]]\n\nthem, attacked Joe Wilson's wife Valerie Plame and, in the process, \ndisclosed the identity of a CIA agent. There is a question raised as to \nwhether that violates the law. The fact that people work in covert \nactivities and risk their lives for America is something we should \nnever take for granted. The law is designed to protect them. But the \nWhite House decided, for political reasons and in order to protect \nagainst the disclosure that they were manufacturing intelligence to \njustify the war, they would attack Joseph Wilson's wife Valerie Plame. \nFor that action and for the statements he made to the FBI and the grand \njury, Mr. Libby was indicted. The investigation continues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/16/senate-section/article/S12881-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             AHMED CHALABI\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. The last issue, which is one that is topical, relates to \na man by the name of Ahmed Chalabi. What a fascinating man he is. Ahmed \nChalabi is an Iraqi exile, now back in Iraq after the fall of Saddam \nHussein. What an interesting history this man has.\n  In 1992, Ahmed Chalabi was convicted of bank fraud and embezzlement \nof over $230 million for a bank he was running in Jordan. To escape the \nsentence of 22 years in prison, he fled to London and then to the \nUnited States, and certainly that wasn't the last we heard of him. He \ncreated something called the Iraqi National Congress, which ingratiated \nitself with the Bush administration to the point where the Bush \nadministration paid to Ahmed Chalabi's Iraqi National Congress $39 \nmillion. Then Mr. Chalabi gave us misleading information about the \nsituation in Iraq, saying there were mobile biological weapons labs, \nwhich turned out to be false, information from a source named \n``Curveball,'' of all things, one of most discredited sources of \nintelligence we have ever had who happened to be the brother of one of \nChalabi's aides. It turned out that the information he was feeding us \nall along about Iraq, by and large, was false.\n  Mr. Chalabi was unrepentant when he was confronted with this. From \nthe London Daily Telegraph, in an article on February 19, 2004, I \nquote:\n\n       Mr. Chalabi, by far the most effective anti-Saddam lobbyist \n     in Washington, shrugged off charges that he deliberately \n     misled U.S. Intelligence. ``We are heroes in error,'' he told \n     the Telegraph in Baghdad.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       As far as we're concerned, we've been entirely successful. \n     That tyrant Saddam [Hussein] is gone and the Americans are in \n     Baghdad. What was said before is not important. The Bush \n     administration is looking for a scapegoat. We're ready to \n     fall on our swords if he wants.\n\n  That was not the end of the story. Now that he has misled the \nAmericans into invading Iraq, now that he has us in a position where \nour American forces are there, he is trying to build up his political \nfortunes. In May of last year, Iraqi security forces raided his home \nfor documents, accusing him of passing American secrets to the Iranians \nand endangering American troops and security. He is currently under \nactive investigation.\n  You might expect this man would be in hiding. He is not. He is in \nWashington. He is not being served with a subpoena. He is being served \nlunch. Do you know whom he has visited with in the last week, this man \nunder active investigation? Vice President Cheney is one; Secretary of \nState Condoleezza Rice; Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld; the \nNational Security Adviser, Stephen Hadley; the Treasury Secretary, John \nSnow. And he is under active investigation by the FBI for having sold \nAmerican secrets to the Iranians.\n  I don't understand this. It seems to me that if this man is suspected \nof endangering our troops, he should be called in for questioning, if \nnot more. Instead, he is being called in for a cup of coffee and a \ncookie. That is what this administration thinks is playing straight \nwith Iraq.\n  The American people know better. I am glad yesterday, by a vote of 79 \nto 19, we told this administration their policies in Iraq have to \nchange.\n  It is long overdue for the Vice President of the United States to \nhold a press conference and answer questions. It is long overdue for \nhim to speak truth to the American people, to be candid about the \nmisuse of intelligence leading to the invasion of Iraq, to be candid \nabout his role in disclosing the identity of Valerie Plame to Lewis \n``Scooter'' Libby, to be candid about his role in terms of meeting with \noil company executives to create this Energy bill, and to be honest \nabout his relationship with Ahmed Chalabi. The American people deserve \nstraightforward, honest answers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 \nminutes to complete my statement.\n  Mr. ENZI. I object. We have the pension bill scheduled on a very \ntight time schedule.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. It is only an additional 3 or 4 minutes. We have 8\\1/2\\ \nleft, so it would be an additional 5.\n  Mr. ENZI. OK.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 1 month ago, I expected to be on the \nSenate floor sometime about now engaged in a debate over the pros and \ncons of President Bush's nominee to the Supreme Court. Of course, I \nthought it would be Harriet Miers we would be debating. But that never \noccurred. As the Senate takes up the nomination of Harriet Miers' \nreplacement, Judge Samuel Alito, we should all continually bear in mind \nhow we got to this point because recent history goes a long way in \nexplaining why the American people want us to examine every portion of \nJudge Alito's record with great care.\n  Harriet Miers' nomination was blocked by a cadre of conservative \ncritics who lambasted her at every turn. Why? Because they were not \nsatisfied that her judicial ideology matched their conservative \nextremism. They were not certain that her legal philosophy squared with \ntheir political agenda. In the end, Harriet Miers' nomination was \nblocked before she could explain her judicial philosophy, before she \ncould have a full and fair hearing to answer the doubters, before she \ncould have an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. She was blocked by \nconservatives and Republicans, not Democrats. She was not given an up-\nor-down vote by many of the same people who are clamoring for an up-or-\ndown vote on Samuel Alito.\n  The standards seem to change with the nominee. Many of the very \npeople who denied Harriet Miers an up-or-down vote are now saying that \nthere is an imperative to give Samuel Alito one. So before we even \nbegin examining Judge Alito's record, a natural cause for concern is \nthat he was picked to placate a group of vocal and hard-right activists \nwho have been lobbying for him for many years. Many of those who now \ncall for an up-or-down vote are the same ones who denied that vote to \nHarriet Miers.\n  Anyone who thinks that this nomination is a foregone conclusion is \nsadly mistaken. There are too many questions still to be answered, too \nmany doubts still to be alleviated to say this nomination is a slam \ndunk. The most important thing we must look at is Judge Alito's \njudicial record. And at least on first perusal, there are reasons to be \ntroubled. In case after case after case, Judge Alito gives the \nimpression of applying meticulous legal reasoning, but each time he \nhappens to reach the most conservative result. That is why he \napparently dissented more than most judges in his circuit.\n  I met with Judge Alito. I found him to be bright and capable and down \nto earth. He has an impressive life story and history of \naccomplishment. And his family story is not unlike mine and that of \nmillions of Americans whose families came to these shores in the last \ntwo generations and, due to this great system of ours, climbed the \nladder of success. But this is about more than legal achievement. In \ncase after case, Judge Alito seems to find a way to rule on the side of \nbusiness over the consumer, on the side of employer over employee, and \noften against civil rights, against workers' rights, against women's \nrights.\n  Though any analysis is still preliminary--and, of course, we must all \nwait for the hearings because those will be the most important thing--a \nquick review of some cases reveals a troubling pattern and warrants \ntough questioning at Judge Alito's hearing.\n\n[[Page S12882]]\n\n  Often he stands alone in his decisions, reaching conclusions that \nalmost no other judge has reached or would reach. The machine gun case, \nRybar, is very troubling. Judge Alito alone found that Congress could \nnot regulate machine guns, even though the majority ruled that Congress \ncould, even though every other circuit to consider the issue ruled the \nother way, and even though courts have held for the last 60 years that \nCongress has such power. Judge Alito was in that case and on that issue \nan outlier.\n  This is an issue about which there was and is broad consensus. He \nwent out of his way to find a means to reject that law. When I met with \nJudge Alito, he cited three bases for his dissent. He said the most \nimportant was the lack of specific congressional findings that \nregulation of machine guns affects interstate commerce. I found this \nexplanation, in all honesty, unpersuasive, to say the least. The effect \non commerce is obvious. Congress has passed laws relating to machine \nguns since the 1930s. There has never been any doubt that their \npossession and sale affect commerce. Ninety percent of the crime guns \nin New York come from out of State. So of course it affects interstate \ncommerce.\n  It seems as if, in certain cases, Judge Alito would want Congress to \nmake a finding that the sky is blue before he will give Congress the \nability to make laws. So this case raises questions. Will Judge Alito \nbe unduly cramped in his reading of the Constitution? Will he engage in \njudicial activism to find ways to strike down laws that the American \npeople want their elected representatives to pass and that the \nConstitution authorizes? It is too early to tell. But this merits \nserious and tough questioning at the hearing.\n  There are other cases similarly disturbing. On sex discrimination, \nJudge Alito was again alone in ruling against the plaintiff in a sex-\ndiscrimination suit. Not only was he alone on the original three-judge \npanel, he was alone when the case was reheard by the entire Third \nCircuit. He was alone against 11 of his fellow judges who criticized \nhim for raising the bar much too high for a victim of discrimination. \nThe Supreme Court declined to hear the case, so there are more \nquestions. Will Judge Alito be too quick to dismiss victims of \ndiscrimination and not give them their day in court?\n  On title VII, Judge Alito again was alone on a panel in ruling that a \ncivil rights plaintiff had to meet a higher burden to get a trial than \nthe law already provided.\n  Here is what the majority found extremely troubling. They wrote that \n``title VII would be eviscerated'' if they were to follow Judge Alito's \nanalysis--eviscerated, which means victims of discrimination would have \nno recourse.\n  In other cases we find the same thing. In Chittester, about the \nFamily and Medical Leave Act; in Doe v. Groody, about strip searches, \nhe was on the other side of the conservative Michael Chertoff. In Riley \nv. Taylor, he was again alone and the majority criticized him for \nanalysis that served to ``minimize the history of discrimination \nagainst black jurors and defendants.'' And, of course, Judge Alito was \nalone again in Planned Parenthood v. Casey.\n  These are just a few of Judge Alito's decisions that raise serious \nconcerns and cry out for tough questioning.\n  While there is much more reading and reviewing to be done, it is not \ntoo early to wonder whether there is a troubling pattern in his record. \nIs there an overall consistency in his approach to law or just in the \nresult? Does he practice judicial restraint always or only when it \nallows the right outcome? Does he use the guise of legal reasoning to \nturn the clock back, as he appeared to do in the machine gun case? How \ndo we resolve some apparent contradictions?\n  For instance, sometimes Judge Alito goes out of his way to defer to \nthe legislature, as when he wanted to uphold Pennsylvania's spousal \nnotification law. But at other times he goes out of his way to strike \ndown an act of the legislature, as when he wrote Congress could not ban \nmachine guns.\n  Sometimes he reads the text narrowly, as when he struck down a \nschool's anti-harrassment policy, but at other times he reads the text \nbroadly, as when he condoned the strip search of a woman and her 10-\nyear-old daughter, though there was no such language in the warrant.\n  The disclosures this week of his 1985 Justice Department job \napplication only raise further concern and increase his burden to \nanswer questions fully and forthrightly in the hearing.\n  In that application he wrote, among other things, that he was \n``particularly proud'' of his work to advance the position that ``the \nConstitution does not protect the right to an abortion.''\n  That statement cannot be dismissed as a ``personal view'' that will \nnot affect how Judge Alito will approach the legal issue. It is a flat \nstatement of what Judge Alito, at least at one time, believed the \nConstitution, not his personal belief, said. That is not a personal \nview such as stating you are pro-choice or pro-life. It is decidedly a \nlegal view which involved judicial philosophy and judicial reasoning. \nIf confirmed, his belief about what the Constitution does and does not \nprotect will have the power through his decisions to become the law of \nthe land.\n  Because Judge Alito so firmly and specifically stated his personal \nand legal opinion about this controversial issue while in pursuit of a \nlesser position, he has an obligation to answer questions at his \nconfirmation hearing for the highest judicial job in the land. He \ncannot, as previous nominees have done, say, I refuse to answer. Have \nhis views changed? Is his mind made up? Was he exaggerating for a \npotential employer? And if he was, how should we view what he says to \nus in the committee as he seeks an even higher position? Is he bent on \nadvancing a particular ideological position?\n  Past nominees have said they could not discuss these issues for fear \nof creating a perception of bias. Here, unfortunately, the application \nitself creates the perception of bias and it will be essential for \nJudge Alito to address the issue head-on.\n  In conclusion, every Supreme Court nominee has a high burden. For \nJudge Alito that burden is triply high: first, because he seems to have \nbeen picked to placate the extreme rightwing; second, because of his \npast statements suggesting a closed mind on certain controversial \nissues; and, finally, because he is replacing Justice O'Connor, for 25 \nyears the pivotal swing seat on a divided Supreme Court.\n  I hope Judge Alito will be able to meet that burden.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to address the nomination of Samuel \nAlito to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. Judicial \nnominees should be judged on their qualifications and their judicial \nphilosophy. On the first point, there is no question that Judge Alito \nis qualified to sit on the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  In 1990, when the first President Bush nominated Judge Alito to the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, the American Bar \nAssociation unanimously gave him its highest ``well qualified'' rating. \nThis body confirmed him at that time without dissent.\n  Regarding judicial philosophy, the most important principle is that \njudges are not politicians. When we hear someone talk only about the \nresults of a judge's decisions, chances are they are applying a \npolitical rather than a judicial standard. This is what we heard today \non this floor from my Democratic colleagues.\n  The description of Judge Alito's record by the Senator from New York, \nMr. Schumer, was all about results. This is how he put it: In case \nafter case, Judge Alito seems to find a way to rule on the side of \nbusiness over the consumer; on the side of employer over employee; and \noften against civil rights, against workers' rights, against women's \nrights.\n  It would be tough to present a more distorted picture of what judges \nactually do. Judges do not decide for or against the rights of groups. \nJudges do not take the side of one group against another. To suggest, \nas the Senator from New York did, that Judge Alito is actually biased \ntoward certain parties, that he intends to take a particular side, that \nhe, in the Senator's words, seems to find a way to rule a certain way, \nis just beyond the pale.\n  Perhaps my Democratic colleagues could provide a list of the side \nthat judges are supposed to take in this case or that. Perhaps they \ncould give us a rundown of the groups whose rights judges are supposed \nto favor, regardless\n\n[[Page S12883]]\n\nof the facts. It might be something like a rate card or perhaps just a \nbig piece of litmus paper. That would make this confirmation process a \nwhole lot easier for all of us. Nominees could just check boxes and get \na confirmation score.\n  Are you for big business or are you for the little guy? Are you for \nthis or are you for that? The facts do not make any difference, no \nmatter how right the big guy might be or the little guy might be.\n  Politicians take sides. Politicians promote political interests. \nPoliticians pursue agendas. Judges are not politicians. Judges settle \nlegal disputes between specific parties by applying the law to specific \nfacts. Without talking about the facts and the law, it is impossible to \nproperly evaluate judicial decisions.\n  It is not enough, as we heard this morning, to toss in words like \n``troubling'' since all that means is that the person using that label \ndoes not like the result. It is not enough to observe that Judge Alito \nwas alone in dissent or that the Supreme Court declined to review a \nparticular decision. Those would be marks of distinction of judicial \ncourage if the Senator from New York liked the result.\n  If such results-oriented litmus tests are appropriate, Judge Alito's \nlong record contains results to fit every political taste.\n  Judge Alito has voted on the pro-choice side in some of his abortion-\nrelated cases. He has voted for civil rights plaintiffs, against \nprosecutors, and even in favor of death row inmates desiring to file \nhabeas corpus petitions. Imagine that. Judge Alito will likely get no \ncredit from my liberal friends for these votes, but he should.\n  As I said, we must apply a judicial rather than a political standard \nto evaluate a judicial rather than a political record.\n  This morning, the minority leader, Senator Reid, also spoke about the \nAlito nomination. I would like to respond to a few of his points. \nFirst, he said the nomination was not, as he put it, ``the product of \nconsultation with Senate Democrats as envisioned by the Founding \nFathers.''\n  America's Founders envisioned no such thing but actually advised \nagainst it. The Founders gave the power to nominate and appoint \nexclusively to the President. The Senate's role is to advise the \nPresident whether he should appoint someone he has already nominated, \nexpressing that advice through an up-or-down vote.\n  Some of my Democratic colleagues are fond of taking jabs at President \nBush by saying that this is the third nomination to replace Justice \nSandra Day O'Connor. If that is true, then he should get credit for \nconsulting with more than 70 Senators, more than any President has ever \ndone regarding a Supreme Court nominee.\n  The idea that consultations for the same position must begin all over \nagain when the first nominee is appointed elsewhere is absurd.\n  I hope this will be a fair, honest, and thorough process that results \nin an up-or-down confirmation vote. I applaud the minority leader for \nsaying this morning that every judicial nominee is entitled to an up-\nor-down vote. In the 108th Congress, of course, he had a different \nattitude, leading filibusters against 10 different appeals court \nnominees, along with Senator Daschle.\n  While the minority leader, this morning, lamented the fact that Judge \nAlito is not Hispanic, one of the filibusters he led in 2003 targeted \nMiguel Estrada, a highly qualified nominee to the Federal appeals \nbench. Perhaps race only matters some of the time.\n  Until Democratic Senators began filibustering judicial nominees in \n2003 with partisan, leader-led filibusters, it has been Senate \ntradition that judicial nominees reaching the floor received up-or-down \nvotes. While I hope the minority leader will help us return to that \ntradition, and I believe he may, he may have a bit of a challenge on \nhis hands.\n  Although the minority leader claimed this morning that not a single \nDemocrat has talked about filibustering the Alito nomination, the \nSenator from California, Mrs. Boxer, told the Associated Press on \nNovember 1 that ``the filibuster is on the table.''\n  According to the Baltimore Sun on November 2, the Senator from Iowa, \nMr. Harkin, said ``I believe Democrats will filibuster this nominee.''\n  The Associated Press reported on November 3 that Democrats have, in \nfact, raised the possibility of a filibuster. Yes, Democrats are \nalready talking filibuster, and I hope the minority leader meant what \nhe said this morning and urges them to take a deep breath.\n  I urge my colleagues, the media, and the American people to apply the \nright standard to this and to all judicial nominations. It must be a \njudicial rather than a political standard when we decide these matters. \nIt must examine the law and the facts of cases as well as the results, \nand it must be fair to this highly qualified and honorable nominee.\n  I have been kind of tough on my colleagues on the other side, but I \nbelieve everything I said is true. I believe it is time to get rid of \nthe populism and start talking about what we can do to help America. \nOne of the best things we can do is to confirm Judge Alito to the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, many Members have serious reservations \nabout the Alito nomination to the Supreme Court.\n  It is obvious that Judge Alito was chosen because the right wing of \nthe Republican Party felt Harriet Miers did not meet their litmus test \nfor Federal judges, a test of right-wing philosophy that was laid out \nin great detail by the Justice Department itself when Ed Meese was \nAttorney General in the 1980s. The right wing flexed its muscle and \nrebelled even when George Bush said, in effect: Trust me--she will be \nyour kind of justice.\n  Well before Judge Alito was nominated, these core supporters of the \nPresident were aware of the President's dwindling public support, and \nknew he would be highly unlikely to cross them again. They were certain \nthat Judge Alito passed their ideological test. They embraced him \nimmediately, then moved in lock step with the White House to support \nand defend him.\n  The reasons for that immediate endorsement by the right are obvious. \nOn key issues of equal rights, fairness, and access to justice, he has \nrepeatedly found ways to keep people from vindicating their rights, \nobtaining remedies, and protecting themselves from government invasions \nof their privacy.\n  He supported a warrantless strip search of a 10-year-old girl, the \nelimination of black jurors despite a black defendant's objection, the \ndismissal of a case against an industrial polluter who had 150 water \nquality violations, the power of a state to intrude in personal medical \ndecisions of women in Pennsylvania, and people who wanted to make \nmachine guns in their homes.\n  On Tuesday, the Reagan Presidential Library made public his 1985 \napplication for a promotion in the Meese Justice Department, in which \nhe pledged his allegiance to the right wing views that Attorney General \nMeese stood for. In the application, he stated, ``I am and always have \nbeen . . . an adherent to'' these views.\n  He traced his views back to Barry Goldwater's 1964 campaign, which \nfeatured strong opposition to civil rights at a time when the growing \nnational support for such rights had just accomplished the landmark \nCivil Rights Acts of 1964 banning racial discrimination in public \naccommodations.\n  As far back as college, he said, his view of constitutional law had \nbeen ``motivated in large part by disagreement with the Warren Court \ndecisions,'' particularly the historic decisions supporting basic \nfairness in the criminal justice system, separation of church and \nstate, and fair districting for legislative elections. In short, for \nall 20 years of his prior political activity, he had been a dedicated \nright wing advocate, especially on the major issues that led to the \nposting of the ``Impeach Earl Warren'' billboards on highways at the \ntime.\n  We have also learned of his failure to recuse himself in a case \ninvolving the Vanguard mutual funds, in which he had a personal \ninvestment of hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n  A different justification was tried out each time his participation \nwas challenged in recent weeks, even though he had specifically pledged \nto the Senate Judiciary Committee not to sit on ``any cases involving \nthe Vanguard companies,'' regardless of whether he was technically \nrequired to recuse himself.\n  It appears that either the Judge or the White House is desperately \nrunning\n\n[[Page S12884]]\n\nnew explanations up the flagpole to see if anyone salutes them.\n  When I saw him yesterday, he dismissed the blunt ideological \ncommitments in his application to the Meese Justice Department as \nsimply part of the job application process, and told me, in essence, \nthat it shouldn't be taken seriously. But now he is applying for a job \non the Supreme Court.\n  Should we take his assurances about ignoring ideology as a judge any \nmore seriously now?\n  The American people have a right to better answers about the record \nof any nominee to the Nation's highest Court. Certainly, in the \nhearings to come, Senators will learn a great deal more about whether \nJudge Alito has the basic commitment to core constitutional rights \nessential to our Nation, and I look forward to those hearings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/16/senate-section/article/S12884-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of S. 1783 which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1783) to amend the Employee Retirement Income \n     Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \n     reform the pension funding rules, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the managers' \namendment at the desk is agreed to. The bill will be considered \noriginal text for further amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2581) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, this is a very exciting day. We are here to \nthe debate on the pensions bill. Every day hard-working Americans go to \ntheir jobs, they are confident we here in Washington are looking out \nfor them and doing everything we can to assure that they will be able \nto retire some day and live the life they have always dreamed about. \nFor our Nation's older workers and those who have already retired, \nthere are few things more important to them than the health of their \npension plan and the protection it provides. It involves younger \nworkers, too.\n  I am glad we are at this point. This may be one of the biggest bills \nthat has ever been covered with as little debate as we will have today. \nPart of the reason for that is how detailed it is and how many moving \nparts there are. I congratulate all of the people who have worked on \nthis bill and worked cooperatively, both sides of the aisle. We have \neven had some conversations with the other end of the building in order \nto be able to get it to this point at this time.\n  I particularly have to commend Senator Kennedy and his staff and my \nstaff. August is normally a time when we are at recess and traveling \nour States, as I was and Senator Kennedy was. It is normally a time our \nstaff can catch up on things. It was not. It was a time they were \nheavily involved in negotiations to come up with the best possible \npackage for protecting the retirement of the people of this country, \nand they worked virtually around the clock during the entire month of \nAugust. Senator Kennedy and I were on the phone several times working \nout some of the big issues and trying to keep the focus on the \ndirection it needed to go.\n  I also have to specifically congratulate Senator Isakson. He has been \nour coordinator with airlines on this whole thing, and had the airlines \nnot had a crisis, I am not sure we would be here today debating \npensions. It was enough of a focal point, enough of an impetus that it \ngot us on the track of solving all of the pension issues, in all of the \naspects, and I think we have a very complete reform package here.\n  Of course, I would be remiss if I did not mention Senator Lott and \nSenator Coleman, who also were strong advocates on getting a solution \nfor airlines so we would stop seeing the airlines go into bankruptcy \nover their pension problem. We have a team of them here today to add \none more amendment that will make sure we will have airlines and to \nmake sure that airline employees will have a solvent retirement \npackage.\n  I also have to thank Senator DeWine and Senator Mikulski, the \nchairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Pensions on Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions. They held a number of hearings that set \nup the data so we would actually have information on which to base this \npension reform. They have done a tremendous job, not just with the \ncommittee but also representing particularly people in manufacturing \nacross this country who also have some very special problems at this \npoint in time.\n  I would also mention Senators Stabenow and Senator Levin, who have a \nmajority of those manufacturing workers. In fact, they probably \nrepresent more manufacturing workers than there are people in the whole \nState of Wyoming. But the team of people worked together and put \ntogether a bill for the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee. Senator Grassley and I, and the members of the Budget \nCommittee, had an amendment in the budget bill that required that the \nHELP Committee and the Finance Committee merge a bill. I have to \ncongratulate Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus for their tremendous \nwork with the Finance Committee to put together a separate bill that \ncovered all the jurisdictional areas of the Finance Committee, and then \ntheir effort with us to merge a bill, which is the bill that is here \ntoday.\n  I have to tell you there were a lot of people betting that, first, \nneither committee would be able to report a bill out of committee and, \nsecondly, that we would never be able to merge the two bills. It has a \nlot to do with Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley and their staffs \nbeing extremely involved and working again in this detailed, ``many \nmoving parts'' bill. That is the reason we are here today and have a \nrather comprehensive bill, and it is one that people have been \nscrutinizing and working on through all of the months of this year.\n\n  I think it is a tribute to all of the people who have worked on it \nthat we have limited debate on S. 1783. Only two amendments are being \noffered, and then we will have a final vote. That is a lot of agreement \nfor this body of 100 people who usually have a lot of disagreement.\n  I have some other comments, but I will make them later and allow \npeople to get on with describing the actual workings of this bill to \nthe point where we can do a final vote.\n  I yield to my neighbor from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague, Senator Enzi \nfrom Wyoming, the chairman of the HELP Committee. As he has indicated, \nhis committee, along with Senator Kennedy, the ranking member of that \ncommittee, Senator Grassley, chairman of the Finance Committee, and \nmyself, the four of us worked together to be where we are today. \nClearly we are where we are today because a lot of employees, a lot of \nretirees are very worried about their pension benefits. The essential \nway to help address that situation is to make sure these plans are more \nfully funded so as the promise is made, the promise is kept and, \nsecond, to make sure the backstop of the PBGC is also there when \ncompanies facing incredible pressures worldwide feel they have to no \nlonger live up to their pension obligations and those obligations are \npassed on to the PBGC.\n  It is worldwide competitive pressures that big American companies and \nsmaller American companies are facing as well as the Enron collapse \nwhich has forced us to take a good, hard look at this to try to find \nsome good solutions. I thank Senator Enzi, Senator Grassley, and \nSenator Kennedy for their very good work.\n  It is important to say a little bit about this bill so Americans know \nwhat we are doing today. Millions of workers clearly have worked very \nhard over their lifetime. American workers, when they work, feel they \nare playing by the rules. They want to play by the rules and they want \nto do what is right. This bill, frankly, is about making sure that the \nretirement benefits\n\n[[Page S12885]]\n\nare there when people need them, more likely to be there than a lot of \npeople think.\n  As we start the debate, let's remember why we are here. We are here \nto protect workers' pension benefits, plainly and simply. That is why \nwe are here. This need was highlighted recently by cover stories in \nTime magazine and the New York Times Sunday magazine. Their titles were \n``The Broken Promise''--that was Time magazine--and ``The End of \nPensions'' in the New York Times magazine. I highly recommend all \nMembers of this body read these articles. I read them both. They are \nvery thorough and very perceptive in stating the problems and some of \nthe solutions to the problems Americans face in having retirement \nbenefits.\n  The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, PBGC, was established to \nprotect workers' pensions, but there are limits on PBGC's guarantees. \nMany participants have been promised benefits in excess of those \nguaranteed by the PBGC. When a company fails and the pension plan \nterminates with unfunded benefit promises, these workers and retirees \npay severely for pension underfunding with part of their own hard-\nearned retirement benefits.\n  For example, the PBGC--and that is the outfit that takes over failed \nplans--has estimated that almost 7,000 United Airlines workers will \nlose 50 percent or more of the benefits they had earned under their \npension plans. Another 28,000 United Airlines workers will lose between \na quarter and half of their benefits. Clearly, as a result, promises to \nthose employees are not being kept. We are here to try to help make \nsure those promises are better kept, and this bill will help move in \nthat direction.\n  The most basic building block of pension funding is the interest rate \nused to determine the present value of benefits to be paid for the plan \nin the future. This bill provides a permanent replacement for the 30-\nyear Treasury rate which has been used basically for this purpose--that \nis, determining the interest rate--under current law.\n  Under this legislation, we will change that. It is true Congress did \npass a temporary substitute last year. This bill is to enact a \npermanent interest rate calculation. This bill would extend the current \ntemporary interest rate--a corporate bond rate--for an additional year, \nand then begin phasing in a permanent solution known as a modified \nyield curve of interest rates. Using a yield curve to determine the \nvalue of future benefit payments is more accurate than using a single \ninterest rate because the yield curve recognizes that you get a \ndifferent interest rate on a 5-year loan than, say, on a 15-year loan, \nand that is relevant because clearly more people work longer than \nothers, so their retirement is a different period of time.\n  This bill simplifies that yield curve by breaking it into three \nsegments--retaining the improved accuracy of a yield-curve measurement, \nwhile making it easier to apply the rates.\n  There are other key changes to the funding rules.\n  Unfunded benefit liabilities would have to be paid off over a 7-year \nperiod. Ideally, every plan would be 100 percent funded every year, but \nwith fluctuating asset values and interest rates, that is not \npractical.\n  Large companies could base cost calculations on their own mortality \nexperience. Workers in some industries do not live as long as the \ngeneral population. That affects the cost of providing lifetime \npensions and should be reflected in an accurate measurement of funding \nobligations.\n  The increased utilization of early retirement subsidies that occurs \nwhen troubled companies start downsizing is reflected in a special at-\nrisk liability calculation. This will ensure that companies begin \nfunding for subsidized benefits before it is too late.\n  The at-risk calculation is not a penalty imposed on companies when \nthey are down and out. It is a reflection of increased costs. Someone \nhas to pay those costs. The question is who. Should other companies pay \nthrough increases in PBGC premiums? Should workers pay through lost \nretirement benefits? Or should we, as I believe, require the company \nthat made the promise fund the promise?\n  Failure to recognize the real cost of benefits is one reason for the \nsystem's funding problems. Another is that current law actually would \nhave penalized many employers if they had contributed more to their \npension plans.\n  Employer after employer has told us that we need to allow companies \nto contribute and deduct more in good times to build a cushion for bad \ntimes. This bill does that. It allows companies to deduct contributions \nthat would fund the plan up to 180 percent of the cost of benefits \nalready earned and allows employers to maintain a prefunding account \nwith these extra contributions, which is sort of a rainy day fund, to \nhelp them meet contribution requirements when cash is a little tighter.\n  Our goal is retirement security, assuring workers that benefits they \nhad been promised will be paid. There are two sides to keeping that \npromise--funding what is promised by the company and also not promising \nmore than a company can afford to pay.\n  This bill limits increases in a plan's benefit formula if the plan is \nless than 80 percent funded. If a plan is less than 60 percent funded, \nthen no more benefits can be earned until funding improves. Employers \nwould have to fund up collective bargaining plans to keep these \nlimitations from kicking in.\n  To make sure poorly funded plans do not become even more unfunded, \nthis bill limits the portion of a benefit that can be paid in a lump \nsum if a plan is less than 60 percent funded. Lump sum payment of \npension benefits can drain plan assets and hurt other workers. No \nbenefits would be forfeited. The difference would be paid as an \nannuity. Retirement benefits are the largest asset of many workers, and \nthey deserve timely, complete information on the state of their \ninvestment. Under this bill, most workers and retirees will receive \ndetailed funding information within 90 days after the end of the year. \nThat is new.\n  There was a time when pension plans paid monthly benefits at normal \nretirement age, usually based on years of service and some average \ncompensation. The benefits were heavily weighted to workers who spent \ntheir entire career with one company. But in today's competitive world, \nthat is not likely to be the future. Today many companies have moved to \ncash balance plans or other hybrid arrangements that are structured \nmore similar to 401(k) plans, defined contribution plans. Benefits are \nearned more evenly over a worker's career and are more portable--easier \nto move from one job to another--than the traditional pension benefit. \nThere has been uncertainty surrounding these plans, and litigation is \nongoing. If defined benefit plans are to be a viable, attractive option \nin the future--and there is a real question whether they can be, and we \nare trying to make sure we can be--we must bring some certainty to the \nrules governing these arrangements. That is cash balance and hybrids.\n\n  This bill lays down the rules for moving forward with these plans. It \nrecognizes the legitimacy of the basic design. It also provides \nprotections for older workers when a traditional plan that rewards a \nlifetime of hard work is converted to one of these hybrid arrangements \nthat is designed for a more mobile workforce. I think we have done a \ngood job of protecting participants without putting too onerous a \nburden on employers.\n  Let me emphasize that this is a prospective provision; it is not \nretroactive. We do not step into the legal quagmire that exists with \nregard to the past. I want to make it clear that this bill offers \nneither side an inference as to interpretation of existing rules.\n  Some of the provisions in this bill that provide participant \nprotections were in a bill we introduced in the 107th Congress, a bill \ndesigned to help prevent another Enron.\n  We all remember Enron. Thousands of workers lost their jobs. Because \ntheir 401(k) accounts were heavily invested in company stock, these \nworkers lost most of their retirement savings as well. In February \n2002, ``60 Minutes'' did a segment called ``Who Killed Montana Power,'' \nabout my own State's experience with employers behaving badly and havoc \nwreaked on employees and their savings. The story reported one worker \nhad lost $350,000 in his 401(k) plan because of the crash of employer \nstock. He certainly was not alone.\n\n[[Page S12886]]\n\n  This is not to say company stock is a bad investment. Sometimes it is \na wonderful investment. So this bill does not prohibit investment in \nemployer stock. It simply puts the choice where it should be--in the \nhands of participants who are building up their retirement savings.\n  To help make that decision, we give workers tools to make good \ndecisions and understand the consequences of their actions. We require \nmore frequent benefit statements, and we provide a safe harbor to make \nit easier for employers to make independent investment advice available \nto plan participants if they want independent investment advice.\n  This bill has a number of other provisions that will make it easier \nfor a worker to move retirement plans from employer to employer or from \nan employer plan to an IRA. There are also provisions that make it \neasier to administer retirement programs.\n  All of us are fortunate to have the benefits of the Federal \nretirement system. We have good pensions. We have good retiree health \nbenefits, and I might add the PBGC does nothing to health benefits. \nThis legislation does nothing to health benefits. It is only pension \nbenefits. Health benefits is something that has to be addressed clearly \nand solidly at a not-too-distant date.\n  Imagine, however, if the Government all of a sudden said: Sorry, we \ncan't afford that retirement, all you folks in Federal Government; we \nare going to cut it back; you will have to learn to live on less. That \nwould be a problem, and it is a problem for many Americans.\n  That is what many of America's older workers and retirees are facing. \nOur steel workers, our airline workers, and many others have had the \nrug pulled out from under them. It is no one's fault, certainly not \ntheirs. America's companies are competing in a cutthroat world. It is \nimportant to remember that. They have problems too.\n  What we are trying to do today is ask everyone to be more responsible \nand strike the right balance. We need a system where companies put \nenough money aside to pay for what they promise. And we need a system \nwhere workers who carry out their part of the bargain do not have to \nworry that a pension was more dream than substance.\n  This is a tough challenge. The bill is not perfect. It is a \ncompromise. But I believe it is a good bill and should become law. The \nretirement security of millions of workers deserves our attention. I \nurge my colleagues to support keeping promises, to support protecting \nworkers' retirement benefits. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2582\n\n(Purpose: To modify pension funding rules related to airlines, and for \n                            other purposes)\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I call up my amendment at the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Isakson] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2582.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Amendments \nSubmitted.'')\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing Senators be added to the amendment as cosponsors: Senators \nLott, Coleman, Rockefeller, DeWine, Alexander, Bennett, Burns, Hatch, \nand Chambliss.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, it is a privilege for me to introduce a \nMember of the Senate who has been instrumental in bringing this \namendment to the floor, Senator Coleman from Minnesota. I yield him 4 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 4 minutes.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to work with the Senator \nfrom Georgia. I wish to talk about a piece of this amendment. Before I \ndo, I thank Chairman Enzi and Ranking Member Kennedy for the work they \nhave done on this bill. I represent Minnesota, Big 10 football, big \nground game, not fancy passes. The Senator from Wyoming is not a \nrabbit, not fast on his feet, but, boy, is he solid, steady, and \nconsistent. This is a great bill.\n  There is a piece particularly important to the folks in my State and \nactually throughout the country. This is not just about my State. \nPension reform provisions relating to the airline industry take the \nburdens off the taxpayers. That is what this is about.\n  Let me be clear, when airlines cannot meet their pension obligations, \nthe Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, PBGC, is saddled with the \nresponsibility. Who is the PBGC? It is the American taxpayer. That is \nwho is saddled with the responsibility.\n  In my State alone, Northwest Airlines is struggling to meet its \nobligations and make good on their promises of pensions to its \nemployees. Minnesota has almost 22,000 people who depend on Northwest \nAirlines pensions. As the Senator from Montana said a minute ago, this \nis about promises made and about promises being kept.\n  The Federal law defining underfunded defined pension benefit plans is \nseriously broken and must be fixed. A number of airlines have already \nterminated their defined benefit plans in bankruptcy and transferred \nthem to PBGC. Other carriers may well suffer the same fate.\n  I am not going to go into detail as to why it happened--stock market \ndeclines, low interest rates, September 11, record oil prices--but as a \nresult, the deficit reduction contribution rules kick in. They require \nthat Northwest and other carriers make massive additional contributions \nto its defined benefit plans that they cannot afford.\n  It is difficult to overstate how profoundly these DRC rules have \nimpacted the funding of pensions. It would be akin to telling \nhomeowners with 30-year mortgages that if the value of their homes drop \nbelow 80 percent of the purchase price, for whatever reason, their loan \nwill be accelerated such that the balance will become due in 3 to 5 \nyears. This is a problem. Common sense is not in play. This amendment \nprovides common sense to pension laws.\n  This amendment provides some protection to the taxpayers. This \namendment provides protection to the employees. They should get what \nthey have worked for. Promises made, promises kept.\n  Northwest has worked with the labor unions. They developed a proposal \ncontained in this compromise bill allowing them to proceed in a way to \nstop adding to the underfunding of airline plans by requiring airlines \nand their affected unions to freeze their plans, ceasing future benefit \naccruals, and protect the PBGC by freezing the PBGC guarantee. It would \nfix the broken DRC rules by extending the term of the pension \n``mortgage'' from its current 3-to-5-year amortization period to a \nlonger amortization period.\n  Under this proposal, retirees and plan participants would receive the \nbenefits they earned to the date of the freeze. Retirees would be \nprotected. In addition, the PBGC will be in better shape financially \nsince its liability will be capped, and each airline payment that an \nairline makes to the plan will reduce that liability.\n  The bottom line is this: Northwest and other airlines are not seeking \na subsidy, they are not seeking a bailout from the Government. Just the \nopposite. They are asking for a responsible alternative to current law \nthat lets them pay their pension liabilities versus shifting those \nobligations on to a Government agency.\n  It is the right thing to do. It is a fiscally responsible thing to \ndo. It is the right thing to do for the employers and taxpayers. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I first thank Senator Coleman for his remarks and \nassociate myself with those remarks. I particularly thank Chairman Enzi \nof the HELP Committee, as well as Senator Kennedy. They have made sure \nthat\n\n[[Page S12887]]\n\nthis stayed alive during the course of this session.\n  I thank Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus for the efforts they made \non pensions and particularly thank Senator Coleman and Senator Lott for \ntheir untiring efforts to bring this to reality today.\n  I wish to go back to one thing Mr. Coleman said briefly by \nacknowledging what brings us to this point in terms of airlines. In the \npast 5 years, there have been five things that have happened, none of \nwhich would be in control of the aviation industry: the decline of the \nstock market early in this decade, the tragic events of 9/11 which \ngrounded American aviation, the unprecedented historically and \ncontinuously low interest rates, the hurricanes that hit the United \nStates and shut down refineries and petroleum and closed major airline \nmarkets for transportation, and not the least of which is petroleum \ngoing to $70 a barrel and aviation fuel tripling in its cost.\n  If we take all of those and combine them with the constraints of the \ncurrent formula on pensions, one can understand why the aviation \nindustry has had the difficulties it has had and how employees of \nlegacy airlines will lose their pension benefits unless we adopt \nreasonable and appropriate amendments such as the amendment we propose \ntoday.\n  Very simply, this amendment does a couple of things. One is for the \naviation industry. It allows the amortization of the obligation over a \n20-year period of time, an amount that is manageable, an amount that is \ndoable, an amount that for all intents and purposes will ensure \nemployees will get the pensions they have earned. Failure to adopt this \namendment will almost guarantee that those employees of airlines such \nas Delta, Northwest, and others will not ultimately get the pension \nbenefits they have earned. The major consequence of that will be the \ntaxpayers of the United States of America, through their surrogate, the \nPBGC, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, will have the \nadditional liability those pensions will thrust upon the PBGC.\n  In this amendment, we have met the challenges the aviation industry \nhas before it. We have looked responsibly at the right formula and the \nway in which to calculate that formula to ensure the benefits are paid. \nWe have addressed the concerns of the industry and its individual \nairlines, all of which have similar unique but some different problems.\n  In particular, what we do is give hope for the employees to get their \nbenefits. We cap the liability of the PBGC, and we ensure that one of \nthe most important elements of the U.S. economy, the aviation industry, \nis not forced by laws that are out of sync to unfund, defund, or \njettison their pension plans for the employees who have made those \nairlines fly throughout their careers and throughout their history.\n  We have some time remaining on our allocation for the amendment, to \nwhich Senator Lott was to speak but was called away. I reserve the \nremainder of our time on the amendment for Senator Lott upon his \nreturn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent to speak up to 10 minutes under \nthe time controlled on the Democratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I note that the distinguished chairman of the Finance \nCommittee has come to the Chamber, and I know he is eager to speak on \nthe bill and has many demanding responsibilities.\n  I compliment both Senators Enzi and Kennedy, as well as Senators \nGrassley and Baucus, on the outstanding job they have done in \ndeveloping this legislation and putting two bills together. Pension \nreform is one of the most important issues facing the American people, \nand Congress must rise to the challenge of passing legislation. Reform \nis needed to protect workers' pensions, to protect good-guy businesses, \nand also to protect the American taxpayer, who often ends up being the \nsafety net for so many pensions.\n  The bill before us today is generally a very good bill. Yes, I do see \nsome yellow flashing lights about two provisions of the bill regarding \nthe use of credit rating and something called smoothing. That is why \nSenator DeWine and I had originally wanted to offer an amendment to \navoid the unintended consequences that might push companies to drop \ntheir pension plans and leave workers in desperation.\n  In recent days, we have made a lot of progress. Senator DeWine and I \nhave had very constructive conversations with Senators Grassley and \nBaucus. Senators Enzi and Kennedy have been particularly helpful in \nbrokering a resolution to some of the issues. The process seemed far \nless ominous when their wise heads and hands got involved in it. Their \nhelp was invaluable in ironing out some of the wrinkles. I believe we \nhave a commitment to work together in conference to address our \nconcerns because I truly believe that the Senate bill is in many ways a \nsuperior bill to those in the House. This is why I am eager to see this \nbill move ahead.\n  Throughout my career, everyone knows I have been fighting for the \nlittle guy. This is no different. Pensions are part of the American \ndream. People believe that if one works hard, they can get ahead, but \nalso if they work hard, they are going to have a pension. A pension has \nto serve as one of three legs of an increasingly wobbly stool \nsupporting older Americans in retirement. That is why we are so \nconcerned about the fragility of so many pension plans in our own \ncountry.\n\n  We have worked from the beginning on a bipartisan basis. Senator \nDeWine and I are the chair and ranking member of the Subcommittee on \nRetirement Security and Aging in the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee, of which Senator Enzi is the chair and Senator \nKennedy is ranking. We held a series of hearings, and they were \noutstanding. I wish the American people could have seen them. They were \ncontent rich, and they were also characterized by civility, \nparticularly among members. The hearings demonstrated the need for \ncomprehensive reform that addressed not just single-employer plans, but \nmulti-employer plans and cash balance plans as well.\n  What I like about the bill is that we have a smart bill, we have a \ngood bill, and we have a bipartisan bill. When we looked at it, part of \nour bipartisan framework was to let us do no harm either to the people \nwho need pensions or to the people who provide the jobs and the \nbusiness. We need to make sure workers do not lose their pensions. We \nhad to look out for good-guy businesses that are doing everything they \ncan to fund their pensions. We also had to protect the taxpayer and \nensure that the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation was solvent. It \nmust not be used as a dumping ground for those companies that want to \nwalk away from their pensions even though there was no need to. I \nbelieve we accomplished so much in those principles: do no harm, \nprotect the worker, protect good-guy businesses, and look out for our \ntaxpayers.\n  When the HELP bill was merged into the finance bill, many \nimprovements were made, but there were several provisions that, as I \nsaid, had yellow flashing lights. One is the issue of credit rating and \nthe other is the issue of smoothing.\n  There are those within the HELP Committee--and my colleague, Senator \nDeWine, and I count ourselves as two of them--who are concerned that a \ncompany's credit rating is being used as an indicator of its pension \nplan's health. Companies with bad credit ratings could be forced to put \nin extra payments, even if they had been responsible in making regular \npayments to their generally well-funded plans.\n  Credit rating is a blunt instrument. Data from Moody's, one of the \nNation's leading credit rating companies, should help explain this. \nMoody's looked at companies that were sub-investment grade and followed \nthem for a full 20 years. After these 20 years, a majority of the \ncompanies had not defaulted on their bonds. This tells us that the \ncompanies had not gone bankrupt.\n  Some people are worried that weak companies will go into bankruptcy \nand dump their pension plans. The facts say otherwise: a majority of \ncompanies in junk-bond status won't go bankrupt. Forcing struggling \ncompanies to make new draconian payments could end up pushing many \ncompanies to terminate their plans or enter bankruptcy. We have to take \nthat into consideration.\n\n[[Page S12888]]\n\nThis means in fact this language would bring about exactly what it is \ndesigned to protect against.\n  Auto manufacturers and tech companies, many of whom are just now \nregaining their financial stability, could be among those hit hardest \nby these provisions. We should encourage these viable businesses to \ncontinue making contributions to their plans, not push them into \nbankruptcy.\n  Such an unintended consequence could well cost many Americans their \njobs and their pensions. Senator DeWine and I wanted to make a targeted \nchange to the bill to help prevent this, substituting the actual \nmeasure of a plan's health in place of credit ratings.\n  The other issue that concerned me is limitations on smoothing. \nSmoothing is the process of averaging estimates of assets and \nliabilities and is used because pensions are by nature long-term \ninvestments. Smoothing improves predictability and makes it easier for \ncompanies to plan their budgets around their pension contributions.\n  Under current law, companies can average estimates of assets and \nliabilities over 4 or 5 years to smooth fluctuations in the stock \nmarket and in interest rates. Senator DeWine and I wanted to tighten \nthis to 3 years, which is more restrictive than current law but more \neffective than the merged bill's one year. Numerous experts have said \nthat one year is just not enough.\n  I also want to highlight a key transparency provision in the merged \nbill that requires companies to issue a snapshot, unsmoothed picture of \ntheir assets and liabilities each year to participants and the PBGC. \nThis new disclosure addresses the criticism that smoothing can hide \nproblems in plan funding for several years. Now, many problems should \nbe apparent just 90 days after the end of the plan year.\n  Last Wednesday, the House Ways and Means committee passed Chairman \nThomas' bill. Like the HELP bill and like Chairman Boehner's bill, the \nWays and Means Committee didn't include credit rating and allowed 3 \nyears of smoothing.\n  I continue to feel strongly about the need to make changes to the \nlegislation before us today. I also believe it is imperative to \ncontinue moving through the legislative process so we can pass this \nmuch needed reform. The Ways and Means Committee has acted, and we now \nknow that the House of Representatives is sure to have a good position \non these issues. There are too many other good provisions in this bill \nthat we must pass.\n  I am not going to go into all the details of the bill. I note that \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee wishes to speak. We want to move \nthis legislation. I want to pass this bill so we can get to conference. \nWe want to say to the House: They sometimes think the Senate is the \nbody that talks more than it gets done. We challenge the House to pass \nthis bill before they leave the way the Senate is going to do it and to \ndo it the way we did it--working on a bipartisan basis.\n\n  I cannot say enough about the appreciation I have for Senator DeWine \nof Ohio, who was the chairman of the subcommittee. We worked together, \nand we really looked out for those jobs that have a defined benefit \nplan, particularly in the older manufacturing corporations. It was a \ndelight to work with him, and I look forward to that on many other \nissues.\n  Senator Enzi, with his accounting background, provided a steady hand \nand again has worked to create a culture and climate of civility that \nis becoming a hallmark of our committee. I have also appreciated \nworking with Senators Grassley and Baucus to achieve the melding of two \nvery good bills. We thank them and we thank their staffs for their \ncollegiality and consultation.\n  I look forward to voting for this bill. I look forward to being a \nconferee, and I look forward to bringing a bill back to the Senate not \nonly that the Senate can be proud of but that people who need pensions \ncan rely upon and that business does not fear. Government must be part \nof the solution rather than the problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland, Ms. \nMikulski, for her tremendous work. She showed such tremendous concern \nfor the workers and the companies, both of which are multiple in her \nState, and she did a great job of brokering for both to make sure the \nbusinesses would continue and the employees would get their pensions.\n  The Senator showed the depth of understanding that she already had \nand that she got from the hearings which were conducted. We appreciate \nthe bipartisan way she has worked on this to get us to this point.\n  I yield to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before I give my reasons to my \ncolleagues for why they should support this legislation and why it came \nout of my committee, there are several thank-yous I would like to give, \nfirst to Senator Baucus because this is truly a bipartisan bill that \ncame out of committee. In fact, I think it came out totally unanimous. \nOver a period of many months working with Senator Baucus, we were able \nto put something together to get that kind of bipartisan support.\n  Then later on, the HELP Committee reported a bill. There was \nextremely great cooperation between Senator Enzi and Senator Kennedy \nwith Senator Baucus and me. I do not say this tongue-in-cheek, I say it \nas a matter of fact: I think if one can get Senator Enzi and Senator \nGrassley together on one side of the aisle and Senator Baucus and \nSenator Kennedy together on the other side of the aisle, there ought to \nbe something that ought to pass this body.\n  I also lend compliments and support for helping move this bill along \nto Senator Mikulski and Senator DeWine because they had a very \ncontroversial amendment--they may not have thought it was \ncontroversial--and we were able to work out some understandings beyond \nthe action on this floor to accomplish that. So we would not be here \ntoday doing this bill without Senator Mikulski and Senator DeWine's \ncooperation. I thank the Senator from Maryland for that, and Senator \nDeWine as well.\n  I am very pleased that the Senate now is turning their attention to \nwhat we call the Pension Security and Transparency Act, 2005. It is a \nbipartisan bill, and I support it. I think every Member of the Senate \nought to be proud to support this bill and, of course, only a rollcall \nwill show that.\n  This is a bill that is about one thing--improving the retirement \nsecurity of all Americans. It will improve Americans' retirement years \nin many different ways. Much of the public focus on this legislation \nhas been on the comprehensive pension funding reforms that are in the \nlegislation. Those reforms are very important, but before I talk about \nthose, I wish to spend a couple of minutes talking about other \nimportant provisions in the bill.\n  No. 1, the bill represents a completion of the post-Enron retirement \nplan reform that I have worked out with my good friend Senator Baucus, \nDemocrat ranking member. We all remember that when Enron spiraled into \nbankruptcy and the value of that company's stock evaporated, Enron \nemployees had 401(k) plans locked in Enron stock. They had no chance of \ndiversifying their 401(k) portfolios, and they were blocked from \nselling Enron stock at the time top executives were cashing that stock \nout with big gains for them. This bill would say that Enron practice is \nunacceptable for any company in the future. Employees should not be \nforced to stuff their 401(k) plans with company stock. Diversification \nis the most fundamental principle of sound investment strategy. The \nbipartisan legislation before us today then guarantees that employees \nhave the right to diversify their 401(k) accounts.\n\n  This bipartisan bill also seeks to increase savings by adopting new \nrules to promote automatic enrollment in 401(k) plans. Very often, I am \nafraid, the hardest dollar to save is that first dollar. Once people \nbegin to save, it can become a habit that lasts a lifetime. Automatic \nenrollment means that saving that first dollar will be easier, less \nredtape, and it means that millions of Americans then will be saving \nmany times more than what they save today. Obviously, every month we \nget statistics on savings that say Americans are almost, throughout the \nentire globe, the ones who save the least.\n\n[[Page S12889]]\n\n  The bipartisan bill before us today also simplifies retirement plan \nrules, making it easier and less burdensome for employers to give \nretirement plans to their employees. These types of changes will be \nparticularly helpful to small businesses, which are often discouraged \nfrom sponsoring a retirement plan because of the costs, administrative \ncosts particularly, and the redtape burdens. The bipartisan bill before \nus today would allow small businesses to combine a defined benefit plan \nwith a 401(k) plan, and they would do this into one simple plan called \nDB(k). This type of combined plan will give employees the best of both \nworlds at the same time.\n  Speaking of combining the best of both worlds, the bipartisan bill we \nare considering today provides long-needed clarifications that cash \nbalance and other types of hybrid pension plans are not inherently age \ndiscriminatory. Hybrid pensions combine positive features of both the \ntraditional pension plan and the defined contribution plans. These \nplans have long provided meaningful retirement benefits to employees. \nToday we will help to lift the cloud of legal uncertainty over these \nplans. At the same time, we also ensure that the rights of participants \nare protected and that the plans truly do meet the needs of today's \nmobile workforce by requiring faster vesting of employees' benefits in \nthose particular plans.\n  Finally, then, I will refer to the pension funding changes in this \nbill, those things that really have gotten the most attention and maybe \nare somewhat controversial. This bill honors a promise that we made way \nback in 1974, before I came to Congress, when the law governing plans, \ncalled ERISA, was enacted. That promise was made that the pensions of \nrank-and-file employees should not depend on the financial solvency of \ntheir particular employer. ERISA, the law, says that it is OK for a \nnonqualified pension of senior management to be exposed to the \ncompany's risk of bankruptcy. But then when it comes to the rank-and-\nfile employee, people who probably had as much to do with making the \ncompany as the manager, people who worked hard all their lives in hopes \nof a good retirement, and a pension being a part of that good \nretirement--those people's golden years should not be ruined because of \ntheir employer falling on hard times.\n  ERISA is meant to protect against that, and we are making some \nchanges to make sure that ERISA does what it was originally intended to \ndo in 1974, without using the taxpayer as a possible backstop. ERISA, I \nhope people believe, has worked pretty well for the last 30 years. But \nwe found that in recent years there are times that the promise of ERISA \nis not honored. So, today, we are here to fulfill the promise and to \nlet the American people know that if you have been promised a pension, \nwe are going to make sure that you receive it.\n  The pension funding reform in this bill also stands for another \nbedrock American principle that if you make a promise, you are \nresponsible for your own promise. We all know that most companies fund \ntheir pension plans in a very responsible manner. Unfortunately, there \nare a few--and it only takes a few bad apples to ruin the whole barrel \nof apples--but a few bad apples who have abused loopholes. Those are \nloopholes that are in the current rules to avoid funding pensions in a \nway that shows that they are responsible for their own promises.\n  Those few who have taken advantage of these loopholes have often, in \nthe end, dumped their pension plans on the Pension Benefit Guarantee \nCorporation, the Government agency that was set up to provide the \ninsurance; let's say in a sense like the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation does, for savers in bank accounts. These companies have \nessentially said we cannot pay our bills. Someone else is going to have \nto pay them for us. That is the PBGC.\n  Unfortunately, the people they want to pay are other employers who \nhave done the right thing and have guaranteed their employees the \npensions they promised. They are able to deliver on those promises. \nThose employers who are honest and upright get stuck with the bill, in \nthe form of higher premiums to the Pension Benefit Guarantee \nCorporation.\n  I think we would all agree that is not fair, and it is no way to run \na pension system. Even more unfair is the concept of a taxpayer bailout \nof the PBGC. One thing that I am for in this legislation is the attempt \nto make sure this does not happen, that the taxpayers are not laid bare \nfor this obligation that the corporation ought to pay, but that goes \nback to the irresponsible actions of a few bad apples who do not fund \ntheir pensions adequately. I do not want another savings and loan \nsituation like we had in the late 1980s coming out of bad policy in the \nPBGC.\n  As we have watched the financial condition of this Government \ncorporation deteriorate rapidly in recent years, the prospects of such \na bailout become increasingly real--in other words, a taxpayer bailout, \na savings-and-loan-type bailout that we do not want to let happen. In \nother words, we ought to show that we have learned a lesson, and \nhopefully this bill is a good step showing we have learned a lesson.\n  The bipartisan bill we have before us today will reverse the decline \nover time by improving pension funding and bringing additional premium \nrevenues into the corporation, the Pension Benefit Guarantee \nCorporation. This bipartisan bill represents a huge leap forward for \nretirement security.\n  Let me say I am cognizant of the fact that we in Congress are saying \nthat it is a huge leap forward. I think it ought to be known to all of \nmy colleagues that the President and his staff, who were interested in \nthis legislation, would say it is not good enough in this direction and \nmaybe there are opportunities, hopefully along the way, for \nimprovement.\n  I think, once again, in closing, I need to give thanks, as I have \nalready given. I start with Senator Baucus for his dedication in this \nlegislation. He has been a great partner to work with me to advance \nthis bill to where it is now. I also thank Chairman Enzi and Senator \nKennedy. I think we have had a partnership working together as two \ncommittees on legislation because we share jurisdiction. I have to \ncommend their dedication to important reforms that they put in their \nbill. They have been tireless in their efforts to get us to this point. \nI look forward to working closely with them and all my colleagues in \nthe Senate as we continue to work towards the goal of getting this \nbipartisan legislation to the President for his signature.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I would like to turn the wheel back on \nour time allotted to the Isakson amendment and yield that time to the \nSenator from Mississippi and, in so doing, repeat my acknowledgment of \nmy thanks to Senators Grassley, Baucus, Enzi, and Kennedy for their \ncooperation in allowing this amendment of the aviation portion of the \npension bill to come before the Senate today, and the distinguished \nSenator from Mississippi for his untiring effort to bring us to this \npoint today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the distinguished Senator from Georgia yielding me \nthat time. Might I inquire, what is the time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, first of all, I point out this is a classic \nexample of how we can work together to get an agreement to move needed, \nnecessary, balanced legislation. There have been a lot of glitches \nalong the way, but there has been persistence by the Finance Committee \nand by the HELP Committee to report out the legislation, to have \nhearings, to listen to the arguments from the administration, from the \nprivate sector, from those who are experts in this field of the PBGC. I \nam very proud of the work that was done by the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, working hand in hand with the ranking member, Senator \nBaucus, to get the legislation passed and to allow an amendment in \nwhich I was very interested dealing with the airline pension situation. \nThey could have said ``don't do it'' or ``we will do it later,'' but \nthey allowed the process to work its way through.\n  Then, also, I have to give tremendous credit to the chairman of the \nHELP Committee, Senator Enzi. He did not give up on it. He was dogged \nand he was working on trying to get this unanimous consent agreement on \nhow we consider this legislation, and our leadership on both sides of \nthe aisle were\n\n[[Page S12890]]\n\nable to come together. There were a lot of people who had amendments \nthey wanted. They had objections, there were holds here, holds there, \nyet here we are. So I hope we can look at this and see if we cannot do \nthis again in the future.\n  There is no question we need reform in this area. There is real \nexposure across the board. American workers all over this country, and \nmanagement, and the leadership in the administration or in the PBGC are \nvery worried about where we are headed with these pensions. Are we \ngoing to keep our commitment to the workers and to the people involved \nin these pensions? We have an exposure, according to an article this \nmorning in the newspaper, this PBGC organization, of approximately $26 \nbillion.\n  Where are we heading in this regard? Part of the problem with regard \nto pensions is the requirements that the law places on them are \ninverted. If you get into difficulty, if you are losing altitude, your \npayments to the agency, PBGC, go up, making it more likely you are \ngoing to continue to plunge into the ground. Conversely, if you are \ndoing well, you pay less. How did we ever allow the law to get into \nthat shape? Reform clearly is needed. If we do not do it, and do it in \nthe right way, more companies are going to go into bankruptcy and are \ngoing to wind up dumping their pensions. The people who earned these \npensions or had agreements for their pensions are going to get less \nthan they thought they would get or in some cases even less than they \nshould be getting.\n  We can debate whether or not these pensions have been too inflated, \nbut we have to transition. I personally think we have to get away from \nthese defined benefit plans. We have to go to the defined contribution \nplans. But I think this legislation is a good compromise. We need it \nand we certainly should get it done before we complete this session of \nCongress.\n  I also congratulate Senator Coleman from Minnesota for working on the \naviation provisions, and especially Senator Isakson, the great Senator \nfrom Georgia, for his efforts to stay behind this legislation and to \noffer the amendment that is going to be voted on before we complete the \nlegislation.\n  The language in the bill says airlines that freeze their defined \nbenefit plans can amortize any funding shortfalls over a 14-year \nperiod. That was a compromise agreement. The chairman had some concerns \nabout what that number would be. The language we have from Senator \nIsakson is slightly broader than that, broader than the base bill.\n  It allows airlines that freeze their plans and airlines that prefund \ntheir plans 20 years over which to amortize their funding shortfalls. I \nthink that is the right number. I would like to have seen it more than \n14. I support this amendment. I must say that I know it is critical to \nsome of our airlines that we have this language. I have worked on the \nlanguage in the pension reform package on airlines. I have worked on \nsupporting this amendment, and I have worked on checking the votes. I \nwant the Record to show, in case there is a voice vote, that I believe \nthere are probably over 80 votes in the Senate that would be for this \namendment.\n  I want to make it clear for the future and for the Record and for the \nconference that this amendment is going to be handled in the way it is \ngoing to be handled because of the overwhelming support it has. We \ncould have a lot more resistance to it by the leadership, but they \ncontinue to be reasonable in their handling of this legislation.\n  I support the Isakson amendment. I certainly believe it will be \naccepted by an overwhelming indication of support in the Senate, and \nthat is the way it should be.\n  I believe, as a result of this legislation, that companies--\nparticularly airline employees--the PBGC, and ultimately, most \nimportantly, the U.S. taxpayer will be better off.\n  This bill is not perfect. It will probably be better as we go along \nthrough the conference, but it will never be perfect. But it is a major \nstep forward and one we should be proud of. It is not the kind of thing \nyou will read about in the local newspaper or, congratulations, you did \na good job, unless you are the hub of an airline. It is not something \nyou are going to read a lot about in most places in Wyoming. But this \nis the right thing to do, and the exposure is cataclysmic if we don't \ndeal with it.\n  I am delighted to support the legislation and the Isakson amendment.\n  I yield any remaining time at this point. I thank the Senator for \nyielding.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am very pleased to offer an \namendment with my colleagues: Senator Isakson and Senator Lott. Our \namendment provides important pension relief to the airline industry, \nwhich has struggled financially as a result of the September 11 \nterrorist attacks and dramatically higher fuel costs. In the last few \nyears, we have seen United Airlines and US Airways terminate their \npension plans and turn over their liabilities to the Pension Benefit \nGuaranty Corporation. Our amendment is designed to avoid this unhappy \noutcome for airlines that are still struggling with large pension \ndebts.\n  Throughout the work on this legislation, my goal has been to protect \nthe employees and retirees who have worked hard to earn retirement \nbenefits. Whenever underfunded pension plans are dumped on the PBGC, \neveryone loses. Employees and retirees lose benefits that they deserve. \nCompanies struggle with sour employee relations. And the PBGC and \nultimately, perhaps someday the taxpayers--gets stuck with a bill for \nthe portion of the pensions that is guaranteed but not funded.\n  I am very appreciative of the cooperation that we have had from the \nbipartisan leadership of both the Finance Committee and the HELP \nCommittee. The legislation we are considering today would allow \nstruggling airlines to pay off old pension debts over a 14-year period \nusing reasonable interest rate assumptions. Unfortunately, given the \nrising fuel costs and the need to attract bankruptcy financing, the \nrelief provided in this bill is insufficient to help Delta Airlines. \nThat is why the Isakson-Rockefeller-Lott amendment, which extends the \nrepayment period to 20 years is so important. The amendment would also \nallow airlines, such as American and Continental, to benefit from \nrelief without terminating their pension plans, as long as any new \nobligations were fully funded.\n  I am very pleased that this amendment has the support of Delta, \nNorthwest, Continental, and American airlines. This amendment does not \npick winners or losers within the airline industry. Rather, it focuses \non maintaining defined benefit pension promises, and any airline that \noffers defined benefit plans would be able to benefit from this relief.\n  I understand the skepticism of Senators who are concerned that in \nspite of any relief Congress provides, airlines may still terminate \ntheir pension plans. I cannot say that this is an unreasonable fear.\n  However, the amendment we are offering would make it more difficult \nfor airlines to dump their plans. Without sufficient funding relief, \nairlines may convince a bankruptcy court that the plans must be turned \nover to PBGC in order for the airline to emerge from bankruptcy. \nHowever, if the law requires reasonable-sized payments, stretched out \nover 20 years, an airline's argument that it cannot make such payments \nloses credibility.\n  As a West Virginian, I have seen the tragic consequences of \nunderfunded plans. I am not interested in letting employers off the \nhook for pension promises they made to workers.\n  The point of this amendment is to make sure that employers fulfill \ntheir obligations. In light of the current financial situation of \nseveral airlines, it is unrealistic to expect them to maintain their \npension plans under normal funding rules. The reality of the situation \ncalls for reasonable funding relief in order to make sure that the \ncompanies continue to make substantial payments to their plans. \nProviding a 20-year period for airlines to repay their pension debts is \nthe best way to protect workers' benefits and reduce unfunded \nliabilities covered by the PBGC.\n  For the sake of the airline employees who have earned a secure \nretirement and for the sake of the millions of workers who depend on a \nstrong PBGC, I ask my colleagues to support the Isakson-Rockefeller-\nLott amendment.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate \namendment No. 2582 offered by my good friend Senator Isakson to S. \n1783, the\n\n[[Page S12891]]\n\nPension Security and Transparency Act of 2005.\n  The retirement security of millions of Americans participating in \nsingle employer defined benefit pension plans depends on employers \nkeeping their pension promises. Unfortunately, in recent years those \npromises have not been kept. Defaults of pension plans in the airline, \nsteel and auto-parts industries have raised concerns about the health \nof existing plans and the possibility of a taxpayer bailout of the \nPension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, PBGC.\n  The current system does not ensure that pension plans are adequately \nfunded. When under-funded plans terminate, as several have done \nrecently, they place an increasing strain on the pension insurance \nsystem. As of September 30, 2005 the PBGC showed a deficit of $22.8 \nbillion for pension plans sponsored by a single employer. While the \nPBGC will be able to pay benefits for years to come, the solvency of \nthe pension insurance system is in jeopardy. It is estimated that the \nPBGC will run out of cash within the next 20 years.\n  The airline industry in particular has been faced with its own \nspecific set of economic challenges. The attacks on September 11, 2001 \ncoupled with a stock market decline and record oil prices have placed a \nsignificant burden on the airline industry, forcing them to make tough \nchoices. The unfortunate reality of our current economic climate is \nthat some businesses, particularly the airlines, are taking devastating \nfinancial losses as a result of unforeseen circumstances.\n  As many of my colleagues know, Delta Airlines is headquartered in my \nhome State of Georgia. Delta has a longstanding history of service to \nairline passengers throughout the world and has been a great corporate \ncitizen for the State of Georgia. Delta's some 31,000 employees, like \nmany other hardworking Americans, have devoted years to working for \ncompanies like Delta. We need to ensure that they receive the pension \nbenefits they were promised and deserve.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that this amendment would \nraise $14 million over the period 2006-2010 and $30 million in Federal \nrevenues over the period 2006-2015. Changing the amortization period \nfor airline pension plans such as Delta's, from 14 years to 20 years \nwould take the burden off the PBGC while ensuring that the thousands of \nworkers employed by the airline industry would receive the benefits \nthat they have earned.\n  This common sense amendment, of which I am a cosponsor, will not \nrelieve the airlines of pension liability, nor will it prohibit \nairlines from meeting pension obligations sooner than 20 years. It \ndiscourages airlines from relying on the PBGC and the taxpayers' \ndollars by allowing them time to fulfill their pension obligations. \nThis amendment complements the purpose of the overall pension reform \nbill by taking the necessary steps to ensure that American workers \nreceive every penny they have earned, while holding companies \naccountable and simultaneously reducing the burden on the PBGC.\n  American workers deserve the security of knowing that their pensions \nwill be there when they retire. I also want to help ensure the job \nsecurity of the employees of great companies like Delta, while allowing \npassengers and our economy to benefit from the continued use of our \nairlines. As we continue this debate, I am committed to passing \nmeaningful pension reform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I understand the majority manager favors \nthe Isakson amendment. I control time on this bill, as well as the \nSenator from Georgia. I support the amendment. Given all of that and \nthe support on both sides, I am prepared to yield back the remainder of \ntime we have on this amendment so we can then prepare to vote on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded.\n  Is there further debate on the amendment? If not, the question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2582) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ENZI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I yield to the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, first, let me congratulate my colleague \nfrom Georgia for this amendment, as well as my colleague from \nMississippi.\n  I also commend the chairman of the Finance and the HELP Committees \nand ranking members Senators Grassley, Baucus, Enzi, and Kennedy for \ntheir hard work on the legislation that is before us today, for their \nhard work in forging the compromise pension reform bill.\n  While I appreciate all of the hard work that went into this \nlegislation that is before us today, I would like to discuss some grave \nconcerns that I have about this bill. Historically, a defined benefit \npension has been the cornerstone of a worker's retirement, along with \npersonal savings and Social Security. However, with the movement away \nfrom defined benefit plans and personal savings, many Americans are \nrelying mainly on Social Security for their post-retirement income.\n  That is a very disturbing trend. This is an alarming trend. The \ndefined benefit pension system is an important part of a worker's \nretirement, but unfortunately, an increasingly rare one. The number of \ndefined benefit plans has decreased from over 114,000 in 1985 to just \nover 28,800 in 2004. Since 2001, almost a quarter of Fortune 500 \ncompanies have frozen or considered freezing their defined benefit \nplans.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Retirement Security and Aging, \nalong with my good friend and colleague from Maryland, Senator \nMikulski, I chaired a hearing to examine the issue of PBGC funding and \nthe effect that reforms to shore up the PBGC may have on the defined \nbenefit system, which is the financial backbone of many workers' \nretirement. At that hearing, we heard testimony acknowledging the need \nto strengthen pension funding rules, but we were warned that going too \nfar would force employers to leave the defined benefit system through \nfreezes and terminations of plans, and in the worst case, could force a \ncompany into bankruptcy.\n  There is no question that something must be done to maintain the \nsolvency of the PBGC. The agency has estimated that its deficit is \n$22.8 billion and CBO projects a much larger deficit than that over the \nnext 10 years. A taxpayer bailout of the PBGC is a terrible option. \nBut, I also do not believe it is a good option to drive companies out \nof the defined benefit system. It is important that we balance rules to \nimprove funding of plans without going too far and forcing plan \nsponsors to abandon their plans or declare bankruptcy.\n  I believe that the bill that we passed out of the HELP Committee in \nSeptember by an 18 to 2 vote struck such a balance. The Defined Benefit \nSecurity Act amended the funding rules so that companies would fully \nfund their plans, while at the same time increase the premiums that \ncompanies pay to the PBGC to better fund the pension insurance system.\n  Unfortunately, I believe the bill that we have before the Senate \ntoday is a step backwards from the HELP Committee bill. While I commend \nChairmen Enzi and Grassley and ranking members Kennedy and Baucus for \ntheir efforts to reach a compromise on two very different bills, I am \nseriously concerned about the impact several of the provisions of the \ncompromise bill will have on plan sponsors and participants. I am \nconcerned about the impact it will have on job creation in the future \nand on job creation.\n  First, I am concerned about the 3-year transition to the new funding \nrules, including the new 100 percent funding standard. For many \ncompanies, this will require a significant increase in pension funding \nin a short amount of time. I also have concerns about decreasing the \namortization period from 10 years to 7 years. My biggest concerns, \nhowever, are credit rating and smoothing. Senator Mikulski and I \nproposed an amendment that would replace S. 1783's provisions on credit \nrating and smoothing with the provisions of the HELP bill.\n  Using credit ratings to determine plan funding would result in a loss \nof jobs. It is a simple calculation. Using a company's credit rating \nwill put additional pressures on a company\n\n[[Page S12892]]\n\nexperiencing a downturn in their business cycle. They will have to put \nmore money into their plans at the very time they cannot afford to do \nso. These are funds that could be used to modernize facilities or roll \nout new product lines--activities which could help a company actually \npull out of a downturn.\n  The at-risk rules can increase a company's required pension \ncontribution by hundreds of millions of dollars, and in some cases, by \nbillions of dollars. Struggling companies experiencing a business \ndownturn cannot absorb that type of additional burden. There is little \ndoubt that if this legislation becomes law, far more struggling \ncompanies will be forced out of business as a result of their pension \nobligations. Their employees will lose some of their pension and their \njob. This is not in anyone's interest. This hurts the employees, the \nplan, the company, and the PBGC. We best protect the PBGC and retirees \nby helping struggling companies recover, so that they can contribute \nmore when they are healthy.\n  I would also note that the proposed DeWine-Mikulski amendment would \nhave increased the smoothing period for asset valuation and interest \nrates to three years from the twelve months included in S. 1783.\n  One of the clearest messages that we have received from the business \ncommunity is that they need to be able to predict their funding \nobligations so that they can make necessary business plans. If they \ncannot predict those obligations with reasonable certainty, they will \nnot maintain defined benefit plans.\n  This is not idle speculation. As I stated before, companies have been \nleaving the defined benefit plan system in droves and the reason given \nis the unpredictability of the funding obligations. So, what should we \nexpect if this bill, in its current form, becomes law, dramatically \nlimiting the smoothing rules and thus limiting predictability? We can \nexpect an even faster exodus from the defined benefit plan system. That \nwould be very sad news for the retirement security of millions of \nAmericans.\n  In conclusion, while the changes that the DeWine-Mikulski amendment \nsought to make were not incorporated in the bill before us today, both \nSenator Mikulski and I will be conferees and have the opportunity to \nhelp shape the final bill in a way that can be beneficial for \nparticipants, plan sponsors and the PBGC. And, I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on the conference to work on these issues.\n  Quite frankly, what is at stake is the future of businesses--real \ncompanies. What is at stake are future jobs in our home States, whether \nit be Maryland, whether it be Ohio or the other States in the Union. \nWhat is at stake is job creation in the future. What is at stake is job \nretention now.\n  The issues that Senator Mikulski and I have brought before the \nAmerican people and before the Senate will have to be addressed in \nconference because the issues are simply about jobs.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I see that the ranking member of the \nHELP Committee is now on the floor and also the Senator from Hawaii, \nMr. Akaka. I wonder if the Senator might allow the ranking member to \nspeak, and then we could be at a point to bring up the amendment of the \nSenator from Hawaii.\n  Under the unanimous consent agreement, I believe we have about 30-\nsome minutes remaining. I yield as much time as the Senator from \nMassachusetts desires. When the Senator finishes, I urge the Presiding \nOfficer to recognize the Senator from Hawaii for an amendment which he \nhas to offer.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will withhold, my friend is ready to go \nand make his presentation. After that presentation, if I could then \nhave a chance perhaps to talk about the importance of this legislation, \nthe history and development of it, that would be agreeable with me.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Whatever works out for the two Senators.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is fine.\n  I thank the Senator from Montana for his typical courteousness, and I \nwelcome the opportunity to hear the Senator from Hawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Montana and the \nSenator from Massachusetts for providing this time for me.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2583\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I call up my amendment and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii, [Mr. Akaka], for himself and Mr. \n     Specter, proposes an amendment numbered 2583.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To compute the actuarial value of monthly benefits in the \nform of a life annuity commencing at age 60 for certain airline pilots)\n\n       At the end of title IV, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 4__. AGE REQUIREMENT FOR EMPLOYERS.\n\n       (a) Single-Employer Plan Benefits Guaranteed.--Section \n     4022(b) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of \n     1974 (29 U.S.C. 1322(b)) is amended in the flush matter \n     following paragraph (3), by adding at the end the following: \n     ``If, at the time of termination of a plan under this title, \n     regulations prescribed by the Federal Aviation Administration \n     require an individual to separate from service as a \n     commercial airline pilot after attaining any age before age \n     65, paragraph (3) shall be applied to an individual who is a \n     participant in the plan by reason of such service by \n     substituting such age for age 65.''.\n       (b) Multiemployer Plan Benefits Guaranteed.--Section \n     4022B(a) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of \n     1974 (29 U.S.C. 1322b(a)) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following: ``If, at the time of termination of a plan under \n     this title, regulations prescribed by the Federal Aviation \n     Administration require an individual to separate from service \n     as a commercial airline pilot after attaining any age before \n     age 65, this subsection shall be applied to an individual who \n     is a participant in the plan by reason of such service by \n     substituting such age for age 65.''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to benefits payable on or after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I rise today to offer my amendment to the \npension bill to correct an injustice. I want to thank my cosponsors, \nSenators Specter, Feinstein, Salazar, and Inouye, for working with me \non this amendment. I also want to thank the cosponsors of my stand-\nalone bill S. 685, which include Senators Isakson, Kennedy, Harkin, \nObama, Durbin, Salazar, and Feinstein.\n  The Federal Aviation Administration, FAA, requires commercial airline \npilots to retire when they reach the age of 60. Pilots are therefore \ndenied the maximum pension benefit administered by the Pension Benefit \nGuaranty Corporation, PBGC, because they are required to retire before \nthe age of 65. This significant reduction in benefits puts pilots in a \ndifficult position. With drastically reduced pensions and a prohibition \non reentering the piloting profession because of age, many pilots are \nsubjected to undue hardship. For plans terminated in 2005, the maximum \nbenefit for someone that retires at 65 is $45,614 a year. For those who \nretire at 60, the maximum is $29,649.\n  While I believe that Congress needs to address the issue of \nunderfunded pension plans, I believe that it is also important for us \nto address this inequity. We must adopt this amendment to assist pilots \nwhose companies have been or will be unable to continue their defined \nbenefit pension plans. My amendment will slightly alter title IV of the \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to require the PBGC to \ntake into account the fact that pilots are required to retire at the \nage of 60 when calculating their benefits.\n  If pilots want to work beyond the age 60, they must request a waiver \nfrom the FAA. It is my understanding that the FAA does not grant many \nof these waivers, and I have even heard from some pilots that the FAA \nhas never granted these waivers. Therefore, most of the pilots, if not \nall, do not receive the maximum pension guarantee because they are \nforced to retire at age 60. Pilots already lose substantial amounts of \ntheir promised pensions when the PBGC takes over their pension plans, \nbut this needless penalty makes the pension cuts even harder to adjust \nto after a termination.\n  This amendment would benefit US Airways and United Airlines pilots in\n\n[[Page S12893]]\n\naddition to other legacy carriers whose pensions were absorbed by the \nPBGC. In my home State of Hawaii, I have 91 United and US Airways \npilots in the Air Line Pilots Association data base. I also have 305 \nactive or retired Aloha Airlines pilots in Hawaii. Aloha Airlines \nrecently filed to terminate its pension plan. Other States, such as \nNorth Carolina and Virginia have 1,064 and 1,014 United and US Airways \npilots respectively. As I look at the financial difficulties \nconfronting Delta Airlines and Northwest Airlines, I am troubled by the \nprospect of even more pilots losing their plans and being subjected to \nthis unfair penalty.\n  I ask unanimous consent a letter of support from the Air Line Pilots \nAssociation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Air Line Pilots Association, International\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 28, 2005.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: On behalf of the 64,000 members of the \n     Air Line Pilots Association, I am writing to express our \n     strong support for your legislation, S. 685, The Pilots \n     Equitable Treatment Act, which would put airline pilots on an \n     equal footing with non-pilots with respect to guaranteed \n     benefits payable from the PBGC if a defined benefit pension \n     plan is terminated. I also understand that you plan to offer \n     the language of S. 685 as a floor amendment to pension \n     overhaul legislation that is expected to be considered by the \n     Senate in the next few days. We heartily support and endorse \n     that action as well.\n       As you know, your legislation would change the PBGC rules \n     so that airline pilots, who by FAA regulation must stop \n     flying at age 60, are protected from having their pension \n     benefits actuarially reduced by the PBGC if their defined \n     benefit retirement plan is terminated. S. 685 is bold and \n     innovative legislation that calls for pilots to receive \n     benefit guarantees at age 60 that are calculated as though \n     they already had reached age 65.\n       Your legislation will provide some measure of pension \n     protection for those thousands of airline pilots who have \n     already lost and/or will likely lose retirement benefits they \n     had worked for and counted on for years. These employees who \n     have given so much to their companies already deserve no \n     less.\n       We greatly appreciate your leadership on this important \n     matter, and pledge to work with you and your staff to assist \n     in any way to secure inclusion of the language of S. 685 in \n     pension reform legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Duane E. Woerth,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment so pilots \nare not unfairly penalized for having to retire early by FAA.\n  I call for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I understand it, it has been the request of our \nleaders we give notification to our colleagues when we are likely to \nhave a vote. It is agreeable with the Senator from Hawaii that we have \nthis vote just prior to the time we have the final passage. I certainly \nyield to my friend and colleague.\n  Mr. ENZI. I understand this has been cleared on both sides. I ask \nunanimous consent when all time is used or yielded back on the \namendments and the underlying bill, the measure be temporarily set \naside; provided further that at 2:30 today the Senate proceed to a vote \nin relation to the Akaka amendment, to be followed by a vote on passage \nof the bill, as amended, to be followed by a vote on the adoption of \nthe conference report to accompany the Commerce-Justice-State \nappropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I yield such time as I might use.\n  At the outset, I thank our Senate leadership, Senator Frist and \nSenator Reid, for arranging the Senate schedule so we would have an \nopportunity to consider this extremely important legislation. I thank \nmy colleague and friend, my chairman, Senator Enzi, for his commitment \nto getting good legislation passed at a very important time in the \nentire history of the evolution of the pension system in our country. \nThis is a very important piece of legislation. His diligence, attention \nto detail, and persuasiveness has permitted the Senate to move this \nlegislation forward in a timely way. I am very grateful to him for all \nof his good leadership.\n  I thank our friends on the Committee on Finance, Senator Baucus and \nSenator Grassley. We have worked together at other times on the pension \nlegislation. We did work closely together over a year ago and received \nthe overwhelming support of the Senate in a bipartisan way. We worked \nvery closely with the members of the Committee on Finance. As a result \nof both committees working, we have a stronger legislation. This is a \nbipartisan effort in a very important area of public policy. I am \ngrateful to all who brought the Senate to where we are at this time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, the retirement security of millions of \nhard-working Americans is at risk. Millions of our fellow citizens have \nworked hard all of their lives, played by the rules. They have been \ndedicated and loyal workers only to find their promised pensions \ndisappear when they retire. They worked faithfully, assuming their \nretirements would be their golden years. But then suddenly it all \ndisappears. The pension plan is in financial trouble and their \nretirement dreams are being wiped away. This is exactly what has \nhappened to millions of loyal American workers.\n  In the past 5 years, 700 pension plans have gone into crisis, and \nmillions of workers have lost $8 billion in pension benefits that they \nhad been promised. It is a crisis. We see it with our airline workers. \nWe see it with our workers in manufacturing industries. We see it with \nour construction workers and sales clerks at the store and so many of \nour neighbors. It is a crisis, and this bill responds to it by saving \ntheir pensions.\n\n  Large numbers of Americans are increasingly concerned about their \nretirement security and rightfully so. Each leg of the three-legged \nstool of retirement--private pensions, private savings, and Social \nSecurity--is in jeopardy.\n  Many Americans find they are unable to save anything toward their \nretirement. In fact, the personal savings rate has now fallen below \nzero. Americans are spending more than they earn. It is no wonder when \nwages are stagnant and costs are soaring for basic necessities such as \nenergy, housing, health care, and education.\n  The Bush administration continues to propose to privatize Social \nSecurity, which would put the reliability of future benefits in that \nlandmark and highly successful program in jeopardy.\n  Many workers have no private pension at all. Only half of American \nprivate sector workers have a pension through their job. And 2.7 \nmillion fewer private sector workers have a pension today than in 2000. \nListen to that: 2.7 million fewer private sector workers have a pension \ntoday than in 2000. Most workers who do have a pension today have only \na 401(k) account as their pension, but many have nothing saved in these \naccounts. Even those who are saving do not have enough to live on in \nretirement. More than half of the workers approaching retirement have \nless than $43,000 in their 401(k), and workers who rely on these \naccounts face the constant risk of investments that perform poorly.\n  These problems make pensions with defined benefits more critical than \never because they are secure. They provide a known monthly benefit for \nlife. They are ensured by the Federal Government. But they are becoming \nmuch rarer today, as businesses shift away from them.\n  In the early 1980s, almost 40 percent of American workers were \ncovered by secure pensions. Today, that number is only 20 percent. Yet, \nwhile workers' pensions are being cut, executives' pensions are \nincreasingly generous.\n  A recent study found that 25 percent of the CEOs of 500 large \ncompanies had been promised retirement benefits of more than $1 million \na year. Why should Ken Lay of Enron or Bernie Ebbers of WorldCom walk \naway with millions of dollars in guaranteed pensions after driving \ntheir employees' pensions into the ground?\n  On this chart, we see this rather dramatic decline in terms of what \nis happening to workers, particularly in defined benefit programs. We \nfind that the CEOs are being well taken care of. Here is Ken Lay. Enron \nrequired the employees to invest in the company\n\n[[Page S12894]]\n\nstock and then lied to the workers, lied about the state of the \ncompany's finances. As stock prices plunged on the news of the \ncorporate mismanagement, employees were blocked from selling their \nstock. This is an area we have dealt with, I think, quite effectively \nin our reforms. And 11,000 employees lost $1 billion in retirement \nsavings during that period of time. We have the example of the WorldCom \nCEO. Bernie Ebbers was given a $1.5 million-a-year pension. He was \nlater convicted of accounting fraud. Thirty percent of the employees' \n401(k) money was invested in the company stock. When WorldCom stock \nplunged in value, 93,000 workers and retirees with WorldCom 401(k) \naccounts lost hundreds of millions of dollars in their retirement \nsavings.\n  These are issues that are enormously important. I think when we were \ngetting started, in terms of the debate on pension reform, most \nAmericans were wondering what the Congress was going to do about these \nissues. They were less aware of the fact that the defined benefit \nprograms have been gradually in decline, the kind of pension program \nthat provides the best kind of security to American workers. And they \nwere not familiar with other factors: the drop in the savings accounts, \nthe fact that so many of the 401(k)s have been buffeted around by the \nstock market and have not been enough to provide for a secure income.\n  But they are increasingly aware now. I think as the debate took place \nearlier this spring about the solvency of Social Security, people have \nfocused on the solvency of Social Security and have also thought about \ntheir retirement. When they think about their retirement, obviously, \nthey are concerned about their pensions.\n  But we have also seen that workers have lost dramatically over the \nperiod of these past several years. In the last 5 years, workers have \nlost $8 billion. That is $8 billion workers have lost in the last 5 \nyears. For those pensions, workers give up an increase in their pay, \nthey give up maybe a reduction in the amount of hours they have to \nwork, they give up other kinds of benefits. That is in order to put \nsomething aside in terms of pensions they are allegedly going to be \nguaranteed at the time they finish working for their company. And \nstill, we have seen that amount of money--$8 billion--that has been \nrelied on by American workers effectively wiped out and disappeared. \nThat is why the legislation we have is so important.\n  When a major pension plan fails, it places a strain on the entire \nsystem. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which ensures these \npension plans, has moved from a surplus in 2001 to a deficit of $23 \nbillion today. Our pension insurance system protects the retirement \nearnings of over 43 million Americans, and we must do what it takes to \nsee that it is there for the years to come.\n  These are serious problems that require immediate action by Congress. \nThe pending bill adopts a broad approach, with stronger rules for \nfunding, expanded disclosure, so workers are going to know the \nstability and the financial security they have with their pension. It \nincludes other new protections for American workers: It strengthens the \nexisting pension plans by requiring companies to fund their pensions \nthat workers have earned. It takes steps to prevent future pension \nfailures and recognizes that workers who are increasingly in charge of \ninvesting their own retirement savings need additional help--two very \nimportant points.\n\n  There is going to be the help and assistance, through the PBGC, to \nhelp companies, as they are looking at sort of more financial \ndifficulty, to make sure these pensions are going to be safe and \nsecure. A front-end warning system built into this legislation with \nflexibility for negotiations--that is very important. And information \nthat is going to be made available to workers about their own \nretirement--that is enormously important.\n  The reforms in this bill allow troubled pension plans the leeway they \nneed to get back on their feet. The current rules would require \ncompanies to pay large amounts into their troubled pension plans right \naway. That is unrealistic and could force many companies to drop their \npension plans altogether. That would hurt workers. Our reforms allow \ncompanies to save their troubled plans by increasing payments gradually \nover a longer period of time. We provide a realistic payment schedule \nbut strengthen the current rules for single-employer pension plans over \ntime by requiring companies to fund 100 percent of their pension \npromises to workers. These workers have earned their pensions over a \nlifetime of hard work, foregoing raises and other benefits. Yet current \nlaw allows many companies to lag behind in paying for them. Our \nlegislation solves this problem by requiring companies to pay more into \ntheir pensions in a fair and predictable way.\n  Our legislation also recognizes the power of public disclosure and \nthe urgent need for more effective oversight of pension plans. Under \ncurrent law, workers receive little financial information about their \npensions, and what they do receive is often years out of date. They \nhave earned these pensions, and they deserve to know whether these \nfunds are there to pay them. That is very important and one of the most \nimportant changes to the current system: giving the notification to \nworkers.\n  Our bill ensures that workers and retirees receive up-to-date \ninformation each year. The bill also provides incentives to keep \npensions financially healthy by tying executive compensation to pension \nhealth. Executives should not be able to feather their own retirement \nnests while workers lose their nest eggs. Our legislation prohibits \ncorporate executives from putting company funds into their own \nretirement trusts when the pensions of rank-and-file workers are \nunderfunded. That is very important. It should be obvious. Justice \ndemands it. But we will make sure that it is implemented.\n  Recent headlines show that many companies are using bankruptcy courts \nto abandon their pension plans. Hundreds of thousands of workers and \nretirees at companies such as United Airlines, US Airways, Bethlehem \nSteel, and LTV Steel are now without the pensions they worked so hard \nto earn.\n  The bill also contains specific provisions to save airline pensions \nby offering companies a specialized payment program. And I know that \nhas been reviewed earlier in the debate.\n  In addition, our legislation addresses the needs of nearly 10 million \nworkers and retirees who receive pensions through multiemployer plans. \nThese are the workers who clean our office buildings and hotel rooms, \nsell us our groceries, build our homes and schools and highways and \ndeliver goods across the country. Many of them are in industries where \nthey have to move from job to job and would not be able to earn a \npension at all without these multiemployer plans, since their \nemployers, particularly small businesses, could not afford to offer a \npension plan of their own.\n  The majority of these plans are in strong financial shape. But the \nrecent economic downturn and weak stock market have put some of these \nplans in financial difficulties similar to those facing single-employer \nplans. We owe it to these employees to protect their pensions now, \ninstead of acting only when they are about to fail.\n  Hybrid pension plans, including cash balance plans, have a growing \nrole in our retirement system. They have a number of advantages. They \nprovide secured, guaranteed pensions. They are attractive to younger \nworkers and those such as parents caring for children. But older \nworkers can lose out when their companies switch to these plans because \nthey lose a large portion of the benefits they were promised. Our \nlegislation requires companies that are going to switch to these plans \nto protect the benefits that workers have already earned. That is \nenormously important.\n  I want to highlight another very important area and that is the \nlegislation also includes very important provisions from the Women's \nPension Protection Act that I introduced with Senator Snowe. Retirement \nsecurity is essential for all Americans, but too often we fail to meet \nthe needs of women on this basic issue. Women live longer than men, but \nthey continue to earn far less in wages over their lifetimes. They are \nalso much less likely to earn a pension. These factors translate into \nseriously inadequate retirement income for vast numbers of women.\n  The realities of this injustice are grim. According to the most \nrecent data, only 28 percent of women age 65\n\n[[Page S12895]]\n\nand over are receiving private pension income, and for those who do, \nthe average is only $3,800 per year, compared to $8,100 for men. \nMinority women are in even more desperate straits. Only 20 percent of \nAfrican-American women and 9 percent of Hispanic women receive a \npension. These disparities are a major reason why nearly one in five \nelderly single women lives in poverty.\n  Our legislation gives them much greater retirement security. Widows \nwill receive more generous survivor benefits. Divorced women will have \na greater ability to receive a share of their former husband's pension \nafter divorce. These are long-overdue improvements in the private \npension system so retirement savings programs will be more responsive \nto the realities of women's lives and careers.\n  American workers and their families rightly expect Congress to \nprotect their hard-earned pensions. This legislation is an important \nstart to meeting this challenge. Madam President, I note the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania is in the Chamber. I want to quickly review this \nlegislation, again.\n  On this chart is effectively a description--I know the writing is \nsmall for those who are watching--but this is really the backbone of \nthis legislation. It requires companies to fund their promises. It \nhelps prevent future pension failures. I have outlined, very briefly, \nin my comments how that is done--by greater flexibility and \nnegotiation. It gives workers timely and accurate information on \npension plan finances. That does not exist today. Well, it exists but \nnot in an efficient or effective manner. Many times it takes months or \neven years to get that timely information. This legislation will \nprovide it in a timely and accurate way, which is enormously important \nfor workers.\n  It protects the workers and businesses in multiemployer pensions. We \nhave the single pensions, as we mentioned, and now also in the \nmultiemployer pensions they face different issues. But we have \nstrengthened and provided and followed a number of recommendations that \nwere made from the business community and the worker community to \nstrengthen those programs.\n  It protects older workers in cash balance plan conversions. I have \noutlined the advantages of cash balance plans to younger workers, but \nto older workers it can work disadvantageously. This legislation \nprovides a very important way of protecting those who have been reliant \non existing programs rather than a cash balance plan. That is \nenormously important. Otherwise there could be some significant \ninjustice.\n  It gives workers access to independent investment advice to avoid the \nkind of Ken Lay situation where they had the requirement of investing \nin the corporation and were refused, when the company was going south, \nthe ability to sell employer stock, and the workers took a bath. That \nwas true in my State with Polaroid, a similar kind of situation and a \ntragic situation that involved abuse of the pension system at a time \nwhen a number of the executive branch did exceedingly well. We are \ngiving access to independent investment advice, and workers can make \ntheir judgments. These are what we call the Bingaman proposals. They \nhave been worked out in a bipartisan way and have solid support in the \nSenate.\n  It adopts the post-Enron worker pension protections. It stops \ncorporate executives from lining their pockets when workers' pensions \nsuffer. This is to deal with the issue I mentioned briefly before, \nwhere the corporate executives can make out while the workers are \nlosing.\n  It provides greater retirement security for widows and former \nspouses. This is enormously important because of the injustice with \nregard to women and the pension system, which is extraordinary. Senator \nSnowe and I have been working for a number of years to try to address \nthat. I am grateful to our chairman, Mr. Enzi, for reviewing these \nmatters in great detail and including these provisions. This is \nenormously important.\n  This is an important piece of legislation. It doesn't solve all of \nthe problems, but it will certainly do a great deal in terms of \nensuring workers in the future of the security of their pensions. We \nare very hopeful, with the strong bipartisan support we have been able \nto develop in the Senate, that we can carry these very important \nprotections for workers, for companies, for women, for the single \nemployer pensions, for multiemployer pensions, through and have them \nenacted into law.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \nhis comments and the outstanding way he summarized the principles we \nhave been working on. It is a very good job, considering that this is a \n730-page bill. He got into significant details. It has been the details \nthat have been holding it up for literally years. You notice that \nnobody is speaking in opposition to this bill, so that means the \nbipartisan effort has paid off.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I thank the chairman of the HELP \nCommittee, as well as the ranking member, for the excellent work they \nhave done on this legislation and for the tremendous cooperation they \nhave shown me, as well as Senator Baucus, and my chairman Senator \nGrassley, on the issue of multiemployer pensions, which has been my \narea of focus on this legislation. It is a very important issue--and I \nwill lay out here--it is critically important that we make sure these \nplans survive. Because unlike the single-employer plans, the backstop, \nthe insurance for a plan that gets dumped into the PBGC is actually \nless than one-third of what a single-employer plan would be. It is even \nmore important for us to have healthy multiemployer plans from the \nstandpoint of the beneficiary than it is to have healthy single-\nemployer plans.\n  Again, I thank the chairmen and ranking members of both committees. \nThey have made the case--I have listened to some of the debate--that \nthe need for reform in both these areas is clear. I come from the State \nof Pennsylvania, which unfortunately has seen its share of plans being \ndissolved and thrown into the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. We \nhave a lot of steel companies. We have an airline that has done that. \nWe have, unfortunately, tens of thousands of retirees who are now \nreceiving their benefits through the PBGC and who were promised more \ngenerous benefits under their contracts with the steel companies and \nthe airline, who are now living, in many cases, very much hand to \nmouth. We need to do a better job for future workers and retirees. We \nneed to address this problem in a climate where increasingly we are \nseeing concern about not only the dumping of these plans onto the PBGC, \nand the transfer of defined benefit plans to defined contribution \nplans, we are increasingly seeing that trend in a lot of industries. I \nbelieve there is a place for defined benefit plans and that we need to \nhave a structure in place to make sure they are adequately funded and \nsafe for pensioners to rely upon as they enter into their retirement \nyears.\n  Again, I don't want to repeat all that has been said about the state \nof play of how bad the system is as far as the deficits and the \nproblems with the single-employer plans. I want to focus on the \nmultiemployer plans because that is an area on which I have been active \nin trying to make sure it was included in this bill and that many of \nthe reforms I put in place in the legislation I introduced with Senator \nStabenow a few weeks ago were included in the mark. Again, I thank the \nchairmen of both committees and the ranking members for working with us \nto see that happen.\n  The importance of making sure multiemployer plans are safe is because \nthe maximum guarantee for a multiemployer participant with 30 years of \nservice is less than $13,000 a year. That means if you worked for the \nIBEW and you were a tradesman, an electrician, and you built some of \nthe greatest buildings in Philadelphia, for example, if the IBEW \npension plan goes belly up, the maximum benefit you would receive would \nbe less than $13,000 a year. That is a horrific end for many people \nfrom the standpoint of what they would otherwise have been promised \nunder their plan. Contrast that with a retiree covered by a single \nemployer plan with the same record. They are\n\n[[Page S12896]]\n\nlooking at about $45,000 and in some cases up over $100,000. So the \nfallback, if these plans should fail, is substantially lower in the \nmultiemployer world. That is why it is vitally important that we have \nremedies and things to improve the overall picture. There are plans \nthat are in bad shape. We have plans that are funded as low as 50 \npercent. One plan is $20 billion underfunded. We have problems out \nthere. The consequences if a single-employer plan failing pale in \ncomparison to the devastation to pensioners if multiemployer plans \nfail.\n  I have worked hard with a coalition to try to put together a piece of \nlegislation that I mentioned before, S. 1825. Senator Stabenow has \nworked hard on this issue. Many of the reforms we put in place are \nincluded in this mark. We worked together with a coalition of \nmanagement and labor and met over a period of months to come up with a \nbipartisan and cooperative agreement between those who are on opposite \nsides of the bargaining table. We have had everybody here--from the \nbuilding trades, the Teamsters, the food and commercial workers union, \nthe IAM, to the grocery manufacturers, a whole host of grocery chains, \nas well as freight companies, UPS, contractors, et cetera--and have \nworked together over a period of months to come up with a bill that, as \nChairman Enzi mentioned, has strong bipartisan support because we were \nable to negotiate. We haven't gotten everything, candidly, we wanted in \nthis legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the list of folks \nsupporting this multiemployer bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Senator Santorum worked with the Multiemployer Pension Plan \n     Coalition to develop S. 1825, the Multi-Employer Plan Funding \n     and Deduction Reform Act of 2005. The coalition members are:\n       Albertsons; American Federation of Musicians; American \n     Federation of Television and Radio Artists; American Trucking \n     Associations; Associated General Contractors of America; \n     Bechtel Construction Company; The Building and Construction \n     Trades Department, AFL-CIO; Carhaul; Food Marketing \n     Institute; Finishing Contractors Association; International \n     Association of Machinists; International Brotherhood of \n     Teamsters; International Council of Employers of Bricklayers \n     & Allied Craftworkers; Kroger; Mechanical Contractors \n     Association of America; Motion Picture Association of \n     America; Motor Freight Carriers; National Electrical \n     Contractors Association; National Coordinating Committee for \n     Multiemployer Plans; Recording Industry Association of \n     America; Safeway; Sheet Metal & Air Conditioning Contrators' \n     National Association; Supervalu; NEA/The Association of Union \n     Constructors; United Food & Commercial Workers Union; UPS; \n     U.S. Chamber of Commerce; and Yellow Roadway Corporation.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I have worked with my constituents. I have had I don't \nknow how many meetings with members of labor unions across Pennsylvania \nto talk about this issue and get their input as to how we can deal with \nthe problem of multiemployer plans to make sure we improve their \nsolvency and increase the reliability of those plans for our \npensioners. It was an unprecedented effort. I thank Jen Vesey from my \nstaff for the work she has done. I thank in particular the folks from \nthe Pennsylvania building trades and Teamsters who have been terrific \nin trying to work through some of these very tough issues to get a \nconsensus bill that I am hopeful we can not only pass here in the \nSenate, obviously in the next hour or two, but also to get something \npassed permanently by the end of the year.\n  One of the key concepts folks were concerned about was the concept of \nan early warning system for multiemployer plans. Under current law, too \noften we don't know about economic conditions of these plans until they \nare facing extreme financial pressure. As we have said, sometimes the \nremedies are too late to solve the problem, and we end up with the \nsituation of people not having sufficient retirement. In this bill, we \ndo address this problem. However, I have heard from labor and \nmanagement representatives of the multiemployer plans. They have \nexpressed concerns about the approach to this taken in S. 1783.\n  It is important that we keep in mind in a multiemployer world, these \npension plans typically operate in tandem with health plans. There is a \nconcern the dollars that otherwise could go to maintain important \nhealth benefits may be unnecessarily diverted to pensions because of \noverly stringent performance benchmarks. I have heard about those \nbenchmarks. I have heard about those concerns. We will continue to work \non this. It is important that we continue to work toward a solution \nthat imposes discipline, which is what this legislation does, without \nimposing undue burdens on the plans, particularly how they might affect \nhealth benefits.\n  I am pleased my colleagues have accepted most of the changes we \nproposed and certainly remain committed to working on these important \nissues to strengthen multiemployer pensions to protect these folks.\n  This is an important piece of legislation. This is a great victory \nfor working men and women across the country that the Senate is about \nto act on. As we head into the holidays, where you want to feel good \nabout your financial security, if we are able to get this accomplished \nby the end of this year, we will provide a whole host of people across \nAmerica a better feeling about not just their holiday plans but the \nsecurity of future holidays after they have finished their working \nyears.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for \nhis diligent effort, particularly in the multiemployer area. He checked \nwith us and gave suggestions several times a month during the process \nwhen we were putting together the HELP bill. That was extremely \nhelpful, particularly since he was also on the Finance Committee which \nhad some jurisdiction in this area. His coordination between the two \ncommittees was invaluable. His tenaciousness and base of knowledge on \nthat issue were particularly helpful. I thank him for his efforts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I want to mention in particular my \ncolleague and friend on this side of the aisle, Senator Barbara \nMikulski, who is ranking member on the Retirement and Aging \nSubcommittee on the HELP Committee and has attended all of the hearings \nin the subcommittee and in our full committee and has been a tireless \nadvocate on this issue. I have learned a great deal from her. I am \nenormously grateful to her for all of her efforts. She has been a great \nally.\n  I also thank my friend Tom Harkin. This is one in a range of issues \nin which he has been involved and about which he cares deeply.\n  He is enormously knowledgeable about it, and he was very committed in \nterms of the defined benefit programs and how we can strengthen those, \nconcerned about the relationship between the cash balance and the \ndefined benefit programs, whether there is going to be fairness to \nworkers, and he made a great contribution to the development of our \nlegislation.\n  Jeff Bingaman had reforms and worked those out in a bipartisan way.\n  As we are coming into the final moments, I want to make a few \ncomments.\n  This legislation is strongly bipartisan. We don't have final \nlegislation over in the House of Representatives. I hope our colleagues \nand friends in the House of Representatives would at least take some \ninspiration from what we have been able to achieve over here working in \na bipartisan way under Republican Chairs to come up with a product \nwhich is going to move through the Senate at 2:30 or 3 o'clock this \nafternoon, which will make a major difference in terms of protecting \nworkers and also be sensitive to some of the economic challenges. We \nhave not had a finished product over in the House, and I am concerned \nit has been rather fractured over there in terms of the nature of the \ndebate and discussion.\n  I hope the leadership over there will take a page from the Enzi and \nGrassley book about how to work their committees in ways to develop \nbipartisanship on the committees and also between those committees as \nit is enormously important.\n  Finally, Mr. President, why this is important: We see that our Social \nSecurity bedrock of retirement now is being reviewed; some believe \nunder attack. We have private pensions. Only 50 percent of our workers \nhave pension\n\n[[Page S12897]]\n\ncoverage at work. Only 21 percent have a secure defined benefit. So it \nis a three-legged stool: Social Security, pensions, and then private \nsavings, and the private savings count, as shown on this chart in terms \nof the current savings, negative six-tenths of 1 percent of income--a \ndecline in savings. They have virtually dried up. The reason for that \nis because, as shown by this chart, of the increased costs of gasoline, \nhealth insurance, housing, and college.\n  People just cannot afford to save. They have to provide for their \nfamilies in these areas. And when it comes to the very end of the day \nit is the squeeze on that pension retirement. Living in the richest \ncountry of the world, in our democracy, being able to retire with a \nsense of dignity is certainly a value all of us hold dear. We are in \nreal danger of losing that very important value. This legislation is a \nvery important downpayment to make sure that value is going to be there \nfor millions of our fellow Americans.\n  I am enormously grateful to the staff: Rohit Kumar with Senator \nFrist; Bob Greenawalt, Senator Reid; Jon O'Neill, Senator Grassley; \nJudy Miller, Senator Baucus; Stu Sirkin, Finance Committee; Katherine \nMcGuire, Ilyse Schuman, Greg Dean, Diann Howland, and David Thompson, \nSenator Enzi; Karla Carpenter, Senator DeWine; Ellen-Marie Whelan and \nBen Olinsky, Senator Mikulski; and Michael Myers, Holly Fechner, Portia \nWu, and Terri Holloway from my staff. As always they have done a \nterrific job.\n  I also want to thank particularly Jim Fransen and Stacy Kern from the \nSenate Legislative Counsel's office, who worked day and night to draft \nthis bill. And thanks also to Carolyn Smith, Patricia McDermott, Nikole \nFlax, and Allison Wielobob of the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President. I see my colleagues here, and I \nunderstand we are going into morning business. If not, I am glad to \nyield time to them.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nsuch time as I may consume remaining for the Democratic side on the \npension bill, and then for an additional 20 minutes as if in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENZI. Reserving the right to object, we still have some time \nremaining on the bill, and there is a vote at 2:30. I guess I did not \nunderstand exactly the time being requested. It sounded like 35 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I think we will be finished by 1:30.\n  Mr. ENZI. Then I would ask the remainder of the time until 2:30 go to \nthis side of the aisle.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I object. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, \nI seek time before the vote to raise a point of personal privilege \nconcerning a comment made about me in the Chamber today. I desire 5 \nminutes but before the vote.\n  Mr. ENZI. I was reserving in that time time for the Senator from \nAlaska to speak.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If that is agreed to, I won't object to the time until \nthat time being allocated to the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank the Chair. And I thank the managers of the \npension bill.\n\n\n                      Hurricane Katrina Commission\n\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss a topic that many \non the other side of the aisle, as well as in the administration, hope \nwill just go away as we near the end of this session--the creation of \nan independent bipartisan commission to examine the State, local, and \nFederal response to Hurricane Katrina. We all know that nearly 3 months \nago Katrina struck Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, wreaking havoc \non cities along the coast and most especially in New Orleans and the \nsurrounding parishes. Thousands of residents had to flee, and thousands \nmore saw that the levees were breached and cataclysmic flooding wiped \nout the city's infrastructure causing extensive damage far beyond the \nboundaries of New Orleans. Along the gulf coast the hurricane force \nwinds destroyed so many of the communities that had been there for \nyears.\n\n  Americans were horrified by the images on television of this \ncatastrophe unfolding before our very eyes. It was followed by an \nequally catastrophic failure of Government in its uncoordinated, failed \nresponse.\n  I remember my own visit to Houston in the days immediately following \nthe hurricane where I met with people who had fled Louisiana and \nMississippi for shelter in Texas. They were desperately searching for \nlost relatives and to try to regain some semblance of order in their \nlives.\n  Mr. President, our response at all levels of Government was nothing \nshort of shameful, and the victims of Hurricane Katrina, as well as all \nAmericans, deserve to know why that response was such a colossal \nfailure. Who was in charge? Was it the President, the Director of \nHomeland Security, the FEMA Administrator?\n  Why were Government assets not more readily available or \nprepositioned better? Why was there no plan to deal with an event that \nhad been predicted for years? What went wrong at the Federal, State, \nand local levels? Why were declarations delayed?\n  But even more important than the answers to these questions is what \ndo we need to do to fix it so this never happens again in our country? \nWho is in charge now? What more must be done to fix the problems that \nplague our national system of disaster, response, and recovery?\n  On September 11 we lost nearly 3,000 people, and the families of \nthose left behind demanded to know what went wrong. Thanks to their \ndedication, we finally convinced the President and Congress to \nestablish the 9/11 Commission. It was the right thing to do because \nover 218 years ago the signers of the Constitution pledged themselves \non behalf of all Americans to provide for the common defense. So when \nwe hear things such as the fact there was only one FEMA employee in the \nentire city of New Orleans from August 27 through 30, we see e-mails \nfrom the FEMA Director that he was distracted with his wardrobe when \npeople were drowning in their own homes, waiting for rescue from the \nroofs of those homes, and the national response plan that is supposed \nto guide our national response was basically totally ignored, we have \nto ask ourselves how could we be so unprepared especially after \nSeptember 11?\n  Because I believe the victims of Hurricane Katrina and, indeed, all \nAmericans deserve answers to these questions and a way forward that \nmerits the confidence and trust of the American people, I introduced \nlegislation cosponsored by my friend and colleague from Colorado to \nestablish a Katrina commission, modeled after the 9/11 Commission, \nintended to be nonpartisan, independent, designed to study the Federal, \nState, and local response to Hurricane Katrina.\n  We have 17 cosponsors of this legislation, and I am, frankly, \noutraged we cannot get an up-or-down vote on it. The cameras may have \nleft the area of destruction but the devastation and the devastated \nlives remain. We owe it to the thousands of people who are still \ndisplaced, who lost loved ones, who are still finding bodies in homes \nthat people are returning to, to understand what went wrong, what needs \nto be fixed, and where the responsibility really resides. Over 80 \npercent of the American people believe a Katrina commission is the \nright and necessary thing to do. Yet the Republican leadership of the \nCongress is afraid to allow an up-or-down vote. Why? Because they know \nwhat I know--that a lot of Republicans will vote for this. They were \nequally dismayed. They saw the same television pictures. They worry \nabout what might happen next with an earthquake, a forest fire, massive \ntornadoes like just whipped through the central-southern part of our \ncountry. But even more significantly, the reason this is important is \nbecause of the potential of a terrorist attack that could happen again. \nAnd I have to say it appeared that our Federal response based on \nKatrina is nowhere near ready. We cannot accept the status quo. We must \nfix FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security.\n  My friend from Colorado is a cosponsor of that legislation, and I ask \nhim does he believe a Katrina commission is still needed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I thank my colleague from New York for her leadership on \nthis very important issue for our Nation. I deeply share her belief \nthat a\n\n[[Page S12898]]\n\nKatrina commission is, in fact, needed and that we ought not to wait.\n  The headline on the New Orleans Times Picayune editorial page this \nSunday was ``Forgotten Already.'' ``Forgotten Already.'' It is about \nhow Washington has already forgotten that Katrina is still an ongoing \ncrisis. It is a shame that Washington has such a short attention span.\n  In the days following the storm, Congress moved quickly to pass a $70 \nbillion hurricane relief effort. We held hearings and we grilled the \nofficials from FEMA. However, because the storm waters have receded, \nmany politicians in Washington feel they can roll their sleeves back \ndown and declare the job is done, the mission is accomplished.\n  That is not the case. Tell the 1,154 children who are missing or who \nare looking for their parents that our job in Katrina is done. Tell the \n129,000 Louisiana residents, 129,000 Louisiana residents who still do \nnot have electricity, that the Federal Government task is done. Tell \nthe 196,000 Katrina evacuees who are currently unemployed, who do not \nhave jobs, that our mission is accomplished.\n  Our job is far from done. We need to do much more to ensure that the \nindividuals and communities along the gulf coast recover, and we have \nto do a lot more to plug the homeland security vulnerabilities that \nHurricane Katrina exposed.\n  What Senator Clinton's legislation would do is establish a Hurricane \nKatrina commission, similar to the 9/11 Commission. The commission \nwould investigate what went wrong in the Government's response to \nKatrina and what steps we need to take to make things better.\n  I remember a number of years ago meeting with President Bush and \nthen-Homeland Security Adviser Ridge at the White House shortly after \n9/11 with attorneys general from States around the country. At that \ntime, the President was opposed to the creation of a department of \nhomeland security. Later, the President relented, taking the position \nthat in the post-9/11 world, a department of homeland security was \nnecessary for us as a nation to make homeland security a greater \npriority to protect America.\n  A few years later, I came to Washington as a U.S. Senator to help on \nthat agenda. I want to make protecting our Nation and our homeland a \ngreater priority. Yet 4 years after 9/11, Katrina slapped the Nation \nwith reality. We are not prepared to protect our homeland, even when we \nhave days of warning that American citizens are in the path of the \ngravest danger. That reality is a shame on the efforts of the last 4 \nyears, but it would be an even greater shame for our Nation not to \nlearn from our failure in the preparation and response to Katrina. We \nneed to learn from those lessons.\n  My colleague's proposed bipartisan commission would help us make sure \nwe prevent failures in homeland security in the future. Therefore, I am \nproud to stand here with Senator Clinton and 16 other cosponsors in \ndemanding accountability from the Federal Government. I am proud to \nstand with them for a stronger America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I thank my friend for his support. He \nknows a lot about what he is speaking of today. He was an attorney \ngeneral. He had law enforcement responsibilities. He knew how essential \nit was to coordinate services throughout the State of Colorado. I am \nvery grateful for his support and his eloquence on behalf of this \nbipartisan commission and his vigilance in working toward the \nestablishment of a Katrina commission.\n  I have said before that I agree that our established congressional \ncommittees should conduct their own oversight roles, but an independent \ncommission is absolutely necessary to get this right.\n  The Katrina commission would be made up of individuals with the \nexpertise and credentials to do the work; namely, people who have \nexperience with emergency preparedness, mitigation, and cataclysmic \nplanning. The commission would build upon previous investigations and \nissues we know exist. For example, on 9/11, one of the problems our \nemergency response system faced was the lack of interoperable \ncommunications; namely, the police radios couldn't talk to the fire \ndepartment radios, couldn't talk with people coming from other parts of \nNew York or even outside New York to be helpful at the site of Ground \nZero where the Towers collapsed. Yet 4 years later, we find people \nresponding to Katrina faced the same problems. We have not yet solved \nthe problem of interoperable communications.\n  How long are we going to let this go on? When the 9/11 Commission \nissued its report, the majority leader applauded the Commission for its \ntremendous act of public service and patriotism and looked forward to a \ntime when we could work together to ensure America grew stronger and \nbetter prepared. Let's ask ourselves, Are we stronger today and better \nprepared?\n  Although I applaud my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who are \nconducting the committee hearings into what happened, I do not believe \nthis disaster has the attention or the right mix of people \ninvestigating it that will give us both answers and a roadmap for the \nfuture.\n  Some of the statistics are frightening. FEMA ordered over 125,000 \ntrailers or mobile homes to provide housing for an estimated 600,000 \npeople. Media reports indicate that as of the beginning of November, \nhundreds of thousands of people are still in hotel rooms, relatives' \nrooms, shelters, and even in tents. Now we hear FEMA is going to move \nthese people out of their hotels as of December 1. Where are they going \nto be moving them? What is going to happen to them? I think these are \nquestions that add to the urgency of such an investigation. There are \nthousands of churches and other faith-based institutions, as well as \nnonprofits, that have yet to hear from FEMA as to whether they will get \nany help in continuing the assistance they are providing.\n  I cannot help but agree with the Senator from Colorado, who pointed \nout that we went through this after 9/11. He spoke about his meeting \nwith the President. He spoke about the resistance to a department of \nhomeland security, to any kind of investigation.\n  This Katrina commission will eventually be put into operation. It \nwill have to be because people are not getting the answers they need. I \nhope we will come to a realization that this Katrina commission, an \nindependent commission, is the way to proceed.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1748\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 220, S. 1748, a bill to \nestablish the Katrina commission investigation, that the bill be read a \nthird time and passed, and that the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, there we have it. We are once again \nhearing objections. The status quo wins the day. FEMA will not change. \nThe Department of Homeland Security will not change. We will never get \nto the bottom of what happened and what we need to do to fix the \nobvious flaws unless we have this independent commission.\n  I ask my friend from Colorado if he agrees that the only way we will \nget the answers we need is through an independent commission.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I agree with my friend and colleague from \nNew York. The Republican leadership should allow this Senate to have a \nvote on whether we establish an independent Katrina commission. This \nought not be a partisan issue. This is not about Republicans and \nDemocrats and Independents. This is not about assigning blame. It is \nabout learning from our mistakes and building a stronger Nation.\n  I hope that President Bush, Senator Frist, and Speaker Hastert will \njoin us and move forward in developing this independent Katrina \ncommission so we can make our homeland even more secure, because what \nKatrina taught us, without a doubt, is that we as a nation are not \nprepared. Every day we go without this commission is a day lost. It \nputs us a day further from finding answers for the victims of Hurricane\n\n[[Page S12899]]\n\nKatrina, a day further from identifying the gaps in homeland security, \na day further from a safer America.\n  I want to say that I, too, have been involved as an attorney general \nlooking at difficult issues that have occurred in my State. I walked \nthrough the carnage of Columbine High School, the bloodiest school \nshooting in America. And so many years later, the answers we sought \nabout why that happened and how it could have been prevented, how we \ncould have improved on interoperable communications, those lessons have \nnot yet been placed on the table.\n  I daresay that without the efforts of the 9/11 Commission, the \nlessons learned from that most horrific attack on America on 9/11 would \nnot have been learned. In the same way, as we move forward to determine \nwhether we have a Department of Homeland Security that is up to the job \nof protecting Americans, protecting the homeland, protecting our \ncitizens, it is a major mistake on the part of the United States of \nAmerica not to undertake this independent review which has been \npresented in a bill by my colleague from New York.\n  I thank Senator Clinton again for her advocacy for this legislation. \nI vow to work with her and to try again and again with my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle. I do not believe we can adjourn this Congress \nwithout finishing the job on a Katrina commission.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. May I finish, Mr. President?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I misunderstood the time sequence, and the \nParliamentarian tells me the Senator has until 2:30 p.m.?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. No, 1:30 p.m.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I remove my previous objection. The Senator should \ncontinue to have her time until 1:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alaska. I will \nwrap this up.\n  I wish to serve notice to my colleagues in the Senate that my good \nfriend from Colorado and I will be back again and again and again, as \nwe were with the 9/11 Commission. He was not in the Senate at that \ntime. He was serving his people in Colorado from a position of trust \nand responsibility as attorney general, but he watched from afar, \nunderstood the tragedy that befell us, and, like so many of us who are \ngiven the public trust of public office, wanted answers. He came to \nthis body to help find those answers.\n  When Katrina struck and it became so apparent that we were not yet \nprepared, the Senator from Colorado was among the very first to say we \nneed those answers and we need them yesterday because no place is \nprepared, no place is ready if the Federal Government is not in a \nposition to provide the assistance and the assets and the support that \nis needed in the face of a large manmade or natural disaster.\n  We will be back again and again, as we were with the 9/11 Commission, \nuntil this commission is established. It is the right thing to do. The \ncountry deserves to have it and, most of all, the people along the gulf \ncoast deserve the answers and deserve to know what did occur to them, \nwhat could have been prevented, and then the rest of us should act on \nthat information to make sure our Nation is prepared in the future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, how much time remains for the minority at \nthis time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if no one seeks that time, I ask that I \nbe permitted to start the majority time at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                      POINT OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have sought the floor now to speak on \nwhat I consider to be a matter of personal privilege. It has been \nbrought to my attention that the Senator from Illinois unfairly \nmaligned my character in direct violation of rule XIX of the Standing \nRules of the Senate.\n  Rule XIX states:\n\n       No Senator in debate shall, directly or indirectly, by any \n     form of words impute to another Senator or to other Senators \n     any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator.\n\n  The Senator from Illinois apparently takes exception to the fact that \nwitnesses who appeared voluntarily before the joint hearing of the \nSenate Commerce and Energy Committees last week were not sworn in. I \nwould like to set the record straight about the events of that day.\n  The request by Senator Cantwell to swear in the witnesses was \ndelivered to my office at 8:10 a.m. on the morning of the hearing. It \nwas leaked to the press before it was ever delivered to me. As a matter \nof fact, the Seattle press that morning had reported that I had already \nrejected the request before I had even received it or read it.\n  While I have accomplished many things in my 37 years in the Senate, \nthe ability to see into the future or read into the minds of other \nMembers is not one of them. Had the Senator from Illinois read the \ntranscript of that hearing, he would have a better understanding of why \nI took the actions I did as the chairman opening that hearing.\n  I made this opening statement:\n\n       I remind the witnesses as well as the Members of these \n     committees, Federal law makes it a crime to provide false \n     testimony. Specifically section 1001 of title 18 provides in \n     pertinent part: ``Whoever in any matter within the \n     jurisdiction of the legislative branch of the Government of \n     the United States knowingly or willfully makes any material \n     false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation \n     shall be fined under this title or be imprisoned not more \n     than 5 years, or both.''\n\n  I continued my statement at that time:\n\n       Having reviewed the rules of the Senate and the rules of \n     the Commerce and Energy Committees and the relevant \n     provisions of title II of United States Code, there is \n     nothing in the standing rules of our committee rules or in \n     the Senate which requires witnesses to be sworn. The statute \n     has the position that everyone appearing before the Congress \n     is in fact under oath. These witnesses accepted an invitation \n     to appear before our committees voluntarily. They are aware \n     that making false statements and testimony is a violation of \n     Federal law whether or not an oath has been administered. I \n     shall not administer an oath today.\n\n  Earlier, Senator Durbin of Illinois came to the Chamber and said--and \nI quote from the Record that has been provided to me:\n\n       You probably heard about the hearing before the Senate \n     Commerce Committee. Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington \n     insisted these oil company executives be sworn in, testify \n     under oath, just as the third base company executives were a \n     few years ago. But Senator Stevens, the chairman of the \n     committee, refused to allow them to be sworn in. Why? So they \n     couldn't be held accountable if they didn't tell the truth.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe Senator Durbin's comments are a direct \nviolation of rule XIX. I did not swear in witnesses who appeared before \nour committee because they are required to tell the truth under law.\n  Those are the rules of the Senate, the rules of our committees. To \nsuggest I did not administer an oath to these witnesses to help them \nlie to Members of Congress is false, inexcusable, and in violation of \nrule XIX, the longstanding practice of Senatorial courtesy, and I \nexpect an apology from the Senator from Illinois.\n  What is the status of the time now in terms of control of time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time until 2:30 is controlled by the \nmajority.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, under the conditions that if the Senator \nfrom Montana would yield to our colleagues on this side if they come to \nmake a statement on the bill, I yield to the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n\n\n               Commerce-Justice-Science Conference Report\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, first, I thank my friend from Alaska for \nhis courtesy in working out this accommodation.\n  I rise to speak on the Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bill \nconference report that might be coming before us later on this day for \na vote.\n  I must say I am outraged. This bill makes further cuts to critical \nprograms that help local law enforcement\n\n[[Page S12900]]\n\nfight methamphetamine nationwide. These cuts--and they are dramatic--\nhave a particularly damaging impact on my State of Montana. Why? \nBecause we are a rural State. We have very limited resources.\n  When I ask Montana law enforcement officers what is the No. 1 law \nenforcement problem they are facing, an open-ended question, they all \ncome back with the same answer: methamphetamine. That is the biggest \nproblem Montana law enforcement officers have.\n  The Byrne grant program and similar programs support most of the \nproactive drug enforcement in the 56 counties of my State, and I dare \nsay that is true for a majority of States in this Nation.\n  Why is Byrne grant money so important? Again, it is because we are \nspread so thin across a vast area in Montana, a small population with \nan international border. An adequately funded Byrne program, \nparticularly when combined with a high-intensity drug trafficking area, \nor HIDTA program, is essential. These programs are critical to help us \nmaintain our seven multijurisdictional regional drug task forces, which \nhave been a huge boon to successful efforts in Montana to fight \nmethamphetamine.\n  Let me give an example. In eastern Montana, we have what is called \nthe Eastern Montana Drug Task Force that is based in Miles City, MT. We \nalso have the Tri-Agency Drug Task Force in Havre that is near the \nCanadian border. We have a third drug task force in our State, and that \nis the Big Money Drug Task Force based outside of Wolf Point. They all \nrely entirely on Byrne funding. These task forces also happen to cover \nsome of the most open, most rural areas in my State where meth \nenforcement is particularly challenging.\n  This Commerce report that is soon to be before us guts the Federal \nGovernment's commitment to State and local law enforcement. It funds \nthe Byrne grant program at just $416 million for this next fiscal year. \nThat $416 million may sound like a lot of money, but it represents a \nnearly 35-percent cut over current year funding. We are cutting this \nlaw enforcement program by 35 percent.\n  Is that bad? That is terrible. But it is even worse because that 35-\npercent cut is on top of a 26-percent cut in funding in reallocation of \nlocal law enforcement resources that occurred in 2005. First we had a \n26-percent cut last year. Now this is a 35-percent cut on top of the \n26-percent cut.\n  This bill cuts the Community Oriented Policing Services, otherwise \nknown as COPS. That is cut by one-third and provides no funding for \ncommunities to hire additional police officers.\n  According to the president of the Montana Association of Chiefs of \nPolice, COPS funding is necessary to maintain an adequate number of \npolice in the field to protect our communities. One law enforcement \nofficer back home told me that without COPS funding, the number of \ncrimes, especially violent crimes, begins to rise again. Currently, \nthere is no other alternative to the COPS Program. He tells me that the \nCOPS Program is one of those programs that works, one of those programs \nthat is directly responsible for protecting our communities and for \ngetting officers out on the street to protect us all. COPS works. We \nall know the COPS Program has worked, particularly for us in rural \nStates.\n  So I ask, where are our priorities? The Senate did its job. We sent \nover a bill to the House that contained nearly $900 million for the \nByrne program, yet somehow we will end up later today with a conference \nreport that funds this program at close to a paltry $348 million. We \nhad $900 million. The conference report comes back at $348 million.\n  Where were our Senate conferees? Why did they not stand up for the \nSenate version? Why did they not stand up for the Senate?\n  The Montana Narcotics Officers Association has told me that if the \nHouse version of the CJS bill is passed, this would gut Montana's meth \nenforcement abilities, especially in rural areas. They told me this \nwould result in an elimination or a dramatic reduction in services \nprovided by Montana's regional drug task forces.\n  The 26-percent cut in Byrne funding in this last fiscal year resulted \nin nearly a 50-percent cut in Byrne funding for the entire State of \nMontana, and that is because of a block grant allocation which has that \nresult.\n\n  I frankly cannot believe we are being asked to support a conference \nreport that has cut law enforcement, especially in the areas to fight \nmethamphetamine enforcement, as much as we are asked to.\n  I am also very disappointed that this conference did something else \nwhich I think is a very bad idea. What did they do? They did not accept \nthe Senate-passed combat meth bill. What was that? That bill would put \ncertain methamphetamine ingredients behind pharmacy counters \nnationwide. We all know that the precursors of methamphetamine over the \ncounter in drugstores are a big inducement for meth manufacturers to \ntake these ingredients and go to local labs out in rural areas and make \nmethamphetamine. It only makes sense that these methamphetamine \nprecursors not be sold over the counter but only sold by prescription \nor at least behind the counter so there is much more control over the \npurchase of those ingredients. We passed that in the Senate. What did \nthe conference do? No, they did not adopt it.\n  Let us look at what this conference report says with respect to rural \nStates that are trying to fight methamphetamine. I might say it is not \njust rural States; it is most States trying to fight methamphetamine.\n  First, it did not take up and agree to the combat meth bill. The \nprecursor provisions are not in here anymore. Willy-nilly, they are out \nof there. It also dramatically cut the Byrne grant money, which is so \nimportant.\n  I made a good part of my job in the Senate devoted to fighting \nmethamphetamine. I have gone to a lot of these drug task force \nmeetings. I go to many assemblies in Montana with high school and \nmiddle school students. I put on these programs that show how bad \nmethamphetamine is. I have law enforcement officers there during these \nsessions with middle school and high school students. I have counselors \nthere. We go over what has to be done to fight methamphetamine.\n  Again, a reminder, methamphetamine is the No. 1 law enforcement \nproblem in the State of Montana, and I am sure that is true in a lot of \nother States as well.\n  I ask for a show of hands at these assemblies. These are schoolwide \nassemblies. I ask: How many of you here know of somebody who is on meth \nor recently on meth? Fifty to 70 percent of the students' hands go up. \nIt is such an outrage. We talk about pandemics with the Asian flu. I \nmight say we certainly have an epidemic with methamphetamine. In a \ncertain sense it may be a pandemic. It is a huge problem.\n  If we are going to fight it--and I hear in my State of Montana, and I \nam sure the Presiding Officer hears the same thing in his home State of \nSouth Dakota--we need to have dollars out in the field to fight \nmethamphetamine. There are all kinds of ways to attack this problem, \nbut certainly dollars out in the field on the law enforcement side are \nabsolutely critical. It is essential, and they are not in this bill.\n  We need a lot more prevention efforts. That is clear. We need more \ncounseling efforts. That is clear. We need drug counseling and other \nways to get people off of methamphetamine. We also need the law \nenforcement there to catch the bad guys who are doing it.\n  In a certain sense, this conference report is a huge victory for the \ndruggies. It is a huge victory for those who are peddling \nmethamphetamine in America because they know if there is much less law \nenforcement, if the dollars are not there to stop them, they have an \nopen field. They are not dumb. The big drug manufacturers and peddlers \nare not stupid. They know where they can go. They know where there is \nlaw enforcement and where there is not.\n  When I talk to local drug task forces in my State, it is so clear to \nme how desperately they need these dollars. They beg me for these \ndollars. That is why I have offered amendments in this body to provide \nfunding to fight methamphetamine.\n  We passed legislation in the Senate. We have been doing our job. But \nfor the Senate conferees to come back with a conference report which \nallows all of these antimethamphetamine efforts to\n\n[[Page S12901]]\n\nbe gutted and to be diluted and cut back and ask us to vote for that \nconference report I think is an outrage. For that reason, I strongly \noppose this conference report. It is a bad idea. It is going to allow \nmore methamphetamine in our country, one of the biggest problems this \ncountry has.\n  This is a victory for the drug dealers. It is a big victory for drug \ndealers. They know where they can deal drugs. They know where there is \nlaw enforcement and where there is not. When we start to cut back \nmoney--not status quo but cut back law enforcement dollars--that is \ngoing to be a huge problem. I very much hope this Congress finds a way \nto redress this imbalance, to deal with this problem so we can \nadequately fight methamphetamine.\n  I have all kinds of PSAs running in Montana, public service ads, \nagainst methamphetamine. I have been working in schools to get rid of \nmethamphetamine. There are other people in Montana who are paying a lot \nof dollars out of their own pockets, with very effective \nantimethamphetamine ads. Part of the solution is to make sure we have \nadequate law enforcement. I strongly urge my colleagues to not agree to \nthis conference report until this problem is solved.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the National Sheriffs' \nAssociation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                               National Sheriffs' Association,\n\n                                Alexandria, VA, November 10, 2005.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the National Sheriffs' \n     Association (NSA) and our 23,000 members, I am writing to \n     express our extreme disappointment and concern over the lack \n     of funding for the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance \n     Grants Program (JAG) in H.R 2862, the Science, State, \n     Justice, Commerce and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill.\n       The JAG program, which was formed by consolidating the \n     Edward Byrne Memorial Grant program and the Local Law \n     Enforcement Block Grant program, is one of the primary \n     Federal assistance programs for State, tribal and local law \n     enforcement agencies. State and local law enforcement \n     agencies, including the 3,087 sheriffs' offices across the \n     country, rely heavily on JAG funds for critical operational \n     activities. JAG funds support many of our counter-drug \n     activities, particularly drug task forces. Without these \n     funds, our sheriffs will not be able to sustain the task \n     forces or even fight the war on drugs!\n       Local law enforcement agencies from all across the country \n     are already out-manned and out-gunned by the drug cartels and \n     street gangs in our communities. Over the last several years \n     we have been forced to deal with the loss of personnel, \n     because of budget cuts to the COPS program. Now the COPS \n     Universal Hiring Program has been zeroed out by Congress, \n     thus abandoning an effective program, and the JAG Funds are \n     being cut as well. These cuts will put an end to any progress \n     that has been made and destroy any hope we might have of \n     winning the war on drugs or ridding our communities of \n     methamphetamine!\n       For more than a decade, the resources provided under the \n     JAG program have allowed law enforcement agencies to expand \n     their capabilities and make great strides in reducing the \n     incidence of crime in communities across the nation. It is \n     our belief that the lack of Federal support for local law \n     enforcement will surely result in increased crime and drug \n     abuse!\n       The conference agreement would provide just $416 million \n     for the Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grants, of which \n     only $321 million is available for local law enforcement \n     assistance. This represents a cut of more than $217 million \n     or 34 percent, from FY 2005 levels. We find this level of \n     funding to be unacceptable and believe that Congress is \n     failing to adequately recognize the mission of law \n     enforcement!\n       Cuts of this magnitude seriously inhibit law enforcement's \n     abilities and endanger the safety and well being of our \n     communities! In order to keep communities safe from crime and \n     free of drugs, law enforcement agencies must be given the \n     resources they need! The FY06 SSJC appropriations bill does \n     not provide for those resources.\n       At a time where law enforcement and securing the homeland \n     should be of the highest priority, Congress has chosen to \n     completely dismiss them as a priority! With the rise of \n     terrorism, and the fact that methamphetamine use and abuse \n     has risen to epidemic proportions, Congress should embrace \n     law enforcement, support the JAG program and COPS Hiring \n     Program, and increase their funding, not cut their funding!\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Thomas N. Faust,\n\n                                            Executive Director and\n                            Retired Sheriff, Arlington County, VA.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nCarper, Salazar, and Nelson be added as cosponsors to the Isakson \namendment on the pension bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman. I \nappreciate very much the chairman bringing this pension reform bill to \nthe floor. As a Senator from a State that has several major airlines, \nthree headquartered in my home State of Texas, I know this is very \nimportant for them. It has been worked on for a long time. I appreciate \nthe efforts of the distinguished chairman in this regard.\n\n\n                              Judge Alito\n\n  I also want to take this opportunity to answer some of the things \nthat have been said in the Chamber today, particularly about Judge \nAlito, who is the President's nominee for the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States.\n  It has been implied in the Chamber today that maybe he doesn't \ndeserve an up-or-down vote. After all, Harriet Miers didn't get one.\n  I am the perfect person to say I think Harriet Miers should have \ngotten one. I do believe Harriet Miers was qualified for the Supreme \nCourt. If she had been allowed to open her mouth and say what she \nbelieved and talk about her experience, she would have been confirmed, \nand she would have been a superb Justice.\n  However, Harriet Miers didn't get an up-or-down vote because she \nwithdrew her nomination. She withdrew it voluntarily. It was her \ndecision. I was sorry she did. I didn't want her to make that decision. \nBut to imply that all of a sudden now we have a new standard, that \nJudge Alito doesn't deserve an up-or-down vote, is absolutely wrong and \nit must be refuted. Judge Alito does deserve an up-or-down vote just as \nevery nominee for the Supreme Court of the United States who has gone \nthrough the committee and come out deserves an up-or-down vote. The \nidea that seems to be creeping in here is that, maybe for the first \ntime in the history of the United States, there might be a filibuster, \na partisan filibuster of a judge, a nominee to be Justice for the \nSupreme Court of the United States. That would be a terrible thing for \nthe United States of America, for the President, and for the Senate of \nthe United States. It would be wrong for everyone concerned. It would \nset a precedent that I believe would cause partisanship in this body to \nescalate to a degree that we do not want to see happen.\n  Partisanship has already escalated in the Senate. I am sorry that it \nhas. But I think there are many instances where we work in a bipartisan \nway in the Senate, and we accomplish a great deal when we do. So I \nthink the idea of throwing a bombshell into the Senate and breaking all \ntradition and all precedent and filibustering on a partisan basis a \nnominee for the Supreme Court who is reported out of committee is \nwrong, and I hope the hints of that happening are wrong. I hope they \nare put to bed. I hope we will give this judge his due.\n  This man is qualified for the Supreme Court of the United States by \nany standard. He has an academic record that is excellent. He has years \nof experience as a circuit court judge. He is very well regarded as a \ncircuit court judge. His opinions are reasoned. He has even gone \nagainst what are his stated personal beliefs in order to adhere to \nprecedent and give great respect to the law of the land. He is \neverything we are looking for in a Supreme Court nominee.\n  When he has his hearings and he has the chance to answer the \nquestions of the Judiciary Committee and he is then voted out of that \ncommittee, even a suggestion that he doesn't deserve an up-or-down vote \nis outrageous. I hope we can stamp out those little feelers, say this \nwas a misunderstanding, that Judge Alito most certainly is a nominee \ndeserving of an up-or-down vote in the Senate if he is, in fact, voted \nout of the committee.\n\n\n                   Amendments To The Iraq Resolution\n\n  I also want to take this opportunity to discuss an amendment that was \nagreed to yesterday by the Senate regarding the Iraq resolution. There \nhas\n\n[[Page S12902]]\n\nbeen a statement on the floor today saying that this was a rebuff of \nthe President's policies. The rebuff was to the amendment that was put \nforward that would set a timetable for a withdrawal, that would call on \nthe President to say on a date certain we are going to withdraw troops \nfrom Iraq.\n\n  I have been one in the past who has said we should have a game plan. \nWe should have an exit strategy. I have said that when we were in \nBosnia. I said it as we are in Iraq. I said it about Afghanistan. It is \na legitimate role for the U.S. Congress to say: Mr. President, give us \nan update on where we are and give us what we can expect to see. That \nis exactly what happened. It was not unusual.\n  When we are in a conflict overseas with our troops on the ground, it \nis not unusual that the Congress would ask for a report on the status \nof the conflict. Most certainly it is fair to ask for a report. The \nPresident welcomed that because he knows the role of Congress, just as \nwe do. Those who would characterize that as a rebuff are wrong. The \nPresident knows how tough this situation is. All of us do. Every one of \nus grieves when we lose one American life. But I will say I could not \nbe more proud than I am of our Armed Forces, our men and women who are \nfighting for our freedom today as we speak in this Chamber, because \nthose with boots on the ground know that if we set a time prematurely \nwhen we would exit, we would embolden the enemy they are facing today. \nWe would say to the enemy: Have at it. No matter what happens, we are \nout of here on a date certain.\n  Don't you think that puts the lives of those troops who are on the \nground right now in jeopardy? The idea that we would do something like \nthat is appalling. The Senate didn't do it. The Senate voted down an \namendment. The Senate rebuffed that amendment because it was wrong. \nInstead, we did what is the role of the Senate to do, and that is we \nasked the President for a status report. We asked the President for the \ngame plan for the future. Of course, the President is going to do that. \nHe has been doing that. We have had briefs on the situation in Iraq and \nbriefs on what the next step is ever since we went in to Iraq.\n  Of course it is the right of Congress and the role of Congress to ask \nfor this. The President understands that and actually said he was very \npleased that the Congress did that and that he would, of course, do \nthat type of report as he has been doing on a regular basis in various \nways, through the Secretary of Defense, through the Joint Chiefs, the \nChairman, and the Ambassador to Iraq from the United States. We have \nhad reports from all of these people on the status. We have seen the \nvotes that have been taken in Iraq. We have seen the progress.\n  I think it is important that we set the record straight. On this \nfloor this morning, I think there have been some statements that needed \nto be refuted, and that is what I have attempted to do.\n  I thank the chairman of the committee for allowing me this time and \nthank him for bringing this pension bill to the floor. It is a very \nimportant bill. It will mean a lot to the employees in my State and the \nemployees throughout our country in airlines that are struggling right \nnow. This is an industry we need to protect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield myself such time as I might consume. I thank the \nSenator from Texas for coming to the Chamber and making the comments on \npensions, and I appreciate all the work she has done, particularly in \nthe airline area. I don't think there is a single airline that doesn't \nfly into Texas. I appreciate all the concern she has shown over all the \nvarious issues. There are certainly a lot of them in this 730-page \nbill.\n  I also thank her for the comments on the other topics because, while \nthe time today was supposed to be for debating the pension bill, I \nguess the disadvantage of having one that is as bipartisan as this and \nas much concern to all the employees and businesses of this country is \nthat we didn't have that much opposition today. So people came in with \nother topics.\n  I want to address one of those that came up that disturbs me a little \nbit, and that is the comments about a Katrina Commission.\n  The Katrina disaster and the others that followed it were bigger than \nanything we had ever had in this country. I have to tell you that I \nthink there is enough blame to go around on it. If people want to point \nfingers, it goes the whole circle. The biggest problem with it was we \nhad never seen that many displaced people in one single disaster. There \nwere a million people displaced in that disaster, and 200,000 was the \nprevious record--not that those are the kinds of records we like to \nkeep.\n  A couple of weeks before Katrina, there was a tornado in Wright, WY, \n38 miles south of my hometown. I happened to be there at the time. I \nspent a lot of time in Wright seeing how the recovery went and seeing \nwhat FEMA did. I didn't have much of an idea what FEMA is supposed to \ndo. It was kind of astounding to me. They are the group who comes in \nafter the disaster. They are not the prevention group. They are the \nafter-disaster folks. They come in and register all of the victims of \nthe disaster. Then they help those victims get coordination to find \nevery source of help they possibly can.\n  This disaster was a lot different than any of the ones before. A lot \nof times, when there is a disaster in one town and people are displaced \nfrom that town, they can move to their friends and relatives in the \nnext town. But in this one, not only did their town get wiped out but \nthe towns of their friends and neighbors and relations got wiped out as \nwell; and so did the next town and the next town. They wound up moving \nto completely different States.\n  You can't see those boundaries of States when you drive down the \nroad. There is usually a sign that says ``Welcome to Wyoming'' or \nLouisiana, whatever State it is. There isn't any physical line that is \ndrawn, but in everybody's mind there is a tremendous mental barrier of \ncrossing a State line and being in unfamiliar territory.\n  That happened in this instance, and States are saying those are \nresidents of another State that we are supposed to take care of; people \nfrom another State are saying, I am not real comfortable being here, \nbut I am here. What can you do to help me? It was even hard to locate \npeople.\n  The size of the disaster was tremendous. I think I am in a position \nto complain about anybody complaining about how it all went because I \nam from the committee that proposed legislation and actually moved it \nthrough the Senate floor. I think the only legislation that has dealt \nwith the Katrina disaster is student displacement, which we had in the \ndeficit reduction bill. We have a health package we are working on, and \nwe hope to be able to move it as well.\n  There are unprecedented problems with this. We have the opportunity \nfor some unprecedented solutions. They are not the best solutions, but \nthey are the best we can come up with on short notice.\n  Rather than trying to figure out whose fault it was, I think the \nwhole country has a big problem with this ``whose fault it is.'' We \nhave gotten to the point where, if we fall down, we wonder who caused \nthat and who should pay. We want some kind of retribution for it. What \nwe are doing with that is eliminating some personal responsibility. \nEverybody has to watch out for themselves and their neighbor and help \nget ready particularly for events they can see coming. I think people \nare going to be a lot more responsible on that in the future because of \nsome of the things that happened. But to try to place blame doesn't do \nmuch except build divides. We are trying to bring people together.\n  That is what the pension bill is working to do--bring people together \nso they can have a secure future, so they can know what is going to \nhappen with their savings and their pensions and how it all comes \ntogether. This bill does do that.\n  It is extremely complicated, with many moving parts. It is hard to \nhave unanimous agreement on anything, but this is pretty close to that. \nIt is because it solves a huge problem. Here again we could talk about \nwhat the blame is for the problem.\n  I actually want to talk a little bit about how we got to the point \nwhere there was a problem with pensions. I am not going to go into some \nof the\n\n[[Page S12903]]\n\nthings mentioned before about how the negotiations went and drove up \nthe amount of benefits people were receiving. Instead, I want to talk a \nlittle bit more about the core problem we have; that is, after \nSeptember 11, 2001, the economy went in a little different direction \nthan we had anticipated--in fact, drastically different than \nanticipated.\n  Two things happened at the same time: Both the interest rates and the \nstock market went down. Usually, when interest rates go down, the stock \nmarket goes up and people take their money out of the low-interest \nmechanisms and put it into the stock market which grows faster because \nthere is more money coming in there, which is driving up the price of \nthe stock. But after 2001, both the interest rates and stocks went \ndown. There was no possibility of taking the money from the pension and \nhedging it anywhere, of moving it so they would have more income. So \nthe income dropped drastically and investments dropped drastically. \nThat put the companies in a position where those who had fully funded \nplans no longer had fully funded plans. It wasn't because they stopped \nputting money in or taking money out. It was because it didn't grow at \nthe rate that had been anticipated before. That created a lot of \nproblems. That is not to say there weren't some problems, but primarily \nthe problem came from the stock market and the interest rates dropping \nat the same time. The good news is that interest rates, as far as \npension plans--and some senior citizens' savings and other people's \nsavings--the good news is the interest rate has been going up. That has \nnot been a help to the stock market, but that has been a help to those \npeople who have money in savings accounts. It has been a help to \npensions because the annual statement that just came out by the PBGC \nfor their fiscal year 2005 financial results show they actually had a \nnet gain of almost $.5 billion for last year. That isn't because the \nPBGC was better. That is because firms were able to generate more \nrevenue for their pension funds. There are a lot of things at work in \nthis.\n  Another thing that was mentioned this morning that I want to clear up \na little was a relationship people draw--the relationship between the \nPension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the savings-and-loan debacle. \nWe have two different ways of paying out here. They are dramatically \ndifferent. For one thing, when people have money that is ensured by the \nFDIC and a bank fails, people take their money now. It is an immediate \ncrisis--to the total value of their ensured deposits. With the Pension \nBenefit Guaranty Corporation, they are guaranteeing that people will \nget a portion with a cap of what they have coming in pension at the \ntime they would have received it. It is long term. It isn't an \nimmediate disbursal of whatever money they have in that account. It is \na disbursal over time at the rate at which they would have received the \npension, which would be the rest of their lifetime, as opposed to an \nimmediate withdrawal like savings and loans.\n\n  We have another problem that is coming up here shortly. That is when \nthe stock market and the interest rates both went down, they created a \ncrisis. It was not a crisis of bad management as much as this \ndifficulty with the stock market. Recognizing that crisis, we passed \nsome legislation. But it was temporary legislation to allow for some \nrecovery of the economy and the market and that sort of thing, to get \nthings back in balance. That temporary piece of legislation runs out \nDecember 31 of this year. We need to have in place something that will \ncontinue to encourage the companies to put more into their pension \nfunds, to add to the solvency of their pension funds, to bring them up \nto the level they are supposed to be, without putting them out of \nbusiness. We need something that will fill in for these temporary rules \nthat are running out, something that does the job, I hope, better.\n  We have had some time to review the whole situation and come up with \nthis bipartisan solution.\n  One of the difficulties during this discussion was over an item \ncalled ``credit rating.'' There is a provision in the bill that calls \nfor companies to have to put in considerably more money once they get a \nbad credit rating. I am counting on that being something we work on in \nconference committee. We all operated on a principle, and the principle \nwe operated on was we want to know when a company is having difficulty, \nand we want to know it early. We want to have them make sure their \npension for their employees is protected at the time the business \nstarts to go bad.\n  That was the principle from the White House, that was the principle \nof the HELP Committee, that was the principle of the Finance Committee, \nand we tried to arrange a way to do that.\n  One of the things on the surface that looked like a good idea was \ncredit rating. When they get a bad credit rating, it forces them to \nbring more solvency into their fund. The idea is once they get a bad \ncredit rating, they cannot put more money in the fund. They are in a \nvery bad situation when they are listed as a junk bond situation \nalready. In fact, one of the difficulties with the credit rating is it \nis not done by people in the company or people in the Government. It is \ndone by some other experts who look at what they have access to and \nmake decisions about the company. Sometimes they probably get it \nextremely right, and sometimes they can get it wrong. But that doesn't \nmatter. What matters is if a company gets rated at a junk bond status, \nthey can virtually never get out of that. Why can't they get out of it? \nOne reason is the person who analyzed the thing and who may have \nreplaced a new employee is a little bit reluctant to sign his name to \nsay this company is OK. It is the ``protect yourself'' kind of \nattitude. So you don't let them out of the junk bond status, which \nforces them to make the payments perhaps longer than they ought to have \nto at that rate, and in fact keeps them in junk bond status. It is a \nkind of cart-and-the-horse sort of situation--they keep getting one in \nfront of the other and impeding the progress toward what we don't want.\n  What I am hoping we can do in the conference committee is to find \nanother way that is not the credit rating way but a way that the \ncompany will realize and start to correct on this point where they were \nstarting to go downhill, and then also be able to know when they have \nrecovered so we don't force them into bankruptcy. We are asking people \nfor solutions, and we have had a number of them suggested.\n  Again, I thank Senator DeWine for his efforts in this area. Senator \nDeWine and some of the folks--particularly some manufacturing companies \nthat are involved in this kind of a situation, where some of them even \nhave 100-percent funded plans, but they are in junk bond status. \nConsequently, even though their funds have a lot of funds, they get \ndifferent requirements that will escalate the problem and not provide a \nsolution.\n  That is one of the things particularly I am expecting we will take a \nlook at when we get in conference committee. I think there is a way for \nall of us to come up with a solution that will work and meet that basic \nprinciple of locating companies when they begin to have trouble and \nmake sure that as much solvency is put into the pension plans as \npossible.\n  I also will mention that in the deficit reduction bill we passed last \nweek, there was a section that dealt with pensions. I want to reassure \neverybody that there is the clause in the deficit reduction bill that \nsays if we pass the full pension bill--that means the House and the \nSenate actually conferring and coming to an agreement and getting a \nfull pension bill signed--that what is in there will modify the \npension.\n  Under deficit reduction, our hands were kind of tied on the options \nwe have to meet the requirements of reconciliation. Under those \nrequirements, all we could do was raise rates to the company. We had to \ndo that considerably higher than we would have had to, had we some of \nthe tools which we have under the full pension bill.\n  Now, there may still have to be some numbers tweaked on that to meet \nthe requirement that we set for ourselves. We set in the budget a \nrequirement we need to have a $6.6 billion deficit reduction on the \nPension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. We needed to reduce potential \noutlays by the corporation so that it would be solvent or moved toward \nsolvency.\n  I mentioned this tale that there is on pensions so there was not a \nneed to\n\n[[Page S12904]]\n\ncome up with $22 billion this year. It can be done over a period of \nyears. In that deficit reduction bill, there is a paragraph that says \nif we pass a full bill, the full bill takes precedence over the deficit \nreduction package, so it will not be nearly as much of an increase for \nthe company using that as if we went with the deficit reduction.\n  I thank everyone for the cooperation we had on the deficit reduction \npart and in coming up with that.\n  I want to add my words to Senators Kennedy and Mikulski as they \nchallenge the House to get their bill done. Getting our bill done by \nitself does not complete the process. It requires that the Senate and \nthe House pass a bill that is the same which means they have to hurry \nand pass one; we have to conference it and, hopefully, have this done \nwhen we come back shortly in December. If not, very quickly after the \nfirst of the year. As I mentioned, December 31st is the expiration of \nthe previous formulas.\n  I need to thank and commend a few people. This has been a lot more \ncomplicated and a lot more difficult than the discussion today might \nseem to indicate. The reason we have had as little discussion and as \nlittle opposition today is because people put in a lot of hours to \nunderstand what was going on and focusing on principles so we could \narrive at a solution for pensions. I commend the work of the staff on \nthis bill. Particularly, I commend my HELP Committee staff. Katherine \nMcGuire is the director of the committee and did an outstanding job of \njuggling multiple interests and bills. Somebody suggested that we were \nnot a committee, we were a bill factory. If you look at the work that \nhas come out of the committee under Katherine's direction and the \ncooperation of both sides--near unanimous consent on almost every \nbill--we have had a very productive year. This bill is one of those \nindications.\n  When the President listed his top 10 priorities, my committee had 21 \nof them. That is largely because in the HELP area he listed one \npriority, and that turned out to be 16 bills in my committee. We are \nprogressing through those, as well. We are hoping to be able to come up \nwith lower cost health care but with better quality and access. That is \na major challenge of this country. We have had double-digit inflation \non health care for years. I have a lot of faith in the committee and in \nstaff in what we have been able to do so far.\n  I also commend Diann Howland and David Thompson. These are my two \nexperts in this area of pensions. I mention that one of them had a lot \nof experience on the Committee on Finance staff and one of them had a \nlot of experience on the HELP Committee staff. It was fortuitous we \nbrought these people together with this expertise and have them on the \nsame side working to both come up with the ideas and merge the bill. \nThey probably have, combined, about 20 years' worth of experience on \nthis bill alone.\n  I congratulate Gregg Dean, who brings the banking knowledge to the \ndebate, and Amy Angelier, who brings the budget expertise to it. Ilyse \nSchuman does an outstanding job with the legal work we have to do on \nthe bill. I also commend Portia Wu, Holly Fechner, and Terry Holloway \nof Senator Kennedy's staff; John O'Neill of Senator Grassley's \nCommittee on Finance staff; Judy Miller and Stuart Sirkin from Senator \nBaucus's staff. We all owe our thanks to Jim Fransen and Stacy Kern of \nthe Legislative Counsel's Office, who drafted numerous versions of this \nbill and all of its predecessors. A very special thank you is owed to \nthe staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation for their advice and \nguidance. The staff of the Joint Tax includes Carolyn Smith, Patricia \nMcDermott, Nikole Flax, and Allison Wielobob. Last, but not least, I \nthank Karla Carpenter of Senator DeWine's subcommittee for her \ndiligence and Ellen-Marie Whelan and Ben Olinsky of Senator Mikulski's \nstaff for all of their hard work. That subcommittee did an absolutely \nmarvelous job.\n  The way we have our subcommittees set up is pretty much along the \nlines of the title of our bill. We have some spectacular subcommittee \nchairmen and ranking members who are out there working on projects. \nThat is the only reason we are able to produce as many bills with as \nmuch bipartisanship as we have done.\n  I also thank Glee Smith, Mike Quiello, and Ed Egee of Senator \nIsakson's staff for their fine work on this airline amendment.\n  We are about at the point where we will vote on the amendment. I \nexpress my opposition to the amendment because I don't think it is fair \nto the other people who would be getting pensions. I appreciate Senator \nAkaka's tremendous effort to try and find a solution for pilots. But as \nwe find the solution, we have to be sure we are finding the solution \nfor everyone. I ask Members to vote against that amendment and for the \npension bill as a whole.\n  I have some remaining time, and I am happy to yield some to the \nSenator from Massachusetts, who has been absolutely wonderful to work \nwith on this issue. He has tremendous institutional memory on this and \nhas worked on parts of this problem for years. There were numerous \ntimes I went to him and asked: What would you do in this situation? And \nhe told me. I think we found that the shortest distance between two \npoints is a straight answer. We have been able to come up with some \nanswers together and I appreciate that cooperation.\n  I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I know we will be voting soon. This is a reflection of a \nlegislative process working and working well. We have been fortunate in \nour committee with Senator Enzi, at the beginning of this whole \nprocess, examining the pension issues which have not been dealt with \nseriously since 1994, at the time of the GATT agreements. So much has \nchanged since then.\n  We had an openness and a process that has worked through the \nCommittee on Finance in a similar kind of way, Republicans and \nDemocrats working alike. And now, in a short period of time, we are \ngoing to pass legislation this evening that is going to give millions \nand millions of Americans and hundreds of thousands of companies a real \nsense of hope about their retirement future.\n  I certainly hope the House of Representatives recognizes the strong \nbipartisan support we have had for this proposal and follow a similar \npath.\n  Finally, we know that workers have enormous insecurity today. They \nare concerned about the increased costs of gasoline, their health care \ncosts, their job security, the education security of their children, \nand the security of their retirement. This legislation is focused on \nretirement security. We all believe in a strong Social Security Program \nand we all believe in savings. But we all know those savings are down \nand Social Security is going to need focus and attention over the next \nyears.\n  This legislation is the backbone to providing help and assistance and \nassurances to workers about the safety of their retirement programs. It \nprovides innovative and creative ways to deal with the challenges women \nhave presented in terms of the workplace, a much greater sense of \nequity, much greater protection and information for workers so they can \nmake the appropriate decisions, help and assistance so the good \ncompanies can meet their responsibilities to their workers.\n  We are very much in debt to all of those on our committees--the \nSenator has mentioned them--and Senators Mikulski, Harkin, and Bingaman \non the HELP Committee, and our Republican colleagues. I again thank our \nchairman of this committee. It is a very important piece of legislation \nthat will make a big difference. I thank him and I thank the chairman \nof the Committee on Finance, Senator Grassley, and my friend, Senator \nBaucus, as well. We have been able to work together.\n  It is difficult enough around here to get people in your own party to \nagree on something, I find, and then to get both parties to agree and \nthen two committees to agree on something is remarkable.\n  All Members understood the importance to American families in this \ncountry. They are being challenged about their retirement security. It \nbrought out the best in the membership. I strongly support this \nlegislation. I thank my chairman for all he has done.\n  To review quickly, this requires the companies to fund all of their \npensions. It gives the workers timely and accurate information on the \npension plan.\n\n[[Page S12905]]\n\nIt protects older workers in cash balance plan conversions. That is \nenormously important. It gives independent investment advice so workers \ncan have information to make solid judgments. It guards against the \nexploitations we have seen in too many instances, where the CEO's have \nlooked after themselves and failed to look after workers. And it does \nprovide the retirement security for widows and former spouses, which is \nenormously important. Senator Snowe, myself, and others have been \nworking on that issue for years.\n  This is a balanced, well-formulated program that is addressed to meet \nthe needs. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield myself a couple of minutes. I thank Senator Kennedy \nfor his outstanding charts and summary of what we are about to do. I \nthank Senator Baucus for the outstanding work he has done in dealing \nwith this issue this morning and on the Committee on Finance. I thank \nSenator Grassley. It has been great teamwork to get to this point. I am \nlooking forward to the vote we have in about 2 minutes.\n  I yield a minute to Senator Baucus and then a minute to Senator Akaka \nso he can summarize his amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I reinforce a theme that has been in the \nSenate, working together in bipartisanship. I have thought I am one of \nthe luckiest Senators here because the chairman is Senator Grassley, a \ngreat Senator to work with. We work very closely together. That is not \nrhetoric. That is true. That is accurate.\n  The same is also true with Senator Enzi, the chairman of the HELP \nCommittee, and Senator Kennedy. They work very closely together. Not \nonly do they work well together, here are two committees working well \ntogether.\n  A lot of Americans think there is a lot of partisanship in \nWashington. There is. There is too much. But there are also pockets of \ncooperation. We are witnessing today one of those pockets, one of those \ntimes when we are working together. I take my hat off to the chairman \nof the HELP Committee, the chairman of the Committee on Finance, \nSenator Kennedy, and the staffs. This is an effort to solve a problem \nin a nonpartisan way.\n  I thank the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2583\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, my amendment corrects a wrong. Pilots have \ntheir promised pensions significantly reduced when the PBGC takes it \nover. The FAA mandates that the commercial pilots retire at 60. We must \ntake the steps necessary to ensure that the PBGC will have resources to \nbe able to help pilots whose retirement security has been threatened \ndue to the pension takeover and prevented from continuing their \ncareers. This penalty combined with the FAA mandate produce an overly \nharsh result that hurts pilots and their families when they lose their \npension plans.\n  My legislation only affects pilots. Pilot plans have been some of the \nlargest pension plan terminations in history. Again, the FAA mandates \nthat they retire at 60 and the PBGC's early retirement penalty occurs \nbecause they cannot continue to fly past age 60 commercially. My \namendment will bring about much needed relief for United Airlines, US \nAirways, Aloha Airlines, TWA, Eastern Airlines, and Braniff pilots. It \nis important to note that pilots are the only private sector employees \nrequired to retire at the age of 60. I urge my colleagues to support my \namendment.\n  I thank my cosponsors, Senators Specter, Feinstein, Salazar, and \nInouye, for working with me on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I allot myself some time in opposition to \nthe amendment. I appreciate Senator Akaka proposing the amendment, but \nI have to rise in opposition to it for a number of reasons. The biggest \nreason is the amendment changes how the Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation calculates benefits for any one class of workers, which \nwould be airline pilots. It is unfortunate that so many airlines have \ngone into chapter 11 bankruptcy and so many pilots have seen reductions \nin their pensions. Flight attendants and ground workers also deserve \nour attention, not just pilots. This carveout for pilots, who are some \nof the most highly paid professionals in our country, is unfair to \nother workers who also retire early but happen to have devoted their \nwork lives to other positions in the industry.\n  Pilots are not the only workers who have expectations of subsidized \nearly retirements. Many machinists, steelworkers, and autoworkers have \nearly retirement benefits which are reduced under the ERISA guarantees. \nA retiree from any one of these industries has the same complaint as a \npilot when his or her company goes bankrupt and dumps its pension plan \non the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. The steelworker or the \nauto parts maker has less notice that a problem could arise if the \ncompany went broke. Pilots know, when they start their careers, that \nthey will not work past age 60 and pilots can plan accordingly.\n  The shortfall confronting pilots of bankrupt companies is not the \nresult of a change in law. The limit on the PBGC guarantee has been on \nthe books for years. Commercial airline pilots who are universally \nunionized have negotiated over these benefits with their airlines. The \nfact they retire at age 60 is factored into the structure of their \nplans. Pilots know they will likely stop flying before reaching normal \nretirement age of 65. That is why they negotiate rich retirement \nbenefits on top of their high salaries.\n  It is too harsh to suggest that they in any way assumed the risk that \ntheir plans would fail, but it is well known that pilots are some of \nthe most cautious and savvy investors. Risk is something they always \nanticipate.\n  On the merits, therefore, the Akaka amendment is unfair to other \nsimilarly situated workers and overlooks the fact that they have been \nbefore the parties for many years.\n  But, more important, this amendment at this time is kind of the \nultimate non sequitur. This amendment on this legislation just does not \nfollow. It does not fit. The Akaka amendment actually increases the \ndeficit of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation on a bill designed \nto save the agency from insolvency.\n  The PBGC estimates that if this provision were applied just to the \nUnited Airlines pilots plan, the unfunded guaranteed benefits in the \nplan would increase by more than $400 million. Additionally, if United \npilots would cost $400 million, the cost to the PBGC for all pilots \nplans would probably exceed $1 billion. Ultimately, the cost is not \nborne by the PBGC, nor is it borne by the U.S. taxpayers. I hope my \ncolleagues are well aware by now that the full faith and credit of the \nUnited States does not stand behind the PBGC. The additional $1 billion \nin new debt that the Akaka amendment would impose on the PBGC would be \nborne by all the other companies that sponsor and fund defined benefit \npension plans. In this bill, we are already increasing the burden on \nthose companies by about $4 billion through new premiums. Adding \nanother $1 billion in debt is unfair and irresponsible, so I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose the Akaka amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. Chairman, the proposed Treasury regulation ``safe \nharbor'' in the Pension Security and Transparency Act of 2005 states:\n\n       The accrued benefit determined under this subparagraph \n     shall be determined under regulations prescribed by the \n     Secretary which are consistent with the purposes of this \n     paragraph and which may require a plan to provide a credit of \n     additional amounts or increases in additional account \n     balances in amounts substantially equivalent to the benefits \n     that would be required to be provided to meet the \n     requirements of subparagraphs (B) or (C).\n\n  Mr. Chairman, am I correct in my understanding that the intention of \nthis provision authorizing Treasury regulations is that the Secretary \nbe given the widest latitude possible to approve cash balance \nconversions falling within the spirit of the conversion requirements?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The gentleman from North Carolina is correct in his \nunderstanding of the provision, that Congress intends for Treasury to \nhave wide latitude and flexibility in determining which plans could \nqualify for safe harbor protection.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. Chairman, do you agree that the provision is intended \nto allow Treasury to consider for purposes of the regulatory safe \nharbor cash balance plan conversions that are announced 5 or more years \nin advance, allow employees to continue to accrue benefits under the \nold formula until the conversion date and thereafter provide full \nprotection for previously accrued benefits as well as the opportunity \nto ``grow into'' early retirement subsidies under the old formula; and \nthat provide full cash balance plan accruals after conversion without \nwear away?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The cash balance plan conversion described by the \ndistinguished gentleman would indeed be within the scope of the \nauthority intended for the regulatory safe harbor.\n  Mr. BURR. I thank the distinguished chairman for this important \nclarification and for his hard work in developing this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I appreciate that this is a tough, complex \nbill. I know that the HELP and Finance Committees have worked hard to \nmake this a bipartisan measure and worked to include important \nprovisions to help multiemployer pensions alongside single employer \npensions, and I appreciate those efforts. There are some very useful \nprovisions, here, that will help employers to fund pension plans \npredictably and fully--and to do so when times are good, so we can \navoid crash landings when times are bad.\n  I rise to address the provisions in the bill on an issue very close \nto my heart: protecting workers in conversions to cash balance plans. I \nam pleased that we were able to reach a general consensus in this \nlegislation on the cash balance issue. Of course, this compromise is \nnot 100 percent of what I wanted, nor is it 100 percent of what my \ncolleagues on the other side of this issue may have desired. But it is \na solid bipartisan compromise. I am coming to the floor, today, to \nstate why I strongly support the provisions in the bill before us, and \nto explain why I will do everything in my power to oppose any effort to \nweaken this legislation by giving retroactive approval to cash balance \nplans that have already been adopted, no matter how badly workers were \ntreated in the conversion.\n  This is not a hypothetical conversation. Unfortunately, over the last \ndecade, literally millions of employees have seen their traditional \ndefined benefit plans converted into cash balance plans. And, in the \nprocess, many have seen their benefits significantly eroded. This \nerosion of benefits falls primarily on the backs of older workers, who \ncan have their benefits reduced by many thousands of dollars.\n  The HELP-Finance compromise measure would fix this problem by \nrequiring that, in the future, all cash balance plans must have a \nstrong basic structure that provides some predictable level of wage \nreplacement for workers, and by prohibiting companies from ``wearing-\naway'' or eroding the value of the benefits of their older workers, \nincluding early retirement benefits. Furthermore, the HELP-Finance \ncompromise recognizes the problem workers face when they find the \npension plan they had long counted on has suddenly been turned on its \nhead, and gives people a grace period to continue to accrue benefits in \nthe old plan while they make decisions for the future.\n  I should back up here, and describe this very complicated issue. In \nthe early 1990s, a groundswell of companies started changing from \ntraditional defined-benefit pension plans to ``cash balance'' pension \nplans. A cash balance pension is a hybrid between a defined benefit and \ndefined contribution plan. Like a defined benefit plan, it is insured \nby the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, and an employer \nautomatically contributes some percent of an employee's pay to a \nhypothetical guaranteed account for the worker. This account then earns \ninterest. Most defined benefit plans, however, calculate your benefit \nat retirement as some percent of your final average pay multiplied by \nthe number of years you worked for the company.\n  Cash balance plans are different: in a cash balance plan an employer \ncontributes a certain percentage of your paycheck to an account and \nthen credits that account with interest. In that regard, a cash balance \nplan looks a lot more like your typical 401(k) plan, since you have a \nhypothetical account that you can watch grow over time.\n  As I noted earlier, during the 1990s, many companies began moving \naway from traditional defined benefit plans, and toward cash balance \nplans, for a variety of reasons. Many companies said cash balance plans \nwould be easier for benefits managers to calculate, and easier for \nworkers to understand. We were told the plans would better serve our \nNation's new, more mobile workforce.\n  Unfortunately, many workers found there was often a different \nmotivation for the conversions: to cut benefits. Older, retiring \nworkers covered by these conversions learned, too late, that their \nretirement benefit was far less than they had expected.\n  The pension conversions eroded the benefits employees thought they \nhad already earned. One way to erode benefits was to base benefits on a \ncareer average instead of highest years of pay average. It throws pay \nfrom when an employee was younger and earning less money into the \naverage used for the pension. The motivation here is obvious. This will \nreduce the benefits that workers can expect to get toward the end of \ntheir lives. Then, it will ``wear away'' the benefits that workers \nalready earned.\n  What is wear-away? Right now, under pension law, an employer cannot \ntake away money an employee has already earned. If I leave a company \ntomorrow, I'll get the full value of everything it\n\n[[Page S12907]]\n\npromised me up to that point. But in a cash balance conversion, as some \nemployers have done the shift from a defined benefit plan to a cash \nbalance plan, they have set up the new account balance at a lower level \nthan the worker had previously accrued or earned in the old defined \nbenefit account. Wear away happens when no new pension funds are added \nto what was already accrued till the value of the old pension is worn \naway to reach the level it would have been under the new cash balance \nplan. The effect? An older worker effectively earns nothing towards \ntheir pension for years, while younger workers do.\n  The length of time it takes for an employee to make up what has been \nlost is a long time because the wear-away is so significant. Here is a \nhelpful chart from the GAO. This chart shows in the first column, a \nhypothetical 45-year-old's early retirement subsidy. It is frozen, \nbecause the plan is converted. Now, look where she started out under \nthe cash balance formula. It takes her all these years to finally catch \nup to what she had in the first place. All I am saying is that she \nshould start out in the new plan at the same place she left off in the \nold plan. Her 30-year-old coworker is getting money added to his \naccount. Why shouldn't she?\n  The other problem in converting from a traditional plan to a cash \nbalance plan is a complete reversal of the plan formula--so people lose \na big chunk of their expected benefits. This is how benefits are \naccrued under a cash balance plan versus a regular plan. Can you \nhonestly look at these rates of accrual and say that no one thought \nthat there might be a problem for older workers who get caught in the \nmiddle, here, and get the downside of both plans? They get the front \nend of a back-loaded plan, and the back end of a front-loaded plan. \nMaybe these CFOs are just really bad at math--went to Wharton Business \nSchool, but still can't add. I don't know.\n  Employers are claiming that these are great plans for workers. Sure, \nthey are better than plan termination. But, they turn traditional \npensions on their head, taking benefits from older workers and \nredirecting them to younger folks. Then they say these plans are so \nterrific for younger workers, but in reality 40 percent of people in \nthese plans never see any benefit at all because they didn't even work \nat a company long enough to vest.\n  This is, was, and always will be age discrimination. And it is \nsomething that Congress has never before acted to approve. After these \ninjustices were exposed in 1999, I introduced legislation to ban wear-\naway. While it did not pass, it raised the profile of this problem. \nThat September, the Treasury Department stopped issuing letters of \ndetermination stating that these plans meet some basic IRS standards \nout of concern over how workers were losing out in conversions.\n  In 2000, the Senate unanimously passed my sense of the Senate \nresolution saying that it is unfair for older workers to see the \nbenefits they have worked for eroded or worn-away in cash balance \nconversions. That sense of the Senate state that: ``For a number of \nyears after a conversion, the cash balance or other hybrid benefit \nformula may result in a period of ``wear away'' during which older and \nlonger-service participants earn no additional benefits.''\n  It said: ``Federal law should continue to prohibit pension plan \nparticipants from being discriminated against on the basis of age in \nthe provision of pension benefits.''\n  The Senate agreed, in 2000, that: ``It is the sense of the Senate \nthat the levels in this resolution assume that pension plan \nparticipants whose plans are changed to cause older or longer-service \nworkers to earn less retirement income, including conversions to ``cash \nbalance plans,'' should receive additional protection than what is \ncurrently provided, and Congress should act this year to address this \nimportant issue. In particular, at a minimum: (1) all pension plan \nparticipants should receive adequate, accurate, and timely notice of \nany change to a plan that will cause participants to earn less \nretirement income in the future; and (2) pension plans that are changed \nto a cash balance or other hybrid formula should not be permitted to \n``wear away'' participants'' benefits in such a manner that older and \nlonger-service participants earn no additional pension benefits for a \nperiod of time after the change.\n  In 2003, the House and Senate both passed an amendment to the \nTreasury-Transportation Appropriations measure to block Treasury from \npromulgating a proposed rule that would have blessed these plans, \nbecause they left room for age discrimination. That provision was \nchanged in conference to instead direct Treasury to propose legislation \nthat would help workers caught up in these conversions, and Treasury \ndid so. Treasury sent up a bill that said you can convert to a cash \nbalance plan, but only if you don't wear away currently accrued \nbenefits, and only if you allow people to accrue benefits in the old \nplan for 5 years after the conversion. Now this legislation did not go \nquite as far as my bill, but it did firmly state that wear away is \nunacceptable. It also acknowledged that these conversions result in a \nserious loss of expected benefits, and some transition period is \nnecessary to help older workers.\n  Prior to Treasury Secretary John Snow's confirmation vote, Senator \nDurbin and I asked him to come to the Senate and talk with us about his \nintentions on cash balance. He said that fairness and equity would \nguide the rule of law, and that he would work to protect the workers. \nAfter all, when he was CEO of CSX railroad, he put in a cash balance \nplan. But he gave everyone who worked there a choice between the old \nand new plans.\n  His proposed legislation was much fairer to workers than the \nregulation that had been proposed during the gap between Secretary \nO'Neill's tenure and Mr. Snow's nomination.\n  The HELP-Finance bill continues to uphold the principle that has long \nbeen supported here in Congress: Cash balance conversions should only \nbe allowed if they are done right, without allowing companies to gouge \nolder workers.\n  The bipartisan compromise in this bill guarantees this by prohibiting \nwear-away in future conversions. It requires employers to give older \nworkers a grace period during which they can continue to accrue \nbenefits in the old plan. It says that, because cash balance plans \nweren't in fact as portable as advertised, we need to make them vest \nfaster so that they actually do provide the benefits to younger workers \nthat have been advertised.\n  This compromise is very similar to the legislation proposed by the \nTreasury Department that I outlined above. It is the exact same \nlanguage as the Frist-Grassley-Baucus-Lott amendment in the Finance \nCommittee's pension markup. It is an excellent example of finding \ncommon ground, which is exactly what we should do on this issue. This \nis not a partisan issue. Retirement security matters to everyone. \nKeeping promises to workers is critical to our workplace climate. \nLikewise, it is important for workers to be loyal to their employers. \nPreserving this tradition is critical to maintaining a skilled, \nproductive workforce.\n  Turning to another issue, I am pleased that the managers of this bill \nhave decided not to accept any proposals that would amend the fiduciary \nstandards in ERISA to allow pensions to invest in riskier investments, \nand engender conflicts of interest for pension fund managers. These \nproposals will expose the retirement income of millions of pension plan \nparticipants and beneficiaries to the risk of loss from self-dealing, \nconflicts of interest and other abuses that have been prevented by \nERISA for the last 30 years. Under current regulations, if 25 percent \nor more of a hedge fund's assets come from employee benefit plans, \nincluding private-sector, public-sector and foreign benefit plans, the \ninvestment manager must comply with ERISA. The hedge fund industry \nwould like to weaken that standard greatly by no longer counting public \nand foreign plan assets and increasing the threshold to at least 50 \npercent--and as much as 75 percent in some cases.\n  Part of the reason Congress enacted ERISA in the first place were \nnumerous findings by Congress of pension fund mismanagement. We put \nfiduciary standards in place to prevent exactly these kinds of \nconflicts of interests and dangerous financial dealings. I can't \nunderstand why at a time when we clearly need to tighten those \nstandards how anyone could work to loosen them.\n  For too long, pension funds have been seen as a cash cow for CFOs to \nplay\n\n[[Page S12908]]\n\nwith to help bolster the bottom line. Questionable enough when times \nare good, these methods can be disastrous when investment schemes don't \npan out.\n  I would like to call my colleagues' attention to an excellent article \nin Congressional Quarterly from September 3, 2005. This article really \nlays out the basis for much of the so called ``perfect storm'' we are \nfacing today with pension funding. For the past few years, there have \nbeen numerous reports about money evaporating from pension plans. \nAccording to those reports, pension funds were being depleted through \nno fault of those who managed them, but simply because liabilities were \nincreasing exponentially because of the sinking 30-year Treasury rate \nand the drop in the stock market.\n  What these stories left out, however, is the fact that decisions made \nby pension managers contributed significantly to the problem. Beginning \nin the early 1990s, stocks began to make up a much bigger share of plan \nassets than they ever had in the past. Stocks went from making up 44 \npercent of pension plan investments in 1980 to 62 percent in 2004.\n  Why the shift? According to Bradley Belt at PBGC, interest rates in \nthe 90s were generating 25 percent to 30 percent returns to plans--in \nother words, investing in stocks were generating so much revenue that \non paper, these plans no longer looked like a cost to the company, but \ninstead appeared to be generating profits.\n  But as we all know, what goes up must often come down. This gamble \nwith the pension security of millions of Americans resulted in massive \nlosses when stocks fell. The PBGC is now in crisis in large measure \nbecause of these investment decisions--which is why we are here on the \nfloor trying to figure out how to shore it up.\n  Why do I bring this all up? Some of my colleagues are talking about \nmaking it even easier to invest in even riskier investment vehicles. \nThe irony of pushing a proposal backed by the hedge funds onto a bill \nto rescue a drowning PBGC and revive a struggling defined benefit \npension system is beyond comprehension.\n  This is absolutely not the time to weaken requirements on pension \nasset investments. It's no secret that we are in the position we are in \nbecause of lax standards in the past. Loosening them in the future will \nbe absolutely disastrous.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today, I come to the floor of the Senate \nto briefly state my thoughts about a component of the bill under \nconsideration, the Pension Security and Transparency Act of 2005. I \ncommend both the Senate Finance and HELP Committees for their hard \nwork, and tireless efforts to work towards a bill that we all can \nsupport.\n  A variety of Colorado companies, including Arch Coal, IBM, Gates \nRubber, and Qwest Communications, have been carefully following the \ndebate on pension reform. These companies are significant employers in \nColorado, and they contribute to the State's economy in countless \nmeasures. Many companies, including these, have been affected by the \nrecent court decision Cooper v. IBM, and in turn I have been paying \nparticular attention to the development and treatment of so-called \nhybrid pension plans. Hybrid pension plans, a combination of a defined \nbenefit and defined contribution, were ruled illegal by one judge, \nsaying that they were discriminatory based on age, since younger \nworkers had more time to accrue more value in their pension than older \nworkers. Since the court decision, IBM and many other companies with \nsimilar hybrid plans have been trying to interpret the court's ruling, \nand the future direction of their pension plans. These companies are \ntrying to do the right thing for their workers. Currently, they are \ncaught in a situation that does not give them any clear guidance or \ndirection on how to help their employees.\n  As this bill is currently written, it does not provide the necessary \nvalidation for the 1,700 existing hybrid pension plans and their 9 \nmillion participants and opens the door for more litigation for more \ncompanies. If new conversion mandates are put into place, many of these \nemployers may be forced to leave the defined pension system altogether, \npossibly reducing retirement security for workers. As everyone knows, \nthe defined benefit system is a voluntary system. When companies first \nstarted offering defined benefit plans for workers it was an excellent \nbenefit for workers and for their companies. However, now many \ncompanies are forced to give up offering defined benefit and the hybrid \npension plans because of the legal uncertainty.\n  While I commend Chairman Grassley and Chairman Enzi for working with \ntheir committees and reaching a compromise, I cannot help but point out \nthat this issue is not completely addressed in S. 1783. My hope is that \nonce this bill reaches the conference committee, hybrid pension plans \nwill be a point of focus. I would be happy to work with my colleagues \non this issue. It is important to Colorado, and important to many other \ncompanies nationwide.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the Senate is undertaking a long awaited \ndebate on the need to strengthen the private pension system. It is \nimperative that current and future retirees are assured that they will \nreceive the pension benefits they have been promised so they are able \nto enjoy a secure retirement.\n  I am deeply concerned about the growing economic insecurity of \ntoday's workers. Despite recent economic growth, a healthy jobs \nrecovery has yet to take hold, wages are failing to keep pace with \ninflation, income inequality is growing, employer-provided health \ninsurance coverage is falling, and private pensions are in jeopardy. \nIndeed, strong productivity growth has translated into higher profits \nfor businesses, but not more take home pay for average workers. The \nstagnation of earnings in the face of soaring prices for gasoline, home \nheating, food, and health care is squeezing the take home pay of \nworkers.\n  Any wage gains we have seen seem to be concentrated at the top of the \nearnings distribution, while the largest losses are at the bottom. Over \nthe past 4 years, average household income has fallen for all income \ngroups except a small slice at the very top of the distribution. Those \ndevelopments stand in sharp contrast to what happened in the 1990s, \nwhen wage and income gains were strong for all income and earnings \ngroups.\n  At the same time that earnings are stagnating, the average worker's \nretirement prospects are more uncertain than ever. Twenty years ago, \nmost workers with a pension plan could expect to receive a defined \nbenefit based on years of service and salary. Today, defined \ncontribution plans--which shift most of the investment risk and \nresponsibility onto workers--have become the dominant form of pension \ncoverage. As a result of this increased risk and responsibility, \naverage workers may end up with inadequate retirement savings.\n  Despite the shift away from traditional pensions, defined benefit \nplans remain a critical source of retirement support, with 44 million \nworkers and retirees relying on such plans as a source of stable \nretirement income. However, as we have seen by the recent pension \nterminations in the airline industry, the real risk of defined benefit \nplan defaults further exacerbates workers' uncertainty and concern \nabout their retirement prospects.\n  The Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation estimates that total \nunderfunding in PBGC-insured pension plans is about $450 billion, more \nthan $100 billion of which is in plans sponsored by financially weak \ncompanies and at reasonable risk of default.\n  And what of the status of PBGC itself, which serves as a backstop to \nthe defined benefit pension system? At the end of 2005, the PBGC \nreported a cumulative deficit of $22.8 billion in its single-employer \nprogram. That figure is a slight improvement from a year earlier, when \nthe shortfall was $23.3 billion which is the largest deficit in the \nprogram's 30-year history, and a sharp deterioration from only a few \nyears ago when the single-employer program was in surplus. The deficit \nis expected to get worse in 2006, as PBGC will account for additional \nliabilities that it has taken over for the new fiscal year resulting \nfrom a number of major airlines and manufacturing companies who have \ndefaulted on their pension obligations.\n  While the PBGC has sufficient assets to pay benefit obligations for a \nnumber of years, without changes in funding, the agency will eventually \nrun out of\n\n[[Page S12909]]\n\nmoney. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that PBGC's cumulative \ndeficit will increase to $87 billion over the next 10 years, and \nsuggests that there is a significant likelihood that all of PBGC's \nassets will be exhausted within the next 20 years.\n  The increased number of pension defaults means lost benefits for \nparticipants whose earned benefits exceed the statutory maximum benefit \nguarantee; premium increases for healthy plan sponsors remaining in the \nsystem; and ultimately the risk of a taxpayer bailout of the PBGC.\n  Clearly, the private pension funding system needs reform and the bill \nbefore us today, S. 1783, the Pension Security and Transparency Act of \n2005, is movement in the right direction. I know that Chairman Enzi, \nRanking Member Kennedy, Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Baucus, and \ntheir staffs worked long hours to get to this point.\n  The bill tightens the funding rules to ensure that defined benefit \nplans are adequately funded. Limiting the use of credit balances to \nprevent companies with unfunded plans from avoiding plan contributions \nand requiring an accurate accounting of each plan's true financial \ncondition are important steps.\n  But we must also avoid imposing unnecessarily burdensome funding \nrequirements on plan sponsors that are playing by the rules. An asset \nvaluation approach that doesn't allow for short-term fluctuations in \nthe stock market will only exacerbate the inherent volatility in \npension plan funding and increase funding burdens during economic \ndownturns when companies can least afford them.\n  The bill also requires truth-in-funding disclosures for companies \nwith underfunded pension plans so participants and other stakeholders \ncan learn the true financial condition of their pension plans, as well \nas the potential loss of benefits if the plan terminates. This is an \nespecially important safeguard for workers whose pension benefits \nexceed the PBGC's maximum benefit guarantee limit.\n  In order for the PBGC to remain a viable insurance program that \ncontinues to protect workers and retirees, its current funding gap must \nbe closed. Recognizing this, the bill increases PBGC premiums to $30, \nwhile ensuring that companies whose plans pose the greatest insurance \nrisk actually pay the additional premium for that risk.\n  S. 1783 would also prohibit companies from funding nonqualified plans \nunder certain circumstances, including bankruptcy, significant \nunderfunding of regular pension plans, or the termination of an \nunderfunded regular pension plan. This is a positive development in \naddressing inequities of what has become a two-tiered pension system. \nToo often, the executives of those companies that default on their \npension obligations escape with padded executive retirement packages \nwhile the average worker is left holding the bag. Companies that \nunderfund or default on their regular pension obligations should be \nprohibited from funding and paying out benefits from special executive \npension plans.\n  Finally, as new types of defined benefit plans evolve, we must ensure \nthat older workers are protected and don't lose the benefits they have \nbeen promised.\n  The Pension Security and Transparency Act makes positive strides \ntoward ensuring that workers will receive the full pension benefits \nthey have earned. While the bill reflects difficult compromises, it is \nimportant that we act now to preserve the financial health of defined \nbenefit pensions. I urge my colleagues to not stop here. We must \ncontinue work to improve our pensions system to ensure that Americans \nwho work their entire lives have the financial security they deserve \nand worked so hard for when they retire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we must get serious as a Congress and a \nnation about across-the-board retirement reform. It is time every \nAmerican worker has a sense of ownership over his or her retirement \nincome and the promises that have been made.\n  To do so requires valid information about the security of his or her \nfuture retirement income, and current and relevant information to be \nable to make smart choices when options are available.\n  Beneficiaries must be timely notified when their retirement income is \nin jeopardy; workers must be assured that the law doesn't allow and \neven encourage hollow promises. Employers and union leaders should be \nprohibited from offering rank-and-file members benefit increases that \ncannot be paid for, particularly when a company is below investment \ngrade.\n  The law must place a tangible price on all plan underfunding to limit \nthe moral hazard of shifting risk to beneficiaries, the PBGC, and other \ncompanies paying premiums. Accounting schemes that paper-over massive \nfunding shortfalls must be outlawed, and interest rate policies should \nbe straightforward to administer and consistent with each plan's \nliability payout schedule.\n  Continuing the underlying 30-year-old pension law is not an option. \nIt is a law without transparency where union bosses and irresponsible \nmanagement are allowed to go into back rooms and make promises they \nknow cannot be kept.\n  If we continue the status quo, we will move ever closer to the \nprecipice of the slippery slope to a taxpayer bailout of the pension \ninsurance system.\n  Those who make and then break their promises have now pushed us to \nthe edge of a raid on the U.S. Treasury.\n  The Budget Committee held a hearing back in June where we heard \ntestimony from the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, and the \nadministration that confirmed the Nation is already in the midst of a \nretirement crisis. I am not speaking of the crisis in Social Security \nbut of private pension plans and the program that insures benefits when \nsponsors default on their promises.\n  Since then, the CBO has prepared two additional reports analyzing the \ncurrent state of health of defined benefit pension plans and the \nPension Benefit Guaranty Corporation the Government insurance agency \nthat insures them. Employer groups, think tanks, and the financial \npress have also widely reported on the poor health of America's single \nemployer defined benefit pension system. The consensus is indisputable \nthat we have a crisis on our hands on our watch if you will.\n  The PBGC already has a serious deficit and a cash crisis looming with \na clock that will toll 20 or 30 years sooner than what we expect in the \nSocial Security system. While many criticized the PBGC over the last \nyear as being overly pessimistic in projecting a $23 billion deficit, \nwe learned just yesterday with their year end reporting that not only \nwas the PBGC surprisingly accurate--posting a deficit of $22.8 billion, \nif recent events that occurred right after the end of the fiscal year \nhad been included, the deficit in the single-employer program would \nhave been posted at $25.7 billion--a 10 percent increase.\n  Furthermore, because accounting standards require the PBGC to \ndisclose additional information on the change in its net position, we \nlearned that PBGC's exposure to losses from plans sponsored by weak \nemployers has risen to $108 billion from $96 billion just a year ago--\nthat is an increase of 13 percent in a year when sponsors would have \nhad us believe things are not as bad as they seem.\n  Just last year, there were 120 defaults requiring the PBGC to assume \nresponsibility for pension benefits of an additional 232,000 workers \nand retirees. In just 3 short years, the PBGC has taken on more \nworkers' retirement responsibilities than the previous 27 years \ncombined.\n  We are obviously in a crisis and something must be done. \nUnfortunately, the bill before us today is only a very modest and \nincomplete step toward addressing the issue.\n  With regard to the PBGC's health, modification to premium levels fall \n$1.7 billion short over 5 years from what was reported just last month \nby the HELP Committee in meeting its budget reconciliation instruction, \ncomparatively lowering the level of resources available to the PBGC to \ntake on the responsibilities of plan defaults.\n  With regard to the health of pension plans themselves, the \nadministration has analyzed the funding rules in the bill and reports \nthat its provisions do not improve the underlying funding requirements \nfor plan sponsors over current law.\n  With regard to innovative retirement programs offered by employers, I \ncontinue to have serious reservations about the measure before us today \nand\n\n[[Page S12910]]\n\nits failure to provide comprehensive clarification of the law \napplicable to cash balance and hybrid pension plans.\n  The Congress should be able to enact legislation stating \nunequivocally that providing interest on employees' pensions is an \nimportant benefit protection and is not and never has been age \ndiscriminatory, and that Federal law does not and never has required \nany type of pension plan to pay out lump sum benefits that are much \nlarger for younger employees than for identically situated older \nemployees.\n  At best, the bill half heartedly recognizes these principles only as \nto the future and then only subject to numerous qualifications and \nbenefit mandates--apparently trying to dance around the concerns of \nsome who would try to repeal laws of mathematics, specifically the \neffect of compound interest.\n  The failure to acknowledge the legitimate status of plans already in \nplace leaves companies that provided generous pension benefits to their \nemployees, many of them with favorable determination letters from the \nIRS, facing hundred of billions of dollars in potential liabilities and \ncontinues a legal landscape for frivolous lawsuits and attempts by the \nplaintiff bar to extract unreasonable settlement agreements.\n  The numerous qualifications and benefit mandates in the bill applying \nto hybrid plans are more likely to discourage employers from continuing \ninnovative pension plans. Indeed, the only parties that clearly benefit \nfrom these provisions as currently drafted are trial lawyers who will \ngladly file frivolous lawsuits and extract settlement agreements with \nno basis in underlying Federal law.\n  On the plus, side, the bill does improve transparency and more-timely \nnotification to participants regarding their retirement plan's health--\na significant step in moving toward making more information public and \nallowing the marketplace to more reliably take into account funding \ndecisions of plan sponsors.\n  Fortunately PBGC payments are generally not made on a lump sum basis \nunlike withdrawals on a savings & loan. Nevertheless, the pension \ninsurance fund will first run short on cash in just under 5 years. It \nwill take roughly another 15 years to liquidate its remaining assets to \npay claims but then all its resources are gone.\n  If Congress allows shortcomings in current law to remain, more \ndefined benefit pension plan terminations will happen, and millions of \nworkers will receive only a fraction of the retirement they were \npromised.\n  Consider that in 1986 there were over 170,000 defined benefit pension \nplans. That number has dropped to roughly 56,000. Just since 1999, \n7,500 defined benefit plans were terminated--a drop of 19 percent in \njust 3 years. Continuing a broken system and the uncertainty about \npromising opportunities to preserve creative defined benefit approaches \nto retirement plans such as cash balance plans will only increase this \ntrend.\n  Specifically, absent stronger funding rules, clarifying the \nlegitimacy of innovative plans, improved transparency and increased \npremiums, employers will have little incentive to restore faltering \npension plans to financial stability, and the PBGC deficit will \ncontinue to grow, posing an ever greater risk that taxpayers will be \nasked to step in and bail out the private defined benefit system long \nbefore social security goes in the red.\n  To be very clear, we are very close to the slippery slope of no \nreturn from a default crisis of a magnitude that cannot be handled \nalone by premium increases on employers to shore up the PBGC.\n  I am disappointed that the measure we have before us today does not \nsolve the defined benefit pension crisis and at best only postpones a \npolitical fight about the advisability of a taxpayer bailout of pension \npromises made by American companies to American workers. But we must \nmove the legislative process forward.\n  If Congress doesn't act, the PBGC will need to charge even higher \npremiums for companies that remain in the system, significant economic \nlosses affecting beneficiaries and investors will result, and pressure \nfor a taxpayer bailout will be seen as a commonplace solution to the \ncrisis, resulting in the likely demise of defined benefit pension plans \naltogether.\n  While I commend the chairman and ranking member for a significant \namount of hard work and progress on these challenging issues, there are \nstill important areas that I believe require a great deal of work. I \nstrongly encourage the chairman to ensure that the shortcomings in this \nbill that I have identified today be corrected as it moves through the \nremainder of the legislative process.\n  An incomplete fix to these issues will have a devastating effect on \ncompanies, current workers, and retirees. I understand that this bill \nis a work in progress and my concerns will continue to be addressed as \nthis legislation proceeds through the legislative process. For the \nretirement security of millions of American workers and taxpayers, I \nhope so.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today we are debating the Pension Security \nand Transparency Act of 2005 which is the culmination of the efforts of \nthe Finance Committee and Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee to improve the funding of both single and multiemployer \ndefined benefit plans. I commend Senators Grassley, Baucus, Enzi, and \nKennedy for their efforts in reaching bipartisan compromise \nlegislation. We all agree that defined benefit plans are underfunded \nand that this issue needs to be addressed.\n  At the end of fiscal year 2005, the Pension Benefit Guarantee \nCorporation had $22.8 billion in underfunding in its single employer \nprogram. The PBGC's liabilities for fiscal year 2006 are expected to be \nmuch higher. If other liabilities that the PBGC assumed after the end \nof the fiscal year were counted, the 2005 deficit would have been $25.7 \nbillion.\n  We cannot allow the underfunding of pensions to continue. This \nlegislation takes the right approach by striking the appropriate \nbalance. We want to protect employees, but we do not want to make \ndefined benefit plans so restrictive that employers will not offer \nthem.\n  The focus of the Pension Security and Transparency Act is to improve \nthe funding of pension plans and to provide more disclosure, but this \nlegislation does address other important pension issues. The Senate \nFinance Committee has reported out pension legislation in past \nCongresses that was not addressed by the full Senate. The first \nreiteration of Senate Finance pension legislation focused on defined \ncontribution issues that arose in light of the collapse of Enron. Along \nwith Senator Snowe, I introduced legislation which strengthened defined \ncontribution plans by requiring diversification and disclosure. Many of \nthe provisions from this bill were incorporated into the Finance bill.\n  Even though the collapse of Enron is behind us, the lessons learned \nremain. It is important for defined contribution plans to be required \nto allow workers to diversify their contributions out of employer \nstock. The rank and file employees of Enron do not want anyone else to \nhave the same experience that they had. These provisions are overdue.\n  Other lessons can be learned from the Enron debacle. Back in 2001, we \nwere all repulsed by the stories of corporate greed and how executives \ncrafted elaborate schemes to falsify the true financial status of the \ncompanies. Enron reminded us about the problems with excessive \nexecutive compensation.\n  Unfortunately, excessive executive compensation remains an issue \ntoday. Due to the work of the Finance Committee on executive \ncompensation an end has been put to some abusive practices, but some \nstill remain. One in particular that I find troubling is the funding of \nnonqualified deferred executive compensation prior to the funding of \nthe corporation's pension plan.\n  In recent years, a number of large companies set aside millions of \ndollars to fund the pensions of top executives, but they do not bother \nto fund their pension plans. Companies that chose to do this were not \nviolating laws by doing so, but this legislation will change this. \nUnder this legislation, for the first time the funding of nonqualified \ndeferred executive compensation will be linked to the funding of \npension plans.\n\n  Executives of financially weak companies will no longer be able to \ntake care of themselves. We repeatedly hear about executives that \nnegotiate deferred compensation to ensure that\n\n[[Page S12911]]\n\nthey have a lucrative nest egg, even if the company is struggling or \nabout to go bankrupt. We cannot stand for this any longer.\n  This legislation includes a provision which I worked to have included \nin the Finance Committee bill. Financially weak companies will no \nlonger be able to fund executive compensation unless their pension plan \nis 80 percent funded. Initially, the Finance Committee restricted the \nfunding of deferred executive compensation for companies with plans \nthat are funded at 60 percent or less. I thought 60 percent was too low \nbecause a plan is already in trouble at this point. In addition, no \nbenefit increases will be allowed if a plan is funded at 80 percent or \nless. There is no valid reason why deferred executive compensation \nshould be funded if a pension plan is funded at a level at which \nbenefit increases are restricted.\n  Employers have a responsibility to fund pension plans. They should \nnot make promises to their employees and fail to keep them, while they \nare taking care of their own retirement.\n  The bill before us today does the right thing by restricting the \nfunding of deferred executive compensation for financially weak \ncompanies that have pension plans funded at 80 percent or less and for \nall companies that have pension plans funded at 60 percent or less.\n  In June, the PGBC released data on the underfunding of pension plans \nwith more than $50 million in unfunded pension liabilities. This data \nshows that these plans have an average underfunded ratio of 69 percent. \nBack in 2000, the average funding ratio was 82.8 percent.\n  While pension funding has been on the decline, deferred executive \ncompensation is increasing. We need to send a message to corporate \nexecutives that they need to fund the pension plans of their workers \nbefore they reward themselves with extremely generous benefits for \nlife. I see this not as punitive, but as meeting our responsibility to \ndemand better performance from the executives who can do the most to \nput pension funding on track. Ultimately, this proposal will protect \nthe taxpayer.\n  The Pension Security and Transparency Act of 2005 includes provisions \nwhich make slight modifications to the funding rules for interstate bus \ncompanies. I worked to have these provisions included in the Finance \nCommittee bill. These provisions address a unique situation in which \nthe average age of the participant of the plan is much older than \nparticipants in other plans. Congress has addressed this issue before \non a temporary basis and the provision in the chairman's modifications \nwould make this relief permanent. It will help retirees in my home \nstate of Massachusetts, and it is an equitable outcome.\n  Not only does this legislation address single employer plans, it \nstrengthens multiemployer plans. The Pension Security and Transparency \nAct of 2005 includes important provisions which strengthen the funding \nrules for multiemployer pension plans. Multiemployer pension plans play \na vital role in our pension system. Multiemployer pension plans are \ncollectively bargained arrangements between a labor union and a group \nof employers in a particular trade or industry. These plans provide a \nway for workers in industries where job changes are frequent to save \nfor retirement. Pension coverage continues when an employee changes \njobs if the new employer is with a participating employer.\n\n  The Pension Security and Transparency Act would require troubled \nplans to improve their finance condition and severely underfunded \npension plans would be required to adopt a ten-year rehabilitation \nplan. This legislation requires the Secretary of the Treasury, and the \nExecutive Director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to issue \na study on the state of multiemployer funding in five years.\n  I proposed an amendment which was added to the bill. This provision \nrequires the study to look at the effects that the new funding rules \nhave on small employers and other issues that they face, including the \nimpact of withdrawal liability. Employers that wish to discontinue \ntheir cosponsorship of a multi employer plan are required to pay a \nwithdrawl liability, which represents the sponsors' pro rata share of \nthe plan's underfunded liabilities.\n  Recently, I heard from a small business owner in Massachusetts who \ncontributes to a multiemployer plan and he explained how his withdrawal \nliability has increased rapidly over the last five years. Some of this \nis due to corrections in the stock market, but part of it is due to a \ndecrease in companies paying into plans. This small business described \nwithdrawal liability as a ``vicious death spiral''--as more companies \ngo out of business or otherwise withdraw from the pension fund, \nwithdrawal for the remaining employers rise.\n  This provision would require the impact of withdrawal liability on \nthe financial status of small employers to be studied. In addition, the \nstudy would look at the role of the multi employer pension plan system \nin helping small employers to offer pension benefits.\n  The multiemployer pension system serves an important role in our \npension system and we do not want to make these plans a burden for \nsmall businesses. If withdrawal liability continues its vicious spiral, \nit will be difficult for multi employer plans to attract new employers \nand existing employers could be faced with a situation in which their \nwithdrawal liability exceeds their assets.\n  In addition, the Pension Security and Transparency Act would \nincorporate provisions from the Save More for Retirement Act of 2005 \nwhich I have cosponsored. These provisions will encourage workers to \nparticipate in retirement plans by providing innovative incentives for \nemployers to modify their existing plans to add provisions that will \nincrease savings. Employers will be able to automatically enroll their \nemployees in 401(k)s upon being hired unless the employee notifies the \nemployer that he or she does not want to participate. Studies have \nshown that this simple change will dramatically increase participation \nrates. This is a simple improvement that should increase our \ndrastically low national savings rate.\n  We might not all agree with every single provision in this bill, but \noverall it reflects a balanced approach to a problem that needs to be \naddressed. Plans need to be adequately funded. The rules cannot be \ndraconian and lead to the termination of pension plans by employers.\n  Pensions are a central part of our retirement system and we need to \nensure continued participation by employers. Retirement is based on \nthree components: personal savings, employer provided pensions, and \nSocial Security. All three components are necessary for a sound \nretirement system that is able to provide for most of America's retired \nworkers.\n  Our current pension laws are inadequate. Employers have not properly \nfunded their pension plans, workers have been promised more than their \npension plans can possibly 3 deliver, and the PBGC can not be expected \nto cover the difference. At the same time, the financial burden of \nemployer-provided pensions is real, and it threatens some of our major \ncompanies and the jobs they provide today.\n  This issue is not going away. The PBGC estimates that its shortfall \ncould approach $100 billion dollars based on the underfunding of plans \nwhich have been classified as reasonably possible of termination.\n  We should avoid a subsidy or bailout with general revenues. The PBGC \noperates with no taxpayer assistance today and it was designed to be \nfinancially independent of the Federal Government. We should maintain \nthat.\n  Passing the Pension Security and Transparency Act of 2005 is a step \nin the right direction to preserving our defined benefit pension \nsystem.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I commend my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle for crafting this comprehensive pension reform measure to \nstrengthen the defined benefit pension system and ensure the solvency \nof the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.\n  One provision that I am pleased we were able to find bipartisan \nagreement on and include in S. 1783 is language that recognizes the \nspecial nature of multiple-employer defined benefit plans. These \nmultiple-employer plans are sponsored by rural electric, rural \ntelephone, and agriculture-related cooperatives. Nationwide, more than \n1,700 cooperatives participate in a multiple-employer plan, providing \nbenefits for over 109,000 workers and retirees. In\n\n[[Page S12912]]\n\nKansas, more than 160 cooperatives will benefit from the multiple-\nemployer provisions in this bill.\n  These cooperatives are not-for-profit, and provide at-cost services \nto their consumer owners. Multiple-employer defined benefit plans allow \ncooperatives to pool experience and expenses by maintaining a single \nplan as opposed to single-employer defined benefit plans that cover \njust one company's employees.\n  For companies that sponsor a single-employer plan, if that company \ngoes out of business, the pension plan terminates, and if underfunded, \ncreates risk to the PBGC. Multiple-employer cooperative plans are \ndifferent because the pension plan continues to operate even if some \ncooperatives go out of business. Most importantly, no liabilities shift \nto the PBGC. These cooperative plans are ongoing plans that can outlive \nmany of their participating employers, and are treated as such under \nthis bill.\n  The Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, of which I am a \nmember, and the Finance Committee, both recognized the special nature \nof multiple-employer plans, and their lack of risk to the PBGC, in \ntheir respective pension bills. During consideration of the HELP \nCommittee's pension bill, the Defined Benefit Security Act, an \namendment I offered to clarify the treatment of multiple-employer \ncooperatives was approved by unanimous consent. The Finance Committee \nadopted a different approach to recognize the unique nature of \nmultiple-employer plans.\n  As the committees worked to bring a bill to the Senate floor, I, \nalong with several of my colleagues, shared our concerns about the need \nto include multiple-employer cooperative language in a final bill in a \nletter to the chairmen and ranking members of the HELP and Finance \nCommittees.\n  While different from the provisions of both the HELP and Finance \nCommittee bills, the multiple-employer provisions in S. 1783 achieve \ntheir goal. S. 1783 provides a 10-year delayed effective date for these \nrural cooperative plans, continues to exempt these plans from the \nbill's at-risk rules, and provides special funding and premium rules \nduring this 10-year period. With regard to funding, these plans will \nuse the four year weighted average of the third segment rate of the \ncorporate bond yield curve created in this bill. For purposes of the \npremium rules, these plans will use a spot version of the third segment \nrate.\n  Mr. President, I urge the inclusion of the multiple-employer rural \ncooperative provisions contained in S. 1783 when a final pension reform \nbill is sent to the President for his signature. These provisions have \nbipartisan support, recognize the special nature of rural cooperatives, \nand provide an important benefit for over 109,000 employees and \nretirees across the country.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the letter to which I referred in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 23, 2005.\n     Hon. Michael B. Enzi, Chairman,\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy, Ranking Member,\n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, Russell \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley, Chairman,\n     Hon. Max Baucus, Ranking Member,\n     Committee on Finance, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Enzi, Chairman Grassley, Senator Kennedy and \n     Senator Baucus: We write to urge you to continue recognizing \n     the special nature of rural cooperative ``multiple-employer'' \n     defined benefit plans sponsored by the National Rural \n     Electric Cooperative Association, the National \n     Telecommunications Cooperative Association and the United \n     Benefits Group (agriculture-related cooperatives), as you \n     work toward an agreement on comprehensive pension reform. By \n     design, these rural cooperative plans are different because \n     they would continue to operate even if some cooperatives go \n     out of business. Most importantly, no liabilities shift to \n     the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC).\n       Both the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee \n     and the Finance Committee have recognized the special nature \n     of ``multiple-employer'' defined benefit plans of these rural \n     cooperatives. We believe that any bill sent to the floor for \n     consideration should include both Committees' provisions.\n       These rural cooperatives are not-for-profit, and provide \n     at-cost services to their consumer-owners. Their defined-\n     benefit plans permit them to pool experience and expenses by \n     maintaining a single plan for hundreds of employers, as \n     opposed to single-employer plans that cover only one \n     company's employees. We have concerns that unless these \n     specific cooperative provisions are included, these entities \n     may be forced to either reduce benefits to their employees or \n     pass along substantially increased costs to their member-\n     owners.\n       For companies that sponsor a single-employer plan, if that \n     company goes out of business, the pension plan terminates, \n     and if underfunded, creates risk to the PBGC. Again, these \n     rural cooperative plans are different because the pension \n     plan continues to operate even if some were to go out of \n     business, and no liabilities shift to the PBGC. In fact, none \n     of the liabilities of these rural cooperative ``multiple-\n     employer'' plans have ever been shifted to the PBGC.\n       These rural cooperative plans are ongoing plans that can \n     outlive many of their participating employers, and they \n     should be treated as such under any bill that goes to the \n     floor. Again, we urge you to include both Committees' \n     provisions in any bill sent to the floor to recognize the \n     special nature of rural cooperative plans, their ongoing \n     nature, and their lack of risk to the PBGC.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this request.\n           Sincerely,\n         Pat Roberts, Lamar Alexander, Johnny Isakson, Gordon \n           Smith, Craig Thomas, Tom Harkin, Jeff Bingaman, Ron \n           Wyden, Tim Johnson, John Thune.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the issues addressed in this pension bill \nare complex. We are treading into a swamp of technical terms and \ncomplicated plans. But the core issues are simple matters of fairness. \nWill retirees receive the benefits they were promised? And will the \ncompanies who are trying to do right by their workers be encouraged \nrather than unfairly penalized?\n  About half of all private sector workers participate in one of two \ngeneral types of employer-sponsored retirement plans: a defined-\ncontribution plan or a defined-benefit plan.\n  Defined-contribution plans, such as a 401(k) plan, are much like \nindividual savings accounts into which employers and employees \ncontribute. These funds are then usually invested into stocks and bonds \nwith the hope that the investment will grow as the worker approaches \nretirement. When the worker does retire, the balance of the account is \navailable for him or her to withdraw.\n  Defined-benefit pensions, by contrast, guarantee an employee a \ncertain amount of retirement benefits, typically based on years of \nservice and salary level. To pay these promised benefits, the employer \nsets aside money in a combined pension fund, which is then invested. \nThe employer decides how that fund is invested and retains control over \nthe funds until dispersed to the retirees.\n  It is this second category, defined-benefit pensions, that are facing \na crisis today. Due to swings in the stock market, complex funding \nrules, changes in the business climate, or unforeseen developments, \ncompanies' defined-benefit pension plans are underfunded. Some \ncompanies have declared bankruptcy to get out of their pension \nobligations, and there is reason to worry that this disturbing trend \nwill continue.\n  When a company sloughs off its pension obligations in bankruptcy, the \nFederal pension insurance agency, the Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation PBGC, steps in to ensure retirees receive benefits, up to a \nmaximum of about $46,000 per year for employees who retire at age 65. \nThe PBGC is self-funded through insurance premiums and fees paid by \ncompanies with defined-benefit plans. With the PBGC taking on more \ncompanies' pension obligations, however, there is less money coming \ninto the PBGC and more money going out. The PBGC announced just \nyesterday that it is running a deficit of $22.8 billion.\n  Ultimately, if the long-term health of the PBGC continues to decline, \nmany people are concerned that only a taxpayer-financed bailout would \nallow retirees to receive the benefits they were promised.\n  We need to strengthen the defined-benefit system so that that does \nnot happen. We must encourage the recovery, rather than the \ntermination, of underfunded and vulnerable pension plans. If we can \nshore up these plans without doing undue harm to the companies, the \nconcerns about PBGC's fiscal problems will be addressed.\n  To do so, companies should be required to adequately back up the \npromises they have made to their workers. And changes in Federal \npension policy should help them. For example, we need to reduce \nuncertainties for employers making a good faith effort to\n\n[[Page S12913]]\n\nmeet their obligations. We also need to ensure that we do not give \nincentives to employers who offer hybrid pension plans to either \njettison their retirement plans entirely or offer only defined-\ncontribution plans.\n  In this way, I believe it is possible to improve retirement security \nwhile also reducing the long-term exposure of the PBGC.\n  However, I have serious concerns that the bill before us today will \ndo some significant harm in the effort to do positive things.\n  One provision of particular concern would require the pension plans \nof companies with plans that are less than 93 percent funded who also \nhave declining credit ratings to be considered ``at-risk.'' Once \nconsidered ``at- risk,'' companies must use different actuarial \nassumptions that require them to sock away significantly more money \ninto their pension trusts. That provision alone could require companies \nto put unnecessarily high amounts of additional dollars into their \npension plans. These are dollars that could otherwise be used to boost \nresearch and development or doing other activities that could create \njobs.\n  Another provision of concern deals with an actuarial method known as \n``smoothing.'' Under current law, how much money companies have to put \ninto their plans is determined by using a 4-year weighted average of \nthe values of pension assets and/or liabilities. It is generally \nrecognized that 4-year smoothing has led plans to become underfunded by \nmasking the diminished current fair market value of a plan's assets.\n  The original bill from the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee would have shortened smoothing to 3 years. The House Ways and \nMeans Committee and House Education and Workforce Committee bills also \nallow 3 years. The HELP/Finance Committee compromise, however, takes a \n12-month average. Three years is a fair approach that would tighten \ncurrent law but still allow some necessary cushion against volatility \nfor employers; twelve months would significantly increase the \nvolatility and unpredictability for employers. This shorter time frame \nwould unwisely add significant volatility for companies when they are \ndetermining how much money they need to set aside for the pension \nplans.\n  For months, Senators Mikulski and DeWine have been urging an \namendment that would have addressed these two problems. The amendment \nthey wanted to offer, which I co-sponsored, would have adopted the HELP \nCommittee's 3-year position on smoothing. Their amendment also would \nhave replaced the use of credit ratings in determining whether a \ncompany has to abide by ``at-risk'' funding requirements and would \ninstead measure ``at-risk'' by how well-funded the pension plan is.\n  I am disappointed that we were not able to vote on the DeWine-\nMikulski amendment. I am hopeful, however, that these problems with the \nSenate bill will be adequately addressed in conference. I hope the \nconferees will come back with what the House committees adopted on \nthose issues.\n  I am also concerned about the overall effect that the bill will have \non the defined-benefit plan system. Some of the actuarial changes that \nmay be appropriate on their own may become problematic when packaged \ntogether. The changes required by this bill would require companies to \nfund their long-term pension obligations somewhat too quickly, and \nwould make the amounts of their required contributions fluctuate \nunpredictably. The short-term financial impact might push companies \nwith underfunded plans to terminate the plans, rather than working to \nbring their funding levels up. A survey of chief investment officers \nfor large pension plans found that 60 percent thought significant and \nrapid changes, such as those in the House or Senate bills, would lead \nto benefit reductions or plan termination.\n  I also hope that in the final conference report the Senate's position \non credit balances prevails over the unwise House provision. The House \nbill would penalize companies that prefunded their plans, by making \nadditional, non-required contributions, to subtract these prefunded \namounts from the calculations of their plans' assets. This change would \ntrigger unfair financial penalties for the companies and would deter \nfuture prefunding, which we should encourage, not discourage.\n  On a positive note, I am pleased that this bill will give airlines \nextra time to fund their plans. In the wake of Northwest and Delta \nairlines declaring bankruptcy, Congress must help companies do the \nright thing and keep their plans when they emerge from bankruptcy, \nrather than turning their obligations over to the PBGC.\n  Also, I am pleased that Senator Stabenow's work to address problems \nwith the multiemployer pension plan system is reflected in this bill. \nThese multiemployer plans provide millions of employees of small firms \nwith the opportunity to be covered by a defined benefit plan.\n  Finally, I am pleased that this bill protects older workers in cash \nbalance plan conversions, and that it gives guidance regarding some of \nthe uncertainties surrounding hybrid plans. Legal questions surrounding \nhybrids like cash balance and pension equity plans should not stand in \nthe way of companies offering the best pension plans that they can.\n  Pension reform is a critical issue for Michigan. Michigan's \nmanufacturing workers have always planned for the future by forgoing \nsome short-term wages in order to provide for themselves and their \nfamilies when they are no longer working. Likewise, those in other \nindustries, including employees of Northwest Airlines, also rely on \ndefined-benefit pension plans.\n  The retirement security of Michigan workers and workers across the \ncountry would be significantly weakened if we drive guaranteed benefit \npension plans out of business, and that is what I am concerned that \nthis bill could do. I will vote no on this bill, because on balance it \ndoes not ensure that companies striving to do the right thing are not \nunfairly penalized and because workers in those companies must also \nreceive the retirement benefits they were promised. I truly hope the \nfinal bill reported by the conference committee will repair the defects \nI have identified.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the calculation of lump sum distributions \nhas been hotly debated. Some have been worried that the bill would \nshortchange participants in their lump-sum distributions. That is not \nthe case. In fact, this bill has been very careful to avoid the \nproblems that occurred after the enactment of the pension reforms on \nthe GATT in 1994.\n  Under S. 1783, it is intended that plans may use different \nassumptions--that is, interest rates and or mortality tables--to \ndetermine lump sum distribution amounts so long as the plan provides \nthat a participant's lump sum distribution amount is no less than the \npresent value determined in accordance with the requirements of the \nbill.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the pension reform \nlegislation we have been working on for months. Many have said that the \npolicy goal of any major reform to the current pension system is to \nensure that the defined benefit system remains a viable option for \ncompanies and that employers keep the retirement promises they have \nmade to their employees. In these discussions, one often hears about \nthe proposed new rules and mandates concerning funding rules or asset \nand liability valuations. Given that the pension statute has not \nreceived a major overhaul since the 1970s, new rules are certainly \nnecessary to ensure that past and present employees and the American \ntaxpayer are protected from financial loss.\n  Nevertheless, what is often left unsaid in our discussions is the \nfact that the defined benefit system is a voluntary, not a mandatory, \nsystem. While rules and mandates exist for companies that choose to \nparticipate in the defined benefit system, no such rules or mandates \nexist requiring companies to participate. Thus, if strengthening the \ndefined benefit system is the basic premise behind this proposed \nlegislation, it is critical that we ask ourselves if the proposed rules \nand mandates might have the unintended consequence of driving companies \nout of the voluntary defined benefit system once and for all.\n  Alternatives to the voluntary defined benefit system do exist. For \nmany companies and employees, they are good alternatives, such as the \ndefined contribution system and its 401(k)s. However, the personal \nsavings rate of\n\n[[Page S12914]]\n\nAmericans remains one of the lowest among the industrialized nations, \nand the average balances in 401(k) accounts are quite modest. There is \nno question that without defined benefit plans, fewer Americans would \nbe able to retire comfortably. Further, the disappearance of defined \nbenefit plans, including hybrid defined benefit plans, could very well \nresult in increased pressure on Federal entitlement and income \nmaintenance programs, not to mention an increase in old-age poverty.\n  Given these troubling facts, the value of defined benefit plans to \nmany American families is clear. Sadly, we have seen a decline in \ndefined benefit plan sponsorship, and these are perilous times for the \ndefined benefit system. Employers are leaving the system for many \nreasons. Among these are uncertainty about how future pension \nliabilities will be measured, new pension funding rules that are \ncomplicated and unpredictable, the worry over new and more onerous \npension funding and premium requirements, upcoming changes to the \npension accounting rules, and, of course, legal questions regarding \nhybrid pension plans.\n  I appreciate the efforts of my Senate colleagues to craft meaningful \ndefined benefit pension reform legislation. The proposed legislation, \nhowever, will have the unintended consequence of driving away company \nafter company from the defined benefit system and further exacerbate \nthe looming deficit of the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, PBGC, \nthereby passing an unnecessary financial risk on to the American \ntaxpayer. Rather than strengthening the defined benefit system, this \nproposed legislation contains elements that could negatively affect the \nretirement security of the current 44 million participants in defined \nbenefit plans. Further, workers coming behind them are at risk if the \nlegislation is not done in a way that encourages plan sponsors to stay \nin the voluntary defined benefit plan system. I wish to highlight a few \nof the provisions contained in the proposed legislation I believe will \nlead employers to opt out of the voluntary defined benefit system.\n  To plan business investment and operations, employers must be able to \nanticipate required pension contributions several years into the \nfuture. Required contributions cannot be too volatile; otherwise, they \nwill be too difficult to accommodate in cash flow operations of the \nbusiness. To determine the amount of money an employer must contribute \nto its pension plan, assets in the plan are compared to the liabilities \nof the plan. Under the bill, plans would determine the amount of their \nfunding liability using an interest rate averaged over only a 12-month \nperiod and asset values also averaged over just a 12-month period. This \nwill make it very difficult for businesses to plan and will force them \nto set aside assets in the event they are needed for liabilities due to \nspikes in interest rates. The alternative is to force companies to \nshift assets out of the equity markets and into fixed income markets \nwhich could hike costs and discourage plan sponsorship. This is bad \npolicy.\n  The proposed legislation also sets a new target liability--100 \npercent of liabilities promised under the plan. This is a significant \nincrease from the current law target--90 percent. If companies must \nmeet this new target too quickly, sharp upticks in contributions may be \nrequired for many companies that are currently considered well-funded. \nBecause the new interest rates will adjust liabilities for some \ncompanies, companies that are currently at their maximum funding level \ncould be facing very large contributions. Since obligations are due \nover a very long period in many instances, these contributions will be \nunnecessary. Pensions could be frozen, other benefits could be frozen, \ncosts of goods and services could increase, and jobs could be lost as a \nresult. The 3-year phase-in of the new target is insufficient to avoid \nharmful consequences to American workers and the economy.\n  Another very troubling provision of the proposed legislation relates \nto credit ratings. A company's credit rating, determined by private \nratings agencies and not the Federal Government, should not determine a \npension plan's liability. The credit rating of a company does not \ndetermine the funded status of a plan. A company can have a below \ninvestment grade credit rating and pose absolutely no risk to the PBGC. \nIt serves no policy goal to impose new liabilities on a company because \nit is financially weak. That will simply make it more difficult for a \ncompany to recover, leading to potentially lower credit ratings, and \ncould result in death-spirals and plan terminations that the \nlegislation seeks to avoid. Furthermore, the credit rating provision \nwould introduce a whole new concept--credit rating of private companies \nby the Government. If an at-risk liability is to be imposed, it should \nbe based solely on the funded status of the plan.\n  A final concern I wish to raise relates to one of the most urgent \ncrises in retirement security--clarifying the outstanding issues \nregarding hybrid pension plans. Hybrid defined benefit pension plans \nsuch as cash balance and pension equity plans were developed to meet \nthe needs of our highly mobile workforce by combining the features of \nboth traditional defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans, \nsuch as 401(k) and other individual account plans. Traditional defined \nbenefit plans are most effective for employees with long careers with \nonly one employer. Yet, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, \nvery few employees are spending a full career with just one company. \nToday's workers need a pension benefit that is portable and that will \nproduce meaningful benefits, even if they don't stay with one employer \nfor their entire career. In light of these facts, nearly 30 percent of \nthe Nation's largest companies with defined benefit plans have moved to \na cash balance or other hybrid plan design. As of 2003, the PBGC \nreported that there are estimated to be between 1,200 and 1,500 of \nthese plans providing benefits to around 8 million Americans and their \nfamilies.\n  Employees know that cash balance and other hybrid plans contain many \nof the positive features of traditional defined benefit plans such as \nthe safety of an employer-funded, PBGC-insured benefit where the \ncompany bears the risk of the investment, while at the same time \nproviding defined contribution plan features such as individual account \nbalances, portability, and a more even benefit accrual pattern. Many \npeople who criticize hybrid plans do not realize that they are defined \nbenefit plans, and as such, they provide a tremendous benefit to \nAmericans, helping them achieve better retirement security.\n\n  Hybrid plans also provide greater benefits than traditional pensions \nfor the majority of employees. This is because hybrid plans accrue \nbenefits ratably, rather than toward the end of a long career, which is \ntypical in a traditional pension plan design. For the minority of \nworkers for whom a conversion from a traditional defined benefit plan \nto a hybrid plan design may result in future benefits that could be \nless generous than under the old plan, employers have employed a \nvariety of transition assistance techniques to boost their benefit \nformulas. And of course, benefits earned by employees for service they \nhave already put in are fully protected under the law.\n  Despite the value that hybrid plans provide to workers, current legal \nrisks threaten their continued existence. One court case has placed all \nhybrid pension plans, both cash balance and pension equity plans, into \ndoubt. Three other courts have found to the contrary, that hybrid \npension plans do not violate the age act and are permissible under law. \nYet it is this one single decision on which opponents of the hybrid \npension plan hang their arguments. To preserve the retirement security \nof millions of Americans, it is essential that Congress comprehensively \nclarify for existing and future plans that the design of hybrid plans \nis not age discriminatory.\n  In Cooper v. IBM--274 F. Supp. 2d 1010, S.D. Ill. 2003--a District \nCourt judge held, in the face of legal authority to the contrary, that \ncash balance and pension equity plans are age discriminatory. This \ndecision was based on the fact that younger workers have more time to \nearn compound interest on their pension benefit than older workers. \nCompound interest is a feature of all defined contribution plans and of \nall savings plans. The logic behind declaring compound interest age \ndiscriminatory in defined benefit plans is seriously faulty and would \nnullify many longstanding defined benefit pension plan designs, \nincluding contributory defined benefit plans common in\n\n[[Page S12915]]\n\nthe Federal, State, and local government sectors.\n  As a result of the Cooper decision, every hybrid pension plan sponsor \ntoday finds itself in potential financial and legal jeopardy. It is a \npity that we have come to this state. I say this because policymakers \nshould be working to create an environment that promotes hybrid plans--\nnot subjects them to greater risk. I had hoped that Congress would have \nresponded to the Cooper case by providing legislative certainty and \nclarity for hybrid pension plans, both retrospectively and \nprospectively, to prevent widespread abandonment of these programs by \nemployers.\n  I do not want my colleagues to think that I have not heard the \ncritics of hybrid plans. I have. However, I believe that the majority \nof the criticisms of the plans are unfair. Let me review some of these \ncriticisms and rebut them.\n  Some critics of hybrid plans have claimed that the plans are \ndiscriminatory on the basis of age. It is true that there has been one \nsingle court case that found that compound interest is age \ndiscriminatory in the hybrid plan context. As I said, three other \ncourts have found to the contrary, yet critics give credence to this \nodd case. Hybrid plans provide the same or greater wage and interest \ncredits for older participants than for young participants. Because \nolder workers under these plans are treated the same as or better than \nsimilarly situated younger workers, the plans cannot possibly be in \nviolation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, ADEA.\n  Others have criticized the ``wear away'' or benefit plateau that \noccurs in some hybrid plans. This has generated numerous questions and \nconcerns through the congressional review of the hybrid plan issue. It \nis important to understand that parallel rules in ERISA and the \nInternal Revenue Code protect all benefits that an employee has already \nearned for service, to date. Thus, despite assertions to the contrary, \nexisting benefits are not reduced in a hybrid conversion. ``Wear away'' \nis the term used for the benefit plateau effect that some employees can \nexperience in conjunction with a cash balance conversion.\n  Still others criticize hybrid plan conversions because they \nfrequently eliminate an early retirement subsidy, although they do so \nonly prospectively. Some have complained about allowing employers to \neliminate any benefits in their retirement plans. My own feeling is \nthat employers must be able to maintain their flexibility to eliminate \nearly retirement subsidies, but only on a prospective basis, as is the \ncase under current law.\n  Early retirement subsidies are a better alternative to layoffs in \nmany workplaces and they can help a company to manage its workforce. On \nthe other hand, if an employer's right to eliminate early retirement \nsubsidies on a prospective basis is not protected, no employer would \never adopt such an early retirement program in the first place. It \nmakes no sense for employers to encourage highly productive workers to \ntake retirement in their fifties by paying a premium for them to leave \nthe workforce. While current law protects any subsidy that employees \nhave already earned for their service to date, it allows employers to \nremove those incentives from their plans going forward.\n  The conclusion that all hybrid plan designs are inherently age \ndiscriminatory also raises the question why the Internal Revenue \nService, IRS, issued determination letters for many years specifically \npermitting the hybrid designs and why it issued proposed regulations \nproviding that the cash balance plan design is not inherently age \ndiscriminatory. The Cooper decision completely ignored this regulatory \nhistory. Of even more interest is that the Cooper decision disregarded \nthe legislative history of the pension age discrimination laws adopted \nin 1986. That conference report made it clear that intent of Congress \nwas limited to prohibiting the practice of ceasing pension accruals \nonce participants reached normal retirement age, i.e. the so-called \npost-65 pension accrual.\n  The Cooper decision emboldened cash balance critics to demand an \nappropriations rider that prohibited the Treasury Department from \nfinalizing its age regulations addressing hybrid plan designs and \nconversions. At that time, Congress directed the Treasury Department to \npublish a legislative proposal regarding conversions from traditional \nto cash balance plans. In the legislative history, the conference \nreport did state that ``[t]he purpose of this prohibition is not to \ncall into question the validity of hybrid plan designs (cash balance \nand pension equity). The purpose of the prohibition is to preserve the \nstatus quo with respect to conversions through the entirety of fiscal \nyear 2004 while the applicable committees of jurisdiction review the \nTreasury Department's legislative proposals.''\n  While the Cooper case is a rogue decision, there is significant \nauthority to the contrary concluding that hybrid plans are age-\nappropriate. Unfortunately, the Cooper case has led to what are called \ncopycat lawsuits both in the Southern District of Illinois and \nelsewhere in the Nation. The Cooper case has also had a chilling effect \non the plan sponsor community. Concerns over potential damages from \nthese cases are causing CEOs and CFOs to have very sober discussions \nregarding the future of their plans. There seems to be a slow, but \nsteady, domino effect of freezing hybrid pension plans as a result of \nconcerns over potential liability from fallout of the Cooper case. This \nis occurring despite a general belief that the Cooper case could be \noverturned on appeal. I fear that if Congress fails to bless the hybrid \npension plan design in short order, these voluntary plans could all \nbecome frozen.\n  If we can conclude that the design of these plans is consistent with \nthe ADEA, but the conversions to hybrid plans raise questions, why \ncan't we legislate in this area to simply bless the hybrid plan design? \nClarifying only the legality of prospective plans does not address any \nof these problems; it does nothing to eliminate the potential for \ndevastating suits directed at the prior operation of hybrid plans. \nRetroactive legislation is needed because the consequences of inaction \nor prospective-only legislation could be disastrous. If retroactive \nlegislation is not adopted and the Cooper case is decided adversely on \nappeal, the liabilities of hybrid plans would triple if companies are \nforced to pay the enormous windfalls created under Cooper. This would \nimpose such enormous costs on employers that large numbers of them \nwould have no choice but to eliminate future benefits in their defined \nbenefit plans. Many companies will not be able to absorb those \nadditional liabilities, causing business declines and bankruptcies, as \nwell as widespread damage to the economy.\n  Many have ignored the taxpayer interest in the outcome of \nretroactivity legislation. As we contemplate the precarious state of \nthe PBGC, it is important to consider the potential impact of failing \nto provide retroactive relief on that troubled agency's solvency. \nConservative estimates of the national liability attributable to the \nCooper theory of age discrimination are well in excess of $100 billion. \nMany employers would undoubtedly be forced into distress plan \nterminations by this liability, shifting the liability to the PBGC. \nOther employers would simply terminate their plans, resulting in a \nprecipitous contraction of the PBGC's premium base. The PBGC reports \nthat for 2004, 24.6 percent of the participants in covered single \nemployer plans are in hybrid plans; this means that such plans generate \nalmost a quarter of the single-employer flat-rate premiums. Both \ndevelopments would make a taxpayer bailout of PBGC far more likely.\n  I must also raise an additional issue regarding the hybrid pension \nplan provisions of the bill before us. As you know, it is the cash \nbalance pension design that has been at the center of the congressional \ndiscussion about the need to provide legislative clarity for hybrid \nplans. Yet, another leading variety of hybrid plan, called the pension \nequity plan, is in equal need of congressional attention. In a pension \nequity plan, employers provide credits for each year of employee \nservice and these credits are multiplied by an employee's final pay to \nproduce a lump sum figure. Typically, the benefit credits given to \nemployees increase with age and/or years of service, making this design \nan attractive one for older and long-service workers. Dozens of large \nemployers around the country offer pension equity plans, including a\n\n[[Page S12916]]\n\nnumber of very large employers in my state.\n  Pension equity plan sponsors and participants face the same risks and \nare in need of the same legislative clarification as cash balance \nplans--that their basic design is not, in fact, illegal and does, in \nfact, satisfy our age discrimination rules. To achieve this objective, \nthe legislative provision clarifying the age discrimination rules for \nhybrid plans must specifically reference pension equity plans in the \nstatutory language. The legislation before us does not do this. Rather, \nit leaves the issue of whether pension equity plans receive the same \nbeneficial clarification as cash balance plans up to the Treasury \nDepartment in later administrative guidance. This will simply prolong \nthe legal uncertainty that is driving many employers to consider ending \ntheir pension equity plans altogether. I believe this must be \nremedied--that we must give pension equity plans the same explicit \nstatutory treatment as cash balance plans. I hope that, along with \napplying the clarification of the hybrid designs to existing plans \nunder current law, we can explicitly address pension equity plans as we \nmove toward conference on this pension bill.\n  I likewise hope that we can make several other refinements to the \nbill's hybrid provisions so that these provisions more appropriately \naddress some of the unique issues surrounding pension equity plans. For \nexample, the bill currently has a requirement that hybrid plans pay \ncertain minimum interest rates. Yet, unlike in cash balance plans, the \nbenefits in pension equity plans grow with pay increases, as \ntraditional defined benefit plans do, rather than with interest, so \nthis requirement really does not make sense in the pension equity \ncontext. In addition, conversions to pension equity plans are typically \nhandled differently than conversions to cash balance plans, and this \nneeds to be acknowledged in the legislation. Finally, just as there are \nunique differences between cash-balance and pension equity hybrid plans \nthat we must acknowledge, we must also recognize and support unique \ndifferences among cash-balance and pension equity plans respectively. \nNo two plans are identical, nor should they be. Congress should not be \nso overly prescriptive in the rules for hybrid pension plans that it \nprohibits sponsors from adding unique features that may better serve \ntheir employees in retirement. I hope that during the conference on \nthis bill, for example, we can recognize that there are cash balance \nplans that have returns based on equity indices. Such plans may provide \nreturns that do not fall within the interest rate corridor established \nin this bill because their returns may be greater or lesser than \nrequired under this bill for the plan to be considered a qualified cash \nbalance plan. While I do believe it is good policy for these plans to \nhave a principal protection feature, to ensure workers are guaranteed \nupon retirement to receive the investment credits they have earned, I \nalso believe that we should not discourage plans which provide \nparticipants the opportunity to receive higher returns that are \nattainable through the equity markets.\n  I would like to finish my statement by thanking the chairmen and \nranking members for their work on the prospective hybrid language. \nWhile the bill does not address existing plans, serious discussions \nhave begun to do so. It is imperative that these discussions continue \nso that we can clarify the validity of the hybrid pension designs, both \ncash-balance and pension equity, under current law.\n  Hybrid defined benefit plans play an invaluable role in delivering \nretirement security to millions of Americans and their families. To \nprevent total abandonment of hybrid plans by employers and the \nresulting harm to employees, I hope Congress will quickly provide \nlegislative certainty and clarity for existing cash balance and other \nhybrid pension plans such as pension equity plans. Waiting for the \nCooper case to be resolved on appeal is not the answer; as time goes \nby, more companies are reacting to the current uncertainty and \npotential liability by freezing or terminating their plans. At the same \ntime, more and more companies are being dragged into copycat \nlitigation. The losers in this terrible failure to act are my \nconstituents in North Carolina and workers across America who will lose \nthe opportunity to be covered by an employer-provided pension plan. \nFailure to resolve the status of hybrid defined benefit plans \ncomprehensively is a betrayal of employers who are trying to do the \nright thing by their employees and the millions of workers who are \ncounting on a pension for their retirement.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for S. \n1783, the Pension Security and Transparency Act. This bill will make \nmuch needed reforms to our pension security system. It takes important \nsteps to address the deteriorating financial condition of the Pension \nBenefit Guarantee Corporation, PBGC, to ultimately protect the defined \nbenefit plans of millions of American workers. My purpose in coming to \nthe floor today is to make note of a number of provisions in this bill \nthat I believe are particularly important to our system of retirement \nsecurity, and I am pleased that this bill incorporates these \nprovisions.\n  First, the bill includes measures to encourage companies to implement \nso-called auto-enroll 401(k) plans. In plain English, this will \naccomplish a relatively simple, but tremendously effective change to \nensure that more Americans are saving for their retirement. Currently, \nunder most retirement plans, employees must take affirmative steps to \njoin a company's 401(k) plan. Under an automatic enrollment system, new \nemployees would automatically be included in an employer's 401(k) plan, \nand would have to take affirmative steps to withdraw from the plan. In \nessence, the choice of whether to participate in a retirement plan is \nstill entirely with the worker, however, the default would be \nparticipation in the plan: workers could ``opt out'', rather than \nhaving to ``opt in'' to be covered.\n  Many studies have indicated that automatic enrollment is remarkably \neffective in raising participation rates among eligible workers, \nparticularly for lower income workers. One study, for example, found \nthat automatic enrollment increased participation from 13 percent to 80 \npercent for workers making under $20,000 a year. The fact is that \nwithout automatic enrollment, many workers don't take advantage of the \nsavings opportunities available through 401(k)s. Sometimes it is \nbecause of inertia, or because of the more immediate demands of work \nand family, or because the options appear intimidating and confusing. \nThe automatic 401(k) is a relatively simple concept that has the power \nto enhance retirement savings for millions of American workers. Earlier \nthis year, I joined Senator Bingaman in introducing S. 875, the Save \nMore for Retirement Act, to encourage such auto-enrollment plans. Our \nbill also included provisions to encourage plans to add a feature \nwhereby employees' contributions would automatically increase each year \nuntil certain thresholds were met. We sought to address the concern \nthat many who do participate in company plans don't take full advantage \nof the savings opportunities and therefore may be ill-prepared for \nretirement. I am pleased that the bill before us includes both the \nautomatic enrollment and automatic increase provisions.\n  I am also pleased that the bill includes a number of provisions often \nreferred to as the ``post-Enron'' measures. We on the Governmental \nAffairs Committee heard devastating testimony of how thousands of Enron \nworkers saw their retirements savings plummet over the course of weeks. \nThe bill today seeks to address these concerns by ensuring that workers \ndo not have all their eggs in one basket. It encourages diversification \nof pension investments from employer stock. It also calls for workers \nand retirees to get regular statements showing the market value of \npension investments. In addition, it encourages employers to provide \nworkers with access to unbiased investment advice as to how to invest \ntheir pension retirement accounts.\n  There are many much needed reforms in this bill to ensure that \ndefined benefit plans are adequately funded and that the PBGC remains \nsolvent. It is not perfect, but it represents an effective compromise \non a complex matter. I anticipate that additional modifications will be \nmade in conference. I rise here today, however, to make note of these \nparticular provisions that I believe will encourage and protect \nretirement savings for millions of Americans.\n\n[[Page S12917]]\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to \nspeak on the floor today. First, I thank Chairmen Grassley and Enzi and \nRanking Members Baucus and Kennedy in crafting this important \nlegislation. The pension issues we take up today are notoriously \ncomplex and could have a significant financial impact on both American \nfamilies and American businesses. The leaders of the committees have \ndone an impressive job in bringing us to this point, and I congratulate \nthem on their efforts.\n  One of the issues we address in this legislation is the validity of \nthe so-called hybrid plans. Hybrid plans whether cash balance or \npension equity--are a modern form of defined benefit plan that combines \nthe best features of defined contribution plans, such as 401(k)s, with \nthe best features of traditional defined benefit programs. Hybrid plans \nkeep defined benefit plans relevant for workers in our contemporary, \nmobile economy. Indeed, these hybrid plans have been popular with both \nemployers and employees, and today an estimated 8.5 million workers are \nearning secure retirement benefits through these plans.\n  For the past several years, these hybrid plans have been called into \nquestion. These turn of events came about when one of our Federal \ndistrict court judges determined in the infamous Cooper v. IBM decision \nthat the hybrid plan designs are illegal because they pay compound \ninterest. Somehow, this judge believes that it is age discriminatory \nfor employers to pay interest on their employees' pensions. I, for one, \nhave found his position hard to fathom. The judge reached this \nconclusion despite the fact that the Internal Revenue Service had \napproved interest-paying hybrid plans for 15 years and despite the fact \nthat every other court addressing the issue found that these plans \nsatisfy the age discrimination rules.\n  In classic fashion in our litigation-happy society, this lone and \nmisguided court decision has spawned a string of copy-cat class action \nsuits. In these suits, plaintiffs assert hundreds of millions--even \nbillions--of dollars in ``damages'' (over and above the benefits they \nhave earned under the plan--to ``correct'' compound interest.\n  So, the issue we need to address in the legislation before us is to \nmake clear that this lone judge got it wrong and that the IRS and all \nthose other judges got it right. Compound interest in a defined benefit \npension is not illegal, and the hybrid plan designs satisfy our age \ndiscrimination rules.\n  The legislation before us makes this important clarification but \nunfortunately only with respect to the future. While addressing the \nhybrid issue prospectively is constructive and must be done, failing to \nclarify the legal regime for the more than 1,500 or so existing hybrid \nplans and their 8.5 million or so participants will have a number of \nseriously adverse consequences.\n  First, employers will continue to face the threat of truly business-\nbusting litigation, which will drain resources from productive use and \nhamper their competitiveness. Ironically, despite the good efforts of \nour Senate committee leaders to insert ``no inference'' language in \nthis bill, judges may read the legislation's prospective-only approach \nas suggesting the illegality of current plans, thereby worsening the \nlitigation risk faced by employers.\n  Second, in light of the unresolved threat to current hybrid plans, \nemployers are increasingly likely to abandon their pension plans, \ndenying additional retirement benefits to millions of American families \nand leaving new hires at these companies with no pensions whatsoever.\n  Third, as the healthy companies that sponsor hybrid plans leave the \npension system, they will aggravate the financial troubles of the \nPension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, PBGC. Indeed, hybrid plan \nsponsors today pay 25 percent of the per participant premiums received \nby the PBGC. So, unfortunately, while this legislation is designed to \nshore up the PBGC, we have left unaddressed one of the central threats \nto that agency's solvency.\n  In addition, while clarifying the age discrimination rules for hybrid \nplans prospectively and retroactively, it is my hope that the future \nconferees of this legislation will considering making a specific \nreference to pension equity plans--a type of hybrid plan other than \ncash balance plans--in the statutory language. The reason for this need \nis that the Cooper v. IBM decision deemed not only cash balance plans \nto be illegal, but pension equity plans as well.\n  The legislation before us does not address pension equity plans, \nspecifically. Rather, it leaves the issue of whether pension equity \nplans receive the same beneficial clarification as cash balance plans \nup to the Treasury Department in later administrative guidance. This \nwill simply prolong the legal uncertainty that is driving many \nemployers to consider ending their pension equity plans altogether. \nThis leading variety of hybrid plan--the pension equity plan--is in \nequal need of the same congressional attention as cash balance plans. I \nurge the future conferees to address this accordingly and to be mindful \nthat the conversion process in pension equity plans is typically \ndifferent than that of cash balance plans.\n  Mr. President, it is my sincere hope that as this important bill \nmoves through the legislative process we can address the hybrid design \nissue in a comprehensive way. We must do so in order to remedy the \nsignificant harms to workers and employers that will result if we only \naddress the issue prospectively. In addition, we must give equal \nconsideration to both cash balance and pension equity plans as two \nlegal regimes of hybrid plans. I look forward to working with Chairmen \nGrassley and Enzi, Ranking Members Baucus and Kennedy, and the future \nconferees on this bill to ensure a solution that will enhance rather \nthan endanger the retirement security of American families.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I would like to begin by expressing my \ngratitude to Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee \nChairman Enzi and the HELP Committee's ranking member, Senator Kennedy, \nfor working together, and with our colleagues on the Senate Finance \nCommittee, to address the wide spectrum of pension issues in the \nbipartisan bill that is before the Senate today. Their tremendous hard \nwork and conscientious approach to this legislation--and that of their \nstaffs--is commendable. They have had to balance many factors.\n  Enhancing the retirement security of Americans is one of my \npriorities in the Senate. Retirement security is, simply put, one of \nthe most important challenges facing our Nation. Single-employer and \nmultiemployer pension plans play an essential role in providing \nretirement security for so many New Yorkers and millions of Americans \naround the Nation.\n  For a variety of reasons, we have recently seen defined benefit plan \nterminations that have jeopardized the retirement security of many \nAmericans and placed additional burdens on the defined benefit system. \nI have heard from New Yorkers who are gravely concerned that they will \nnot see the benefits they worked so hard to earn.\n  A recent report by the Government Accountability Office, GAO, \nhighlights some of the deeply troubling trends facing the defined \nbenefit pension system. GAO notes that ``the nation's private defined \nbenefit, DB, pension system, a key contributor to the financial \nsecurity of millions of American workers and their families, is in \nlong-term decline.'' The GAO report describes a sharp drop in the \nnumber of single-employer DB plans in recent years, down to less than \n35,000 in 2002 from more than 95,000 25 years ago. According to the \nGAO, the same period of time has seen ``the number of active \nparticipants in such plans dropping from 27.3 percent of all national \nprivate wage and salary workers in 1980, to about 15 percent in 2002.''\n  In addition, the GAO report notes that ``structural problems in \nindustries like airlines, steel, and auto parts have led to large \nbankrupt firms terminating their DB plans, with thousands of workers \nlosing some of their benefits and saddling the Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation, PBGC, with billions of dollars in unfunded benefit \nguarantees.'' Moreover, the PBGC reported in 2004 that the ``rapid \ndecline'' in the net financial position of its single-employer program \nfrom 2000 to 2004 ``resulted from several very large losses (primarily \nfrom steel and airline industry plans), lower interest rates that \nraised the value of PBGC's liabilities and declining stock prices.''\n\n[[Page S12918]]\n\n  A look at the finances of the PBGC provides a snapshot of the \naftermath of these trends. According to the PBGC, in 2004 it insured \nmore than 34 million single-employer plan participants and more than \n9.8 million multiemployer plan participants. The PBGC reported that its \nsingle-employer program swung from a surplus of $9.7 billion in 2000 to \na $23.3 billion deficit in 2004, and that its multiemployer program \nshowed a deficit of $236 million in 2004. Yesterday, the PBGC reported \nits financial results for fiscal year 2005. According to the PBGC, the \nsingle-employer program deficit as of September 30, 2005, was $22.8 \nbillion, and the multiemployer program deficit had grown to $335 \nmillion. While at this time it appears the PBGC will be able to pay \nbenefits for some time to come, it is incumbent upon us, as elected \nrepresentatives, to take meaningful steps to address these challenges \nto the survival of the defined benefit system and the dangers these \nchallenges pose for workers, retirees, and their families who are \ndepending upon the viability of that system.\n  A central goal of that effort should be ensuring that employers \noffering single-employer pension plans keep pension promises and have \nincentives to remain in the defined benefit system to provide good \npensions to their employees. Additional goals include protecting older, \nlonger term employees from unfair changes in their pension plan, \nenhancing financial transparency, and shoring up the PBGC. It is also \nimportant to work to maintain and strengthen the multiemployer pension \nsystem.\n  The Pension Security and Transparency Act of 2005 takes important \nsteps towards these goals, including: transitioning to a full funding \ntarget; offering incentives for companies to contribute more in good \ntimes to help plans get through economically challenging times; tools \nfor the government to use in an effort to help preserve pension plans \nfacing financial challenges; rules intended to help airlines preserve \ntheir pension plans; reforms intended to improve multiemployer plan \nfunding; prospective-only rules for cash balance pension plan \nconversions, with protections for older and longer serving workers; and \nenhanced disclosure of pension plan finances.\n  In addition, the defined contribution autoenrollment provisions \nincluded in the bill are an important first step in ensuring that \nemployees start saving today. It has widespread support among employers \nand employees, and is a commonsense provision that I will work to \nensure is included in the final conference agreement.\n  As is usually the case with new legislation of this scope, I believe \nthere is room for improvement and refinement, particularly with respect \nto ``at risk'' plan funding. I hope that in conference the legislation \nmay be brought in line with the approach to ``at risk'' funding taken \nin the legislation approved by the Senate HELP Committee in September. \nWe should support efforts of companies that are acting responsibly to \npreserve their defined benefit pension plans and fund them adequately, \nin the face of financial distress or cyclical downturns, and we should \nstrive to avoid actions that may, however unintentionally, have the \nopposite effect of that intended.\n  Working men and women are counting on the security provided by the \nbenefits they earn through their pensions. Some of the most important \ndecisions of their lives depend on these benefits being there for them \nwhen they need them. I am glad that the Senate is acting today on \ncomprehensive pension reform legislation and addressing a wide variety \nof challenges facing the defined benefit pension system. I will \ncontinue to work with my colleagues to enact legislation designed to \nmaintain and strengthen the defined benefit pension system for \ngenerations to come.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering long-delayed \nlegislation to reform our defined benefit pension system. While reforms \nare certainly needed, I must say that I am disappointed with how \nwatered down this legislation has become since we passed it out of the \nFinance Committee earlier this year.\n  Obviously, the current system is in dire straits, with the Pension \nBenefit Guarantee Corporation, the Federal corporation that insures \ntraditional pension plans, running a $22.8 billion deficit for fiscal \nyear 2005. Moreover, the PBGC said that if events that occurred just \nafter the fiscal year's end had occurred a few weeks earlier, the \ndeficit would have been $25.7 billion. If the Government is going to \ncontinue to operate a pension-plan insurance program, we must make sure \nthat employers fulfill their pension promises appropriately so that \ntaxpayers are not asked to bail out the PBGC.\n  This legislation makes a first step toward requiring more realistic \nfunding of pension promises, and it tries to assess more accurately \nwhich companies are in such financial difficulty that they are likely \nto declare bankruptcy and shed their pension plans as part of their \nreorganization, leaving it to the PBGC to cover their remaining \nobligations. While I believe the provisions approved by the Finance \nCommittee were stronger and more responsible, I understand that \ncompromises had to be made as the Finance bill was combined with the \nbill reported out by the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee. I hope these provisions will be retained and reinvigorated \nwhen this legislation is reconciled with the House pension-reform bill.\n  My primary concern about this legislation has to do with the special \nprovisions for legacy airlines. The bill reported out of the Finance \nCommittee allows certain airlines to freeze their existing defined \nbenefit pension plans so that no new participants can be added and \nbenefits will not increase in any way. Then it allows these companies \nan additional 14 years to pay off what they owe on these frozen plans. \nI agree that it makes sense to allow the airlines to freeze their \npension plans so that their liabilities do not get any worse. Further, \nif giving the airlines extra time to pay their obligations will keep \nthem from shifting the debts to the PBGC, then I believe we are acting \nresponsibly to protect the American taxpayers. I must say, however, \nthat this special treatment is unfair to those airlines that have been \nresponsible about funding their pension liabilities or that have \ndifferent, and more affordable, retirement savings plans for their \nemployees.\n  Nor is that all we are apparently going to do to provide special \nrelief for the legacy airlines. On the floor, an amendment will be \noffered, and will likely pass, that will lengthen the amortization \nperiod for the so-called ``hard-freeze'' provision to 20 years and to \nprovide separate funding relief to certain other legacy airlines that \nwill not be taking advantage of the ``hard freeze.'' This separate \nfunding relief will allow these particular airlines an extended period \nto pay their pension obligations, but will not require the airlines to \nfreeze completely their pension plans. Rather, this so-called ``soft-\nfreeze'' would not allow new participants, but would allow benefit \naccruals if the company funds those accruals. This is terrible policy; \nif the airlines have the resources to fund benefit accruals, they \nshould fund their existing obligations on a timely basis instead of \ntaking on new obligations. Congress should not grant any company the \nability to amortize its obligations over a longer period of time \nwithout requiring it to freeze its pension plan completely. Further, \nincreasing the 14-year ``hard freeze'' to 20 years is overly generous \nand provides a one-size-fits-all plan for two legacy airlines that have \nvery different financial situations. I am pleased that Chairman \nGrassley will oppose this amendment.\n  Finally, with respect to the Akaka amendment, I opposed this measure \nbecause it would exacerbate the already terrible fiscal problems facing \nthe PBGC. Unfortunately, Federal regulations dictate that individuals \nage 60 and older may not serve as airline pilots. I am one of 20 \nMembers of this Chamber who have cosponsored Senator Inhofe's bill to \nremove this blanket prohibition, a stricture which I have concluded \ncannot be justified as a safety measure. I am heartened that the Senate \nCommerce Committee will have the opportunity at their next markup to \nrectify the inequitable treatment of older pilots the right way--by \nremoving the arbitrary mandatory retirement age. Unfortunately, the \nAkaka amendment would proceed the wrong way--by swelling the PBGC's \ndeficits by raising the ceiling on allowable benefits.\n\n[[Page S12919]]\n\n  Overall, this legislation moves forward the process of reforming our \nbadly broken defined benefit pension-plan funding system, and for that \nreason I will support it even though I am very opposed to its special \nfunding relief for certain legacy airlines. I hope, as the conference \ncommittee meets to work out a final version, that the conferees will \nwork for the best possible funding requirements for all companies that \nparticipate in the system; that they will keep some kind of a benchmark \nto identify struggling companies; and that they will keep the legacy \nairline relief as responsible as possible. We must remember that the \nAmerican taxpayer will be asked to bail out the PBGC if the system, \nwhich is supposed to be self-funding, cannot sustain itself. And a \ntaxpayer bailout is an outcome that I know none of us wants to happen.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the pension \nreform bill we are now considering. This bill is the product of a great \ndeal of work by members of both the Committee on Finance and the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. As a member of \nboth of these committees, I congratulate the chairmen and ranking \nDemocratic members for their leadership and hard work. It is not often \nthat Senate committees share jurisdiction of an issue the way that the \nFinance and HELP Committees share the jurisdiction of pensions. \nBringing the bill to this point required an unusual procedure where the \nseparate bills approved by the two committees, which were quite \ndifferent in many respects, were combined into one bill for floor \nconsideration.\n  The resulting bill, which is before us today, is complex, \ncontroversial, and imperfect. It is also very much needed. Traditional \npension plans, also known as defined benefit pension plans, are facing \na crisis today. The number of defined benefit pensions is in decline. \nIn 1980, around 40 percent of private sector jobs offered pensions to \ntheir employees. Today, only 20 percent do.\n  Since 1985, the number of defined benefit plans backed by the PBGC \nhas declined from 114,500 to fewer than 32,000. Clearly, our economy, \nand the retirement options for our workforce, are undergoing rapid \nevolution. This is due to a number of complex factors, but prominent \namong them is the high expense of starting and maintaining these plans, \nand the uncertainty and volatility of funding them. The rules governing \ndefined benefit pension plans are among the most complex of all U.S. \nlaws.\n  Another factor in the debate about pensions is that the American \nworkforce is changing in a fundamental way. No longer is the idea of \ngoing to work for one employer and remaining with that company for \none's entire career considered the norm. Increasingly, workers are \nmobile and find themselves changing companies and even careers several \ntimes over the course of their work lives. For these workers, the \ntraditional pension plan is not necessarily the ideal. For many such \nworkers, and for most companies in younger industries, hybrid pension \nplans are more beneficial.\n  Unfortunately, these hybrid pension plans are under a legal and a \nlegislative cloud today. So what could be a pretty good answer in \ntoday's world to the problems of cost, complexity, and inflexibility of \na defined benefit plan has been practically halted by legal challenges \nand by political controversy over how to best clarify the status of \nhybrid plans.\n  One of the biggest concerns, however, is that the Pension Benefit \nGuarantee Corporation (PBGC) is under increasing financial strain as \nmore and more companies with defined benefit plans have defaulted on \ntheir pension obligations and left this agency to carry the load. Just \nyesterday, the PBGC released in its annual report that it had only \n$56.5 billion in assets to cover $79.2 billion in liabilities. In \naddition, the report showed the PBGC's exposure to losses from pension \nplans sponsored by financially weak employers rose to $108 billion from \n$96 billion the year before.\n  When I earlier said this pension bill is complex, controversial, and \nimperfect, it is because, to be effective, the bill must walk the very \nnarrow path between two important public policy objectives. On the one \nhand, we need to ensure that when an employer establishes a pension \nplan, and makes inherent promises to its workers, it provides the funds \nnecessary to secure those commitments. Failure to do so does great harm \nto the millions of employees and their families who depend on those \npensions for a secure retirement. It also does harm to our economy, and \nit puts the PBGC, and possibly the American taxpayer, at great risk.\n  On the other hand, we must not forget that employers have no legal \nobligation to offer such pension plans to their employees. These \nbenefits are voluntary, and they must stay so. The Congress has an \nobligation to ensure that the pension laws provide rational and \nsensible rules that encourage employers to offer these benefits to \ntheir employees. This means they should be understandable, predictable, \nand easy to administer. If we place unreasonable or overly aggressive \nrequirements on employers, many or most will simply terminate their \npension plans, leaving employees without the benefits they might have \nhad.\n  I believe we must be careful to ensure that pension plans that are \ncurrently fully funded and are sponsored by strong employers are not \nweakened inadvertently by the reforms in this legislation. However, \nthis is not as easy to accomplish at it may sound.\n  I believe the bill before us goes a long way toward accomplishing the \ngoals of strengthening the pension system, shoring up the PBGC, and not \ndiscouraging employers from staying in the system. However, it has \ncertain provisions that, in my view, may not lead us in the direction \nwe need to go. I hope that as the bill goes to conference that it can \nbe further improved.\n  More specifically, I remain concerned about the provision in the bill \nthat would require certain plan sponsors with credit ratings that have \nfallen below investment grade to fund their plans faster than they \nwould otherwise have to do. While this provision has improved from its \nfirst version in the Finance Committee, I believe it is still too \nonerous.\n  I am also very concerned about the impact of this bill on the \nstruggling airline industry. We simply must provide relief to the \nairlines in funding their pension obligations or many will have to turn \ntheir obligations over to the PBGC. Therefore, I am supporting the \namendment of the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Isakson, and I hope our \ncolleagues will also support it.\n  There is much to be said in favor of this combined bill. I am very \npleased to see that many of the defined contribution provisions that \nthe Finance Committee has long worked on getting enacted have made \ntheir way into this bill. I am also glad that certain protections were \nadded for the multiple employer pensions plans that are very important \nto many of the electrical and telephone cooperatives that are common in \nmany rural States, including my home State of Utah.\n  I am also pleased to see that the managers' substitute amendment also \nincludes a provision on which I have been working for several years now \nwith the chairman and ranking Democrat of the Finance Committee. This \nprovision, which is important to many associations around the Nation, \nincluding the Utah Auto Dealers Association, ensures that they will not \nunfairly have to give up their health plans, upon which many employers \nand their families now rely.\n  And I am happy that we have finally included language that makes it \nmuch easier for firms to enroll automatically new employees into a \nfirm's 401(k) plans. One thing we know about human behavior is that \ninertia is a powerful force--change of any sort can be difficult for \neven the best of us. The beauty of automatic enrollment is that it uses \nthis inertia to our advantage. The firms that have used automatic \nenrollment thus far have reported vastly higher savings rates, and \nemployees have been quite pleased with the result.\n  While nearly everyone on both sides of the aisle supports making \nautomatic enrollment easier for firms, we differ on just how much \neasier we should make it. There have been a number of proposals that \nwould have made it much easier for firms that offer automatic \nenrollment of new employees to meet the convoluted pension distribution \nrequirements that deter many smaller firms from even offering 401(k) \nplans. Unfortunately, the version currently embodied in this bill does \nnot, in\n\n[[Page S12920]]\n\nmy view, adequately address this problem. Still, half a loaf is better \nthan none, and I welcome anything that clears the way for firms to \noffer automatic enrollment.\n  I would like to take another couple of minutes to address more fully \nthe issue of hybrid pension plans, which combine elements of defined \nbenefit and defined contribution plans. I think that corporate America \nis recognizing the importance of these plans. At the same time, there \nis a cloud of legal uncertainty hanging over them. My hope is that we \naddress this uncertainty in the conference.\n  Although the defined benefit pension system has helped generations of \nAmericans achieve retirement security, we have witnessed a decline in \nthese plans during the last several years, as I mentioned. While the \nmodern workforce remains interested in the security of employer funding \nand Federal insurance guarantees, it also demands portability and a \ngreater level of control regarding retirement benefits. Given these \ndiverse criteria it is easy to see why so-called hybrid pension plans \nhave become so popular. These cash-balance and pension equity plans, in \nwhich over 9 million Americans currently participate, incorporate the \nattractive features of a defined contribution plan while offering much \nof the security associated with traditional defined benefit plans.\n  Hybrid pension plans are nothing new. In 1991 the Treasury issued \nregulations that described a safe harbor testing method for cash \nbalance pension plans under nondiscrimination rules. Five years later, \nthe IRS issued Notice 96-8 describing the structure and operation of \ncash balance pension plans as well as citing the previous safe harbor \nrule. This notice and prior regulation stood as the official authority \nfrom Treasury and IRS on how a cash balance pension plan should be \ndesigned and operated. Many plan sponsors even received favorable \ndetermination letters from the IRS that their converted cash balance \npension plans met all requirements to be qualified to preferred tax \ntreatment under the Internal Revenue Code, including all relevant \nnondiscrimination requirements. More recently, in 2002 the Treasury \nissued proposed regulations that clearly established hybrid pension \nplans and plan conversions as nondiscriminatory against older workers. \nMost employers who made these plan conversions did so as part of a \ngood-faith effort to protect the retirement security of their \nemployees.\n  Although many courts have ruled that these plans do not discriminate \nbased on age, they continue to come under attack. The bill we are \ncurrently considering does a good job of establishing the principles \nfor evaluating whether post-effective date conversions of a traditional \ndefined benefit pension plan to a hybrid pension plan are permissible. \nHowever, the bill does not clarify that employers who previously \nadopted hybrid pension plans in good faith, based on generally accepted \nlegal principles and in reliance on guidance issued by the Internal \nRevenue Service, should not be disadvantaged compared to employers who \nadopt hybrid pension plans in the future.\n  If Congress does not clarify the legality of pre-effective date \nhybrid pension plans and plan conversions, it is likely that these \nplans will be abandoned in favor of programs that shift investment risk \nfor retirement savings back to participants, such as 401(k) plans. The \nuncertain climate for hybrid pension plans has already had a profound \nadverse effect on defined benefit plan formation and continuation. I \nhope that in conference we can consider some moderate and fair \nretroactive provisions in order to give some legal clarity to these \nplans.\n  This bill should not be considered the final word on this issue. It \nrepresents good progress, and I am encouraged that those who had placed \nholds on its consideration have agreed to release them. By approving \nthis legislation, we can move into conference where I believe we can \nimprove the bill even further.\n  Again, I thank those who have worked so hard on this legislation, and \nI urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it today.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I would like to commend Chairman Grassley \nand Senator Baucus on their leadership in passing the Pension Security \nand Transparency Act of 2005. It accomplishes a great deal in \nreinforcing the security and financial viability of the defined benefit \npension system. Americans have worked very hard to earn their pension \nbenefits, and this bill does a lot to ensure that their retirements \nwill be secure.\n  A number of important reforms will also improve the defined \ncontribution system. In particular, I am proud that a number of these \ndefined contribution reforms were taken from the retirement package \nthat Senator Conrad and I introduced earlier this year.\n  S. 1783 included a key piece of our legislation promoting automatic \nenrollment in 401(k) plans. Automatic enrollment has been shown to \nincrease participation rates in these retirement plans significantly--\nespecially among low and moderate income individuals.\n  S. 1783 also clarifies the fiduciary rules with respect to defined \ncontribution plans and annuities. Today, very few employers offer \nannuity distribution options in their defined contribution plans partly \ndue to confusion surrounding the appropriate fiduciary standard. I \nbelieve we need to provide retirees with the option to turn a portion \nof a lump sum into a guaranteed stream of income so that we can ensure \nthey do not outlive their savings as they enter the increasingly long \nretirement phase of their lives.\n  On this front, I believe that there is much more we can do to \nencourage individuals to provide themselves with a guaranteed stream of \nincome for life by providing tax incentives for annuitization.\n  In particular, we need to provide incentives for retirees without \nemployer provided retirement plans to save. Because many workers \nbenefited from employer provided retirement plans, they may have little \nsaved for retirement. Aside from Social Security, almost one-half of \nall Americans have only their personal savings to fall back on in \nretirement. Therefore, I believe we must offer additional encouragement \nfor these retirees to choose retirement income that is guaranteed to \nlast as long as they live, and will not decrease based on their \ninvestment results.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that all \nAmericans have a secure retirement.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate is \nfinally taking action on much needed pension reforms. As the Senate \ndoes its work today, there are more than 44 million Americans working \nhard to earn traditional pension benefits. Steelworkers, coal miners, \nflight attendants, autoworkers, carpenters, grocery store employees--\nworkers of every description are putting in long hours, in part, \nbecause they have been promised that when they retire, they will \ncontinue to receive some income from their employers.\n  Traditional, defined benefit pension plans have been an important \npart of workers' compensation for generations. Guaranteed retirement \nincome protects workers from the risks of the stock market. And with a \nsteady monthly check, retirees know they cannot outlive their income. \nWe owe it to all of those workers to be sure that the pension benefits \nthey are earning today will be there for them in the future.\n  Unfortunately, our pension system has failed too many people already. \nAnd in West Virginia, sadly, we understand all too well what happens \nwhen pension benefits are not paid as promised. Last year, more than \n11,000 West Virginians received a pension check from the Pension \nBenefit Guaranty Corporation, because their employer had terminated \ntheir pension plan.\n  There are another 313,000 West Virginians still participating in \ntraditional pension plans. We have an obligation to fix the pension \nsystem so that those workers and retirees will receive what they have \nbeen promised. Companies must be encouraged to continue to promise \nthese valuable benefits, but we cannot accept empty promises. Companies \nmust adequately fund the retirement benefits workers earn.\n  I believe that, on balance, the bill before the Senate today \nstrengthens the retirement system. This legislation requires companies \nto better fund pension benefits. It provides workers more information \nabout the status of their retirement plan, and it improves the \nfinancial position of the PBGC, which\n\n[[Page S12921]]\n\nwill continue to play an important role as Federal safety net for \nfailed pension plans.\n\n  The bill also makes some important improvements to the defined \ncontribution pension system. As Enron collapsed, many employees lost \nall of their retirement savings because they had heavily invested in \ntheir company's stock. I am pleased that Congress is finally acting to \nbetter protect employees by giving them more information about their \ninvestment options and more rights to diversify those investments.\n  I am also pleased that the legislation includes a provision to enable \nthe UMWA's Construction Workers Pension Plan to excess assets to cover \nhealth care costs for retirees, just as many single-employer private \npension plans already do. The Construction Workers Pension Plan \ncurrently has more than twice the assets needed to cover pension \nbenefits, while retirees have been forced to pay large premiums for \nhealth coverage. With this change, the resources set aside to benefit \nretired construction workers can be used to best advantage--including \nhelping to cover health care costs.\n  Yet while I believe there are many positive provisions in this bill, \nit is not a perfect bill. The bill calls for very difficult \ncompromises. Companies are concerned that the funding rules will be \ndifficult to live by. Workers are concerned that benefits may be \nlimited if employers do not adequately fund the pension plans. I \nappreciate these concerns. And I am interested in improving this bill.\n  I had hoped to have the opportunity to support an amendment by \nSenators DeWine and Mikulski to ease some of the funding requirements \nimposed on struggling employers. Without fundamentally upsetting the \nbalance struck in this bill, the amendment would have made pension \nplans easier to maintain. Because a company's credit rating is an \nimperfect indicator of whether the pension plan is sound, I do not \nbelieve that we should impose strict new funding requirements on \ncompanies with lower credit ratings. I believe that the managers of \nthis legislation have already crafted so many important improvements to \nthe funding rules that the payments associated with low credit ratings \nare not necessary to guarantee appropriate pension contributions. \nRather, the credit ratings rules may limit employers' willingness to \noffer such benefits.\n  The reforms contained in this legislation will dramatically improve \nthe health of the Nation's pension system. Improved pension funding \nrules are necessary to protect the many workers who have been promised \npension benefits, and to shore up the Federal pension insurer. As the \nfinal legislation is worked out with the House, I will be working with \nmy colleagues to improve this bill even further.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the conference \nreport to accompany H.R. 2862, the Commerce, Justice, Science \nAppropriations Act. While I will be voting for this conference report, \nI have grave concerns regarding the cuts in the Edward Byrne Memorial \nJustice Assistance Grants Program.\n  The Byrne/JAG program is the primary Federal assistance program for \nState and local law enforcement's counter-drug activities. This program \nis critical to fighting the domestic war on drugs. In my State of Iowa, \nthis grant program funds highly successful drug task forces. I fear \nthat without these grants, many of these task forces will disappear and \nthe threat from methamphetamine will only grow larger.\n  I have a letter from Sheriff Thomas Faust, the executive director of \nthe National Sheriff's Association. His letter raises many of the \nconcerns I have already highlighted with regard to the JAG program. \nSheriff Faust's letter warns that, ``Cuts of this magnitude seriously \ninhibit law enforcement's abilities and endanger the safety and well \nbeing of our communities! In order to keep communities safe from crime \nand free of drugs, law enforcement must be given the resources they \nneed! The fiscal year 2006 CJS appropriations bill does not provide for \nthose resources.''\n  While I have fears that these cuts in the JAG program will have grave \nresults, because the conference report funds other critical programs, I \nwill vote in support of the conference report.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the above-referenced letter in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               National Sheriffs' Association,\n\n                                Alexandria, VA, November 15, 2005.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the National Sheriffs' \n     Association (NSA) and our 23,000 members, I am writing to \n     express our extreme disappointment and concern over the lack \n     of funding for the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance \n     Grants Program (JAG) in H.R. 2862, the Science, State, \n     Justice, Commerce and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill.\n       The JAG program, which was formed by consolidating the \n     Edward Byrne Memorial Grant program and the Local Law \n     Enforcement Block Grant program, is one of the primary \n     federal assistance programs for state, tribal and local law \n     enforcement agencies. State and local law enforcement \n     agencies, including the 3,087 sheriffs' offices across the \n     country, rely heavily on JAG funds for critical operational \n     activities. JAG funds support many of our counter-drug \n     activities, particularly drug task forces. Without these \n     funds, our sheriffs will not be able to sustain the task \n     forces or even fight the war on drugs!\n       Local law enforcement agencies from all across the country \n     are already out-manned and out-gunned by the drug cartels and \n     street gangs in our communities. Over the last several years \n     we have been forced to deal with the loss of personnel, \n     because of budget cuts to the COPS program. Now the COPS \n     Universal Hiring Program has been zeroed out by Congress, \n     thus abandoning an effective program, and the JAG Funds are \n     being cut as well. These cuts will put an end to any progress \n     that has been made and destroy any hope we might have of \n     winning the war on drugs or ridding our communities of \n     methamphetamine!\n       For more than a decade, the resources provided under the \n     JAG program have allowed law enforcement agencies to expand \n     their capabilities and make great strides in reducing the \n     incidence of crime in communities across the nation. It is \n     our belief that the lack of\n\n[[Page S12922]]\n\n     federal support for local law enforcement will surely result \n     in increased crime and drug abuse!\n       The conference agreement would provide just $416 million \n     for the Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grants, of which \n     only $321 million is available for local law enforcement \n     assistance. We find this level of funding to be unacceptable \n     and believe that Congress is failing to adequately recognize \n     the mission of law enforcement!\n       Cuts of this magnitude seriously inhibit law enforcement's \n     abilities and endanger the safety and well being of our \n     communities! In order to keep communities safe from crime and \n     free of drugs, law enforcement agencies must be given the \n     resources they need! The FY06 SSJC appropriations bill does \n     not provide for those resources.\n       At a time where law enforcement and securing the homeland \n     should be of the highest priority, Congress has chosen to \n     completely dismiss them as a priority! With the rise of \n     terrorism, and the fact that methamphetamine use and abuse \n     has risen to epidemic proportions, Congress should embrace \n     law enforcement, support the JAG program and COPS Hiring \n     Program, and increase their funding, not cut their funding!\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Thomas N. Faust,\n\n                                              Executive Director &\n                            Retired Sheriff, Arlington County, VA.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. This bill cuts over $200 million from the Byrne Justice \nAssistance Grant Program and over $120 million from the COPS Program. \nThese cuts follow on 3 previous years of cuts that have decimated these \nimportant and successful law enforcement assistance programs.\n  In 2002, Byrne was funded at $994 million. Next year, it will be \nfunded at only $416 million--a 60 percent cut.\n  I am also dismayed that after my amendment to add $34 million in \nfunding to legal services programs passed the Senate, not a single \ndollar was included in the conference report. Meanwhile a study earlier \nthis year found that over half those eligible for legal aid cannot \nreceive the help they need with critical issues including custody, \nchild support, housing, and more critically right now, navigating \nhurricane related bureaucracy.\n  These programs have now been cut so severely that law enforcement in \nmy State will likely be left with no alternatives to layoffs. That \nsimply isn't acceptable. While I will be voting for this conference \nreport because I believe that the appropriators did the best they could \nwithin the situation they faced, I want to serve notice on the Senate \nthat we must restore funding to local law enforcement grant programs \nand to legal assistance next year.\n  The fault for these drastic cuts to law enforcement programs lies \ndirectly with the President and with every Member of Congress who voted \nfor his budget that cut $1.3 billion in law enforcement funding. \nAppropriators only get a certain amount of money to work with, and that \nmoney is set by the budget. It was literally impossible for \nappropriators to restore all of the $1.3 billion in direct help for law \nenforcement including over $150 million in cuts to victims, over $300 \nmillion in assistance to States overwhelmed with illegal aliens, over \n$150 million in cuts to juvenile justice programs, almost $500 million \nin cuts to the COPS Program and $800 million in cuts to the Byrne \nProgram.\n  It is simply outrageous that 54 Members of this Senate voted not to \nrestore this funding during the budget process and that all 55 \nRepublicans voted for a budget that eliminated this funding. Any one of \nthose 55 people who stands up here and complains about these cuts is a \nhypocrite because they allowed it to happen.\n  In my State of Iowa, these cuts that will mean a 42-percent reduction \nin the amount of Byrne funding available statewide from $4.6 million \nlast year, down from $6.2 million the year before, to only $2.6 \nmillion. We will receive only $2.6 million to fund 25 drug task forces, \n16 offender treatment programs, and 9 early intervention programs. \nThese cuts will come as my State continues to be in the middle of a \nmeth epidemic.\n  Our preliminary estimates are that this is going to mean the loss of \n27 drug task force salaries and corresponding 1300 fewer arrests. It \nwill mean layoffs. There are no longer any alternatives. It will also \nmean the loss of 22 Byrne funded programs including innovative and \nsuccessful treatment programs. These cuts will lead to at least 1,200 \nfewer meth addicts in prison receiving drug treatment. The result will \nbe to put addicts back on the streets where there crimes will escalate \nand drive up the costs of prosecuting and incarcerating them the next \ntime around.\n  These cuts will be devastating. Between fiscal year 2003 and 2005 we \nhad already slashed over $1 billion in direct help to local law \nenforcement officers. How much more can we expect our law enforcement \nofficers to take?\n  It is simply amazing to me that this administration and this Congress \ncould be so foolish as to slash funds from programs that work. Between \n1993 and 2003, violent crime in this country declined by more than 50 \npercent--from 49.1 to 22.3 incidents of violence per 1,000 persons. \nThis is the exact same period of time when we provided over $1 billion \nto the COPS and Byrne programs alone.\n  Even after cuts to the program, last year the Byrne Program funded \n4,316 cops and prosecutors working on 764 drug enforcement task forces \nnationally. Byrne funding led to 130,000 drug arrests in 32 States, the \nseizure of 136 tons of illegal drugs, the confiscation of over 7,000 \nweapons, and the seizure of 7,691 meth labs. It is simply crazy that we \nare slashing over $200 million from this program in this bill.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference report \naccompanying H.R. 2862, the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related \nAgencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2006, but I do so with some \nreservations. To be sure, this bill funds many programs and agencies \nvital to the Nation's security and economic strength, and the conferees \nshould be complimented for drafting a balanced spending bill. However, \nthis appropriations measure is also supposed to fund local law \nenforcement and juvenile crime prevention programs, and in the past, it \ndid so successfully. Unfortunately, this year's version does not \nadequately fulfill the very important responsibility of supporting law \nenforcement and crime prevention programs.\n  Let us first consider the Edward J. Byrne Justice Assistance Grant \nProgram. For more than 30 years, Byrne grants have paid for State and \nlocal drug task forces, community crime prevention programs, substance \nabuse treatment programs, prosecution initiatives, and many other local \ncrime control programs. Talk to any police chief or sheriff back in \nyour home State and they will tell you that the Byrne program is the \nbackbone of Federal aid for local law enforcement. We should not walk \naway from a program with more than 30 years of success supporting our \nlocal police chiefs, sheriffs, and district attorneys.\n  Sadly, this conference report takes a step in that direction by \nproviding a little more than $416 million for the Byrne grant program. \nThat number represents a cut of more than $200 million from last year's \nlevel. Slashing the Byrne program in this manner will have a real and \nnegative impact on local police departments, district attorneys, and \ncommunity crime prevention programs.\n  The COPS program is another victim of this conference report. Though \nmy colleagues should be commended for increasing the overall COPS \nProgram from last year's level of $388 million to $478 million this \nyear, I am discouraged that we have zeroed out the Universal Hiring \nProgram completely this year. We should remember that just 3 years ago, \nthe overall COPS program received more than a billion dollars, and $330 \nmillion of that was for the hiring program which simply puts more cops \non the streets. And that simply has led to a reduction in crime. Do we \nwant to risk this success by abandoning a program that works?\n  Perhaps the biggest disappointment is how the title V Local \nDelinquency Prevention Program is treated in this appropriations bill. \nThe title V program is the only Federal program solely dedicated to \njuvenile crime prevention, and the conference report dedicates $65 \nmillion to it. But after one takes away all of the national earmarks \nthat are housed in title V--all worthy programs that I support like the \nGang Resistance, Education and Training, GREAT Program--title V is left \nwith a mere $5 million to spread across the entire country. That amount \nis not enough to build robust juvenile crime prevention programs. I \nshould hope that in the future, we can, at a minimum, fund the title V \nprogram at the Senate-passed level of $80\n\n[[Page S12923]]\n\nmillion and do so free of national program earmarks. To be sure, these \nother programs deserve federal dollars and should be funded as separate \nline items in order that title V can have sufficient program funds to \noperate successfully.\n  Make no mistake, juvenile crime prevention programs supported by \ntitle V are worth our support. According to many experts in the field, \nevery dollar spent on prevention saves three or four dollars in costs \nattributable to juvenile crime. And who can put a dollar value on the \nhundreds, even thousands of young lives turned from crime and into \nproductive work and community life by the juvenile crime prevention \ninitiatives supported by title V? We can and must do better.\n  This conference report is the product of many long hours of \nnegotiations and hard work. Subcommittee Chairman Shelby and Ranking \nMember Mikulski and their staffs deserve praise for a balanced product. \nIndeed, this bill is the result of compromise and I will vote in favor \nof it. But I hope that next year we can do a better job at helping our \noverworked local police officers and giving a ray of hope for \ndisadvantaged children who desperately need our help.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my disappointment \nwith respect to the funding level provided for Project Safe \nNeighborhoods in the fiscal year 2006 Commerce, Justice, and Science \nAppropriations conference report.\n  The President's Project Safe Neighborhoods has been one of the most \nincredibly successful crime prevention programs in our Nation. And \ntoday, we passed appropriations with tragically low funding for this \nimportant program that has been highly effective at removing from our \nstreets criminals who use guns to carry out their crimes.\n  When I was Attorney General of Texas, I joined with then Governor \nBush to launch Texas Exile. That program, modeled after the effective \nProject Exile in Richmond, VA, also was extraordinarily successful--\nproviding local prosecutors with the funds to get more than 2,000 guns \noff the streets and to issue more than 1,500 indictments for gun \ncrimes, resulting in almost 1,200 convictions in its first 3 years of \nexistence alone.\n  And when President Bush came to Washington, he built upon our success \nin Texas by making Project Safe Neighborhoods one of his top priorities \nand launching the Project Exile program nationally--providing badly \nneeded resources to jurisdictions throughout the country to combat gun \nrelated crimes.\n  And in the short time this initiative has been up and running, the \nresults have been astonishing. Project Safe Neighborhoods' prosecution, \nprevention and deterrence efforts have helped fuel historical lows in \ngun crime across America as well as a 30-year low in the violent crime \nvictimization rate. Over the past 4 years, Federal gun crime \nprosecutions have increased by 76 percent--and virtually all of these \ncriminals spend time in prison--for example, 94 percent in fiscal year \n2004.\n  The administration has devoted over $1.3 billion to implement Project \nSafe Neighborhoods since its inception in 2001. These funds have been \nused to hire almost 200 new Federal prosecutors dedicated to gun crime \nand provide grants to hire approximately 540 new State and local gun \nprosecutors.\n  While I appreciate any effort this body might take to embrace fiscal \ndiscipline--I question the efficacy of choosing to cut a program that \nliterally is saving thousands of lives nationwide and making our \nsociety increasingly safer just as we are seeing the significant \nsuccesses resulting from it.\n  The additional Federal funding for these State and local gun \nprosecutors, as well as the associated community outreach efforts and \nother important initiatives are critical to the success of the program \nand to the national reduction of violent crime.\n  That is why I was so concerned when I learned of the shortfall in \nthis funding. None of the $73,800,000 in grants for State and local \ngovernments requested by President Bush was included initially in \neither the House or Senate.\n  And I was not alone. Chairman Specter and Senators Grassley, Kyl, \nSessions and Coburn from the Judiciary Committee as well as Senators \nSantorum and Lugar joined me in requesting full funding for the program \nin a letter dated September 8, 2005.\n  And, I must thank my colleague from Alabama, Senator Shelby, as well \nas fellow Texan, Congressman Jim Culberson, and their respective \nstaffs, for their help in achieving at least a minimal amount of \nfunding of $15 million that we were able to get into the conference \nreport.\n  The Project Safe Neighborhoods program serves as a model of \ncoordinated government efforts--with Federal, State and local \ngovernments sharing the burden of prosecuting criminals and \ncoordinating their resources to do so. At a time when some Federal \nagencies struggle to coordinate efficiently with state and local \ngovernments--the Project Safe Neighborhoods program serves as a model \nof efficiency and effectiveness.\n  In closing, while I voted in favor of the appropriations conference \nreport because of its many important programs--I remain committed to \nseeking full funding for Project Safe Neighborhoods next year and in \nthe years to come and looking forward to working with my colleagues to \nensure that we keep America's streets safe from violent gun-using \ncriminals.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to the conference report to accompany H.R. 2862.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

After our bill on April 6 got 67 votes on \na procedural motion, Senator Graham and I agreed to an up-or-down vote \non our bill, S. 295, before the August recess.\n  In July, at the behest of Treasury Secretary Snow and Federal Reserve \nChairman Greenspan, we agreed to delay our vote on our bill until the \nend of the first session of the 109th. Well, that may well be this \nweek. We are finishing up business while the President is, in fact, \ngoing to be in China. Senator Graham and I do not think it would be \nappropriate to vote on this bill while the President is there so we \nhave agreed to delay.\n  Senators may recall that back on July 21, China promised to let \nmarket forces work and they revaluated their currency by a small but \nsignificant 2.1 percent. But they said the market should allow the \ncurrency to rise or fall about .3 percent a day. Unfortunately, that \nhas not happened. Since the original 2.1 percent revaluation of the \nyuan, the currency has moved as much in nearly 4 months as China said \nit would allow it to move in a single day. So in the whole 4 months, it \nhas not even moved a day's worth. Senator Graham and I, frankly, are \ndisappointed in the progress so far. We said at the time it was a good \nfirst baby step, but we need additional steps. Thus far, none have been \ntaken.\n  We are hopeful the President's trip to China will produce positive \nresults. We are willing to forestall our amendment to see what happens \non the President's trip.\n  Under the new agreement, Senator Graham and I can call up the bill in \nearly December, when Congress returns for votes, or early in the second \nsession, with a promise that the bill will be considered no later than \nMarch 31, 2006.\n  We hope and pray China will move. We do not want to dictate anything \nto the Chinese. We do not want to tell them how quickly they should \nmove or to what degree, but we do need to see some more movement on \nsomething that just about everyone agrees ought to happen. The delay of \nthis resolution will be salutary, we believe, to bringing some results.\n  I yield back my time to my colleague Senator Graham for some \nconcluding remarks. I would also yield the 5 minutes I have been ceded \nto Senator Graham so he may finish.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for giving a very \ngood explanation of where we started and where we are today and where \nwe hope to be in the future. Where we started was a situation where \nChina saw no self-interest in allowing their currency to meet \ninternational monetary standards of being valued by the market.\n\n  The practice of pegging the yuan to the dollar has created a \ntremendous manufacturing disadvantage for our manufacturers. It has \nhurt every competitor China deals with. It is a practice that needs to \nchange because China has changed.\n  Our goal is to allow that change to come about in a reasoned way, in \na win-win fashion. The change that occurred, as Senator Schumer spoke \nabout, where there was a slight revaluation, was a very good signal \ncoming from China. It was an optimistic event. Since then, 4 months \nlater, very little has happened.\n  I know the President is going to put it on the table when he goes to \nChina. We stand behind our President in this regard, that we in the \nSenate, 67 of us, anyway, and the President, through Secretary Snow, \nand the President himself, have been urging the Chinese to change their \ncurrency practices. It is the position of the administration that it \nshould float, while it is also the position of the Senate that China \nneeds to change their currency practices. As Alan Greenspan has said so \nwell, it is in China's self-interest.\n  I do hope, as Senator Schumer said, that after this meeting with \nPresident Bush there will be further progress. So I am guardedly \noptimistic but resolved to make sure we have a level playing field when \nit comes to dealing with China. This is an opportunity for a win-win. I \nhope the Chinese will take us up on it and we can have a better \nrelationship.\n  This one issue is one of the defining moments in the U.S.-China \nrelationship economically and we will see what time yields in terms of \nthese negotiations.\n  I yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the request is agreed to.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I commend my colleagues from New York and \nSouth Carolina. This is an appropriate way to handle this issue. \nClearly China pegging their yuan to the dollar has caused immense \ndislocations. It is also fairly clear that a 27-percent tariff on \nChinese products coming to the United States is an untenable position \nand it would not be the right action for the United States Congress to \nenact legislation which would enact a 27-percent tariff on Chinese \ngoods coming into the United States that, in effect, is a 27-percent \ntax on products that American consumers would otherwise be purchasing.\n  Having said that, it is a problem--that is, the Chinese failure to \nlet their currency float. They did let it float a little bit by a \ncouple percentage points not long ago, but most all observers agree \nthat is not enough. To some degree, this issue is tied to Chinese \nbanking reform. Chinese financial institutions have asked the United \nStates and other countries for advice on how to reform their system. \nThere are too many nonperforming loans in the Chinese banking system, \nwhich is related to China's inability thus far to let its currency \nvaluate totally freely. There will come a time--and the time is \nprobably sooner rather than later--when this will become an issue and \nit will come to a head.\n  Right now is not the time. The Finance Committee clearly takes this \nissue very seriously. We in the Finance Committee will pay great \nattention to the degree to which this measure, the Schumer-Graham \namendment, should be taken up and passed or modified before reporting \nit to the floor. Waiting until the end of March of next year certainly \nis appropriate.\n  I say to everyone concerned with this issue, we will act in time, and \nhopefully it is a time when it is an accommodation rather than a \nconfrontation. It is up to both sides of the Pacific, frankly--China \nand the States--to recognize that we have to get a resolution here. We \nare two great countries. It is by far better for each country to gauge \neach other appropriately with eyes wide open. It is not appropriate for \neither country to sort of stiff-arm each other.\n  We are here. We are on the world scene. China is on the world scene. \nChina has a huge interest, of course, in China's development but also a \nhuge interest in the stability of the U.S. economy. And vice versa; we \ndo, too, in China.\n  I urge real leadership in both countries to try to find a solid \nresolution so we can avoid confrontation. I again thank my friends from \nNew York and South Carolina for their statesmanlike approach to this; \nnamely, not pressing the issue abruptly but rather agreeing to \npostpone, until March 31, the next deadline.\n  Mr. President, I would like to turn to the bill before us. The Book \nof Proverbs counsels: ``Do not quarrel with a\n\n[[Page S12925]]\n\nman for no cause.'' One might rephrase that for modern times: ``Know \nwhen to take `yes' for an answer.'' That is how I feel about this tax \nbill before us today.\n  Last Tuesday, when the chairman of the Finance Committee gave notice \nof his intention to hold a markup on the tax reconciliation bill, I \nthought that we were going to have a knock-down, drug-out fight over \ncapital gains, dividends, and the budget deficit. Now it appears that \nwe are going to have an entirely different debate.\n  When Chairman Grassley first raised the issues of this tax bill with \nme, I told him: If you take capital gains and dividends out of the \nbill, I can support it. And the chairman and now the Finance Committee \nhave taken capital gains and dividends out of the bill. And now I do \nsupport it. I am willing to take ``yes'' for an answer.\n  I am gratified that the chairman and the committee have chosen to \nforgo the capital gains and dividend provisions that they once \ncontemplated. That is a fundamental change. And from this side of the \naisle, that is a welcome change.\n  The job of a committee chairman is a large part of brokerage job. A \ncommittee chairman tries to do the most that he can with the votes that \nhe has. I compliment the chairman of the Finance committee for being \namong the best at counting the votes. And I think that the bill that \nthe Finance Committee brings before us today represents the moderate \nconsensus of the Senate.\n  For many reasons, the bill before us today is not all that I would \nhave preferred. It is not always the case, as with any Senator. I would \nhave preferred that we had handled this tax cut legislation outside of \nthe reconciliation straightjacket. I would have preferred that we had \ndone more to address the immediate needs of the people affected by the \nhurricanes that ravaged the gulf States. I would have preferred that we \nhad done more to address active financing, the provision that we have \nto help our companies be competitive with companies overseas. And I \nwould have preferred that the committee would have paid for the tax cut \nin this bill. It is not appropriate by any stretch of the imagination \nthat we add to the deficit rather than not adding to the deficit.\n  But I know that the chairman and the majority leader would have \npreferred that the votes had added up a little differently in other \nways. That would have been their preference. I gave my preference. \nThey, their preference. Neither of us prevailed.\n  There are many good things in this mark. Extension of the R credit \nis crucial for American businesses to remain competitive. The \ndevastated Gulf States desperately need the help to rebuild that is in \nthe mark. And I appreciate the work that was done to extend the tax \nprovisions that we all know need to be extended. This is the business \nof the Finance Committee, to make sure that these extensions are \nextended so there is no cutoff date which causes a lot of problems for \npeople trying to plan, trying to determine what the future is. That is \nalso the business of the Senate.\n  The bill before the Senate today thus advances what we have in \ncommon. It avoids a massive quarrel.\n  Later, we will need to resist the fiscally irresponsible road down \nwhich the House of Representative seems headed. If the conference \nreports comes back to the Senate with capital gains and dividends it \nis, we will be back to a different bill. And will be back to the knock-\ndown, drag-out fight we have thus far avoided.\n  I am pleased that we have a bill before us without capital gains and \ndivided tax cuts it in. I am pleased that we received ``Yes'' for an \nanswer. ``Proverbs'' is something I think we should listen to from time \nto time. And as a result, I look forward to fewer quarrels on this bill \nover the balance of the week.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. I will ask the \nquorum call be equally charged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to tell my fellow Senators why \nthey should support this legislation, and most importantly thank \nDemocrats for being so patient while Republicans were figuring out a \ncompromise that we could get a majority of Republicans and all members \nof the committee behind. I thank Republicans for helping us work \nsomething out that we could get done. I have enjoyed the cooperation of \nSenator Baucus. Even though we haven't agreed on the details of this \nspecific piece of legislation--I think you heard Senator Baucus speak \nabout the bill that just passed the Senate, the pension bill--there was \nfull cooperation not only between Republicans and Democrats but between \ntwo different committees that had jurisdiction over it. There will be \ndifferences between Republicans and Democrats on this bill.\n  I compliment my colleague, Senator Baucus, for helping us move things \nalong and being so patient in the process.\n  This afternoon we begin consideration of an important tax relief \nmeasure. The bill before the committee today does three important \nthings. First, it acts on our commitment to provide rebuilding \nassistance to areas of the country devastated by this year's relentless \nhurricane season. Second, it provides tax relief for American families \nby ensuring that there is no interruption in tax provisions that are \nexpiring this year. And third, it provides incentives for increased \ncharitable giving while prohibiting transactions that misuse or abuse \ncharitable organizations and their assets.\n  An important part of this bill is delivery on a commitment we made to \nresidents of the gulf region, as well as more recently impacted areas \nof Texas and Florida, to provide much-needed relief and resources for \neconomic rebuilding to those areas.\n  I want to thank the members of the delegations from States that were \ndevastated by Katrina, Rita, and Wilma during this hurricane season. \nSpecifically, I would like to thank Senator Lott, a senior member of \nour Finance Committee. I would also like to thank Senators Cochran, \nLandrieu, Vitter, Shelby, Martinez, and Bill Nelson for their input.\n  I know some are disappointed we could not do more, especially with \nrespect to Rita and Wilma. But, with the revenue available, we could \nnot answer every need.\n  As promised, we have made our best effort to marry up our compassion \nfor displaced persons and damaged communities with attention to fiscal \ndiscipline and the best use of taxpayer dollars. This hurricane relief \npackage represents an effort to most efficiently and effectively use \nresources under the Finance Committee's jurisdiction to assist in the \nrebuilding and revitalization of those regions. I will reiterate the \nguiding principles of our hurricane relief legislation.\n  First, because market forces will be the driver in getting these \nregions back on their feet, our bill includes only provisions that \nencourage and incentivize redevelopment.\n  Second, our package provides resources only to those who incurred \nuninsured losses and does not provide for a bailout of those who \nassumed risk as an insurer in our capitalist, free-market system.\n  Third, we have focused our limited Federal resources on those most in \nneed--like the many devastated small business employers who were the \nbackbones of these economies and who will be the engines of their \nfuture growth and prosperity. And, finally, the bill provides front-\nloaded incentives on a timely basis to encourage people and businesses \nto return to the region as quickly as possible.\n  This bill also extends popular tax relief ranging from tax deductions \nfor families sending kids to college to relief from the expanding reach \nof the alternative minimum tax. If we let these provisions lapse, we \nare raising taxes on a significant number of taxpayers.\n  I would like to talk briefly about some of the important initiatives \nin our bill. The largest provision in the bill--about $30 billion of \ntax relief--amounts to half of the net tax package and is designed to \nkeep people out of\n\n[[Page S12926]]\n\nthe Alternative Minimum Tax. This piece of the package affects 14 \nmillion American families in every State in this Nation. The AMT is \nterrible and should be repealed. Until such time, we owe it to American \ntaxpayers to ensure that they are not hit by this stealth tax.\n  I have a chart here dealing with the AMT. It shows, by magnitude, the \nnumber of taxpayers, mostly families with kids, who would benefit from \nthe so-called AMT ``hold-harmless'' in this bill.\n  Now, everyone should know this information comes from the IRS \nStatistic of Income. This is the latest available government data on \nState-by-State effects from tax relief proposals in the 2001 and 2003 \nlegislation. With respect to the AMT, the number for 2006 will roughly \ndouble what is shown on this chart. So, any Member who looks at his or \nher State, should understand the number of families affected will \ndouble next year.\n  There will be critics. You are familiar with them. We all know who \nthey are. They will appear with their charts and their over-the-top \nrhetoric. They will appear here today and they will claim that our \nhold-harmless isn't good enough. These critics are very good at \ncriticizing. Let me assure everyone that I don't just want the hold-\nharmless. I want to reform or eliminate the AMT. I challenge the \ncritics in advance, just as I did in the Spring debates on the budget \nresolution, to propose an AMT reform plan. Don't just whine about it. \nJoin me in fixing it. I look forward to the critics' plan to fix the \nAMT.\n  This bill also includes popular and broadly-applicable tax benefits. \nI will talk about them individually and use charts as I move along.\n  Let's take a look at the deductibility of college tuition. This is a \nbenefit for families who send their kids to college. By definition, \nthis benefit goes to middle-income families. A lot of these folks \naren't low-income, so their kids don't qualify for Pell grants. But \nthey are not high-income either. They get the full benefit of the \ndeduction if they make up to $65,000 as a single person or $130,000 as \na couple. Beyond those levels, the benefit phases out. A lot of these \nfolks are paying significant Federal, State and local taxes and they \nget no help in defraying the high cost of their kids' college \neducation.\n  This tax deduction provides help to these hard-pressed middle-income \nfamilies with a benefit and furthers an important national goal of \nsupport for higher education. This deduction runs out at the end of \nthis year. These families will face a tax increase if we don't act on \nthis bill. This chart shows the number of families on a State-by-State \nbasis that benefit from the deduction.\n  Another benefit addressed in this bill is the small savers' credit. \nHere, I am talking about a tax credit for low-income folks that save \nthrough an IRA or pension plan. We all think savings is important. We \nall want low-income folks to save for retirement. This chart shows the \nnumber of low-income savers who benefit in this bill on a State-by-\nState basis.\n  The bill also extends a tax deduction for teachers who buy their own \nsupplies for their students. This provision, developed by Senators \nWarner and Collins, makes whole teachers who go the extra mile by \npaying out-of-pocket expenses. Who could argue with that? I'm going to \npoint to a chart that shows on a State-by-State basis the number of \nteachers taking this deduction.\n  This bill also extends small business expensing. Many small \nbusinesses use this benefit to buy equipment on an efficient after-tax \nbasis. It is good for small business. It is good for small business \nworkers. It is good for economic growth.\n  My final chart deals with the State and local sales tax deduction.\n  For the States of Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South \nDakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming, this bill helps 12.3 \nmillion taxpayers in your States. Tennessee is the home of my friend, \nthe majority leader. He has worked hard to get this bill to the floor. \nNevada is the home of my friend, the Democratic leader. Unfortunately, \nthe Democratic leader has fought this bill tooth and nail. Hopefully, \nhe will see the light now that we are on the floor. I hope he will work \nwith me to guarantee that folks in his State will be able to deduct \ntheir sales taxes next year.\n  These provisions are bipartisan and millions of American taxpayers \nrely on them. Every Senator ought to help us pass this bill for these \nprovisions alone.\n  The bill addresses expiring business and individual provisions known \nas the ``extenders.'' These provisions include the research and \ndevelopment tax credit and the work opportunity tax credit.\n  This bill also includes many of the charitable incentives introduced \nin the CARE Act and which have previously passed the Finance Committee \nand the Senate. I appreciate the work of Senators Santorum and Baucus \nin working with me to balance these incentives with several of the much \nneeded reforms that are supported by the charitable sector, the \nTreasury Department, I.R.S. and donors and taxpayers overall.\n  Last, but not least, this bill contains loophole closers and tax \nshelter fighting provisions that raise revenue.\n  This bill is bipartisan. I thank my friend and ranking member, \nSenator Baucus, for his cooperation. He and I were not partners on this \nbill at the beginning and through a large part of the process, but we \nteamed up yesterday in the Finance Committee. As always, his \ncooperation and good humor make a big difference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent it be charged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from North \nDakota?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from North Dakota \nfor purposes of offering an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was not aware that time had to be \nyielded for the purpose of offering an amendment. I appreciate that, \nbut the Presiding Officer was asking ``who yields time.'' My \nunderstanding is a Senator can seek recognition and, therefore, offer \nan amendment on his own volition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Chair was not \naware that the Senator from North Dakota was going to offer an \namendment, but thought we were in general debate.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2587\n\n   (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to impose a \n   temporary windfall profit tax on crude oil and to rebate the tax \n    collected back to the American consumer, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I offer an amendment on behalf of myself, \nSenator Dodd, Senator Boxer, Senator Reed of Rhode Island, and Senator \nLieberman. I send the amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Reed, and Mr. Lieberman, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 2587.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is not a new subject. It is one \nmyself, Senator Dodd, and others have spoken about on the floor, as a \nmatter of fact, in recent days and weeks.\n  Let me describe briefly that it is, in fact, an amendment that is \nidentical to the legislation we have offered that would create a \nwindfall profits tax on profits of the major integrated oil companies, \nprofits above $40 a barrel for oil, the purpose of which would be to \ncollect that money and rebate it in its\n\n[[Page S12927]]\n\nentirety to consumers. Or in the alternative, if the major integrated \noil companies are using that money to invest into the ground or to \nbuild refineries above ground to expand the supply of energy and, \nthereby, bring down the price, they would be completely exempt from the \nwindfall profits tax.\n  If they are using their profits above $40 a barrel for the purpose of \nbuying back stock, ``drilling for oil on Wall Street,'' as I will \ndescribe in a few minutes, or for other purpose that will not expand \nthe supply of oil or the supply of energy, then they would be paying a \nwindfall profits tax on profits above $40 a barrel at the rate of 50 \npercent--a 50-percent excise tax--all of which would come into the \nFederal Government, all of which would be rebated by check to \nindividuals in this country in order to help pay for the higher cost of \nenergy that individuals are now facing.\n  This is very simple. This is not a complex amendment. We are not \ntrying to recalculate income or do things that are particularly \ndifficult. The proposition is simply this: Last year, the major \nintegrated oil companies in this country earned the highest profits in \ntheir history. The average price for a barrel of oil was $40 a barrel, \nand at that price the major integrated oil companies had the highest \nprofits in their history.\n  Now the price is dramatically above that. It has bounced around from \n$50 to $60 to $70 a barrel, well above the $40 a barrel, and the \nprofits by the major integrated oil companies--and that is all our \namendment deals with, the major integrated oil companies--the profits \nhave been extraordinary.\n  The third quarter profits: $9.9 billion for ExxonMobil. I have a list \nof a number of them I can show. But the third quarter profits are very \nsubstantial--the highest in the history of corporate America. So you \nhave all of this gain by the major integrated oil companies, and then \nall of the pain on the other side. The major integrated oil companies \nhave all of the gain. Who has all the pain? All the American people who \nare trying to pay for the price of a tankful of gas or trying to figure \nout how they are going to heat their home in the winter or trying to \nfigure out, if they are a farmer, how on Earth they can order that next \nload of fuel so they will be able to go into the field in the spring. \nHow do they pay for all that? That is where all the pain is. You have \nall the gain on one side, and all the pain on the other side.\n  Now, we are told this is just a free market. In fact, I had kind of a \nmini-lecture about that from the president of Exxon, the CEO of Exxon. \nHe came to the Commerce-Energy Committee hearing we had, the joint \nhearing, and he kind of gave me a short little mini-lecture about the \nmarketplace: This is the marketplace. Interestingly, he did not say: \nThe free market. He said: The world market.\n  Well, let's think about this for a moment: the world market. For \nExxonMobil, $9.9 billion in profits they made just in the last quarter. \nThe world market, he says. Well, let me tell you about the world \nmarket. The world market, first, is the OPEC ministers sitting around a \ntable someplace in a closed room talking about production and, \ntherefore, the impact on price. Second, it is the major integrated oil \ncompanies that are larger by far than they have ever been because of \nblockbuster mergers. They all have two names now. It used to be Exxon \nand Mobil. Now it is ExxonMobil. It used to Chevron and Texaco. Now it \nis ChevronTexaco. We didn't know they were dating, and they got \nmarried. Now, pretty soon, it is going to be \n``ChevronTexacoShellExxonMobil.'' It will be all one name. They don't \nseem to drop any names; they just get bigger and bigger.\n  So the second part--after the OPEC ministers talk about production \nand price--is these folks, the major integrated oil companies, that are \nbigger because of blockbuster mergers and have more raw muscle in the \nmarketplace than they have ever had before.\n  Third, and finally, we have what are called futures markets. The \nfutures markets are supposed to provide liquidity for trading. Instead, \nit has become a speculative bazaar, a grand bazaar of speculation. And \nthat then gives us what is called the world price--not a free market \nprice. This has no relationship to either freedom or the marketplace. \nThis is not a free market. What we have is all of this gain and all of \nthe pain on the part of the consumers.\n  Let me describe a little about what is happening here. Last year, we \nhad the highest profits in our history for the major integrated oil \ncompanies. BusinessWeek wrote an article. BusinessWeek is not some \nliberal rag someplace. We are not talking about some progressive \nmagazine. BusinessWeek is a solid, conservative business magazine. Here \nis what they say: Why isn't big oil drilling more? Rather than \ndeveloping new fields of oil, giants have preferred to buy rivals, \ndrilling for oil on Wall Street.\n  All right. They were talking about last year. Last year, ExxonMobil \nmade $25 billion in net income. They spent almost $10 billion to buy \nback their stock. Does anybody think that expands the supply of oil? \nNo. No. No. That is an approach that certainly makes the stock options \nof the CEOs much more valuable. It enhances and enriches the \ncorporation. It does nothing at all with respect to expanding America's \nenergy supply and thereby bringing down prices.\n  So BusinessWeek says: Why are they drilling for oil on Wall Street? \nOil has been over $20 a barrel since mid-1999. That should have been \nample incentive for companies to open new fields since projects are \ndesigned to be profitable with prices as low as the mid-teens. \nNevertheless, drilling has lagged. Far from raising money to pursue \nopportunities, oil companies are paying down debt, buying back shares, \nand hoarding cash.\n  That, from BusinessWeek. Question: If this was the case at $40 a \nbarrel, and oil goes to $60, $65, and $70 a barrel, and consumers bear \nall of this pain--an increased pain from high prices that in many cases \nthey cannot afford--for a product they must have to drive to work, to \nheat their homes, to prepare for spring planting, is that fair?\n  The answer clearly is no.\n  Will somebody do something about it? Will somebody stand up and say \nit is time to do something about it? I hope the answer to that is yes.\n  Just a few headlines. This is from last month: High energy prices \nlift profits of ConocoPhillips by 89 percent. Its third-quarter profits \nalmost doubled, the first big American company to report earnings for \nthe third quarter. Net income jumped 89 percent.\n  ExxonMobil, from October 27: $9.9 billion in one quarter, up 75 \npercent.\n  From earlier this year: Big Oil's Burden of Too Much Cash. The \nworld's ten biggest oil companies earned more than $100 billion in the \nyear 2004, a windfall greater than the economic output of Malaysia. \nTheir sales are expected to exceed $1 trillion for the year 2004, more \nthan Canada's gross domestic product.\n  It goes on to say: ExxonMobil, the world's largest publicly traded \ncompany, earned more than $25 billion last year and spent $9.95 billion \nto buy back its own stock.\n  I mentioned that earlier, but that, in fact, is the case. At the \nhearing with the major CEOs of the big oil companies, I asked that \nquestion of the CEO of ExxonMobil. These were people that run \nExxonMobil gas stations in the Washington, DC-Virginia-Maryland region. \nSeptember 9, this is titled, ``Finger Pointing Begins As Gas Prices \nJump 24 Cents in 24 Hours; Exxon Dealers Say They Are Chafing Under \nHigher Prices Decreed From Atop; Station Owners Accuse Big Oil Company \nof Profiting From Impact of Hurricane Katrina.''\n  That is very important to point out. Hurricane Katrina hurt these oil \ncompanies. Oil was well over $60 a barrel before the first hurricane \nstarted circulating in the gulf. That is not what got us $60-plus-per-\nbarrel oil. You have gasoline station dealers saying that Exxon was the \none that said, through wholesale prices, you must charge 24 cents more \nin a 24-hour period. They said: What is going on here?\n  So I asked Mr. Raymond. Well, he wasn't sure that happened. I said: \nThis was a public charge about your company. Didn't you investigate it?\n  No. We didn't. We might have. I don't know. He wasn't sure.\n  Let me back up a step to talk about the slightly larger picture and \nthen come back to this question of fairness. We have a serious problem \nwith energy, there is no question about it. This old planet of ours \nhosts the U.S. citizens in this little part of the planet. There are\n\n[[Page S12928]]\n\nabout 6.4 billion people who live on this planet as we spin around the \nSun. We have a prodigious demand, a huge demand for oil in this little \nspot called the United States. We suck up--when I say ``we,'' the royal \n``we''--everybody sucks up about 84 million barrels of oil every day \nfrom this earth. Eighty-four million barrels a day are produced from \nunderneath this earth. We also use 84 million barrels a day on this \nplanet. It turns out that 21 million of that 84 is used right here in \nthis country. This country uses one-fourth of all of the oil that is \npulled out of the ground.\n  Is that going to change? Sure. China now has 20 million cars on the \nroad. By the year 2020, 15 years from now, it will have 120 million \ncars. Add 100 million cars to the mix and the demand to run something \nthrough those carburetors or fuel injectors, probably gasoline, ask \nyourself, in a planet where you are pulling up 84 million barrels a day \nand this country is using 21 million, one-fourth of it, and we have a \ndemand that now comes from other countries saying, We want some of \nthat, and by the way, we want to have more vehicles on the road--China, \nas an example--where does the additional oil come from? We have serious \nissues and significant long-term problems that we have to deal with.\n  I have my own feelings about that. I largely helped write the \nhydrogen fuel cell title in the Energy bill. I have ideas about what we \nneed to do. We need to grow energy in our fields with renewable fuels, \nethanol, biodiesel. There are so many other things we need to do, \nincluding encourage the transition of hybrid cars as we move toward a \nhydrogen fuel cell future. All of those things I will discuss at \ngreater length at some other time. But at the moment, we live now. We \ncan talk about the longer run. John Kenneth Galbraith used to say, in \nthe long run, we are all dead. But we go into this winter, as consumers \nin this country, confronting a fuel bill that has dramatically \nincreased over last year, and then reading in the newspaper in the \nmorning, wearing a sweater in a home that you have to keep a couple of \ndegrees cooler in order to afford to heat your home, that ExxonMobil \nhas a 75-percent or 89-percent profit or all the majors are showing \nmassive profit increases. So while they sit there fat and happy, \nracking up the profits, everybody else is trying to figure out how they \npay the price. How do you scrape up the money to heat the home, to fill \nthe car, to fill the tanks so that your tractor and farm equipment is \nready in the spring?\n  People say: Well, if that is a problem for you, that is tough luck. \nThere are a couple of economists writing in recent days--I won't name \nthem--who can tell us everything about the future but can't remember \ntheir home phone number. You know the type. They are telling us what \nwill happen here is if people can't afford to pay the cost of energy, \nit will force them to conserve more. Easy to say for one of these \neconomists who drive around town in their Volvo or Mercedes cogitating \nabout the future. What about the people who have to use a car to drive \nto work, have to fill the tank with gas but don't have the money to do \nso, or the people who understand they live in the northern part of this \ncountry where we have tough winters and they have to pay the heating \nbill and it costs a lot of money and they don't have it? What about \nthat?\n  Senator Dodd and I have offered a proposal. It is widely reviled by \nthe major oil companies. I understand that. For them, it is the hog \nrule: Give us what we want, we want everything, and what you don't get \ndoesn't matter to us. After all, energy is not something that is like \nevery other commodity.\n  I did an interview with a radio person the other day, and he said: If \nyou are going to have a windfall profits tax with respect to oil \nprofits above $40, what about a windfall profits tax on the shares of \nGoogle? I said: Do you drive up to your gas station and say, Fill it up \nwith Google? Gasoline is different. Gassing up your car, providing \nnatural gas or home heating fuel for your home is different. It is a \nnecessity. Everybody needs to do it. It is part of what we are as \nAmericans. It is the way we live. In the long term, we have to make \nsome changes, maybe so. But in the short term, we live now at a time \nwhen the major oil companies are exhibiting the highest profits in \ntheir history, and everybody else is trying to figure out how on earth \nto pay the bills.\n  Senator Dodd and I put together the simplest possible plan. We have \nsaid: If oil continues at this level, understanding that last year, at \n$40 a barrel, they had the highest profits in their history for the \nmajor integrated companies, we say, for the major integrated oil \ncompanies, if the price of oil is over $40 a barrel, we believe that is \na windfall profit having nothing to do with fairness or the free \nmarket. If the oil companies, however, use that extra money to sink \nback into the ground for exploration and drilling or to build \nrefineries above ground, to do the things that would expand the supply \nof energy and thereby reduce energy prices, our proposal will not \nimpact them at all. They will not be taxed. We still don't like the \nprices, but it won't affect them. They are doing the right thing to \nexpand the supply of energy, which will ultimately bring down the price \nof energy. But if they do not do that--and they are not; they are \nbuying back their stock, hoarding cash, drilling for oil on Wall \nStreet; they are not doing the right thing--then they would be subject \nto a 50-percent excise tax on those windfall profits above $40.\n\n  Senator Dodd and I, unlike others, would not suggest we bring that \nmoney into the Federal Government and let it rest here. We suggest that \nmoney be brought here and sent out immediately in its entirety as a \nrebate to the consumers of this country who are paying the bills. They \nare the ones who are hurt. They are the ones from whom these profits \ncame. They are the ones entitled to have the rebate, if the oil \ncompanies are not going to use those profits to expand the supply of \nour country's energy and oil.\n  This is a hard proposal to misunderstand. Let me just say, there are \nmany who have deliberately done so. Yesterday, a study came across my \ndesk that appeared to have been paid for by an entity called Investors-\nShareholders Alliance. Actually, I Googled them on my computer to find \nout who on Earth this is. But they have been able not to leave traces, \neven with a Google search. But I don't need to know who they are \nwithout understanding who funded that study. That study purported to \nevaluate a windfall profits tax by number, which was our bill, and the \ntwo authors of the study had not bothered to read it, misdescribed it, \nand analyzed it in a way that was dishonest.\n  So the press people called me and asked for my reaction. I said: It \nis a complete joke, perhaps a Ph.D. joke. These people have really big \ndegrees and tiny glasses and think they are pretty smart. It is just \nthat they forgot to read our legislation because they evaluated \nsomething else and attached our number to it. I am assuming that was \npaid for by the big oil companies. God bless them. They have plenty of \nmoney. They will have lots of money to defend themselves against this \nproposal that we offer today.\n  I wish no ill will toward the oil companies. I don't. That is not the \npurpose of this. We produce oil in my State, and I have done plenty of \nthings to be supportive of those who really want to expand America's \nenergy supply and drill for oil. But when I see $65-a-barrel oil and I \nsee people who can't afford to pay the price struggling to figure out \nhow to live day to day, putting gas in the car and heating homes, and \nthen I see record profits announced every single day in the newspapers, \nI say something is wrong, something is disconnected. It seems to me it \nfalls on the shoulders of this Congress to stand up and do something \nabout it.\n  On this vote, the question is, Who do you stand with and who do you \nstand for? We have separate interests, the interests of the largest oil \ncompanies who would like even higher profits. When one person said to \nme, Well, why is it a windfall at $65 a barrel, I said, Let me ask you \na question. What if it were $165 a barrel? Would you think that was too \nmuch, or doesn't that matter to you?\n  At $40 a barrel, I would say, finally, last year the major integrated \noil companies, larger by far than they have ever been because of \nblockbuster mergers, made the highest profits in their history. Now \nthey have dramatically expanded those profits at the expense\n\n[[Page S12929]]\n\nof American consumers. I believe it is unfair. Our amendment would at \nleast begin down the road to try to do something about it. I am pleased \nto have offered the amendment with my colleague from Connecticut, \nSenator Dodd.\n  I yield the floor so he may amplify on my comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from North Dakota who \nhas more than adequately and eloquently described this simple proposal \nthat has some significant implications but, nonetheless, one that is \nclear and straightforward. Let me repeat what my colleague from North \nDakota has stated.\n  First and foremost, these are not two Senators who believe that oil \ncompanies ought not to be able to earn a profit. In fact, our economy \ndepends entirely on the capitalistic system, the profit motive. But all \nof us have learned historically that there are times when, in the \nabsence of some restraint, the profit motive can cause such disruption, \nsuch a misalignment in economic circumstances, that it is imperative \nthat those in positions of responsibility try to step in to do \nsomething about it. That is clearly what we are trying to do here. The \nunderlying purpose of this amendment is to provide some relief to \nconsumers.\n  The New York Times reported the other day that one business has been \npaying roughly $700,000 for its energy needs. The company anticipated \nits energy costs this year will be $1.4 million, virtually doubling the \ncost of its energy needs in a brief period of time.\n  We know, as a result of these rising costs, what consumers are likely \nto pay for home heating oil. And while we have seen some abatement in \nthe cost of the price of gasoline, clearly the prices are still very \nhigh. We believe these individuals deserve a break.\n  We talk about tax breaks for people who need them. Clearly, the \npeople who will be paying these costs deserve to have some relief. But \nwe quickly point out that this is a choice the industry can make \nbecause what the Senator from North Dakota has said is: If, in fact, \nyou do what you ought to be doing, and that is to plow these profits \nback into energy creation, energy production, development of resources, \nthere won't be an excess profits tax. That is an option that the \nindustry can have at this juncture and one we would hope they would be \nengaging in. It was stunning to find out that they are taking virtually \nhalf of their profits and just buying back their own stock rather than \ninvesting in the expanded development of energy resources.\n  So at the outset, I want to be very clear. We do not begrudge any \ncompany, even an oil company, making a profit and a good profit. It is \nthe engine that keeps our economy moving forward. But as we have said, \nthere is a huge difference between profits and profiteering, and it is \nprofiteering, in our view, that is occurring here.\n  In the opinion of many, the big oil companies have been engaged in \njust that, in profiteering. The concept of profiteering is not a new \none, and this would not be the first time that the Congress of the \nUnited States has acted as a watchdog against such profiteering.\n  One of the most high profile cases was during World War II when Harry \nTruman, then a Member of this body, chaired an investigation into the \nprofiteering that was going on among wartime businesses. The concept of \nprofiteering is also not new to this particular industry which operates \nin a market dominated by the OPEC cartel and a few large corporate \nconglomerates.\n  Over the past several years, we have seen a steady and steep increase \nin the price of oil. In the year 2000, when the Northeast Heating Oil \nReserve was established because of concerns that I and others had about \nheating oil supply and price, crude oil was trading at $30 per barrel. \nToday, just five years later, the price of crude oil has more than \ndoubled. Refining capacity is near 100 percent, yet over the past 25 \nyears, 176 refineries have closed in the United States. And last month, \nthe five largest oil companies recorded record third-quarter profits.\n  So here we are. Refining capacity is nearly 100 percent, and 176 \nrefineries in the last 25 years have closed their doors.\n  ExxonMobil, as this graph here points out, had profits in one \nquarter, 3 months, of $9.92 billion. Imagine the work that went on in \nthe accounting department to make sure it wasn't $10 billion--we will \nsqueeze it down to $9.92 billion, the largest quarterly profit ever \nreaped by an American corporation in the history of our Nation. In \norder to make that profit, ExxonMobil took in a record $100.7 billion \nin revenue in just those 3 months. To put those numbers in perspective, \nit is larger than the annual gross domestic product of the United Arab \nEmirates, a large oil-producing nation. Shell Oil earned third-quarter \nprofits of just over $9 billion. BP earned profits of $6.53 billion, \nand ChevronTexaco earned $3.6 billion. ConocoPhillips earned profits of \n$3.8 billion. That is all in 3 months. That is a total of $32.8 billion \nin profits in 12 weeks.\n  Mr. President, we all recognize that the gulf coast hurricanes \ntemporarily shook the oil industry as it did other industries, \ninterrupting refining and distribution systems across the country, and \nit may be some time before all operations are back to normal. We \nrecognize that. But that does not explain the steadily rising oil and \ngasoline prices that consumers and businesses experienced in the months \nbefore the hurricanes. Long before any wind and rain hit the gulf \ncoast, these prices were skyrocketing.\n  There is evidence that the oil industry deliberately restricted \nsupply to boost profits.\n  Let me explain using their own language in their own reports, by the \nway. One major oil company in their 2004 annual report says the \nfollowing:\n\n       We achieved the highest net income in our history, 18.2 \n     billion. This was 48 percent higher than in 2003 as a result \n     of higher oil and gas prices.\n\n  The report goes on to say that these higher profits occurred at the \nsame time that the company produced 3 percent less oil than the year \nbefore. They produced less and had almost a 50-percent jump in profits. \nMr. President, that is not a coincidence, in my view. It was a \ndeliberate move to raise prices by restricting supply.\n  It was not long ago that Enron traders were caught on tape colluding \nto manipulate energy prices during the California energy crisis of \n2001. One trader was reported telling the operator of a power plant:\n\n       We want you guys to get a little more creative and come up \n     with a reason to [shut the plant] down.\n\n  Mr. President, we don't have anything on tape here from these oil \ncompany CEOs, but clearly when you look at some of the reports, they \nbrag about 50 percent profits and yet also point to a 3-percent drop in \nproduction.\n  So given the circumstance of fewer refineries operating at or near \ncapacity, coupled with the increased demand for oil and gas, all we are \nasking is that these industries reinvest their profits to find \nalternative sources and types of energy.\n  In the Energy bill that passed only a few weeks ago, we provide \nmassive tax breaks for the energy industry, and yet even with that they \ndon't want to go out and invest in energy resources to boost energy \nsupply. Instead, profits are used to buy back stock or engage in these \nmega mergers.\n  My colleague is right to point out; just look at the names. There \nused to be a Conoco; there used to be a Phillips. Now it is \nConocoPhillips. There used to be a Chevron; there used to be a Texaco. \nNow it is ChevronTexaco. There used to be an Exxon; there used to be a \nMobil. Now it is ExxonMobil. I was born at night but not last night, \nMr. President. I know what is going on. You don't have to be an \neconomist or have a Ph.D. in economics to figure out what is going on \nhere.\n  The simple question is, Do we let this happen and just twiddle our \nthumbs or do we try to do something about it? And we have offered a \nsimple alternative. The alternative is to provide the rebate and give \nthe people who are paying these increased prices a break.\n  Let me also be clear that the windfall profits rebate is nothing like \nthe one imposed in 1980. First and foremost, the money would be rebated \nto consumers. The 1980 windfall profits tax was passed to ensure that \nthe oil industry paid its fair share of taxes to the\n\n[[Page S12930]]\n\nFederal Government. We are not suggesting that here at all. Just as \nimportant, this amendment would apply only to large integrated oil \ncompanies, not the independent producers and refiners. They are exempt \nunder the Dorgan-Dodd proposal. The structure of the tax is different \nas well. In 1980, the tax was imposed on the difference between the \nmarket price of oil and the statutory 1979 base price, adjusted \nquarterly. Our amendment proposes a 50-percent profits tax only on the \nprofit over $40 per barrel. As my colleague from North Dakota has \nalready eloquently pointed out, that number was not chosen arbitrarily.\n\n  At that level, record profits were earned by the industry. Yet that \nprice today is substantially more than $40 per barrel. In 1980, the tax \nincluded nearly every barrel of oil produced, and thus domestic \nproduction suffered. If oil companies do the right thing to increase \nsupply, then there will be no windfall profits tax incurred. I don't \nknow how else to get their attention. Jawboning doesn't seem to work. \nSo why don't we join in a bipartisan way and say to the oil companies--\ninvest in the energy needs of our Nation and, if not, provide some \nrelief to the people out there who are paying these tremendously \nincreased prices.\n  If domestic production stays relatively constant at 5.2 million \nbarrels a day and oil continues to sell at nearly $65 a barrel, then \nthe windfall profits tax will be approximately $65 million a day.\n  This is money that constituents of ours across the country could use \nto offset the record price increases expected for home heating oil this \nwinter or to combat the rising costs of goods and services that are \ntransported on trucks and rails.\n  I pointed out one business that the New York Times identified the \nother day as expecting their energy costs to double from $700,000 to a \n$1.4 million. Obviously, they are going to pass it on as a cost of \nproduction. The consumers will pay the additional cost.\n  I noticed--I see my good friend from Utah--last night the snow was \nbeginning to fall in the home State of my spouse and the State the \ndistinguished Senator represents. This is not just a New England issue. \nIt is going to happen across the country where many expect record cold \ntemperatures this winter. This is not a situation where consumers have \na choice. You don't have a choice to stay warm or not warm, to provide \nfor your family or not provide for your family. These people who travel \nto work every day don't have a choice whether to get into an \nautomobile. They don't have mass-transit systems. There is no other \nchoice but to put gasoline in that car and go to work. Those companies \nhave no choice other than to shut down or swallow the cost and pass it \non to their customers.\n  It is clear that rising energy costs are a drag on the economy, for \nindividuals, for families, businesses, or farmers, and while gasoline \nprices are coming down all across the Nation to some degree, they are \nstill on average 32 cents per gallon higher than they were just a year \nago. And as the winter weather begins to bear down on us, consumers are \nbracing for higher heating costs. The prices in my State and across the \nnorthern tier States are going to go up.\n  This windfall profits rebate is a solution for working families \nacross our Nation. It is more than the administration or many of our \ncolleagues have proposed. Every time we try to ease the financial \nburden on individuals and families, we are met with opposition. We have \nnot been able to raise the minimum wage in 9 years. We can't increase \nthe funding for low-income home energy assistance at all. We have been \nunable to realistically address fuel efficiency. Senator Jack Reed of \nRhode Island has offered the home heating assistance amendment. Senator \nKerry of Massachusetts has also offered it. In the past, we have had \njoint efforts by Republicans and Democrats on the LIHEAP program. That \nhas all been turned down. Why not do this? If you don't want to have \nthe general revenues pay for increased help, why not ask that these \nadditional huge profits that are being made go back and provide some \nrelief to people?\n  The administration has been asleep at the wheel for the last several \nyears and was adamantly opposed to embracing conservation measures. In \nfact, in 2001, Vice President Cheney said:\n\n       Conservation may be a sign of personal virtue but it is not \n     a sufficient basis all by itself for sound, comprehensive \n     energy policy.\n\n  So you can imagine my surprise when the administration trotted out a \nconservation program, headed by the ``Energy Hog,'' as they call him. I \napplaud their late arrival to the benefits of conservation, but I am \nvery disappointed that they have done nothing to stem the rising cost \nof fuel in our Nation. They brought the oil companies in when they were \noriginally crafting their energy policy, but they have been unwilling \nto jawbone either OPEC or the large oil companies when individuals, \nfamilies, and businesses are suffering.\n  This is an amendment that will have tangible benefits to consumers \nwithout undermining the oil industry. It gives the oil companies a \nchoice. I hope our colleagues here on both sides of the aisle would \nembrace the Dorgan-Dodd amendment. I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I came over to make some remarks in morning \nbusiness until I heard the remarks of my colleagues on the other side. \nI have to say that the windfall profits tax that we enacted a number of \nyears ago, I voted against it. It did not work. It was a disaster. I \nthink this would be an equal disaster. A lot of these folks on the \nother side are the people who today own a lot of drilling offshore \nwhere we know billions of gallons of oil are, who have fought against \nANWR where they have estimated at least 6 to 8 billion barrels of oil \nlie ready to be recovered from a plot of ground as small as 2,000 \nacres--equal to the Dulles airport acreage.\n  And you could go on and on about how they have made it almost \nimpossible to drill, to build refineries, to do the things that have to \nbe done to bring oil and gas prices down--almost every argument that \nhas come from the other side. And now we are here trying to tax the \ncompanies that now are making very good profits, the very companies \nthat are considering how can they find more oil and gas, how can they \ndrill offshore, how can they drill up in Alaska where there is a lot of \noil and gas, and how can we duplicate what they have done up there in \nCanada with their tar sands. Canada has not been stupid about recovery, \nand it has cost billions of dollars of investment by oil companies to \ndo what they are doing.\n  Today Canada is producing a million barrels of oil a day, and before \ntoo long that number will grow to 3.5 million barrels a day, mostly \nfrom their tar sands. I might add that they now have the second largest \noil reserves in the world today, second only to Saudi Arabia, and that \nis 1 million barrels a day from the tar sands and approximately 1 \nmillion barrels from other energy sources. We have just as big of a \nresource in the U.S., but our companies can not get access to it. It's \nbecoming too difficult to get the necessary permits which are often \ncompletely bottled up by the environmentalists, even in areas where \ndrilling would be environmentally safe.\n  I think the height of stupidity was locking up the Saudi Arabia of \ncoal, which happens to be in Utah, by creating the Grand Staircase-\nEscalante Monument. President Clinton closed up 60 miles south of Utah, \nan area larger than the Grand Canyon, without having talked or \nconsulted with one political official in all of Utah--not the Governor, \nnot Members of the Senate or House of Representatives, not even \nDemocrats in Utah. That coal is high-moisture, low-sulfur content, \nenvironmentally sound coal, which, if blended with the less clean coal \nof the east and the central part of our country would save billions of \ntons of particulates in the air. The arguments for closing off that \nhuge source of clean energy are very similar to the arguments being \nmade today by my two illustrious colleagues, for whom I care a great \ndeal.\n  It is wonderful for some to get out here and beat up on the big old \noil companies. It was just yesterday when I was chatting with one of \nthe largest oil companies, and more than anything, they want to invest \nin new development and take advantage of incentives we put into the \nEnergy bill. They want to develop the tar sands and oil shale\n\n[[Page S12931]]\n\nin our country, we are 15 to 20 years behind Canada on this, so that we \ncan lower the price of oil and gas in this country, so that our good \nfriends in the eastern and northeastern part of this country do not \nhave to pay the high prices they are paying. These oil companies are \noften not able, even when they make these profits, to drill because \nthey cannot get permits and, in some areas, cannot even drill where we \nknow there are billions of barrels of oil that would lower the price of \noil and gas.\n  That is why I have found this a little hard to take, as I have been \nsitting here--I didn't plan on talking on this issue. But I am one of \nthose who put into the Energy bill incentives to develop our tar sands \nand oil shale, our geothermal, our natural gas, and to develop more \nrefineries because over the last 35 years, we have lost 200 refineries \nand only built 1. Why? Because it is so doggone hard to get approvals \nto build refineries in this country.\n  We can't even produce the amount of refined petroleum we need for our \nautomobiles on the road now. Why? Because we have gone so far to the \nleft wing extreme that we cannot develop our own resources, even in an \nenvironmentally sound way.\n  Also, in that bill I put in the CLEAR Act, which provides incentives \nfor alternative fuel vehicles, alternative fuels, alternative fuel \nstations, alternative fuel cells. Given some time and some investments, \nI believe we can solve an awful lot of the pollution problems in our \ncountry the right way, through incentives, not by punishing the very \ncompanies that make our country work. We need to give incentives and \ngovernment cooperation so companies can get permits to develop more oil \nand gas, so that we could bring down the price of oil and gas. But \nevery time they want to do that, every time one of these companies \nwants to do something like that, guess who is throwing up every \nroadblock they possibly can and all in the interest of politics, in my \nopinion, which I think is the sum and total of most of the remarks made \ntoday on the floor by my two friends and colleagues--and they are \nfriends--on the other side.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Utah yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. HATCH. I listened to the Senator from North Dakota, and I will be \nhappy to take a question. I didn't come here to talk about this, but I \ngot a little bit upset listening to what I consider to be political \ntalk, which we have all too much of on this floor.\n  Everyday we have people coming around here giving these populous \ntalks about how we have to bring oil and gas prices down, and yet they \nmake it almost impossible to do it. Come on, America, wake up. I am \nsick of it. I used to be in the oil business. I know how hard it is.\n  Let me tell you, in eastern Utah, western Colorado, and southern \nWyoming, we have upwards estimated 3 trillion barrels of oil, 1 \ntrillion or more of which they say is recoverable, at probably $30 or \nless per barrel. But developing that oil will take billions of dollars \nof investment and all kinds of bureaucratic anguish to get the \npermitting and other steps necessary to go in and do it. And we are 20 \nyears behind Canada. They didn't allow this type of talk to stop them \nfrom developing their tar sands.\n  I talked to a company yesterday who said they may be willing to put a \ntremendous multibillion-dollar investment in there, and when industry \nis through, it will be over $100 billion, close to $120 billion \ninvested. Mr. President, where do we think this money is going to come \nfrom? By the way, that 1 trillion barrels of oil in eastern Utah, \nsouthern Wyoming, and western Colorado is more recoverable oil than all \nthe proven reserves in the Middle East. But it is going to cost more to \ncome out because it is a different form of extraction. To do it costs \nbillions, if not hundreds of billions of dollars of investment over the \nyears. But it will save our country if we have the wisdom and the \nfortitude and the foresight to go and do it.\n  I might also add that we haven't built a refinery, as I have said, in \n35 years--1 refinery and we have lost 200 of them. Why? Because it is \nso difficult to get anything done because of the so-called \nenvironmentalists, and I have to call some of them extreme \nenvironmentalists because true environmentalists should want us to get \nsome of the things I put into the Energy bill.\n\n  I don't believe that oil companies should make excessive profits that \nthey are unwilling to use for furthering their business interests \neither, but if they are given a chance to use them and go out and get \nmore oil for us and more gas for us, they are going to do it. But every \nstep of the way, they are stymied by the very people here who have been \ncomplaining.\n  I am personally tired of it. I feel sorry for the people in the \nNortheast. I feel sorry for the people in Utah. Our folks are paying \nmore than I wish they had to pay for gas. I feel sorry for those over \nin Europe, where they have paid more than $4 a gallon for gasoline now \nfor decades, some as high as $6 a gallon for gasoline because they were \noverrun by the same type of philosophical talk. And that is all it is, \ntalk that we get on this floor.\n  I can tell you, the American people have to wake up. This populist \ntalk is not what is going to get us oil and gas, nor is it going to \nbring prices down, nor are rebates going to help our people over the \nlong run. What will help our people is to develop, in environmentally \nsound ways, resources that will help get us out of these difficulties.\n  As for that Saudi Arabia of coal I mentioned in the Kaiparowitz \nPlateau in southern Utah, we now have the capacity to take that high-\nmoisture, low-sulfur content, environmentally sound coal, and develop \nclean-burn diesel and clean-burn jet fuel. We have that ability today, \nand it is locked up because of what I consider to be a political stunt \nthat we are stuck with, for now. It wasn't on this side of the floor or \nthis administration that caused that political stunt.\n  I think it is time to get rid of the populist talk and start talking \nreality. It is nice to come out and beat up the oil companies who are \nmaking great profits, but who would use those profits if they could to \ndevelop more of their products.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Utah will \nyield on that point.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I say to the Senator from Utah, I have 20 minutes left, \nand I will use them after the Senator from Utah is completed. It may \ntake all the 20 minutes to correct the errors of his presentation.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would be interested in the corrections because I don't \nbelieve you can find what I said to be false.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Almost all of it was wrong.\n  Mr. HATCH. No, it wasn't wrong. I lived in this industry. I \nunderstand it. If you have a question----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senators need to be reminded that they have to \ngo through Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I asked if he would yield for a question. I will ask one \nsimple question.\n  Mr. HATCH. OK.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator from Utah has seen the chart I \nused on the floor that comes from BusinessWeek, not a progressive rag \nor a conservative business journal, that says this about the major oil \ncompanies which the Senator defended so aggressively at the moment:\n\n       Rather than developing new fields, oil giants have \n     preferred to buy rivals, drilling for oil on Wall Street. \n     While that makes financial sense, it is no substitute for new \n     oil.\n\n  They are the ones saying the oil companies are not using these \nprofits to drill and build refineries. They are the ones saying it, not \nus.\n  Mr. HATCH. Do you have a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes. How do you justify what you said with what is in the \nBusinessWeek article, and virtually everyone else knows that they are \nbuying back stock, hoarding cash, and drilling on Wall Street?\n  Mr. HATCH. First of all, BusinessWeek is not a conservative \npublication. Anything that is not liberal you consider conservative on \nthat side. Secondly, the fact of the matter is, I have been making a \npretty good case that it is pretty tough to get permits and get past \nthe environmentalist roadblocks. It is in my State and every other \nState that has energy. Thirdly, I mentioned the coal that has been \nlocked up because of the machinations of the Clinton administration, \nthe last administration.\n\n[[Page S12932]]\n\n  Fourthly, I don't think it is even plausible that the oil companies, \nif they can get permits fast enough to do it, would not invest in more \nproduction, since that is their business. Some of them are going to \nChina, to Russia, and elsewhere to make these profits because they are \nforced to.\n  I think it is very unfair for my colleagues, as much as I admire you, \nit is very unfair to come on this floor and brand the oil companies as \na bunch of antipatriotic companies.\n  Let me finish with my remarks, and I will yield the floor. I have \nbeen in this business. I know doggone well what it takes and how much \nit takes and how much it costs to develop oil and gas. I also know how \ndifficult it is to get past the roadblocks environmentalists put up.\n  I get tired of the populist rhetoric on the other side of the aisle \nthat never gives any consideration to how difficult it is to be in this \nbusiness. I don't have any financial interest in oil. All I can say is \nthat I have been there, I know what it is like. Of course, these \ncompanies are out to make money, and if they have a business plan to \nbuy back their stock, good for them. There are a lot of companies that \nare buying back their stock so they can compete.\n  I feel strongly about this, which is why I fought for incentives in \nthe Energy bill--and I fought hard to get them there--to develop the \ntar sands and oil shale, to develop geothermal, to develop refineries. \nWe hear all this rhetoric about how these oil companies are making all \nthis big money and not building refineries, tell me where they can \nbuild them; tell me where they don't have to spend billions of dollars \nto build a refinery or hundreds of millions to build a refinery, all \nbecause of what many people would argue are pseudo-environmental \narguments and delays.\n  We have gone so far on that side that we made it almost impossible \nfor us to develop our own natural resources for our own benefit.\n  I don't like any company that gouges, and if these companies are \ngouging, then let's do something about it. But let's not take away, as \nwe commonly do around here, their ability to be able to go out and find \noil, drill for oil and do what I think both of my colleagues sincerely \nwant them to do, to go out and produce energy.\n  You talk to any oil company executive and talk about how difficult it \nis to get permits and to do what has to be done in this country, it is \namazing.\n  I again point out--and it was not false--the fact that I chatted with \none of the major oil companies recently that is going to go into the \ntar sands and oil shale at the tristate area, and their estimate is \nthat it could cost industry as much as 120 billion bucks. That is a lot \nof money even for the oil companies. But, boy, would that save our \ncountry.\n  But it will never happen if we keep doing this type of stuff on the \nSenate floor. I think we have done it for so many years now that we are \ngetting used to it and we ought to answer it.\n  Mr. President, I want to address another subject that I came here to \naddress. I apologize to my colleagues if I offended them, but do not \ntell me that what I am saying is false. I know it is true. I for one am \ndoggoned tired of this type of rhetoric.\n  I want to address the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to be \nAssociate Justice of the Supreme Court, and I would like this put in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (Several Senators addressed the Chair.)\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I object. We are on an amendment on the \nreconciliation bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have the floor, do I not?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask the Senator to make his unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. HATCH. I just got the unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has been yielded time \nand may speak on any subject.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Did he not just ask for time in morning business?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will withdraw the morning business request, and I will \nput it in this Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The understanding is that the statement would \nbe placed in morning business, not under this debate but under morning \nbusiness, and the time will be charged.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, who has the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Parliamentary inquiry to the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator yield for an inquiry?\n  Mr. HATCH. Of course, I will.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would just like to know how much time \nhas been yielded to the Senator from Utah, as well as how much time is \nremaining on the amendment offered by the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 24 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from Utah does not have a limit on his time, but \nhe is speaking on the amendment, for which there is 40 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hatch are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this has been entertaining, if not \nenlightening, to see my colleague get a full tank of indignation in \nalmost a nanosecond, on two subjects in fact. Let me cover the first at \nleast.\n  My colleague is a good-natured fellow--I like him--my colleague from \nUtah. In fact, he didn't get angry at me one day some years ago in a \nfull-scale debate when I said to him, if there were an Olympic event \nfor sidestepping, he would win the Gold Medal by far. In fact, he \ndemonstrated that agility again today by sidestepping this point. The \ncenter of our colleague's agitation was he said: You cannot produce any \nmore oil because those leftwingers, those environmentalists, will not \nlet you do it.\n  So I ask, well, how does one explain this then? The Wall Street \nJournal says the major oil companies are drilling for oil on Wall \nStreet. They are paying down their debt, buying back their shares, and \nhoarding cash. That is what they are doing with their money. How does \none explain that? Did not hear anything, did we? No explanation.\n  My colleague said he was sick--he said three times he was sick. It is \ninteresting, I suppose I have felt sick about some debate on the Senate \nfloor over these years. I do not think I have ever admitted that, but I \nwould much prefer to see a colleague of mine agitated about the price \nof energy in a full-scale agitation about what this is doing to \nconsumers, agitated about what it is going to do when somebody on a \nfixed income cannot figure out a way to heat their home this winter. I \nwould much sooner see a colleague agitated about that than having just \ncome fresh yesterday from, as he described, a meeting with a major oil \ncompany, come to make the case for the major oil companies on the \nSenate floor, and say: You know what the problem is in this country? It \nis those populists dripping with venom--that word ``populists''--those \nleftwingers, those environmentalists on this side of the Chamber, they \nare what is wrong with this country.\n\n  Let us see if we can peel back a little bit and expose the truth, if \nI might. My colleague says those environmentalists and those \nleftwingers have shut down all of these refineries. Oh, really?\n  No, that is not true. Take it from me, that is not true. By the way, \nif my colleague would like to come back to the floor of the Chamber at \nsome point, I would love to have a wide-open debate. Let us just talk \nback and forth and figure out where the facts are.\n  Let me give a few facts about refineries. I will not read them all, \nbut I could. Do my colleagues want to know the names of the refineries \nthat were shut down in 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000? Do my \ncolleagues want the names of the refineries? I will give names of \nrefineries, and when I tell the names of the refineries I will say who \nshut them down. The oil companies shut them down.\n  Now, they did not do that so somebody could come to the Senate floor \nand blame somebody else. They did it because they were approved for big \nmergers. They became bigger and bigger, and they decided to shut down \nrefineries. Why? They wanted to tighten\n\n[[Page S12933]]\n\nthe refining capacity and therefore increase margins. And they have \ndone it.\n  I will not say I get sick about somebody coming to the Senate floor \nto blame others for the oil companies shutting down refineries. But do \nI think it is fair, and do I think it is truthful? Absolutely not. The \nevidence is exactly the opposite of what my friend from Utah said. He \nhas a right to say it, and he even has a right to say it with a full \ntank of indignation. That does not make it right. The American people \nneed to know the truth about these issues.\n  Shutting down refineries has, in fact, occurred in this country. Why? \nBecause as the oil companies merged and merged and became bigger, they \nwere shutting down refineries. And I will read the names if anyone \nwould like me to. But my colleague has gone and will not be interested \nin these names, I guess. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DODD. I say to my colleague, since 1980, 176 refineries have \nclosed their doors, not because environmentalists shut them down. Is it \nnot true, I ask my colleagues, these were decisions made by the \nindustry themselves?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DODD. Does my colleague not further agree that in recent reports \none of the major companies we are talking about, in effect, bragged \nthat they had reduced production by 3 percent while profits over the \nsame year had increased 50 percent? That was not some environmentalist \nreducing production by 3 percent. That was the industry itself that \nmade that decision. Is my colleague familiar with that?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Absolutely. These record profits, the highest profits in \nhistory, are accompanied, by the way, in most cases--let me give an \nexample. Exxon reports a 75-percent increase in net profits to $9.9 \nbillion and they produced 5 percent less oil and gas at the same time.\n  Part of that was due to the hurricane. But the company admits that \neven without the hurricane, they would have produced less oil and gas \nat the same time they had the highest profits in history. How does that \nsquare with what our colleague from Utah said? What our colleague from \nUtah said is not accurate. It is not. He said it with great conviction, \nhe said it with great agitation, and it is wrong. Flat wrong.\n  There are plenty of other things to talk about with respect to this \nissue. Our colleague raises the suggestion that we can't drill \nanyplace. You can't drill anyplace.\n  Look, I support drilling in Lease 181 in the Gulf of Mexico. The only \nplace he was accurate about was the issue of ANWR. Do I think we should \ndrill in ANWR as a first resort? The answer is no. I think it ought to \nbe the last resort if we ever drill there. We have people on the floor \nwho want to open up all these pristine places, especially ANWR, that we \nhave set aside and let's drill. Katie bar the door, drill anywhere. We \nhave set ANWR aside, but there are plenty of places I think we ought to \ndrill.\n  This was one of the most partisan rants I have heard for some while \non the floor of the Senate. We are used to it. The minute you offer an \namendment that does anything to a particularly large industry, I am \ntelling you we have people coming through these doors saying, Who do I \nstand for? Let me stand for the big interests here.\n  My colleague said he met with a major oil company executive \nyesterday. Good for him. As I said before, I don't bear ill will toward \nthe major oil companies. But I wish he were as agitated about the \nimpact of these prices on America's consumers. He is not. He has raised \na lot of questions about why the oil companies are not producing more \noil, why prices are where they are. The fact is, point after point \nafter point has been inaccurate.\n  I say to my colleague with respect to Exxon, let's take Exxon. He \nsays the problem is these Senators and all the environmentalists and \nall the others prevent them from drilling.\n  What did Exxon do last year? They made $25 billion and used $9.9 or \n$10 billion to buy back their stock. How does he square that with what \nhe said to the Senate? He is flat wrong.\n  Sigmund Freud had a grandson named Clement. I was thinking about it, \nas my colleague was supporting the major oil industries' profits \ntonight. Clement, Sigmund's grandson, said this: ``When you hit someone \nover the head with a book and get a hollow sound, it doesn't mean the \nbook is empty.''\n  We have offered a proposal here in the Senate that has great merit. \nIt has been misdescribed by the oil industry for reasons I understand--\nI am talking about the major integrated companies--misdescribed by our \ncolleague from Utah tonight as something that would reduce the supply \nof oil. In fact, the single largest incentive that would exist for \nexpanding the supply of energy in this country would be our proposal \nbecause the major integrated oil companies would have a choice. They \ncan either use these windfall profits above $40 a barrel to sink back \ninto the ground, exploring for oil, or building refineries. They can \neither do that, and therefore be exempt from the windfall profits tax \nwe propose, or they can choose to pay a 50-percent excise tax on the \nwindfall profits--one of the two. Which would you choose? There is no \nquestion what you would choose. You would choose to expand the supply \nof energy and reduce energy prices as a result. That is the incentive \nin our piece of legislation. That is why it makes so much sense and it \nis why I was sitting here gritting my teeth, listening to the \ncaricature of this legislation offered by my colleague from Utah and \nthe spirited defense of the highest prices in history by the major \nintegrated oil companies and the disparaging comments about the efforts \nto see if we can give some relief and give some help and stand on the \nside of consumers.\n  I chaired the hearings on the Enron scandal several years ago in the \nCommerce Committee. I had a lot of people there under subpoena, \nunderstanding what they did on the west coast with price manipulation.\n  I must say this issue of pricing, pricing of energy is critically \nimportant because this is not some luxury item. This is a necessity for \nevery family, for their daily needs. We need to get this right. The \nquestion is, when we vote on this: Who do you stand with and who do you \nstand for?\n  Let me yield some time to my colleague. How much time remains on our \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 13 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me yield 8 minutes to my colleague from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Thank you. I may not use all that time because we made our \npoints. But I want to join with my colleague and friend from North \nDakota.\n  Let me say at the outset I have a great friendship with my colleague \nfrom Utah. We have done legislation together over the 24 years we have \nserved together in this body. He has been here a little longer than I \nhave. I enjoyed that relationship. I am somewhat stunned when my \ncolleague from Utah becomes as exercised as he was over the oil \nindustry and its profits. They have done very well. There is no reason \nto be upset about the oil industry. The profits they recorded in the \nspace of 12 weeks are unprecedented in American history.\n  I began to wonder whether my colleague from Utah had even read the \namendment the Senator from North Dakota and I offered. It very simply \nsays that, with the profits when oil is in excess of $40 a barrel, you \neither pay an excise tax which would rebate to consumers to the tune of \nabout $65 million a day, which could be meaningful to families who will \nbe paying much higher costs this year, or reinvest this money, these \nadditional profits, into increased production or developing \nalternatives the industry says it wants to do. That is what the \namendment says.\n\n  We have watched the industry shut down 176 refineries in 25 years. \nOne company brags about how profits are up 50 percent, and they \nthemselves reduced production by 3 percent.\n  In any class in 101 economics, when you reduce supply like that, \nobviously it gives a justification for increasing price. They admit it \nin their annual reports. I didn't make up that quote. I am quoting one \nof the major integrated companies in its message to its shareholders: \nProfits are up 50 percent, we reduced production by 3 percent.\n  Then I hear my colleague from Utah talking about some \nenvironmentalists as if somehow they had shut down the refineries or \nthey were responsible for reducing refinery capacity. It is the oil\n\n[[Page S12934]]\n\nindustry itself that has been closing refineries.\n  There are not going to be many more opportunities because we are \nabout to adjourn here. We will not be back until the middle of January. \nThis may be the one opportunity we have to express ourselves on whether \nwe think the industry ought to be doing a better job when it comes to \nincreasing production and providing some relief for the people out \nthere who will be paying these increased costs.\n  This is not an excessive request. It is one that goes right to the \nheart of what we have talked about, what we talked about during the \nconsideration of the Energy bill. In fact, as I pointed out earlier, we \nprovide literally billions of dollars in tax breaks for the industry to \ngo out and do some of the things the Senator from Utah talked about.\n  I voted against that Energy bill, not because there were not some \nthings I liked in the bill but, frankly, because I thought those tax \nbreaks were unnecessary. When you are recording $9 billion, almost $10 \nbillion in profits in 12 weeks, why do you need a tax break? But when \nthe integrated companies report more than $32 billion in profits in 12 \nweeks and we turn around and provide billions of dollars in tax breaks, \nI didn't understand that. But that is what we decided to do.\n  Here we have a chance to say: Listen, you got these additional \nprofits. Put them into energy production or provide a rebate to the \npeople of this country who are going to be paying these increased \nprices. It is one chance here to decide which side you are on. As I \nmentioned earlier, we tried to get Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nincreases for the poorest of our poor, the elderly on fixed incomes, \nand that has been denied over and over again despite amendments even in \nthe last few days and weeks to provide some relief. That has been \nrepeatedly voted down.\n  What about providing some relief for people who are going to be \npaying these additional costs? That is what we are trying to do with \nthis amendment. I commend my colleague from North Dakota. I know some \npeople say, It is a futile effort, why do you even bother? We bother \nbecause we think it is right to stand up here.\n  Other Congresses in other times--where are the Harry Trumans today? \nWe are in the middle of a war right now in the Middle East. He stood up \nas a Member of this body and he called it profiteering, and he was not \naccused of being a populist. We celebrate Harry Truman today as someone \nwho had the guts to stand up and tell the truth, whether people wanted \nto hear it or not. We ought to tell the truth now. These companies are \nmaking excessive profits at the expense of our economy and hard-\nworking, honest people. They look to us to provide some help.\n  That is what we exist for, in part, to make sure you don't have \nunrestrained activities that will do damage to the average person or \naverage business out there trying to make ends meet.\n  I again urge our colleagues to support this amendment. It is one \nchance we have to try to make a difference for these people.\n  I yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me yield myself 4 minutes. I want to reserve 4 \nminutes. But let me make a comment. I agree with my colleague from \nConnecticut. Spirited debate is fine on this floor. I didn't like the \nrepresentation that was made by our other colleague that somehow what \nwe were proposing here is not only unworthy but part of some cabal that \nis trying to injure this country and, second, using information that is \nsimply not accurate.\n  The refineries have been closed by the oil companies, not \nenvironmentalists. That is a fact. What has happened is when they \nmerged, they closed refineries in order to restrict supply and boost \nthe yields of the refineries. The fact is, we had experts come in. I am \ntalking about experts, I am not talking about politicians. The so-\ncalled experts came to the committee. We said, Why are refineries \nclosing? One reason, because their yields are too low and the major oil \ncompanies are closing them. That is exactly the case.\n  My colleague from Utah talked about tax breaks he had sponsored for \nthe oil industry. He talked about yesterday he was visiting with an \nexecutive of the big oil industry--which is fine. He talked about the \nprice they pay in Europe, $3 or $4 a gallon. The interesting thing is \nin Europe the money between the cost of oil and the $3 or $4 a gallon \ndoesn't go into the pockets of the oil companies, it goes to build \ninfrastructure in Europe. They collect it in taxes and use it to invest \nin the infrastructure of Europe.\n  But I think it is important to point out what happens here on this \nfloor. When you offer a proposal such as we offered, it doesn't matter \nif it is the tobacco industry or pharmaceutical industry or oil \nindustry, we will have people trot through these doors of the Senate \nand rise to the defense of the pricing policy of the pharmaceutical \nindustry or rise to the defense of the pricing policy of the oil \nindustry. I will ask this. If you are going to get agitated in this \nChamber, get agitated about something worthwhile. The agitation ought \nto be on behalf of some families who are trying to figure out how on \nEarth will I pay the bill? As I read in tomorrow's paper of the largest \nprofits in the history of this country coming into the treasury of the \noil companies, how am I going to pay a 50-percent increase in the bill \nto heat my home? You want to get agitated, get agitated on behalf of \nthose folks and help us do something.\n  This notion of partisan blame, coming to the Chamber and ignoring the \nsubstance of a proposal and then casting partisan blame, in my judgment \nis a little tired and a little old. This proposal stands on it own \nmerits. If you don't like it, that is fine. I understand that. Vote \nagainst it. But don't suggest somehow you are on the side of the \nconsumer if your interest here on the floor of the Senate is to come \nand stand with the big oil companies, and to believe that profits above \n$40 a barrel is fine. It is not. It is not fair.\n  We believe one of two things should happen: Either it all ought to be \nsunk back into the ground or above ground for exploring for oil and \nbuilding refineries and expanding America's supply of energy and bring \ndown prices, or it ought to be recaptured and sent back as a rebate to \nthe people in this country who are having trouble paying their bills, \nas a rebate to every American using energy.\n  That is our proposal. Controversial for some? Maybe. Is it the right \nthing to do for the American people? I believe it is, and I hope this \nCongress, I hope this Senate will as well.\n  I yield the floor and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield whatever time he consumes to the majority whip.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum be \nrescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Immigration and Competitiveness\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in 1882, an Irish immigrant named Marcus \nDaly set off an explosion that shook the world. It happened 300 feet \nunder the ground, near Warm Springs Creek, 26 miles west of Butte, MT. \nWhen the dust settled, Daly saw before him the shiny ore of the largest \ncopper deposit ever known.\n  The rich copper vein transformed the American economy. It made \nAmerica the world's largest copper exporter. And it inaugurated an \neconomic boom for my home State that lasted for decades. It also \nenriched many parts of America.\n  Thousands of immigrants made the boom happen. They came from Ireland \nand Italy, Canada and Scandinavia, Serbia and Croatia, Greece and \nSyria. They came to America to find work in the new mining town, \nchristened Anaconda. By 1900, immigrants made up 40 percent of \nAnaconda's population.\n  These new Americans formed the backbone of the mining economy. And \ntheir descendants have woven the colorful fabric of Montana.\n  Immigrants helped build the American economy. In the 1850s, hundreds \nof\n\n[[Page S12935]]\n\nthousands of young Chinese men helped construct the Transcontinental \nRailroad. At the beginning in the 1870s, Basque shepherd immigrants \nhelped shape the western ranching economy. Beginning in the 1890s, \nhundreds of thousands of Norwegian farmers lay the foundations of a \ncompetitive farming economy in Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, and the \nDakota territories. And in the first decades of the 20th century, more \nthan 100,000 Jewish immigrants created New York City's famous garment \nindustry.\n  Immigrant entrepreneurs and innovators revolutionized the American \neconomy. Scotsman industrialist Andrew Carnegie transformed the \nAmerican steel industry and consolidated the Nation's railroads. \nHungarian Joseph Pulitzer produced a legacy in newsprint. Polish-born \nproducer Samuel Goldwyn left his mark on film.\n  Once-foreign names became American household brands. Russian-born Max \nFactor made makeup. Bavarian-born Levi Strauss manufactured clothes. \nHessian-born Adolphus Busch brewed beer.\n  And today, immigrant innovators still populate the cutting edge. \nMoscow-born Sergey Brin helped found Google. Taiwan-born Jerry Yang \nfounded Yahoo. French-born Pierre Omidyar founded eBay. And Hungarian-\nborn Andy Grove founded Intel.\n  America remains a nation of immigrants. More than 33 million people \nliving in America were born abroad. More than 9 million came to our \nshores just between 1990 and 2000.\n  Since colonial times, immigrants have been vital to the American \neconomy. Their skills and their labor have made our companies, our \nindustries, and our economy more competitive.\n  Some immigrants come with little more than their strength and \nambition. They become our economy's machine operators, factory workers, \nfarm laborers, and service workers.\n  But many come with master's and doctorate degrees. They work in \nresearch laboratories and universities. They sharpen our economy's \ncutting edge.\n  This is my seventh address to the Senate on economic competitiveness. \nSince summer, I have highlighted the importance to competitiveness of \neducation, international trade, healthcare, national savings, and \nenergy, all components we must focus on to make our country more \ncompetitive so we have better high-paying jobs and more paying jobs for \nmore Americans. Today, I speak about immigration and economic \ncompetitiveness.\n  Immigrants make our economy more competitive in at least four ways.\n  First, immigrants provide labor. Marcus Daly needed workers to dig \nhis Montana copper mine. Similarly, today's booming industries require \nglobal talent.\n  Without foreign-born workers, the largest economic expansion in our \nNation's history would not have been possible. In the boom years of the \n1990s, the labor force grew by nearly 17 million workers. Nearly 40 \npercent of them were born abroad. Most of these immigrants came when \nunemployment was at record lows. They filled 4 out of 10 job vacancies, \noften in regions short on workers, and often in jobs that natives had \nno desire to fill. Had these immigrants not lent us their strength, our \neconomy would surely have faltered.\n  Second, immigrants help balance the budget. Tally up taxpayer-funded \nbenefits to immigrants--education, healthcare, social security--and \nmatch those costs against what immigrants pay in State, local, Federal \ntaxes. On balance, each immigrant provides a net benefit to the \nAmerican economy of about $90,000 in taxes over a lifetime. Overall, \nimmigrants contribute $15 billion to our economy every year.\n  And immigrants will make an important fiscal contribution as the baby \nboom generation retires. In just 5 years, the number of Americans \napproaching retirement will increase by nearly half. Most new foreign-\nborn immigrants, on the other hand, are between 10 and 39 years old. \nAnd immigrants are likely to have more children than the U.S.-born \npopulation.\n  These younger workers will help fund the coming Social Security, \nMedicare, and Medicaid benefit payments. Immigrants bolster the \ndeteriorating ratio of workers to retirees. Immigrants provide a shiny \nvein of ore in a graying economy.\n  Third, immigrants push the envelope of innovation. Foreign students \nearn more than a quarter of the Nation's science and engineering \ndegrees. They earn more than a third of science and engineering \ndoctorates. Most of those are in computer sciences and electrical \nengineering. Foreign students account for as many as four out of five \ndoctoral students in a number of highly-ranked universities. And \nforeign students bring $13 billion a year to our economy in tuition and \nfees.\n  Foreign students' minds help sharpen our economy's cutting edge. \nForeign student researchers support work on new medicines, software, \nand other innovations. Universities patent this research. A 10 percent \nincrease in the number of foreign graduate students would increase \npatents granted by more than 7 percent.\n  Patents mean new inventions. Inventions mean new products. And new \nproducts mean new profits and new jobs.\n  Just as important, nearly three-quarters of highly-skilled students \nstay in America. Instead of taking their skills home and using them to \ncompete with us, they join highly specialized professions in research \nand academia. They contribute their knowledge to our economy.\n  At IBM Research and Intel, for example, foreign nationals make up \nabout a third of high-level researchers. At the National Institutes of \nHealth, foreign-born workers make up about half of researchers. In \nAmerica's top immigration States, foreign-born workers account for 40 \npercent of teachers and more than a quarter of physicians, chemists, \nand economists.\n  Fourth, immigrants drive entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship is the \nirreplaceable genius that sparks economic growth. For every famous \nimmigrant entrepreneur like Hungarian financier George Soros or Belgian \ndesigner Liz Claiborne, legions of other immigrants push the limits of \nthe economy, or simply provide a neighborhood service.\n  For more than a century, immigrants have been more likely than \nnative-born Americans to be self-employed entrepreneurs. Since the \n1970s, immigrants have helped reverse a national decline in self-\nemployment. Immigrant-run businesses create jobs, tax revenues, and \ngrowth. Even small neighborhood businesses can revitalize entire \nneighborhoods. And small businesses are the primary driver of new jobs.\n  Immigrants also swell the ranks of high-technology entrepreneurs. \nMost of the foreign-born scientists and engineers in Silicon Valley \nhave helped found or run a start-up company. Sixty percent of Indian \nscientists there have participated in start-ups. And fully three-\nquarters of Indians and most of the Chinese scientists there have plans \nto start a business. These entrepreneurs are thinking about tomorrow's \neconomy today.\n  Immigrants devote their labor. They boost our balance sheets. They \ndrive innovation. And they energize entrepreneurship. Immigrants are \nvital to our economic competitiveness.\n  Unfortunately, America is not welcoming global talent and labor. In \nsome cases, we have pulled in welcome mat.\n  State Department visa procedures and security checks intended to keep \nout terrorists are instead keeping out talent. In the post-September 11 \nworld, America must vigilantly protect its borders. But we must also \nstrike a balance between this vigilance and economic health.\n  Look at the case of foreign students who want to study at American \nuniversities. In 2003, foreign applications to American engineering \ndoctoral programs fell by more than a third--with Chinese applications \ndropping nearly in half. Despite considerable efforts to reverse this \ntrend, total foreign graduate school applications declined further last \nyear, by double digits in some cases. This year, the number of \ninternational students entering American graduate schools finally held \nsteady, despite a 5 percent drop in applications from foreign students.\n  The decline in applications is not an anomaly. It is a clear trend. \nAt the same time, our economic rivals are actively attracting the \nworld's brightest. Canada doubled its foreign student enrollment last \nyear. And South Korea will triple its foreign student enrollment by \n2010.\n  We unfortunately have also closed the door on talented workers who \ndrive\n\n[[Page S12936]]\n\nour companies' competitiveness. Our leading high-tech companies--\ncompanies like Intel, Microsoft, and Hewlett-Packard--are imploring \nCongress to raise the cap for visas for highly-skilled workers--known \nas H-1B visas. These visas are capped at 65,000. That limit is so out \nof line with demand that we reached the 2005 cap months before 2005 \nbegan.\n  Today's visa and immigration restrictions also make it difficult for \nmajor American companies to employ and train their workforce.\n  Take this example: A global American entertainment company with \nheadquarters in New York hired Indian managers to run its Bangalore \noffice. The company wanted to train these new hires to company \nstandards, as it does with all employees. The company wanted to send \nthe new hires to New York to receive this training, as it does with all \nmanagement. The company applied for visas on behalf of its soon-to-be \nIndian office managers.\n  What happened? The company filed the paperwork. Months came. Months \nwent. It took 3 months just to get an appointment at the U.S. Embassy. \nDelays continued. Patience wore thin. Costs mounted, with untrained \nmanagers on the payroll. And the company finally gave up.\n  The company applied for visas to Ireland, where the company had its \nEuropean branch. The visas came in 4 days. The company trained these \nnew managers at the company's facilities in Ireland, and then sent them \nback to India to work. This created jobs in Ireland, because the \ncompany set up a training program there, instead of using existing \ntrainers in America.\n  This is no way to do business. We are shooting ourselves in the foot.\n  We must lift the cap on H-1B visas. We do not have a centrally \nplanned economy. The American Government does not tell companies how \nmany workers they need each year. But the cap has that effect, the \neffect of a centrally planned economy. That is wrong. Let us listen to \nbusiness leaders and help them maintain and improve their \ncompetitiveness. When our premier global companies implore us to lift \nthe H-1B visa cap or risk hampering their growth, the time for politics \nis over.\n  We must simplify temporary entry for foreign workers who need to come \nto America to help our companies succeed. If we wish to remain a \ncutting-edge economy, we can no longer obstruct companies from training \ntheir overseas employees, participating in meetings and conferences, or \ntraveling to trade shows. Our companies have global markets, global \nsupply chains, and global strategies. We need a global workforce.\n  Our current commitment of 65,000 H-1B visas each year is outdated. It \nis outmoded and out of touch with today's needs. We should make a bold \ncommitment to expand that cap. Such a commitment would allow us to lock \nin similar commitments from our trading partners and enhance exports \nand American services.\n  We must actively encourage talented foreign students to study, do \nresearch, and innovate at American universities and American research \ninstitutions. Visa renewals during multiyear studies need to be \nroutine. These renewals should not require all students to first return \nto their home countries.\n  For the most exceptional of these students, who have earned advanced \nscience degrees at American universities, we need a simpler process to \nobtain permanent residence. These are talented, highly educated \nindividuals, who are in a position to keep our economy competitive. If \nwe do not welcome them into our economy--guess what--then China, India, \nEurope, or Japan will welcome them into theirs.\n  Three weeks ago, the National Park Service designated the old mining \ntown of Anaconda, MT, as a national historic landmark. Anaconda's \nmining boom times are now preserved as part of our Nation's history. \nBut Marcus Daly's explosion--when he found all that copper ore--\ncontinues to reverberate through the American economy today.\n  Let us not stamp out the spark of future booms. Let us, rather, \nwelcome the labor, the innovation, and the entrepreneurship of our new \nimmigrants. Let us ensure for ourselves and for our children the \nshining ore of boom times to come.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume \nfrom the manager's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2587\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I come to the Chamber to respond to some \nof the arguments that have been made by some of our colleagues in \nsupport of an amendment that would impose a so-called windfall profits \ntax on crude oil and the use of the tax collected to provide an energy \ntax credit to consumers.\n  This is an amendment that, while it may make Senators feel good to \ntry to lash out at the oil companies that are making admittedly \nsignificant profits, it is the wrong thing to do for reasons I wish to \nexplain.\n  I think we are here representing our various States to do more than \nmake popular arguments. We are here to make arguments that ultimately \nmake sense and benefit the national interests of the United States of \nAmerica. I believe passing a windfall profits tax would damage America. \nIt would damage our national security by making us even more reliant on \nimported oil and, conversely, less reliant on domestic oil because \nthere would be less of it. It would essentially confiscate the legally \nearned profits of a legal business that has actually made less money \nthan other industries that I will talk about in a minute.\n  If we are going to determine in the Congress how much of a profit is \ntoo much and how much is not enough, I think we are sending a very bad \nsignal. We are ostensibly believers in the free enterprise system in \nthe United States. Certainly there are examples of gouging and illegal \nprofiteering, but those are at the margins. We should not be in the \nbusiness in the Senate of saying how much is too much and how much is \nnot enough.\n  I point out the bill pending on the floor already includes a $4.9 \nbillion tax penalty on large integrated oil companies. That is already \nin this bill--without this windfall profits tax--and imposes a \nsignificant penalty tax on the oil industry.\n  Now, proposals to limit so-called windfall profits are premised on \nthe notion that the oil industry profits are somehow excessive. I would \npoint out to my colleagues that in the second quarter of 2005, the oil \nindustry earned 7.7 cents, not quite 8 cents, for every dollar of \nsales. The average profit for all U.S. industries during the second \nquarter was 7.9 cents. In other words, the average profit was two-\ntenths of a cent more for sales across all industries.\n  There were 13 industries in the United States that earned higher \nprofits in the second quarter than the oil and gas industry, including \nbanking, at 19.6 cents; software and services, at 17 cents; consumer \nservices, at 10.9 cents; and real estate, at 8.9 cents. Are we going to \nimpose a windfall profits tax on each of these industries that reaped a \nhigher return on their investment than the oil and gas industry? Well, \nI doubt it. And thank goodness we are not. It simply is wrong to target \nan industry, particularly one that has not made excessive profits \nrelative to other industries in the United States during this last \nyear, and say: We are going to treat you differently, we are going to \ndiscriminate against you because we know you are unpopular, and we are \ngoing to tax you at a higher rate than we would otherwise tax business \nactivity in the United States.\n  Now, we have seen a spike in gasoline prices, up to, on average, \n$3.07 a gallon, which, thankfully, has dropped a lot now. I was back in \nTexas this last weekend, and I saw gasoline selling for $1.98 a gallon. \nThat was certainly good news. Those prices are a little bit higher in \nother parts of the country, obviously, but the good news is, the price \nis coming down.\n\n  It is that law that does not emanate from inside the beltway but one \nthat governs all of our economic activities that applies here. It is \nthe law of supply and demand--the law that this amendment would attempt \nto tamper with and create perverse incentives that are not good for \nAmerica. They do not just target this industry, they actually are bad \nfor our national security. They are unfair when you consider other \nindustries. And it violates our fundamental principles as a nation\n\n[[Page S12937]]\n\nthat believes in the benefits of a free market.\n  But the fact is, one of the things that cramped the supply of \ngasoline recently was the hurricanes that have damaged refineries and \noilfields, including out in the Gulf of Mexico. A lot of the refineries \nand the oil wells have been offline while they have been repaired and \nnow are largely being restored. What we are seeing, as they are coming \nonline, with more supply, and given the same demand, is that the price \nis coming down.\n  But the fact is, as well, that significant portions of the profits of \nthe oil industry are going to have to be used to restore prehurricane \ninfrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico and in the affected region.\n  One of the problems with this ill-conceived windfall profits tax is \nit will reduce needed investment. One of the things we need in this \ncountry, of course, is a greater supply of oil and gas because we know \nwe are in a worldwide economic competition with countries such as India \nand China that are becoming increasingly industrialized and consuming \nmore energy than they produce. Here again, the law of supply and demand \npertains.\n  By actually putting a tax on the profits that oil and gas companies \nhave received as a result of their lawful business activity, we will \ndeny them money they can and will invest back into creating a greater \nsupply--exploring for more oil and gas, expanding their refineries--\nwhich will, in turn, bring down the price of oil and gasoline.\n  The other thing I would point out is, we have been here before. We \nhave been there. We tried it. And we found that the effect of a \nwindfall profits tax--no matter how good it feels--simply does not \nsolve any problems and, in fact, creates more problems.\n  In 1990, the Congressional Research Service analyzed the effects of \nthe windfall profits tax that was enacted between 1980 and 1988. The \nCongressional Research Service found that the tax reduced domestic oil \nproduction from between 3 and 6 percent and increased oil imports from \nbetween 8 and 16 percent over its lifetime.\n  At a time when Senator after Senator, Congressman after Congressman, \nhas stood on the floor of our respective bodies and said, We need to \nreduce our dependence on imported oil and increase our domestic \nproduction, this tax, if imposed, would do just the opposite. It would \ndecrease domestic production. It would increase our reliance on \nimported oil. It would make America less secure. And it would damage \nour domestic companies that employ hard-working Americans.\n  It seems like there are so many good reasons not to adopt this \namendment. I cannot think of a single good reason to do it, other than \nperhaps it makes Senators feel good to try to punish the big bad oil \ncompanies for making an excessive profit. But I do not think we want to \nbe in the business of determining how much is enough and how much is \ntoo much.\n  The last thing the Federal Government needs to do is get its clumsy \nhands on the free enterprise system in a way that damages our precious \nenergy supply. We should be encouraging domestic production. We should \nbe encouraging alternative forms of energy, which, by the way, the \nhigher the price of oil and gasoline gets, the more people begin to \nlook at what are other commercially available alternatives. That is \ngood because what it does is it diversifies our dependency on an energy \nsupply so we are not dependent on just one type of energy.\n  That is the reason we need to--in addition to producing more oil \ndomestically, expanding the size of refinery capacity so we bring the \nprice down--look at nuclear energy, which is, in part, what we did \nthrough our Energy bill we passed this last summer. France, for \nexample, generates 80 percent of its electricity using nuclear power. \nWe need to look at other alternative forms of energy that reduce our \ndependency on fossil fuels, which cause environmental problems. \nEveryone who cares about the environment should care about our looking \nat alternative forms of energy.\n  There are so many reasons this amendment is bad. I hope my colleagues \nwill consider these arguments. I hope we do not stampede into adoption \nof this bad amendment based on the populist arguments that oil \ncompanies are big, so they must be bad, or somehow argue that to make a \nprofit implies some sort of corruption or inappropriate activity. We \nhave laws on our books against those who violate our anti-gouging laws, \nbut it is no crime to make a profit in a free market system.\n  It is that profit that creates an investment that expands the supply \nand ultimately brings the price down. It is the profit earned by these \ncompanies that allows them to employ hard-working Americans. If we want \nto put Americans out of business, if we want to increase our dependency \non imported oil and reduce the production of domestic oil, then I guess \nwe should pass this ill-conceived amendment. I hope my colleagues will \nreconsider and vote against the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I am glad that we are debating this bill \non the floor of the Senate. Despite some concerns which I will discuss \nlater, I supported this bill in the Finance Committee. I have heard a \nlot in the last few weeks from some of my colleagues talking about how \nwe can't afford the so-called tax cuts that this bill was expected to \ncontain. As we have been saying for weeks, the growth package is not \nabout tax cuts. It is about stopping tax increases, tax increases that \nwill affect American families.\n  The so-called tax cuts that Democratic Members of Congress are \ntalking about are nothing more than keeping current tax law in place. \nThere are dozens of provisions that American families and employers \nhave come to rely on that will expire at the end of this year, if we do \nnot pass this bill. These are provisions that are important to our \nconstituents and to our economy. Let's take a look at some of the items \nthat are in the bill before us.\n  First, the research and development tax credit will expire at the end \nof this year unless we act. This is an important provision of the Tax \nCode that spurs innovation and new technologies. A majority--believe \nme--of Senators have supported this provision in the past. The bill \nbefore us not only extends this provision, it also adds some \nimprovements to make it more relevant to today's economy.\n  A lot of other important provisions also expire if we do not pass \nthis bill. The deduction of tuition expenses, that provision affects \n36,000 Kentuckians; the tax deduction for teacher classroom expenses, \nthis one affects 38,000 Kentucky teachers; and the low-income saver's \ncredit affects 94,000 low-income Kentucky taxpayers. These are \nKentuckians that do not deserve a tax increase. I am going to do all \nwithin my power to make sure they don't get one.\n  I am extremely disappointed that this bill does not contain a \nprovision that I considered to be a vitally important one--keeping the \ntax rate on dividends and capital gains income from increasing. It is \nvery important that we extend this 15-percent rate through the end of \nthe budget window. As this bill moves through the legislative process, \nI will fight to make sure that the bill that the President ultimately \nsigns includes these vital provisions. It is very hard to dispute the \npositive impact that the 15-percent rate has had on the macroeconomy. \nDividends paid by companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 have been up \nover 50 percent since this tax change was implemented. Capital gains \nrevenues from taxes to the Federal Government is estimated by some to \nexceed the CBO forecast by billions of dollars in fiscal year 2006.\n  But let's talk about which taxpayers are benefiting from these 15-\npercent rates. In my State, Kentucky, 18 percent of taxpayers benefited \nfrom the reduced rates on dividend income, and 13 percent benefited \nfrom the lower rate on capital gains income in 2003. These numbers are \nespecially interesting when you consider that Kentucky has a median \nincome that is below the national average. This does not even count the \nmillions of workers and retirees who hold these assets inside their \n401(k)s. As we all know, these dividends are very important to the \nelderly. Many of our retired folks rely on dividends to supplement \ntheir fixed incomes from pensions and Social Security.\n  While it is true that the lower rates do not sunset until the end of \n2008, it is\n\n[[Page S12938]]\n\nimportant that we send a message to the economy by extending these \nrates this year. If we have not made these provisions permanent, \ninvestors and financial markets will grow increasingly uncertain about \nthe future tax treatment of dividends and capital gains as 2008 gets \ncloser. We cannot risk adding unwanted volatility to the markets and \nthe economy which continue to grow.\n  Again, let me be clear, the proposals that we are planning to extend \nin this package are not new tax proposals, they are simply current law. \nIf we do not extend these provisions, we will cause a substantial \nincrease in the tax bills of American families and businesses.\n  I also express my concern about two provisions currently part of this \nbill that I strongly oppose. First is a provision that will limit the \nability of taxpayers who itemize their taxes to take a deduction for \ntheir full charitable contributions, as they do under current law. This \nchange would amount to a tax increase on some taxpayers who make small \ncharitable contributions, and I strongly oppose it.\n  The second is a provision that will change accounting rules for the \noil industry. The accounting rules at issue are not some loophole for \nthe oil industry. All taxpayers with inventories can elect to use LIFO \ninventory rules--all. It would be unfair to impose different rules \nstandards on only one industry and would set a dangerous tax precedent.\n  Additionally, as my colleagues well know, we just passed an energy \nbill this summer. It contains incentives to increase refining \nproduction which is so desperately needed and which we have been \nneglecting for too long. To turn around and take away these incentives \njust a few months later, as this bill does, makes no sense whatsoever. \nOur focus needs to be on trying to increase domestic production of oil \nand refining capacity, and this provision will do exactly the opposite.\n  I am planning to support this bill on the floor of the Senate, but I \nam only doing so with the expectation that we will improve it and that \nthe bill that lands on the President's desk will ultimately reflect the \nviews of the full Senate and this Congress.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           A Need For Answers\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, tonight the Vice President has come out of \nhis bunker and is speaking at a gathering of Washington, DC, insiders. \nOf course, it is closed to the press.\n  Unfortunately, he brought his bunker mentality with him in the \nspeech. He is repeating the same tired attack we have heard from \nadministrative officials over the last 2 weeks.\n  Mr. President, in the last 24 hours in faraway Iraq 10 of our brave \nsoldiers have been killed. On such a night, you would think the Vice \nPresident would give a speech that honors the fallen and those still \nfighting by laying out a strategy for success. But no, instead we have \nthe Vice President of the United States playing politics like he is in \nthe middle of a Presidential campaign.\n  Yesterday, a bipartisan majority of this body, the Senate, gave the \nadministration a vote of no confidence for its Iraq policy. The Senate \nsaid the era of their no-plan, no-end approach is over.\n  Apparently, though, the White House didn't get the message. The Vice \nPresident's speech tonight demonstrates that once again this \nadministration intends to stay the course and continue putting their \npolitical fortunes ahead of what this country needs, a plan for \nsuccess.\n  Our troops and the American people deserve better.\n  The White House needs to understand that deceiving the American \npeople is what got them into trouble. Now is the time to come clean, \nnot to continue the pattern of deceit.\n  So again, Mr. President, I ask Vice President Cheney to make himself \navailable and answer the American people's questions. If he has time to \ntalk to DC insiders, as he is doing tonight, oil executives, and even a \ndiscredited felon, Ahmed Chalabi, who by the way is under investigation \nfor giving this Nation's secrets to Iran, it would seem he has time to \nanswer the questions of the American people.\n  Mr. Cheney needs to stop stonewalling and hold a press conference.\n  Finally, I would urge the members of the Bush administration to stop \ntrying to resurrect their political standing by lashing out at their \ncritics. Instead, they need to focus on the job at hand, giving our \ntroops a strategy for success in Iraq.\n  This week we have seen Stephen Hadley, Donald Rumsfeld, President \nBush, and Vice President Cheney lash out at their critics. Yet they all \nremain silent when it comes to giving our troops and the American \npeople a plan for success in Iraq. I believe this tired rhetoric and \nthese political attacks do nothing to get the job done in Iraq. I truly \nbelieve, Mr. President, America could do better.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside for the purposes of offering an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2596\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2596.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate concerning the provision \n of health care for children before providing tax cuts for the wealthy)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING HEALTH CARE FOR \n                   CHILDREN BEFORE TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) There are more than 9,000,000 children in the United \n     States with no health insurance coverage.\n       (2) Sixty-seven percent of uninsured children live in \n     families with at least one full-time worker.\n       (3) According to the Center for Studying Health System \n     Change, uninsured children, when compared to privately \n     insured children, are--\n       (A) 3.5 times more likely to have gone without needed \n     medical, dental, or other health care;\n       (B) 4 times more likely to have delayed seeking medical \n     care;\n       (C) 5 times more likely to go without needed prescription \n     drugs; and\n       (D) 6.5 times less likely to have a usual source of care.\n       (4) More than half of these children are eligible for \n     coverage under either the State Children's Health Insurance \n     Program (SCHIP) or Medicaid, but are not enrolled in those \n     safety net programs.\n       (5) Most States, struggling with budget deficits, have \n     curtailed outreach efforts.\n       (6) A focus on simple and convenient enrollment and renewal \n     systems, as well as proactive outreach and educational \n     efforts, could help reach these children and reduce the \n     number of uninsured American children.\n       (7) Some States, seeing that the Federal Government is not \n     providing assistance to middle class families who can't \n     afford health insurance, are trying to extend coverage to \n     some or all children.\n       (8) State efforts to cover all children will not be \n     successful without financial assistance from the Federal \n     Government.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Senate should not vote to extend the capital gains \n     and dividend tax cuts, a majority of the benefits of which go \n     to households with incomes over $1,000,000, until Congress \n     has taken steps to ensure that all children in America have \n     access to affordable, quality health insurance;\n       (2) the Senate should vote instead to use the funds \n     generated by the expiration of the capital gains and dividend \n     tax cuts to further the goal of ensuring that children have \n     access to health insurance coverage by--\n       (A) awarding grants to States, faith-based organizations, \n     safety net providers, schools, and other community and non-\n     profit organizations to facilitate the enrollment of the \n     6,800,000 children who are currently eligible for enrollment \n     in the State Children's Health Insurance Program but who are \n     not enrolled;\n       (B) paying to each State with an approved State Children's \n     Health Insurance Program or Medicaid plan, an amount equal to \n     90 percent of the sums expended for the design, development, \n     implementation, and evaluation\n\n[[Page S12939]]\n\n     of enrollment systems determined likely to provide more \n     efficient and effective administration of the plan's \n     enrollment and retention of eligible children; and\n       (C) establishing a grant program under which a State may \n     apply under section 1115 of the Social Security Act to \n     provide medical assistance under the State Children's Health \n     Insurance Program to all children in their State.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as we gather in the Senate this evening, \nthere are 45 million Americans who are uninsured.\n  I have introduced this sense-of-the-Senate resolution and invite \ncosponsors from both sides of the aisle to establish a national goal \nthat we will eliminate the 45 million uninsured in the next 10 years.\n  Some are critical of a sense-of-the-senate resolution saying this is \n``pie in the sky,'' we could not do that, we could not eliminate 45 \nmillion uninsured in America in the course of 10 years. I disagree. If \nwe set it as a bipartisan national goal, if the President and Congress \nagree it is goal we are going to seek, we can reach that goal.\n  The amendment which I have just offered will eliminate 20 percent of \nthe uninsured Americans--20 percent of them.\n  Now, which would be the first group that you would turn to, to give \nhealth insurance and give the protection of health insurance? Well, I \nthink most Americans, certainly most American families, would say our \nchildren. Would we not want to take care of them first?\n  There are 9.1 million children in America without health insurance. \nLet me show you what 9 million children might look like in this \ndepiction. Look at the States in yellow. If you took the children in \nevery one of these States, they would total 9 million children. It \ngives you an indication of the gravity of this challenge. And it also \ntells you that we need to do much more. The number of children without \nhealth insurance in our Nation exceeds the number of all children \nliving in 21 States and the District of Columbia combined.\n  According to the Center for Studying Health System Change, uninsured \nchildren when compared to privately insured children in the year 2003 \nwere, first, 3\\1/2\\ times more likely to have gone without needed \nmedical, dental or health care; second, 4 times more likely to have \ndelayed seeking medical care; third, 5 times more likely to go without \nneeded prescription drugs; fourth, 6\\1/2\\ times less likely to have the \nusual source of care.\n  Let me give you the hard number. Six million children went without \nneeded health care in America in the year 2003.\n  I am sad to report this year I am afraid it is even more. There are \nmore than 250,000 children in my State of Illinois without health \ninsurance. Most come from working families, such as the Akeys family of \nChicago. Annette and her husband own a real estate company. They make \nabout $60,000 a year. That is not a huge sum of money in the city of \nChicago. They were forced to give up their family health insurance when \ntheir premiums rose to $500 a month. Unfortunately, their 6-year old \ndaughter Katana became ill with a kidney problem and a heart murmur.\n  Katana was in the hospital for 3 days and the Akeys were left with a \n$10,000 medical bill to pay out of their own pocket. How did they do \nit? They took a second mortgage on their home.\n  The Baldwins from Moline, IL, are another working family who can't \nafford insurance. Amanda Baldwin manages a fast food restaurant. She \nmakes $556 every 2 weeks. Her husband David is a truck driver. He \ngrosses $1,100 every 2 weeks. They have a 1-year-old son Zachary, but \nthe Baldwins of Moline, IL, have no insurance. Why? Because it would \ncost $400 a month, which is about one-sixth of their monthly income.\n  Paula Brooks of Adwardsville, IL, has coverage through the nonprofit \nagency where she is employed, but she can't afford to add her daughter \nBrittany, who is 9 years old, to her policy.\n  There isn't a State in this Union, there isn't a city or town or \nvillage in this Nation where you could not find this story repeated \nover and over and over again--families that can't afford health \ninsurance, children that go without protection.\n  Let me tell you what has happened since Congress has failed to \naddress this issue. If this is impossible to read as you are following \nthis debate, it is because the print is so small, but what I have is \nthe response of 19 States that have decided they are tired of waiting \nfor Congress. They are trying to expand health care to their citizens. \nIt is pretty clear that many of these States have become desperate. \nCalifornia, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, my home State of \nIllinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, \nMissouri, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Vermont, Rhode Island, and \nWisconsin, they are doing what we are not doing; they are showing \nleadership on the issue of expanding health coverage to the people \nliving in their State. For the life of me, I can't explain why this \nPresident and this Congress ignore one of the most pressing problems \nfacing America today.\n  Luckily for the kids of my home State of Illinois, Governor \nBlagojevich signed a bill yesterday that covers all the children in the \nState. He calls it the All Kids Program. It will offer Illinois's \nuninsured children comprehensive health care that includes doctor \nvisits, hospital stays, prescription drugs, vision care, dental care, \nand medical devices, such as eyeglasses and asthma inhalers.\n  Parents will pay monthly premiums based on their income. For \ninstance, a family of four that earns between $40,000 and $60,000 a \nyear will pay a $40 monthly premium per child and a $10 copay per \nphysician visit.\n  But let's make it clear, this Governor in my home State is trying. In \nIllinois, we are doing something that is not being done in Washington. \nIn Washington, we are not even trying. At the very least, Congress \nshould take steps to ensure all American children have access to \naffordable, quality health insurance coverage.\n  Does anyone doubt the popularity of that suggestion, that if you went \nto the people of America and said, I have a plan that will make sure \nevery kid in America will be covered for a hospital stay, can get to a \ndoctor, can have their prescriptions filled when they need them, \nregular dental care and vision screenings, is there anyone in America \nwho believes that is an extravagance? I don't think so.\n  Kids are the least expensive people to insure. The average cost to \ncover a child in the program in Illinois is $93.23 a month. To cover \nall 9.1 million children in America, if we decided to expand the \nprogram in Illinois to all of America, the cost would be $10 billion \nper year. Now if you are following this and you say, $10 billion, wait \na minute, Senator, that is a huge amount of money for a program, \nremember this: It is health insurance for every child in America.\n  Where would we find the $10 billion? We would find it in the \nlegislation that is being debated by the House and the Senate right \nnow: the 2-year cost of the extensions on capital gains tax cuts, tax \ncuts for the wealthiest Americans. The 2-year cost from 2008 to 2010 is \n$20 billion. So if we defer the tax break the administration is pushing \nfor the wealthiest people in America, if we say they are not going to \nreceive that tax break for the next 2 years, we would have enough money \nto provide basic health insurance for every uninsured child in America, \nand we would eliminate 20 percent of the uninsured Americans with that \nsingle act alone.\n  We could cover all the kids in America for 2 years for the cost of \ncapital gains and dividend tax cuts, and that figure doesn't even \ninclude the State share of the program.\n  The first thing Congress can do is provide States more funding to \nenroll children who are eligible but not enrolled in SCHIP. These kids \naccount for more than half of all uninsured children.\n  Before his last election, President Bush campaigned in Pennsylvania, \nand here is what he said on October 22, 2004:\n\n       We'll keep our commitment to America's children by helping \n     them get a healthy start in life. I'll work with Governors \n     and community leaders and religious leaders to make sure \n     every eligible child is enrolled in our Government's low-\n     income health insurance program.\n\n  President Bush, then a candidate, went on to say:\n\n       We will not allow a lack of attention, or information, to \n     stand between millions of children and the health care they \n     need.\n\n  That was a few days before the election. Since then no proposal to \ncover the uninsured children in America has come from this White House \nnor from\n\n[[Page S12940]]\n\nthis Congress--a campaign promise that hasn't been kept.\n  The majority leader inserted $25 million in funds for outreach in \nlast week's reconciliation bill. That is hardly enough. That isn't \ngoing to reach and insure these children. The bill of the Senator from \nTennessee to fund outreach to kids would appropriate $100 million. Once \nwe get all eligible kids enrolled, we should provide the Department of \nHealth and Human Services with funds to grant to States that want to \ncover more children in their State.\n  Very briefly, here is what my amendment does. It expresses the sense \nof the Senate that the Senate should not vote to extend the capital \ngains and dividend tax cuts until Congress has taken steps to ensure \nthat all children in America have access to affordable, quality health \ninsurance.\n  The majority of the benefits of capital gains and tax cuts go to \nhouseholds with incomes over $1 million a year. Aren't kids in America \na higher priority than millionaires? And how many times do people in \nthe course of a campaign or on this floor talk about family values and \nmoral values? Here is a nice moral choice for the Senate: Is it more \nimportant to give a tax break to someone making more than a million \ndollars a year, or provide health insurance for 9 million uninsured \nchildren in America?\n  How does that play out, whether your inspiration is the Bible, the \nTorah, whatever it happens to be? I think most who have religious \nconvictions and feelings and believe there are moral values we are \nfighting for say this is a pretty simple choice: a choice between tax \ncuts for people making over $1 million a year or health insurance for 9 \nmillion uninsured children.\n\n  Specifically, my amendment would provide grants to States, faith-\nbased organizations, safety net provider schools, and other community \nand nonprofit organizations to facilitate the enrollment of 6.8 million \nchildren currently eligible for SCHIP and not enrolled.\n  It covers 90 percent of the costs associated with the design, \ndevelopment, implementation, and evaluation of enrollment systems that \nwill provide more efficient enrollment and retention of eligible \nchildren.\n  It will establish a grant program under which a State may apply for a \nwaiver to expand coverage of children in their State.\n  When I go back home and speak to the families I represent, time and \nagain they say to me: Are you people in Washington in touch with the \nreality of what is facing us in America? Whether it is a business owner \nwho had to cancel his health insurance because one of his employees had \na sick baby which drove the premiums through the roof for every other \nemployee in the pool, whether it is a member of a labor union who says, \nI am working harder this year, I am getting paid more this year, but I \nhave no take-home pay because it is being taken away from me in health \ninsurance premiums and, Senator, I am getting less coverage, or whether \nit is a parent worried about a sick child and a medical bill they might \nnever be able to repay--these are the realities of the life in America. \nIt is not the reality of the debate in the Senate. We live in a \ndifferent world in the Senate. We live in a world where people with a \nstraight face can stand before us and say it is a much more moral thing \nto do and the right thing to do to give a tax cut to a wealthy person \nthan to provide basic health care for a child in America.\n  That is the choice, and that is what my amendment will offer to the \nMembers of the Senate. I hope they will choose the children over the \nmillionaires.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of the time for \ndebate on the amendment I just offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the contributions \nof Virginia Rose to Lovelock, NV. After serving the city of Lovelock \nfor 35 years, Virginia retired as deputy city clerk on September 23, \n2005.\n  Virginia has proudly lived in Lovelock all her life. As a young \nwoman, she established a strong work ethic on her family's dairy farm \nperforming daily chores with her nine brothers and sisters.\n  She continued her hard work as an office clerk for the city of \nLovelock from 1961 to 1968. In 1977, Virginia returned as a deputy city \nclerk and spent the next 28 years as city clerk and treasurer. \nVirginia's colleagues at the city describe her as a highly motivated \nand gracious leader who knows how to organize and accomplish what needs \nto get done.\n  Virginia continues to serve her community today through active \nparticipation in her church, the Pershing County Alumni Association, \nthe Pershing County Democratic Committee, the Lovelock Volunteer Fire \nDepartment Ladies Auxiliary, the Sierra Swiss Club, the Lovelock \nCommunity Singers, and several other organizations.\n  Well liked and respected by her community, she has been honored on \nnumerous occasions since 1964. Most recently, she received the Northern \nNevada Women of Achievement Award and the Diocese of Reno Outstanding \nChristian Service Award.\n  Virginia would likely describe her greatest honor as mother to Kim \nand Timothy and grandmother to Sarah, Adam, Lauren, and Caroline. She \nshares in this joy with Glenn, her husband of 46 years.\n  I have known Virginia for many years. While she is considered a \npillar in the Lovelock community, she modestly describes her \ncontributions as a privilege. Her dedication, diligence, and \nexceptional work has improved the lives of her fellow residents. I hope \nthat you will join me in acknowledging Virginia Rose for her service to \nthe Lovelock community on the occasion of her retirement from the city \nof Lovelock.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/16/senate-section/article/S12941-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S12941]]\n                  32 YEARS OF DEDICATED SENATE SERVICE\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the service of \nCarolyn Iddings, my Sergeant at Arms customer support analyst. On June \n4, 2005, Carolyn celebrated 32 years of service in the Senate.\n  Carolyn began her Senate career in the office of Senator Mark \nHatfield of Oregon. For 16 years, she helped develop many of the \nsystems the Senate uses today including office computers and \ncorrespondence management systems. Carolyn then joined the Sergeant at \nArms office and has continued to assist in the development and \ndeployment of many Senate information management systems.\n  Shortly after my election to the Senate, Carolyn was assigned to \nguide my staff through the complex process of opening a Senate office. \nHer experience and knowledge of the inner workings of a Member's office \nwere indispensable as she assisted my staff in the opening days of the \n106th Congress. She took my systems administrator under her wing and \nhelped him equip in a timely and efficient manner. Thanks to her \nefforts, my office was up and running the day I was sworn in as a U.S. \nSenator. Her knowledge of the challenging bureaucratic landscape of the \nSenate played a key role in the smooth setup of my offices. On numerous \noccasions Carolyn's help has proven invaluable as our office automation \nsystems have evolved.\n  Over the last 7 years, Carolyn has answered hundreds of questions, \nbriefed my staff on countless security, information technology, and \nemergency planning matters. She has shown consistent patience, \nkindness, and expertise in her interactions with me and my staff, \nalways willing to lend a helping hand. Carolyn demonstrates outstanding \nprofessionalism in her job and I wish her the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/16/senate-section/article/S12941-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     VETERANS AND TROOP DEPLOYMENTS\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the contribution \nof our Armed Forces to this great Nation. It is important to reflect on \nthe sacrifice and commitment of the brave men and women who have put \ntheir lives on the line to defend what our Nation stands for--freedom, \nequality, and justice for all Americans.\n  Without our veterans, we would not be the free Nation that we are \ntoday.\n  The marines, airmen, and soldiers of Montana have always risen to the \nchallenge by fighting overseas and protecting our homeland.\n  Over the past 2 weeks 700 members of the first of the 163rd infantry \nbattalion of Montana's National Guard returned home after an 18 month \ndeployment in Iraq and 250 troops from the first of the 189th aviation \nbattalion will return home before the holidays.\n  I am extremely proud of these men and women, but I also have great \nconcern for them.\n  Montana now has the highest percentage of veterans per capita in its \npopulation than any other state. We also have the highest percentage of \nfemale veterans in the country, per capita.\n  According to the most recent census, the veteran population in \nMontana is 108,476 out of an adult civilian population of 668,651. \nSimply put, veterans, and families of veterans, constitute a \nsignificant portion of the population in Montana.\n  They are our mothers, fathers, daughters, sons, sisters, brothers, \nand friends who are making sacrifices. I take our Nation's commitment \nto our veterans seriously.\n  Many Montanans choose to serve because of the economic situation in \nrural America.\n  There is no question that rural States are carrying a huge burden \nwhen it comes to our current conflicts abroad and these veterans \ndeserve proper healthcare.\n  I am proud to say that this year the VA Hospital at Fort Harrison, \nHelena, MT and its outpatient clinics have been ranked as the best VA \nmedical system in the country; however, the shortfalls that we faced in \nveterans healthcare funding nationwide in 2005 and 2006 are \ndiscouraging.\n  We still need to ensure that those who have given so much for our \ncountry are granted their due benefits, and treated with respect. Let's \nthink big when it comes to providing for our veterans and health care.\n  We must fully fund the veterans' health care system and we should \nmake spending mandatory in order to ensure that those who have given so \nmuch to our country are granted their due benefits and are treated with \nrespect and thanks.\n  Let's think big when it comes to providing for our veterans and \nhealth care. We must fully fund the Veterans health care system and we \nshould make spending mandatory in order to ensure that those who have \ngiven so much to our country are granted the benefits they deserve.\n  Since September 11, 2001, about 80 percent of Montana's National \nGuard members have been deployed to the Middle East, some of them more \nthan once. This Monday in Great Falls, MT, members of our 341st space \nwing and Red Horse Squadrons from Malmstrom Air Force Base and the Air \nNational Guard will deploy to Iraq.\n  When they return, they should not have to worry about getting health \ncare and benefits.\n  As we welcome home our new veterans and deploy troops overseas, let \nus remember those who have served honorably in all wars, and pay \nparticular attention to those who have made the ultimate sacrifice.\n  The current wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have taken the lives of the \nfollowing brave Montanans: SPC Travis Arndt, Great Falls; CPT Michael \nMacKinnon, Helena; PFC Andrew Bedard, Missoula; LCpl Nicholas Bloem, \nBozeman; SFC Robbie McNary, Lewistown; CPL Raleigh Smith, Troy; LCpl \nNathan Wood, Great Falls; SSG Aaron Honeyman, Glasgow; LCpl Kane Funke, \nKalispell; CPL Dean Pratt, Stevensville; PFC Owen D. Witt, Sand \nSprings; 1LT Edward Saltz, Big Fork; PFC Kristofer Stoneisfer, \nMissoula; 1LT Josh Hyland, Missoula.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/16/senate-section/article/S12941-3", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12941-S12942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, drought continues to be a serious problem \nfor many states in this country, and I am very pleased that yesterday, \nas part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006, \nwe passed legislation that will help small businesses in those States \nthat have been hurt by drought. I thank Senators Levin and Warner, and \ntheir staffs, for their help in moving drought relief one step closer \nto enactment.\n  This legislation helps small businesses that need disaster assistance \nbut can not get it through the Small Business Administration's disaster \nloan program. You see, the SBA does not treat all drought victims the \nsame. The agency only helps those small businesses whose income is tied \nto farming and agriculture. However, farmers and ranchers are not the \nonly small business owners whose livelihoods are at risk when drought \nhits their communities. The impact can be just as devastating to the \nowners of rafting businesses, marinas, and bait and tackle shops. Just \nask the many small businesses on Lake Mead, outside of Las Vegas, that \nmet with the committee in July: fishing guides that struggle to find \nramps that still reach the water to launch their boats; boat \ndealerships in the county that have lost an estimated $100 million in \nsales because recreation at the lake is down; marinas paying millions \nto move their docks, buildings, and utilities, trying to ``chase the \nwater.'' The area usually gets 8 to 10 million visitors a year. \nHowever, the impact of drought on Lake Mead has had a serious adverse \nimpact on the regional economy, exceeding $1 billion according to local \nofficials. Lake Michigan has suffered similar economic losses, and its \ndelegation has been pushing for small business relief for years. Sadly, \nthese small businesses cannot get help through the SBA's disaster loan \nprogram because of something taxpayers hate about Government--\nbureaucracy.\n  The SBA denies these businesses access to disaster loans because its \nlawyers say drought is not a sudden event and therefore it is not a \ndisaster by definition. However, contrary to the agency's position that \ndrought is not a disaster, in July of 2002, when this legislation was \noriginally introduced, the SBA had in effect drought disaster \ndeclarations in 36 States. As of today, 17 States are under SBA drought \ndisaster declarations: Wisconsin, Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia, \nMontana, Oregon,\n\n[[Page S12942]]\n\nNebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, Oklahoma, Illinois, Arkansas, Louisiana, \nMississippi, Texas, Kansas, and California. Adding insult to injury, in \nthose States where the agency declares drought disasters, it limits \nassistance to only farm-related small businesses. Take, for instance, \nSouth Carolina. A couple of years ago that entire State had been \ndeclared a disaster by the SBA, but the administration would not help \nall drought victims. Let me read to you from the declaration:\n\n       Small businesses located in all 46 counties may apply for \n     economic injury disaster loan assistance through the SBA. \n     These are working capital loans to help the business continue \n     to meet its obligations until the business returns to normal \n     conditions. . . . Only small, non-farm agriculture dependent \n     and small agricultural cooperatives are eligible to apply for \n     assistance. Nurseries are also eligible for economic injury \n     caused by drought conditions.\n\n  The SBA has the authority to help all small businesses hurt by \ndrought in declared disaster areas, but the agency won't do it. For \nyears the agency has been applying the law unfairly, helping some and \nnot others, and it is out of compliance with the law. The small \nbusiness drought relief provision that passed yesterday as part of the \nDefense Authorization Act--and that I introduced this July as the Small \nBusiness Drought Relief Act of 2005 S. 1463--would force SBA to comply \nwith existing law, restoring fairness to an unfair system, and get help \nto small business drought victims that need it.\n  This legislation has been thoroughly reviewed, passing the committee \nof jurisdiction and the full Senate three times, with supporters \nnumbering up to 25, from both sides of the aisle. In addition to \napproval by the committee of jurisdiction, OMB, the Office of \nManagement and Budget, approved virtually identical legislation in \n2003. The legislation passed yesterday includes those changes we worked \nout with the administration, and I see no reason why this should not be \nretained in the final conference report and sent to the President for \nhis signature.\n  I thank Senators Snowe and Bond, our current and past chairs, both of \nwhom have been supportive of this legislation each time it was \nintroduced and passed. And I again thank Senators Levin and Warner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/16/senate-section/article/S12942-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On September 3, 2003 in Bridgeport, CT, George Hamilton hosted an \nafternoon picnic at his home. During the picnic, Hamilton and another \nguest discovered that one of the other men at the event was gay. They \nattacked and beat the gay man, causing injuries to his face and ribs. \nAccording to sources, throughout the attack the men shouted anti-gay \nslurs.\n  I believe that our Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nin all circumstances, from threats to them at home. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a major step forward in achieving that \ngoal. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current \nlaw, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/16/senate-section/article/S12942-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12942-S12943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak briefly on some of the \nvotes that this body held yesterday related to the fiscal year 2006 \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill. Overall, this year's Defense \nauthorization bill was a step in the right direction--for supporting \nour troops, for strengthening our military, and for securing our \ncountry. While I regret the limited time that we had to debate \namendments, the end result here is, on balance, positive.\n  There are, however, a couple of important votes on amendments that I \nwould like to take this opportunity to discuss. First, the two \namendments on Iraq--one offered by Senator Levin, which I cosponsored, \nand the other a Republican alternative offered by Senator Warner, which \nI voted for.\n  These two amendments were very similar, and they were both steps in \nthe right direction. They both express the Senate's belief that U.S. \nforces should not remain in Iraq indefinitely. They both establish \nexpectations that calendar year 2006 should be a period of significant \ntransition to full Iraqi sovereignty, thereby creating the conditions \nfor the phased redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq. They both stress \nthe need for compromise among Iraqis to achieve a sustainable sovereign \ngovernment. And they both require the President to begin sharing with \nthe American people his campaign plan for success in Iraq.\n  But these two amendments, despite all of their similarities, have a \nfundamental difference. The Democratic amendment would have gone one \nimportant step further than the Republican amendment that we ended up \nadopting. It would have required the President to tell the American \npeople not only his campaign plan, but estimated dates for the \nredeployment of U.S. forces--in other words, a timetable and strategy \nfor success in Iraq. The Levin amendment acknowledged that unexpected \ncontingencies might arise, and that such contingencies might change \nsome of the projected redeployment dates, but I still believe that \nwithout these projected dates, we have left ourselves in an open-ended \ncommitment. That is not good for us, it is not good for Iraq, and it is \nnot good for stability in the region.\n  Ultimately, I supported the Warner amendment because, as I have said, \nit is a step in the right direction. But it frankly doesn't take us any \ncloser to convincing the American people that the President has a plan \nor a timetable for bringing our operations in Iraq to a successful \nconclusion. And I believe that our soldiers and the American public \ndeserve better.\n  I would also like to briefly address three related amendments offered \nby Senators Graham, Bingaman, and one by both Senators Graham and \nLevin, dealing with the issue of habeas corpus and detainees who are in \nU.S. custody at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n  I voted against Senator Graham's underlying amendment on this issue \nbecause I believe that it would have been a step in the wrong direction \nfor our country. That is not to say that we should be providing \nsanctuary to terrorists. We shouldn't. Any coward who is complicit in \nterrorist attacks against the U.S. and the civilized world must be \nbrought to justice.\n  I also recognize that the new threat posed by international terrorist \norganizations such as al-Qaida, and their murderous henchmen, requires \nlaw-abiding nations to adapt in how they combat this threat.\n  But as we adapt to the terrorist threat, we have to make sure that we \ndon't hurt ourselves, and the cause of freedom, in the process. \nAmerica's judicial system is part of the bedrock of our country. \nProtecting its integrity should be a cause of highest concern. That is \nwhy I voted for Senator Bingaman's second-degree amendment to strike \nthe Graham amendment's text that would have stripped U.S. courts of the \nability to review writs of habeas corpus submitted by or on behalf of \nforeign detainees at Guantanamo Bay. I regret that Senator Bingaman's \namendment failed on a party line vote.\n  I commend, however, Senator Levin for working with Senator Graham to \nstrike a compromise on this issue. The Graham-Levin compromise is not \nperfect. It certainly doesn't go as far as this Senator would have \nliked in fixing the underlying text. But faced with the prospect of the \noriginal Graham amendment being sent to conference in its original \nform, I chose to support the Graham-Levin compromise, which is a \ndefinite improvement over the underlying text. What is particularly \nheartening is that Senator Graham, upon reflection, realized that his \namendment went too far and accepted the moderating suggestions proposed \nby Senator Levin. My hope is that the conferees on this bill will \ncontinue to improve upon the Graham-Levin text.\n  Mr. President, as I said at the outset, the Defense authorization \nbill that the Senate passed yesterday is not perfect. But on balance, I \nbelieve that it sends a message to our troops that we are here to \nsupport them, and that we remain committed to providing them\n\n[[Page S12943]]\n\nwith everything that they need to come home from their missions abroad \nsafely and securely. At the end of the day, that is a good start.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/16/senate-section/article/S12943-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   PROFILES IN COMPASSION: IOWANS PITCH IN TO HELP VICTIMS OF KATRINA\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, Iowans are a big hearted, generous people, \nespecially toward people in need. And citizens of my State proved this, \nonce again, by extending a helping hand to the victims of Hurricane \nKatrina. Some Iowans as individuals or in organized groups--traveled \ndirectly to the region to give assistance in their areas of expertise. \nOther collected funds and supplies to send to the gulf coast region. \nStill others helped to welcome more than 1,400 evacuees who made their \nway to Iowa. And, of course, countless Iowans reached into their bank \naccounts to contribute to the Red Cross, the Salvation Army, and other \norganizations participating in the relief effort.\n  I would like to mention at least a few of the individuals and groups \nthat went far beyond the call of duty in the aftermath of Katrina.\n  Even before Katrina made landfall--within 2 hours of receiving an \nemergency call--the Iowa-1 Disaster Medical Assistance Team based in \nKirkwood, IA, began making its way to the gulf. Commanded by Dave \nWilson, this team of rapid-response medical professionals set up \nheadquarters in Bay St. Louis and Waveland, MS. In the first 14 days \nafter the Hurricane hit, they took care of more than 2,700 patients. \nTheir facilities were equipped to care for only 125 patients a day, \nbut, on some days, the team cared for as many as 450 people.\n  Another Disaster Medical Assistance Team from Iowa, this one \nconsisting of 30 members, helped to turn an abandoned hospital in Baton \nRouge, LA into a full-fledged emergency room hospital. Key members of \nthis team were Beth Boyd of Nevada, IA; Melissa Groet of Oskaloosa; and \nKevin Long of Des Moines. A smaller crew from this DMAT team, all of \nthem environmental health experts, deployed to rural Louisiana where \nthey played a critical role in getting public water systems back \nonline.\n  Some 140 members of the Iowa Army and Air National Guard deployed \nfrom Camp Dodge to the gulf region in a convoy of fuel tankers, water \ntankers, food and water trucks, and other much-needed equipment. Dubbed \n``Joint Task Force Iowa,'' their mission was to provide medical, \nlogistics, and water-purification support in Mississippi. In addition, \nthe 185th Air Refueling Wing of the Iowa National Guard provided \nevacuation, transport, security, and fuel-handling missions from its \nbase in Sioux City.\n  Meanwhile, back in Iowa, thousands of Iowans went into action in \nthose initial days and weeks after Katrina hit the gulf. For example, \nthe Iowa Jaycees collected enough supplies to fill 20 semi tractor \ntrailers bound for Louisiana. Half of the semis carried clean drinking \nwater, and the others carried diapers, baby wipes, batteries, hygiene \nproducts, canned food, and much more, all bound for Louisiana. Jaycee \nchapters all across Iowa contributed to this magnificent effort.\n  So many individual Iowans stood out as profiles in compassion during \nthis difficult time. For example, Pastor Rod Bradley of the True Bible \nBaptist Church personally made three trips by car to pick up evacuees \nin Gonzales, LA. Wesley Jones traveled from Iowa to the gulf to help \nclear away debris. And school children in LeClaire, IA, helped evacuee \nchildren to adjust to their new school, and sold homemade bracelets to \nraise money for the evacuee families.\n  Mr. President, obviously, these are just snapshots. I cannot possibly \nname all the people from my State who gave generously of their time, \ntalents, and energy to assist the victims of Katrina. Thousands of \nIowans opened their hearts, their homes, and their pocketbooks. I \nsimply want to take this time to thank them--the named and the unnamed \nfor their amazing response to this tragedy. They have done Iowa proud, \nand I am deeply grateful to them for their service and sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/16/senate-section/article/S12943-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                WASTEWATER TREATMENT WORKS SECURITY ACT\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Wastewater \nTreatment Works Security Act of 2005. I am proud to be an original \ncosponsor of this bill.\n  When Timothy McVeigh drove a rental vehicle up to a Federal building \nin Oklahoma City, Americans began to look at trucks in a completely new \nway. So we learned to screen vehicles to safeguard against such a \ntragedy ever happening again.\n  On September 11, 2001, a thing as ordinary as an airplane became an \ninstrument of destruction and terror, robbing innocent people of the \nrest of their lives. As a result, we have gotten pretty good at \nscreening people and their luggage at airports, and at keeping planes \nout of protected air space.\n  While these changes are necessary and prudent, there is another part \nof the equation to consider: the act of terror not yet committed. We \nmust look at the threats our security experts have identified and \naddress these potential threats.\n  One such threat is a possible attack on our Nation's wastewater \ntreatment plants. Traditionally, wastewater treatment plants have \nstored chemicals that, if used properly, clean the water of harmful \norganisms. When most of these plants were built, we did not design them \nto ward against use as potential weapons of mayhem and destruction. \nAppropriately, we were only concerned about the environment, safety, \nand preventing accidents.\n  Since September 11, as security concerns have been identified in this \nsector, many of these facilities have taken steps on their own to \nswitch to safer alternative treatments or to further secure chemicals \nand the facilities against deliberate acts of terrorism. But, such \nchanges are expensive. Many of these facilities need assistance to \nupgrade security at the facility and to switch to these safer \nalternative forms of treatment.\n  The Wastewater Treatment Works Security Act of 2005 puts in place \nrequirements to assess facilities' vulnerability and provides much \nneeded financial assistance to upgrade security and to switch to safer \nforms of chemical treatment. My only regret is that the bill does not \npick up more of the cost of the assessments and upgrades. I believe the \nFederal Government needs to take on a larger share of funding these \ntypes of homeland security improvements.\n  This is a much needed bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/16/senate-section/article/S12943-3", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12943-S12944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               LEAKGATE AND THE INDICTMENT OF LEWIS LIBBY\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, 2 years ago, after the Washington Post \nfirst reported that ``two senior White House officials'' had exposed \nValerie Plame Wilson's identity as a covert operative of the Central \nIntelligence Agency, I repeatedly came to the Senate floor to call on \nPresident Bush to act quickly to identify the leakers.\n  After all, this was a potentially illegal act committed by ``senior \nWhite House officials.'' This should have outraged everyone at the \nWhite House. President Bush should have taken steps to identity the \nperpetrators forthwith.\n  Bear in mind that the number of ``senior White House officials'' with \nthe appropriate security clearances and access to knowledge about Ms. \nWilson's identity could be counted on one hand--two hands at a maximum. \nIf Mr. Bush had been serious about identifying the perpetrators, those \n5 to 10 ``senior White House officials'' could have been immediately \nsummoned to the Oval Office and questioned by the President. This \nmatter would have been resolved literally within 24 hours.\n  But that did not happen. There was no outrage. There was no internal \ninvestigation. There was no angry President Bush demanding answers from \nhis senior aides. Instead, we have had more than 2 years of \nconcealment, coverup, and contempt.\n  Well, Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald has now broken that coverup \nwide open. Vice President Dick Cheney's top aide, Scooter Libby, has \nbeen indicted for lying and obstructing justice in order to conceal his \nrole as one of the two leakers. ``Official A,'' the second leaker, is \nPresident Bush's top aide, Karl Rove, according to multiple reports in \nthe media, quoting senior White House sources.\n\n[[Page S12944]]\n\n  But let's be clear, Mr. President, this is about more than Mr. Libby \nrepeatedly lying about his role in leaking a CIA agent's identity; this \nis about the Bush administration hiding the fact that it manipulated \nand manufactured intelligence in order to justify the war in Iraq. This \nis about the Bush administration stopping at nothing to attack and \ndiscredit anyone who dared to question its efforts to ``fix'' the \nintelligence. This is about the United States of America being led to \nwar under false pretenses.\n  Only one person in this enterprise, Mr. Libby, has been indicted so \nfar--though Mr. Rove remains under investigation. But the issue here is \nnot strictly: Who perpetrated a criminal offense? The issue is: Who \nelse participated in the hardball political campaign to discredit and \npunish Ambassador Wilson--and who instigated that campaign?\n  According to Mr. Fitzgerald's indictment, Vice President Cheney's \noffice was the hub of a concerted effort to gather information about \nAmbassador Wilson and to counter the assertions made in his famous New \nYork Times op-ed. Indeed, according to the indictment, it was none \nother than Vice President Dick Cheney himself who first told Mr. Libby \nabout Valerie Plame Wilson's identity as a CIA operative and wife of \nAmbassador Joe Wilson.\n  Again according to the indictment, on July 12, 2003, Mr. Libby flew \nwith the Vice President on Air Force Two, and one of the issues \ndiscussed on board was how to deal with the news media. Just hours \nlater, the indictment says, Mr. Libby told two reporters about Mrs. \nWilson's status as a CIA agent.\n  So this gives rise to several obvious questions: What did Vice \nPresident Cheney know, and when did he know it? Why did Mr. Libby lie, \nsaying that he first learned about Mrs. Wilson's identity from \nreporters? Was he trying to conceal a broader effort, involving the \nVice President, to go after Ambassador Wilson?\n  Vice President Cheney owes a full explanation to the American people.\n  Bear in mind that it was Mr. Cheney who was most aggressive in \npushing the CIA to come up with intelligence to justify an invasion of \nIraq. The CIA told him definitively that there was no meeting in Vienna \nbetween Iraqi agents and 9/11 terrorist Mohammed Atta, but Mr. Cheney \ncontinued to assert in public that this meeting took place. Time and \nagain, he exaggerated the case for Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, \nincluding his statement that Iraq had ``reconstituted nuclear \nweapons.'' It was the Vice President and his aides who took the lead in \nresponding to those who challenged those and other claims by the \nadministration.\n  By all accounts, Mr. Libby was a disciplined, cautious staff person \nthe antithesis of a rogue operator. It is farfetched to imagine that he \nwas freelancing when he outed Mrs. Wilson's identity as a CIA agent.\n  So the American people need to hear directly from Vice President \nCheney: Did he discuss with Mr. Libby whether to tell reporters about \nMrs. Wilson's identity? When the Vice President read in the media that \nMr. Libby had claimed that reporters first told him about Mrs. Wilson's \nidentity, what did he say to Mr. Libby, given the fact that it was he, \nthe Vice President, who first told Mr. Libby about Mrs. Wilson? Why has \nthe Vice President not condemned the leaks and lies by his top aide?\n  It is very clear why Mr. Libby lied about who told him about Mrs. \nWilson's identity. It was to frustrate, sidetrack, and stall Mr. \nFitzgerald's investigation until after the 2004 election. As Mr. \nFitzgerald said in announcing his indictment, if Mr. Libby had not \nthrown sand in the eyes of the prosecutors, ``we would have been here \nin October 2004 instead of October 2005.'' So Mr. Libby's lies were not \nonly about protecting his original source, Vice President Cheney; they \nwere also about delaying any indictments by Mr. Fitzgerald until after \nthe election. They were about not allowing the election to become an \n``accountability moment,'' which very well could have denied President \nBush reelection.\n  At the same time, we need an accounting from President Bush. Karl \nRove is the President's closest adviser. We now know from multiple \naccounts in the media, citing senior administration sources, that Mr. \nRove was one of the two ``senior White House officials'' who leaked \nMrs. Wilson's identity as a CIA agent to reporters. Mr. Rove is still \nunder investigation, and may or may not face indictment. But whether or \nnot he is actually indicted, his actions were unethical and \nunacceptable.\n  Two years ago, we heard testimony from Vincent Cannistrano, former \nChief of Operations and Analysis at the CIA Counterterrorism Center, on \nthe far-reaching damage caused by the disclosure of Mrs. Wilson's \nidentify. He said: ``Twenty years of training and experience and \nmillions of dollars were invested in this agent, Valerie Plame \n[Wilson]. . . . The consequences are much greater than Valerie Plame \n[Wilson's] job as a clandestine CIA employee. They include damage to \nthe lives and livelihoods of many foreign nationals with whom she was \nconnected, and it has destroyed a clandestine cover mechanism that may \nhave been used to protect other CIA non-official cover officers.''\n  Early on, President Bush stated that he would fire any White House \nofficial found to have been involved in leaking Mrs. Wilson's identity \nas a CIA agent. To this day, on the White House Web site, you can read \nthe transcript of a press conference on June 10, 2004. A reporter \nasked: ``Mr. President, do you stand by your pledge to fire anyone \nfound to have [been involved in leaking the CIA agent's name]?'' The \nPresident responded with an unambiguous ``yes.''\n  Today, the President needs to come clean about Mr. Rove's role. He \nneeds to publicly acknowledge, as senior administration officials have \nalready done anonymously, that Mr. Rove was the second leaker. And then \nhe needs to make good on his pledge to fire him.\n  I urge President Bush--for the good of the country and for the good \nof his administration--to follow through on his public pledge. The \nPresident's original instincts were exactly right: It should be \nintolerable to allow someone who leaked a CIA agent's identity to stay \non in the White House.\n  It is also deeply disturbing that Mr. Rove continues to hold a top-\nsecret security clearance. Like all holders of a top-secret clearance, \nMr. Rove signed a ``Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement'' \nacknowledging that ``unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized retention or \nnegligent handling of classified information by me could cause damage \nor irreparable injury to the United States.'' The signer of the form \nstates: ``I have been advised that any breach of this agreement may \nresult in the termination of any security clearances I hold; removal \nfrom any position of special confidence and trust requiring such \nclearances; or the termination of my employment . . .''\n  Before signing the nondisclosure agreement, an employee is given \ntraining and a booklet explaining the nondisclosure rules, which \ninclude prohibitions against providing classified information--or even \nconfirming it--to reporters.\n  The facts are plain: Mr. Rove violated the terms of his security \nclearance. If the White House disputes this, then it owes the American \npeople a formal Justice Department investigation of Mr. Rove's actions. \nIf it is determined that he violated the terms of his Nondisclosure \nAgreement, he should be stripped of his security clearance immediately. \nThis is an issue entirely separate from Mr. Fitzgerald's ongoing \ninvestigation, but it is no less important.\n  I am sure that President Bush is concerned about the damage to his \nadministration from the leaking of Mrs. Wilson's covert identity. A \nweek ago, the Washington Post reported the results of its most recent \npoll. It found that by a ratio of 3 to 1--46 percent to 15 percent--\nAmericans say that the level of honesty and ethics in the Government \nhas declined since Mr. Bush took office.\n  I believe it is time for Mr. Rove to go. It is time for President \nBush to restore honor and integrity to the White House and to demand \nthe highest ethical standards from his staff.\n  President Bush still has more than 3 years in office. For our country \nto be successful, he must be successful. To that end, I urge the \nPresident to set a new tone and to chart a new a new course. He should \nbegin by asking Mr. Rove to leave and by asking Vice President Cheney \nto give a full and honest accounting of his role in this matter.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/16/senate-section/article/S12945-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S12945]]\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO HARDY L. BROWN\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nlifetime of achievement of Hardy L. Brown. His story is a true American \nsuccess story and he stands today as a leader in his community.\n  Hardy L. Brown was born in Trenton, NC, in 1942, the son of a \nsharecropper. After graduating from high school, Hardy Brown relocated \nto California where he found work as a laborer for Kaiser Steel in \nFontana. He did not remain a laborer for long, and, in time, he took a \nmanagement position with Kaiser Steel. During this same time, he also \nbecame actively involved with many community projects, always with a \nfocus on community service.\n  Hardy Brown was elected to the San Bernardino City Unified School \nDistrict's Board in 1983 and served for 12 years. He served as \npresident of the board and was the first African-American male to hold \nthis position. During his tenure as board president, he was responsible \nfor the re-opening of and the changing of names of two schools on the \nwest side of San Bernardino.\n  The banner of The Black Voice News, a weekly news publication \nfocusing on issues surrounding the African American community, claims, \n``The Black Voice News, serving the Inland Empire for 30 years.'' \nCheryl and Hardy have, in fact, owned and operated the newspaper and \nserved the Inland Empire for 28 of those successful years. He has also \nserved on the board of the West Coast Black Publishers Association and \nhas been active in the National Newspaper Publishers Association, which \nnamed him Publisher of the Year in 2000. He also has served as \npresident of the California Black Media Association, an advocacy \nalliance for Black-owned newspapers, magazines, and radio stations.\n  Hardy L. Brown has had a lasting impact on southern California both \nthrough his public service and through his weekly publications. His \nadvice and counsel are often sought by leaders in education, and by \ncivic leaders and by Members of Congress. In fact, Hardy served on the \nstaff of the late Congressman George E. Brown, Jr. in the Inland \nEmpire. He and his wife, Cheryl, provide an important and reliable \nprogressive voice and insight to the community.

Mr. President, one of my longtime friends, \nPatricia Patterson, and I were recently discussing the life and service \nof a great American, and I wanted to take a moment and bring to the \nattention of my colleagues this American success story.\n  Al Casey passed away on July 10, 2004, after a lifetime of \ncontributing strong leadership and a gregarious disposition to numerous \ncompanies, communities, and organizations from across the country.\n  After putting himself through Harvard, Al enlisted in the Army during \nWorld War II. Following his military service, he returned to Harvard \nbusiness school, earning a graduate degree in finance. Al loved \nHarvard, and his friendships there opened doors and enriched his life \nthroughout his long career.\n  Al's first job was in New York for Railway Express. He and Ellie, his \nwife of more than 40 years, then moved to San Francisco with the \nSouthern Pacific Railroad. Al later worked as President of the Times \nMirror Company and the Los Angeles Times for 8 years, before moving to \npossibly his most visible corporate assignment--CEO of American \nAirlines. His philosophy, ``you don't have to be mean to be tough,'' \ncarried him to success in most of his professional endeavors, \nespecially with American, where Al provided aggressive leadership. When \nhe came to American Airlines, he had already established a reputation \nof high ethical behavior. This, combined with his ability to laugh at \nhimself, secured for him the cooperation and loyalty of his employees.\n  Following his retirement from American Airlines, Al began a \nrelationship with SMU's Cox Business School as a faculty member. His \nteaching career was interrupted to rescue First International \nBankshares as it emerged from bankruptcy. Later, he served as \nPostmaster General of the United States under President Reagan. Al \nenjoyed this tour immensely, even signing letters to close friends as \n``Big Stamp.'' He returned to teaching, only to be tapped in 1991 by \nPresident George H.W. Bush and Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal \nReserve Bank, to pilot the Resolution Trust Corporation--which was \ncharged with disposing of financial and real estate assets left behind \nin the wake of failed savings and loan companies in the 1980s. It was a \nmassive undertaking that no one thought could be done. Al worked for 18 \nmonths and was able to lead the RTC in disposing of almost all of the \nassets by the time the Clinton administration took office.\n  Al had a positive outlook on life and genuinely desired to know about \nthe triumphs and tribulations in the lives of friends and coworkers. He \nsupported countless community and civic organizations and was committed \nto improving the cities and neighborhoods where he lived and worked.\n  The effects of his steady guidance and endless enthusiasm for life \nhave been felt in major corporations, in professional associations, in \ngovernment organizations, and in the personal lives of many Americans. \nAlbert Casey coined ``Casey's Law,'' which holds that ``if anything \ncould go right, it should.'' I was honored to know Al, and I thank you, \nMr. President, for the opportunity to commemorate such a fine man. He \nis certainly missed and fondly remembered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/16/senate-section/article/S12945-3", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12945-S12946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL O. HILL\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to pay tribute today to \nMichael O. Hill, superintendent of Assateague Island National Seashore. \nMike is retiring after a long and distinguished career in the National \nPark Service, and I want to thank him for his service to our Nation and \nespecially for the outstanding job he did in managing and enhancing \nAssateague Island National Seashore since coming to Maryland in 2000.\n  Throughout his 33-year career with the National Park Service, Mike \nHill has distinguished himself through his commitment and dedication to \nmanaging and protecting some of our Nation's most precious treasures. \nBeginning as a seasonal employee at Sequoia National Park in 1973, \nMike's career quickly took him through a variety of increasingly \nchallenging posts, from his first permanent position as a horse patrol \nranger at Petrified Forest National Park to management positions in \nparks all over our country including Channel Islands National Park, \nShenandoah National Park, VA, and Biscayne National Park, FL. In 1990, \nhe was selected for the 2-year Bevinetto congressional fellowship \nprogram, where he worked with the National Park Service and Congress to \nbetter manage our national parks. In 1993, he became superintendent of \nPetersburg National Battlefield, and in 2000 he was selected for his \npresent position at Assateague Island National Seashore.\n  Over the past 5 years, I have had the opportunity and privilege to \nwork closely with Mike on several initiatives to protect the natural \nresources at Assateague and to enhance visitors' experiences at the \nseashore. I know firsthand the great leadership and expertise he \nbrought not only to these initiatives, but equally important, to \nsupporting and encouraging one of the finest staffs of park \nprofessionals in the country--at a time when all our parks are \noperating with only two-thirds of the needed funding and personnel. \nUnder Mike's direction, the integrity of the northern 7 miles of the \nNational Seashore has been restored after decades of unnatural erosion, \nplans have been advanced to develop a new barrier island visitors \ncenter to accommodate the increasing number of visitors to the park, \nand partnerships with the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, the \nMaryland Coastal Bay Program, and the State and local governments have \nbeen strengthened.\n  Mike's dedication to the stewardship of the National Park System has \nearned him the respect and admiration of his colleagues, park visitors, \nand community residents, alike. His passion for Assateague was evident \neven in\n\n[[Page S12946]]\n\nhis voicemail: ``I can't take your call right now. With any luck, I'm \nout on the Island.'' It is due to that commitment that visitors to \nAssateague and other units of the National Park System will benefit \nfrom his labors for years to come. I want to extend my personal \ncongratulations and thanks for his many years of hard work and \ndedication to the principal conservation mission of the National Park \nService and join with his friends and coworkers in wishing him and his \nfamily well in the years to come.\n  It is my firm conviction that public service is one of the most \nhonorable callings, one that demands the very best, most dedicated \nefforts of those who have the opportunity to serve their fellow \ncitizens and country. Throughout his career, Mike Hill has exemplified \na steadfast commitment to meeting his demand.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/16/senate-section/article/S12946-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   COMMENDING SMOKEY HOLLER TREE FARM\n\n Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Earl, \nBetsy, Meg, and Buddy Deal of Smokey Holler Tree Farm in Laurel \nSprings, NC, for winning the National Christmas Tree Association's 2005 \nNational Christmas Tree Contest. As Grand Champions, the Deal family \nhas the distinguished honor of providing this year's official White \nHouse Christmas tree. This is a storied tradition that began in 1966, \nand I applaud the Deal family for producing North Carolina's ninth \nofficial White House Christmas tree. After winning at the State level, \nthe Deal family's prized 18\\1/2\\-foot Fraser fir was selected out of 22 \nother entries at the national competition. The tree was then approved \nby White House Chief Usher Gary Walters and Grounds Foreman Mike Lawn \nto be the Blue Room Christmas tree. The Deal family will have the honor \nof presenting the prized Blue Room tree to First Lady Laura Bush in a \nspecial ceremony at the White House on November 28, 2005. As an added \nbonus, the Deal family will provide a tree for the Oval Office and \nanother tree for the private residence at the White House.\n  This year's official White House Christmas tree is a fine example of \nthe exceptional quality of Christmas trees that we have in North \nCarolina. North Carolina is one of the top producers of Christmas \ntrees, providing roughly one out of every five Christmas trees in the \nUnited States, thereby contributing over $100 million annually to North \nCarolina's economy. But this success does not come easily; it takes \nseveral years of meticulous care and attention to raise a Christmas \ntree. An average 7-foot tree is about 10 years old, and throughout that \ntime the grower diligently shapes, grooms, and fertilizes the tree \nseveral times per year. Not many people realize the years of hard work \nand sacrifice that go into raising a Christmas tree, and our growers \nare to be commended for their continuous success.\n  North Carolina has a rich history in Christmas trees, and year after \nyear, many American families enjoy the warmth and beauty of these North \nCarolina trees that are a symbol of the holiday season. I am proud of \nthe hard work exhibited by our Christmas tree growers in North \nCarolina, and I am proud that there will be another North Carolina \nChristmas tree in the White House this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/16/senate-section/article/S12946-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n GUIDEONE INSURANCE HONORED WITH ``PRINCIPAL 10 BEST COMPANIES'' AWARD\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, each year the Principal Financial \nGroup shines a spotlight on companies across the United States that \nexcel in providing for their employees' financial future, including a \nwell-funded retirement. Selected by a blue-ribbon panel, these \nexemplary companies are honored with the Principal 10 Best Companies \nAward.\n  This year, 1 of the 10 recipients of this prestigious award is \nGuideOne Insurance of West Des Moines, IA. GuideOne, which was founded \nin 1947, is one of the Nation's largest insurers of churches. It also \ninsures faith-based private schools and colleges as well as not-for-\nprofit senior living communities.\n  At a time when so many companies across the United States are cutting \nback--or completely eliminating--their employer-provided retirement \nbenefits, GuideOne is charting a different course. The firm's \nexecutives believe that providing for their employees' financial future \nis critical to success in recruiting, retaining, and motivating an \nexcellent staff.\n  The 807 employees at GuideOne enjoy a generous benefit package, \nincluding a defined benefit pension plan; 100 percent employer-paid \npremiums for disability insurance; a 401(k) plan with 100 percent \nemployer match up to 3 percent of pay; and health insurance that is 76 \npercent employer-paid for employees, and 68 percent employer-paid for \ndependents. Nearly 85 percent of employees participate in the company's \n401(k) plan, which is remarkably high by national standards.\n  To its great credit, the company is also concerned about the health \nof its employees. GuideOne has a robust wellness program that, among \nother things, reimburses employees $200 for fitness-related expenses.\n  Mr. President, it is clear to me that GuideOne understands what too \nmany companies in the United States have forgotten. GuideOne \nunderstands that its employees truly are its greatest asset and \ncompetitive strength, and that a generous benefit package is the way to \nattract and retain outstanding talent, while keeping morale and \nproductivity high.\n  So I congratulate GuideOne for the richly deserved honor of receiving \nthe Principal 10 Best Companies Award, and I salute all the folks at \nGuideOne for setting an example of enlightened corporate stewardship. \nThey are proving that it is possible to do well and do good at the same \ntime. And I couldn't be more proud that this excellent company calls \nIowa home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/16/senate-section/article/S12946-3", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/16/senate-section/article/S12946-4", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/16/senate-section/article/S12946-5", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12946-S12947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DRAFT OF PROPOSED LEGISLATION ENTITLED ``UNITED STATES-BAHRAIN FREE \n              TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT''--PM 32\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit legislation and supporting documents to \nimplement the United States-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement (the \n``Agreement''). This Agreement enhances our bilateral relationship with \na strategic friend and ally in the Middle East region and will promote \neconomic growth and prosperity in both nations.\n  In negotiating this Agreement, my Administration was guided by the \nobjectives set out in the Trade Act of 2002. The Agreement reflects my \nAdministration's commitment to opening markets and expanding \nopportunities for American workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses. \nThe Agreement will open Bahrain's market for U.S. manufactured goods, \nagricultural products, and services. As soon as it enters into force, \nthe Agreement will eliminate tariffs on all manufactured goods that the \nUnited States sells to Bahrain and immediately remove Bahrain's import \nduties on over 80 percent of U.S. agricultural products. The Agreement \nis also one of the most comprehensive ever negotiated to reduce \nbarriers to trade in services and will create new opportunities for \nU.S. services firms.\n  The Agreement contains procedures that will facilitate cooperation \nbetween the United States and Bahrain on environmental and labor \nmatters. The labor chapter of the Agreement reinforces Bahrain's recent \nlegislative actions to expand democracy and improve the protection of \nworker rights,\n\n[[Page S12947]]\n\nincluding trade union rights. Provisions in the Agreement requiring \neffective enforcement of environmental laws will contribute to high \nlevels of environmental protection.\n  The approval of this Agreement will be another significant step \ntowards creating a Middle East Free Trade Area by 2013. This Agreement \noffers the United States yet another opportunity to encourage economic \nreform in a moderate Muslim nation as we have done through our free \ntrade agreements with Jordan and Morocco. Leaders in Bahrain are \nsupporting the pursuit of social and economic reforms in the region, \nencouraging foreign investment connected to broad-based development, \nand providing better protection for women and workers. It is strongly \nin our national interest to embrace and encourage these reforms, and \npassing this legislation is a crucial step toward that end.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to amend the provisions of titles 5 and 28, United \nStates Code, relating to equal access to justice, award of reasonable \ncosts and fees, and administrative settlement offers, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I plan to introduce the Equal \nAccess to Justice Reform Act of 2005.\n  This legislation contains adjustments to the Equal Access to Justice\n\n[[Page S12951]]\n\nAct (EAJA) that will streamline and improve the process of awarding \nattorneys' fees to private parties who prevail in litigation against \nthe Federal Government. This is the fifth Congress in which I have \nintroduced EAJA reform. I believe this reform is an important step \ntoward reducing the burden of defending government litigation for many \nindividuals and small businesses.\n  I am very pleased to be joined in introducing this legislation this \nyear by my friend from Maine, Senator Olympia Snowe, who chairs the \nSmall Business Committee. We hope that by working together on a \nbipartisan basis, we will increase the chances that this important \nproject will become law.\n  The legislation we are proposing today deals directly with a problem \nthat affects small businesses and individual Americans across this \ncountry who face legal battles with the Federal Government. Even if \nthey win in court, they may lose financially because they incur the \ngreat expense of paying their attorneys.\n  It is important to understand what the Equal Access to Justice Act \nis, and why it exists. The premise of this statute is very simple. EAJA \nseeks to level the playing field for individuals and small businesses \nthat face the United States government in litigation. It establishes \nguidelines for the award of attorneys' fees when the individual or \nsmall business prevails in a case brought by the government. Quite \nsimply, EAJA acknowledges that the resources available to the Federal \nGovernment in a legal dispute far outweigh those available to most \nAmericans. This disparity is lessened by requiring the government, in \ncertain instances, to pay the attorneys' fees of successful individual \nand small-business parties. By giving successful parties the right to \nseek attorneys' fees from the United States, EAJA seeks to prevent \nindividuals and small business owners from having to risk their family \nsavings or their companies' financial well-being to seek justice in \ncourt.\n  My interest in this issue predates my election to the Senate. It \narises from my experience as both a private attorney and a Member of \nthe State Senate in my home State of Wisconsin. While in private \npractice, I became aware of how the ability to recoup attorneys' fees \nis a significant factor, and often one of the first considered, when \nparties decide whether to defend a case. Upon entering the Wisconsin \nState Senate, I authored legislation modeled on the Federal law, which \nhad been championed by one of my predecessors in this body from \nWisconsin, Senator Gaylord Nelson. Today, Wisconsin statutes contain \nprovisions similar to the federal EAJA statute.\n  It seemed to me then, as it does now, that we should do all that we \ncan to help ease the financial burdens on people who need to have their \nclaims reviewed and decided by impartial decision makers. The bill \nSenator Snowe and I are introducing today does a number of things to \nmake EAJA more effective for individuals and small business owners \nacross this country.\n  First, this legislation eliminates the restrictive provision in \ncurrent law that prevents successful parties from collecting attorneys' \nfees unless they can show the government's position was ``not \nsubstantially justified.'' I believe that this high threshold for \nobtaining attorneys' fees is unfair. If an individual or small business \nbattles the Federal Government in an adversarial proceeding and \nprevails, the government should pay the fees incurred. Imagine a small \nbusiness that spends time and money fighting the government and wins, \nonly to find out that it must undertake the additional step of \nlitigating the justification of government's litigation position just \nto recover attorneys' fees. For the government, with its vast \nresources, this second litigation over fees poses little difficulty, \nbut for the small business or individual, it may simply not be \nfinancially feasible.\n  This additional step presents more than a financial burden on the \nindividual or small business litigant. A 1992 study also reveals that \nit is unnecessary and a waste of government resources. University of \nVirginia Professor Harold Krent reviewed EAJA cases in 1989 and 1990 \nand released a study on behalf of the Administrative Conference of the \nUnited States. Professor Krent found that only a small percentage of \nEAJA awards were denied because of the substantial justification \ndefense. While it is impossible to determine the exact cost of \nlitigating the issue of substantial justification, Professor Krent \nfound that the money saved by the government was not enough to justify \nthe cost of the additional litigation. In short, eliminating this \noften-burdensome second step is a cost-effective step that will \nstreamline recovery under EAJA and may very well save the government \nmoney in the long run.\n  A second improvement this bill makes to EAJA are modifications to the \ndefinition of a small business. Small businesses are currently defined \nfor purposes of EAJA as businesses with a net worth of less than $7 \nmillion. We update that number to $10 million and also provide for an \ninflation adjustment every five years based on the Producer Price \nIndex. This provision will ensure that EAJA continues to serve the \nsmall businesses it is intended to protect.\n  Another part of this legislation that will streamline and improve \nEAJA is a provision designed to encourage settlement and avoid costly \nand protracted litigation. Under the bill, the government can make an \noffer of settlement after an application for fees and other expenses \nhas been filed. If the government's offer is rejected and the \nprevailing party seeking recovery ultimately wins a smaller award, that \nparty is not entitled to the attorneys' fees and costs incurred after \nthe date of the government's offer. Again, this will encourage \nsettlement and speed the claims process. It will reduce the time and \nexpense of the litigation.\n  This bill also requires the government agency that brought the case \nagainst the small business or individual to pay attorneys' fees from \ntheir own budgets. This provision ensures federal agencies will \nconsider the financial impact of the actions they choose to bring \nagainst individuals and small businesses. OSHA, NLRB, EEOC, and the \nMine Safety and Health Administration are exempt from this provision \nbecause they play a unique role in acting on behalf of workers to \nenforce the laws.\n  Finally, this bill will modify the definition of prevailing party to \nensure that if claims filed against the government are the catalyst for \na change in the position by the government that results in the \nindividual or small business achieving a significant part of the relief \nsought, the individual or small business will be considered the \nprevailing party even if the case settles rather than going to a \njudgment. This reverses, in cases where fees are available under EAJA, \nthe 2001 decision of the Supreme Court in Buckhannon Board and Care \nHome, Inc. v. West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources.\n  We all know that the American small business owner faces many \nchallenges. Government regulation can be a formidable obstacle to \nconducting business, and litigation can be costly. The Equal Access to \nJustice Act was conceived and implemented as a check on the formidable \npower of the federal government. It has already helped many individual \nAmericans and small businesses. The legislation we are offering today \nwill make EAJA more effective and more fair. I want to thank Senator \nSnowe for agreeing to work with me on this important bill. I hope our \ncolleagues can support it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2017\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Equal Access to Justice \n     Reform Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Equal Access to Justice Act (Public Law 96-481; 94 \n     Stat. 2325 et seq.) (in this section referred to as ``EAJA'') \n     was intended to make the justice system more accessible to \n     individuals of modest means, small businesses, and nonprofit \n     organizations (in this section collectively referred to as \n     ``small parties'') through limited recovery of their \n     attorneys' fees when they prevail in disputes with the \n     Federal Government; and\n       (2) although EAJA has succeeded, at modest cost, in \n     improving access to the justice system for small parties, \n     EAJA retains formidable barriers to attorneys' fees recovery\n\n[[Page S12952]]\n\n     (even for small parties that completely prevail against the \n     Government), as well as inefficient and costly mechanisms for \n     determining the fees recovery.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is, therefore, the purpose of this Act to \n     remove existing barriers and inefficiencies in EAJA in order \n     to--\n       (1) equalize the level of accountability to Federal law \n     among governments in the United States;\n       (2) discourage marginal Federal enforcement actions \n     directed at small parties;\n       (3) reduce the practice of paying EAJA liabilities from the \n     General Treasury, to ensure that Federal agencies properly \n     consider the financial consequences of their actions and \n     subsequent impact on the Federal budget;\n       (4) refine and improve Federal policies through \n     adjudication;\n       (5) promote a fair and cost-effective process for prompt \n     settlement and payment of attorneys' fees claims; and\n       (6) provide a fairer opportunity for full participation by \n     small businesses in the free enterprise system, further \n     increasing the economic vitality of the Nation.\n       (c) Compliance Policy.--In complying with the statement of \n     congressional policy expressed in this section, each Federal \n     agency, to the maximum extent practicable, should--\n       (1) avoid unjustified enforcement actions directed at small \n     parties covered by EAJA;\n       (2) encourage settlement of justified enforcement actions \n     directed at small parties covered by EAJA; and\n       (3) minimize impediments to prompt resolution and payment \n     of reasonable attorneys' fees to prevailing small parties \n     covered by EAJA.\n\n     SEC. 3. REPORTING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BY OFFICE OF \n                   ADVOCACY.\n\n       (a) Functions of Office of Advocacy.--Section 202 of Public \n     Law 94-305 (15 U.S.C. 634b) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (3), by inserting before the semicolon at \n     the end the following: ``and for ensuring that the justice \n     system remains accessible to small businesses for the \n     resolution of disputes with the Federal Government''; and\n       (2) by striking paragraph (11) and inserting the following:\n       ``(11) advise, cooperate with, and consult with the \n     President and Attorney General with respect to section 303(b) \n     of the Small Business Economic Policy Act of 1980 (15 U.S.C. \n     631b(b)) and section 504(e) of title 5, United States Code; \n     and''.\n       (b) Duties of Office of Advocacy.--Section 203 of Public \n     Law 94-305 (15 U.S.C. 634c) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (2), by inserting before the semicolon at \n     the end the following: ``, including the resolution of \n     disputes with the Federal Government and the role of \n     procedures established by the Equal Access to Justice Act \n     (Public Law 96-481; 94 Stat. 2325) in such disputes''; and\n       (2) in paragraph (3), by inserting after ``the Small \n     Business Act'' the following: ``, including those related to \n     the Equal Access to Justice Act,''.\n       (c) Reports to Congress.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Attorney General, in cooperation \n     with the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business \n     Administration, shall transmit to the congressional \n     committees specified in paragraph (2) a report containing--\n       (A) an analysis of the effectiveness of the Equal Access to \n     Justice Act (Public Law 96-481;

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The provisions of this Act and the amendments made by this \n     Act shall take effect 30 days after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as Chair of the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, I have fought to ensure that small \nbusinesses across the country are treated fairly by the Federal \nGovernment. Unfortunately, in far too many cases, Federal agencies take \narbitrary or abusive enforcement actions against small businesses. Few \nrepercussions deter the Federal Government from taking these \nunwarranted and unjust actions, which can irreparably injure the \nreputation and financial viability of a small business.\n  Enacted in 1980 on a bipartisan basis, the Equal Access to Justice \nAct (EAJA) intended to allow small businesses to collect legal fees \nafter prevailing in litigation against the Federal Government. However, \na number of barriers and inefficiencies exist within EAJA that prevent \nits effectiveness.\n  For example, EAJA currently requires a small business that has \nprevailed in litigation against the Federal Government to enter into a \ncostly second proceeding with the government. At the second proceeding, \nthe government can assert a ``substantial justification'' defense to \nprevent the small business from recovering its legal costs, even though \nthe small business prevailed on the merits of the underlying case in \ncourt. Even in instances when the Federal Government based its actions \nentirely on erroneous facts or without any legal basis, if the Federal \nGovernment can show that it was ``substantially justified'' in taking \nits actions, then a small business will be barred from EAJA recovery.\n  In practice, courts typically give a very wide berth to the \ngovernment's substantially justified defense--a reality that means that \nprevailing small businesses can rarely, if ever, recover their legal \nfees under EAJA. And while\n\n[[Page S12954]]\n\na second proceeding may be in the best interest of the Federal agency--\nespecially because its case is being funded by the General Treasury--\nthe second proceeding may ultimately be more costly and more time \nconsuming to the small business than the original, underlying case.\n  I believe that this is a flawed system. Small businesses are a \ndriving force of the United States economy, representing 99.7 percent \nof all employer firms and generating approximately 75 percent of net \nnew jobs annually. It is in our Nation's best interest to protect and \nwatch over small businesses, as their success and vitality are key to \nAmerica's economy and job growth.\n  It's plain and simple: We should not idly stand by while the Federal \nGovernment mistreats our Nation's small businesses.\n  That is why today I introduce with my colleague Senator Feingold the \nEqual Access to Justice Reform Act of 2005 (EAJRA). This bill would \nensure that small businesses are adequately protected from unreasonable \nregulations and actions, as well as update EAJA to better serve today's \nsmall businesses.\n  Under our legislation, small parties would be more likely to recover \ntheir legal fees when they prevail in litigation against the Federal \nGovernment. First, the EAJRA would eliminate the ``substantial \njustification'' defense, which would increase the likelihood that small \nbusinesses will be able to recover their legal costs after their \nwinning their case.\n  Second, our legislation would modernize the EAJA by updating \neligibility qualifications for small businesses. It would raise the \nthreshold for qualifying small businesses from $7 million to $10 \nmillion net worth, and index that threshold for inflation. Given modern \neconomic realities, a net worth of $7 million is no longer sufficient.\n  Third, the EAJRA would remove the hourly rate cap on attorney's fees. \nThe current hourly rate cap of $125 was set during EAJA's enactment in \n1980, and has yet to be adjusted for inflation. However, the market \nrate for competent legal services, especially for complex and high-risk \nlitigation against the Federal Government, is far greater than the cap \nof $125 per hour. This limit prevents small businesses from receiving \nfair and just reimbursement of attorney's fees, placing them at a \nnotable disadvantage.\n  Finally, the EAJRA would require agencies that lose lawsuits, other \nthan the National Labor Relations Board, the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Administration, the Mine Safety and Health Administration, and \nthe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, to pay legal fees awarded \nunder EAJA out of their own budgets and not the General Treasury. This \nwould eliminate inefficient uses of Federal agency resources and would \ndiscourage marginal or abusive Federal enforcement actions directed at \nsmall parties. In addition, the Federal budget would no longer be \nunnecessarily burdened.\n  The EAJRA creates a fair and even playing field. It would equalize \nthe level of accountability to Federal law among governments in the \nUnited States. It is a ``good government'' statute that would promote \njustice and equality of treatment between small and large entities, and \nwould greatly increase transparency in the Federal Government.\n  This legislation is absolutely necessary. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Equal Access to Justice Reform Act so that we can ensure \nthat our nation's small businesses are protected from unfair and \nunreasonable governmental actions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 2019. A bill to provide for a research program for remediation of \nclosed methamphetamine production laboratories, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce with Senator \nSmith a bill that would provide for the establishment of voluntary, \n``health-based'' remediation guidelines for former methamphetamine \nlaboratories, an issue of great importance to Montana, Oregon, and all \nof rural America.\n  The material and chemical byproducts of methamphetamine production \npose novel risks to the environment and public health. These risks are \ncompounded by the sheer number of meth labs and the vulnerability of \npolice, social service workers, and children exposed to meth \nproduction. The DEA estimated that there were as many as 16,000 meth \nlabs in operation in 2004. Additionally, thousands of meth labs have \nbeen busted over the years but never properly remediated. Producing one \npound of meth leaves behind six pounds of hazardous waste. In addition \nto bulk waste, cooking meth infuses toxic chemicals into the walls, \ncarpeting, and ventilation systems of the homes, apartments, motel \nrooms, and parks where meth is produced.\n  Unremediated methamphetamine labs pose significant public health \nrisks. The Department of Health and Human Services has reported that \nlaw enforcement officials and social service workers exposed to meth \nlabs, or even just individuals removed from meth labs, have complained \nof severe headaches, eye and respiratory irritations, nausea, and \nburns. The need for remediation guidelines is clear.\n  Currently, eight States, including Montana, have ``feasibility-\nbased'' remediation standards. ``Feasibility-based'' standards consider \ncost as a key factor in determining what level of remediation is \ndesirable. While such standards are a start, we need greater certainty \nthat our public servants and children are adequately protected.\n  Our bill provides a remedy. It directs the Assistant Administrator \nfor Research and Development of the EPA to establish voluntary \nremediation guidelines, based on the best available scientific \nknowledge. To further this effort, our bill provides for a program of \nresearch to identify methamphetamine laboratory-related chemicals of \nconcern, assess the types and levels of exposure to chemicals of \nconcern--including routine and accidental exposures--that may present a \nsignificant risk of adverse biological effects, and evaluate the \nperformance of various methamphetamine laboratory cleanup and \nremediation techniques. Our bill does not regulate States. The \nremediation guidelines are purely voluntary, meant to put States, \nremediation consultants, homeowners, and realtors on the same page.\n  Methamphetamine production poisons not only users but also spouses, \nchildren, public servants, and any future owners of properties exposed \nto meth production. To protect the public we need consistent, \nscientifically-based remediation guidelines.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAMBLISS:\n  S. 2021. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to establish \nin the Department of Veterans Affairs an Office of National Veterans \nSports Programs and Special Events; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce my bill, the \n``Disabled Veterans Sports and Special Events Promotion Act of 2005''.\n  We discovered during World War II that sports and physical activity \nplay a vital role in the rehabilitation of recently disabled military \npersonnel. Young service members who had just returned from WWII and \nwere undergoing rehabilitation were drawn to sports and other team \nactivities. The appeal of sports for these veterans served as more than \njust a rehabilitation technique. In fact, sports served as a source of \nmotivation as well as a path to a fuller life for young people in the \naftermath of a disability. As would be expected, many of these veterans \nbecame exceptional athletes and sought opportunities for competition \nand excellence in the new world of competitive Paralympic sports.\n  With the onset of hostilities in Afghanistan and Iraq, a new \ngeneration of U.S. military personnel with disabilities has emerged. \nThese newly-disabled men and women are young, ambitious, goal-oriented \nand in their physical prime. Sport, which played a fundamental role for \nreturning veterans of World War II, Korea, and Vietnam, has the \ncapacity to assist military personnel in adjusting to life with a \ndisability. The United States Olympic Committee (USOC) and its \nParalympic partners recognize the opportunity to play a key role in the \nlives of returning military personnel with newly acquired disabilities.\n  The USOC Paralympic Military Program is a collaborative effort among \nthe USOC, military installations and\n\n[[Page S12955]]\n\ncommands, Veterans' Affairs (VA) offices and programs, and Paralympic \norganizations nationwide that are conducting Paralympic sport programs \nfor active duty military personnel and veterans who have physical \ndisabilities.\n  The Program has been established to enable severely injured service \nmembers and veterans to enhance their rehabilitation, readiness and \nlifestyle through participation in Paralympic sports. The Program is \ndesigned for recently injured service members, 2001 and after, \nParalympic-eligible disabilities; however, other service members and \nveterans with physical disabilities who are able to engage in program \nactivities are welcome. Paralympic-eligible disabilities are: \namputations, visual impairments, Brain injuries affecting physical \nmobility, spinal cord injuries and, other mobility-impairing \ndisabilities.\n  This bill would establish within the Department of Veterans Affairs \nan Office of National Veterans Sports Programs and Special Events which \nwould establish and carry out sports programs for disabled veterans. In \naddition, the office would arrange for the VA to sponsor sports \nprograms for disabled veterans conducted by other groups if the \nSecretary detennines that the programs are consistent with the VA's \ngoals and missions. The office would provide for, facilitate, and \nencourage disabled veterans to participate in these programs. Finally, \nthe office will cooperate with the USOC and their Paralympic Military \nProgram to promote participation of disabled veterans in the \nParalympics.\n  This bill allows those injured in service to our country the option \nto regain a healthy, active lifestyle through sport and competition. \nCompeting in sports such as cycling, fencing, shooting, sled hockey, \ntable tennis, and sitting volleyball gives these injured veterans the \nopportunity to rehabilitate their bodies and minds while competing at \nthe highest level. It is my hope that as we proceed with this bill, we \nkeep the people at the receiving end of our decisions and deliberations \nforemost in our minds.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COLEMAN (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 2022. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage of remote patient management services for chronic \nhealth care conditions under the Medicare program; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, constituents across the country in rural \nareas face serious health care issues, not only in terms of illness but \nalso in lack of easily accessible services. One out of every five \nAmericans lives in rural areas however only one out of every ten \nphysicians practice in rural areas. Forty percent of our rural \npopulation lives in a medically underserved area. With access to care \nan average of thirty miles away, rural areas have much to gain from the \nability to access healthcare information at a distance. We depend on \nour farmers and ranchers--they are the lifeblood of America and take \ncare of the essentials in our lives such as feeding us and clothing us. \nWe should make sure to take care of them as well.\n  Today, I am proud to be joined by my friend, Senator Bingaman in \nintroducing the Remote Monitoring Access Act of 2005 to overcome the \nbarriers to more rapid diffusion of innovative new technologies that \nwill improve quality and access to care for Medicare beneficiaries, by \nimplementing changes in Medicare fee-for-service reimbursements. Our \nlegislation would create a new benefit category for remote patient \nmanagement services in the Medicare physician fee schedule. Under this \ncategory, Medicare would cover physician services involved with the \nremote management of specific medical conditions.\n  New technology that collects, analyzes, and transmits clinical health \ninformation is in development or has recently been introduced to the \nmarket. The promise of this remote management technology is clear: \nbetter information on the patient's condition--collected and stored \nelectronically, analyzed for clinical value, and transmitted to the \nphysician or the patient--should improve patient care and access.\n  Remote monitoring technology is also emerging to extend the provision \nof health care services to areas where there is a shortage of \nphysicians. This technology allows physicians to monitor and treat \npatients without a face-to-face office visit, thereby increasing access \nto physicians for patients living in rural areas.\n  In its March 2001 report, ``Crossing the Quality Chasm,'' the \nInstitute of Medicine stated that the automation of clinical and other \nhealth transactions was an essential factor for improving quality, \npreventing errors, enhancing consumer confidence in the health care \nsystem, and improving efficiency, yet ``health care delivery has been \nrelatively untouched by the revolution in information technology that \nhas been transforming nearly every other aspect of society.''\n  Three major areas in which remote management technologies are \nemerging in health care are the treatment of congestive heart failure \n(CHF), diabetes and cardiac arrhythmia.\n  Despite these innovations and their ability to improve care, many new \nclinical information and remote management technologies have failed to \ndiffuse rapidly. A significant barrier to wider adoption and evolution \nof the technologies is the relative lack of payment mechanisms in fee-\nfor-service Medicare to reimburse for remote, non-face-to-face \nmanagement and disease management services provided by a physician.\n  Under existing Medicare fee schedules, physicians generally receive a \nfixed, predetermined amount for a given service. The cost of devices \nused or supplied in the service is usually bundled into the payment, \nand payments are primarily provided for face-to-face interactions \nbetween the physician and patient. The payment structure creates at \nleast two problems for the wider adoption of patient management \napproaches using remote management technology.\n  To overcome the barriers to more rapid diffusion of innovative new \ntechnology for Medicare beneficiaries, changes in Medicare fee-for-\nservice reimbursements are necessary. This legislation would create a \nnew benefit category for remote patient management services in the \nMedicare physician fee schedule. Under this category, Medicare would \ncover physician services involved with the remote management of \nspecific medical conditions.\n  The quality of care provided through remote management would allow \nphysicians to qualify for bonus payments conditioned on specific \nquality measures. This legislation directs the Secretary, through the \nAgency for Health Care Research and Quality (AHRQ) to develop standards \nof care and quality standards for the remote management services \nprovided for each medical condition covered. AHRQ would develop these \nstandards working in conjunction with appropriate physician groups. The \nSecretary is also given the authority to develop guidelines on the \nfrequency of billing for remote patient management services.\n  I urge my fellow colleagues to join me in ensuring rural Americans \nhave the access to remote monitoring and the opportunity to keep pace \nwith health technology by supporting the Remote Monitoring Access Act \nof 2005.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2022\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to raise the minimum State allocation under section \n217(b)(2) of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act; to \nthe Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that will \nincrease the minimum funding level for low population States for the \nU.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's HOME Investment \nPartnerships Program.\n  This program was created when the Cranston-Gonzalez National \nAffordable Housing bill was signed into law in 1990. Funds were first \nappropriated for this program in 1992. HOME program funds are disbursed \nto State and local governments for the purpose of assisting with the \nexpansion of housing for low-income families. These governmental \nentities have a great deal of flexibility when using these funds to \nimplement the program's purpose.\n  When this program was created, a minimum funding level of $3 million \nwas created for States that would normally receive a small amount of \nHOME funds under the allocation formula, which is based on a State's \npopulation, among other parameters. Five States--Alaska, Delaware, \nNevada, Hawaii, and North Dakota--received this level of funding for \nthis program in fiscal year 2005. Bearing in mind inflation between \n1992--when this program was first funded--and 2005, a $3 million \nallocation in 1992 dollars decreased in value to $2,215,235 in 2005.\n  This is unacceptable. My State is one of the most expensive areas in \nthe country to develop housing, especially when one takes into account \nthe cost to transport building materials to extremely remote areas of \nmy State.\n  This legislation increases the minimum State funding level for the \nHOME program to $5 million. Based on fiscal year 2005 allocations for \nthis program, eight States received less than $5 million. Those States \nare: Alaska, Delaware, Nevada, Hawaii, Montana, North Dakota, Utah, and \nWyoming. My proposed increase in funding would be offset by an overall \ndecrease in allocations to other States. If a $5 million minimum \nfunding level had been in place in fiscal year 2005, the other 42 \nStates would only have experienced an overall decrease of less than $13 \nmillion. Bearing in mind that the amount appropriated in fiscal year \n2005 for this program is $1.865 billion, such a decrease in funds seems \nreasonable considering no changes have been made to the minimum State \nfunding level since the HOME program was first funded in 1992.\n  In addition, the congressionally appointed, bipartisan Millennium \nHousing Commission recommended increasing the minimum State funding \nlevel for the HOME program to $5 million in their May 30, 2002, report \nto Congress.\n  It is imperative that we address this important issue so that we can \naddress the housing needs of a greater amount of low-income families in \nlow-population States.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2024\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small State HOME Program \n     Equity Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES.\n\n       Section 217(b)(2)(A) of the Cranston-Gonzalez National \n     Affordable Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 12747(b)(2)(A)) is amended \n     by striking ``$3,000,000'' each place it occurs and inserting \n     ``$5,000,000''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAYH (for himself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n        Coleman, Mr. Graham, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Nelson of \n        Florida, Mr. Lugar, and Mr. Obama):\n  S. 2025. A bill to promote the national security and stability of the \nUnited States economy by reducing the dependence of the United States \non oil through the use of alternative fuels and new technology, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, our dependence on foreign oil is \nsapping America's power and independence as a nation. It is urgent we \nbegin now to diversify the fuels we use to power our vehicles or risk \nceding our national power to the rulers of faraway deserts, distant \ntundras, steaming rain forests or off-shore, drilling platforms half a \nworld away.\n  I rise today as part of a bipartisan group of 10 Senators who \nrepresent the American Northeast, South, Midwest and West to introduce \nthe Vehicle and Fuel Choices for America Security Act.\n\n[[Page S12957]]\n\n  We chose this title because nothing less than our national security \nis at stake.\n  Besides myself, the rest of the ``Gang of Ten,'' or the ``Energy \nSecurity Ten,'' as some call us are Senators Sam Brownback of Kansas, \nEvan Bayh of Indiana, Norm Coleman of Minnesota, Lindsey Graham of \nSouth Carolina, Ken Salazar of Colorado, Jeff Sessions of Alabama, Bill \nNelson of Florida, Richard Lugar of Indiana and Barack Obama of \nIllinois. And we expect even more of our colleagues from both sides of \nthe aisle will be joining us soon.\n  I hope that in the future we all look back on the day this bill was \nintroduced as the beginning of a major shift in our national security \nstrategy. I hope that history will say we saw a challenge to our \nnational security and prosperity and then met it and mastered it.\n  A recent report by the International Energy Agency, IEA, sums up the \nurgent need for our legislation.\n  According to the IEA, global demand for oil--now about 85 million \nbarrels a day--will increase by more than 50 percent to 130 million \nbarrels a day between now and 2030 if nothing is done.\n  The industrialized world's dependence on oil heightens global \ninstability. The authors of the IEA report note that the way things are \ngoing ``we are ending up with 95 percent of the world relying for its \neconomic well-being on decisions made by five or six countries in the \nMiddle East.''\n  Besides the Mideast, I would add that Nigeria is roiled by \ninstability, Venezuela's current leadership is hostile to us and \nRussia's resurgent state power has ominous overtones.\n  In fact, we are just one well-orchestrated terrorist attack or \npolitical upheaval away from a $100-a-barrel overnight price spike that \nwould that would send the global economy tumbling and the \nindustrialized world, including China and India, scrambling to secure \nsupplies from the remaining and limited number of oil supply sites.\n  History tells us that wars have started over such competition.\n  Left unchecked, I fear that we are literally watching the slow but \nsteady erosion of America's power and independence as a nation--our \neconomic and military power and our political independence.\n  We are burning it up in our automobile engines and spewing it from \nour tailpipes because of our absolute dependence on oil to fuel our \ncars and trucks.\n  That dependence on oil--and that means foreign oil because our own \nreserves are less than 1 percent of the world's oil reserves--puts us \nin jeopardy in three key ways--a convergence forming a perfect storm \nthat is extremely dangerous to America's national security and economy.\n  First, the structure of the global oil market deeply affects--and \ndistorts--our foreign policy. Our broader interests and aspirations \nmust compete with our own need for oil and the growing thirst for it in \nthe rest of the world--especially by China and India.\n  As a study in the journal Foreign Affairs makes clear, China is \nmoving aggressively to compete for the world's limited supplies of oil \nnot just with its growing economic power, but with its growing military \nand diplomatic power as well.\n  Second, today we must depend for our oil on a global gallery of \nnations that are politically unstable, unreliable, or just plain \nhostile to us.\n  All that and much more should make us worry because if we don't \nchange--it is within their borders and under their earth and waters \nthat our economic and national security lies.\n  Doing nothing about our oil dependency will make us a pitiful giant--\nlike Gulliver in Lilliput--tied down by smaller nations and subject to \ntheir whims. And we will have given them the ropes and helped them tie \nthe knots.\n  We can take on this problem now and stand tall as the free and \nindependent giant we are by moving our nation--and the world--on to \nenergy independence, by setting America free from its dependence on \noil.\n  There is only one way to do this. We need to transform our total \ntransportation infrastructure from the refinery to the tailpipe and \neach step in between because transportation is the key to energy \nindependence.\n  Barely 2 percent of our electricity comes from oil.\n  Ninety six percent of the energy used to power our cars comes from \noil--literally millions of barrels of oil per day. This is \nunsustainable and dangerous.\n  The Vehicle and Fuel Choices for America Security Act aims to \nstrengthen America's security by transforming transportation from the \nrefinery to the tailpipe and each step in between, thus breaking our \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  We start by making it our national policy to cut consumption by 10 \nmillion barrels a day over the next 25 years.\n  First, we need to rethink and then remake our fuel supplies. Gasoline \nis not the only portable source of stored energy. Tons of agricultural \nwaste and millions of acres of idle grassland can be used to create \nbillions of barrels of new fuels.\n  Our farmers could soon be measuring production in barrels of energy \nas well as bushels of food.\n  Then we must remake our automobile engines as well. Vehicles that get \n500 miles per gallon--or that use no refined crude oil--are within our \ngrasp. I know that sounds unbelievable. I am going to tell you how we \ncan do it.\n  To help us get there, our bill also requires that by 2012, 10 percent \nof all vehicles sold in the U.S. be hybrid, hybrid-electric plug-in or \nalternative fuel vehicles. That number will rise by 10 percent a year \nuntil it reaches 50 percent in 2016.\n  To help spur this market along, our bill amends our current energy \npolicy to require that one quarter of federal vehicles purchased must \nbe hybrids or plug-in hybrids.\n  My bill will detail how we can get there with available technology \nand previously unavailable Federal Government leadership. Coupling \nthese new programs with the explicit oil-savings goals for the Federal \nGovernment is the key to the effectiveness of this proposal.\n  I can almost hear colleagues murmur, So, Senator Lieberman, what else \nis new? We've been hearing this for years and nothing has happened.\n  I can't blame you if you are skeptical. The struggle for oil \nindependence has been going on at least since Jimmy Carter was \nPresident.\n  But things have changed since the days of Jimmy Carter and even since \nlast summer. There is a new understanding of the depth of the crisis \nthat our oil dependence is creating.\n  This summer's doubling of gasoline and crude oil prices hit tens of \nmillions of Americans with the global reality of oil demand and \npricing. And Hurricane Katrina reminded us how vulnerable our supplies \ncan become.\n  This reality is bipartisan. And, along with my colleagues \ncosponsoring this bill, I think Americans are ready to set the serious \ngoals that eluded us in the past and take the bold steps necessary to \nreach those goals.\n  Now let me give you more details.\n  The bill I will propose puts our Nation's transportation system on a \nnew road--a road where the tanks are filled with more home-grown fuel--\nand I do mean grown--not just American corn, but from American sugar, \nprairie grass, and agricultural waste.\n  We will push harder for more and quicker production and \ncommercialization of biomass-based fuels.\n  The Energy bill signed into law last summer created a new set of \nincentives for these fuel alternatives, including their commercial \nproduction.\n  What my bill would do--again, by including a mass-production mandate \nfor alternative fuel vehicles--is ensure that the investments would be \nmade in the facilities to produce and market these new fuels by \nproviding big demand for them.\n  The bill would also create a program to guarantee that filling \nstations had the pumps to provide the fuel to keep pace with the \ngrowing alternative-fuel fleet produced by the mandate.\n  Is there a model to give us confidence we can achieve this \ntransformation? Yes.\n  Brazil is now enjoying substantial immunity from current high world \noil prices, thanks to a long-term strategy, launched during the oil \nshocks of the 1970s, to integrate sugar cane ethanol into its fuel \nsupply. They started initially with a mandate that all fuel sold in the \ncountry contain 25 percent alcohol. They are now up to 40 percent \nbiofuels.\n\n[[Page S12958]]\n\n  In addition to the fuel mandate, Brazil offered low-interest loans \nand tax breaks for the building of distilleries and subsidized a fuel \ndistribution network.\n  Brazil has the advantage of a substantial sugar cane industry already \nin place. But we have our own vast potential to develop our own biofuel \nsupply, using feedstock like corn, crop waste, switch grass, sugarcane \nand fast-growing trees and shrubs such as hybrid poplars and willows.\n  According to the Department of Energy, if two-thirds of the Nation's \nidled cropland were used to grow these kinds of energy crops, the \nresult could be dramatic. Those 35 million acres could produce between \n15 and 35 billion gallons of ethanol each year to fuel cars, trucks, \nand buses.\n  That is about 2.2 million barrels of fuel a day from right here in \nthe U.S.A.\n  What Brazil offers us, more importantly, is a case study of \ngovernment leadership to combine technology mandates and subsidies to \nwean its transportation sector from foreign oil to a domestic \nalternative.\n  From this January through this July--before this summer's fuel \nspike--we have sent almost $100 billion out of the country to purchase \noil, while the Brazilians are now relying on home-grown fuel.\n  The key to their success is that they responded 30 years ago to the \nfirst storm warnings. We did not, and now the storm is at our shores, \nslapping against the levees of our economic strength and national \nsecurity. We have to mobilize and lead a similar response as Brazil \ndid.\n  If we do this right, our farmers could soon be measuring production \nin barrels of energy as well as bushels of food. Our energy would be \nguaranteed ``Made in America'' and the profits would be guaranteed \n``Kept in America.''\n  For all these new fuels to be effective, we need the flexible fuel \nvehicles that can take advantage of them.\n  As I said earlier, our bill also requires that 50 percent of all \nvehicles sold in the U.S. be hybrid, hybrid-electric plug-in, or \nalternative fuel vehicles by 2016.\n  Sound ambitious? It is not. It has already happened in Brazil. \nSeveral automakers selling cars in Brazil, including our own General \nMotors and Ford, already manufacture a fleet that is more than 50-\npercent flexible fuel cars that can run on any combination of gasoline \nand biofuels.\n  The technology exists now and adds a negligible cost--about $150--to \nthe price of each vehicle. For this we get the flexibility to power a \ncar with fuel made from corn, prairie grass, or agricultural waste from \nour own heartland that will cost a lot less than gasoline does today.\n  Maximizing fuel efficiency and promoting energy independence even \nfurther would be a new generation of flexible-fuel hybrid cars known as \nplug-ins because you can plug them in at night to recharge the battery.\n  Hybrids that use a use both a gasoline engine and electric motor for \npower are already getting 50 miles per gallon. Making them flexible \nfuel cars, as I've already said, can save us more than 2 million \nbarrels of gasoline a day.\n  But we can do even better--dramatically better--with the plug-in \nhybrid that is just now on the threshold of commercialization. Like the \npresent hybrids, it would use both a gasoline and electric motor. But \nthe plug-in hybrid would be able to use the battery exclusively for the \nfirst 30 miles of a trip.\n  Think of that for a minute. Although Americans drive about 2.2 \ntrillion miles a year, according the Census, the vast majority of those \ntrips are less than 15 miles.\n  That means a plug-in hybrid would use zero--zero--gallons of gas or \nany combustible fuel for the vast majority of its trips. And experts \ntell me it could effectively get the 500 miles per gallon on longer \ntrips.\n  Plugging in your car during off peak hours--when power is in surplus \nand cheaper--would soon just become part of the modem daily routine, \nlike plugging in your cell phone or PDA before you go to bed.\n  And off-peak electricity can be the equivalent of 50 cent a gallon \ngasoline, I repeat--the equivalent of 50 cent a gallon fuel is \nfeasible.\n  Of course, electricity does not come magically through the wires to \nour homes. That power would come from coal, natural gas, nuclear, \nsolar, wind or other sources--sources that we have in abundance here at \nhome--and a little--very little--would come from oil.\n  This isn't pie in the sky. These vehicles could be in your garage \nwithin a couple of years. Some of the incentives for achieving this \nwere included in the Energy bill signed into law in August. But they \ndid not go nearly far enough.\n  We need to couple these incentives with real performance standards \nand sales requirements to ensure that as soon as possible new cars are \nrunning not just on gasoline but on biofuels and electricity.\n  As always, there is a do-nothing crowd that says the ever-rising \nprice of gasoline and crude oil are the cure--that with higher prices \npeople will reduce consumption and the market will respond with greater \ninvestments in the supply of oil to bring prices down.\n  But all that would do is perpetuate the problem. Market-driven oil-\ndependency is still dependency on foreign oil, driving us further down \nthe current path toward national insecurity and economic and \nenvironmental troubles.\n  Some say that we can ease the crisis through greater domestic \ndrilling--in places like the Arctic Refuge and other public lands or \noff our shores.\n  But that won't make a dent in the problem. In the world of oil, \ngeology is destiny and the U.S. today has only 1 percent of the world's \noil reserves. And that small new supply wouldn't matter much in the \nglobal market, since the price of oil produced within the United States \nrises and falls with the global market, regardless of where it is \nproduced.\n  We just don't have enough oil in the U.S. anymore. And no matter how \nmuch more we drill, we will still be paying the world price of oil--not \nan American price.\n  Our present energy and transportation systems were born at the end of \nthe 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries with the twin \ndiscoveries of oil extraction and the internal combustion engine. Those \nsystems have served us well bringing growth to our Nation and the \nworld.\n  But it is now the 21st century, and it is time to move on. The era of \nbig oil is over. It is time to revolutionize our entire energy \ninfrastructure, from the refinery to the tailpipe, and begin a new era \nof energy independence.\n  It is time to set America free by cutting our dependence on foreign \noil and by doing so strengthen our security, preserve our independence \nand energize our economy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. \n        Dayton):\n  S. 2026. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nrequire that a prescription drug plan or an MA-PD plan that has an \ninitial coverage limit obtain a signed certification prior to enrolling \nbeneficiaries under the plan under part D of such title; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Medicare \nPrescription Drug Gap Disclosure Act with my colleagues, Senators \nKerry, Dorgan and Dayton. This important legislation will require \nMedicare beneficiaries enrolling in a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan, \nPDP, or Medicare Advantage Drug Plan, MA-PD, with a potential coverage \ngap to sign a short, easy to read, statement indicating that they are \naware of the potential loss of coverage.\n  Yesterday, 42 million Medicare beneficiaries became eligible to sign \nup for the new Medicare prescription drug benefit, scheduled to start \non January 1, 2006. However, too many seniors are understandably \nconfused about this complicated change to Medicare, and I fear that \nmany may sign up for drug plans without understanding the major \npitfalls of the program. The biggest pitfall in the drug plan is the \nnotorious ``coverage gap'' also known as the ``donut hole.''\n  In the coverage gap, beneficiaries pay 100 percent of prescription \ncosts after they exceed a certain level of out-of-pocket spending and \nbefore protection kicks in against catastrophic drug expenses. They \nalso continue to pay 100 percent of their monthly premiums.\n  We need to make sure that seniors are aware of the threat that the \ncoverage gap poses, and it should not be\n\n[[Page S12959]]\n\nhidden in a mountain of paperwork. My legislation would require plan \nproviders to have beneficiaries sign the following certification before \nenrollment:\n\n       I understand that the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan or \n     MA-PD Plan that I am signing up for may result in a gap in \n     coverage during a given year. I understand that if subject to \n     this gap in coverage, I will be responsible for paying 100 \n     percent of the costs of my prescription drugs and will \n     continue to be responsible for paying the plan's monthly \n     premium while subject to this gap in coverage. For specific \n     information on the potential coverage gap under this plan, I \n     understand that I should contact [prescription drug plan] at \n     [toll free phone number].\n\n  The bottom line is that, after months of trying to explain this new \ndrug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries, many do not understand the \nramifications of the coverage gap. Unfortunately, millions of Medicare \nbeneficiaries may learn about the coverage gap the hard way--when the \npharmacist at the cash register tells them sometime next year that they \nare suddenly required to pay the full cost of their prescriptions.\n  Mr. President, a study by the Commonwealth Fund found that 38 percent \nof Medicare enrollees are likely to experience this costly interruption \nin care. Moreover, the benefits must be renewed each year, meaning that \nthe coverage gap repeats itself if beneficiaries reach the coverage gap \nagain.\n  A recent survey by the Kaiser Foundation and the Harvard School of \nPublic Health, found that only 35 percent of people 65 and older said \nthey understood the new drug benefit. In addition, the numerous media \nstories in recent days contain anecdotal evidence that illustrates the \nconfusion around the new drug benefit.\n  I therefore urge my colleagues to support this bill. Only with such a \nclear, separate disclaimer will seniors have a fair opportunity to be \nwarned of the risks posed by this gap in drug coverage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2026\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Prescription Drug \n     Gap Disclosure Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REQUIREMENT OF SIGNED CERTIFICATION PRIOR TO PLAN \n                   ENROLLMENT UNDER PART D.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1860D-1(b)(1) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-101) is amended by adding at \n     the end the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(D) Special rule for plans with an initial coverage \n     limit.--\n       ``(i) In general.--The process for enrollment established \n     under subparagraph (A) shall include, in the case of a \n     prescription drug plan or an MA-PD plan that has an initial \n     coverage limit (as described in section 1860D-2(b)(3)), a \n     requirement that, prior to enrolling a part D eligible \n     individual in the plan, the plan must obtain a certification \n     signed by the enrollee or the legal guardian of the enrollee \n     that meets the requirements described in clause (ii) and \n     includes the following text: `I understand that the Medicare \n     Prescription Drug Plan or MA-PD Plan that I am signing up for \n     may result in a gap in coverage during a given year.

Res. 317\n\n       Whereas the origins of the Internet can be found in United \n     States Government funding of research to develop packet-\n     switching technology and communications networks, starting \n     with the ``ARPANET'' network established by the Department of \n     Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency in the 1960s and \n     carried forward by the National Science Foundation's \n     ``NSFNET'';\n       Whereas in subsequent years the Internet evolved from a \n     United States Government research initiative to a global tool \n     for information exchange as in the 1990s it was \n     commercialized by private sector investment, technical \n     management and coordination;\n       Whereas since its inception the authoritative root zone \n     server--the file server system that contains the master list \n     of all top level domain names made available for routers \n     serving the Internet--has been physically located in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas today the Internet is a global communications \n     network of inestimable value;\n       Whereas the continued success and dynamism of the Internet \n     is dependent upon continued private sector leadership and the \n     ability for all users to participate in its continued \n     evolution;\n       Whereas in allowing people all around the world freely to \n     exchange information, communicate with one another, and \n     facilitate economic growth and democracy, the Internet has \n     enormous potential to enrich and transform human society;\n       Whereas existing structures have worked effectively to make \n     the Internet the highly robust medium that it is today;\n       Whereas the security and stability of the Internet's \n     underlying infrastructure, the domain name and addressing \n     system, must be maintained;\n       Whereas the United States has been committed to the \n     principles of freedom of expression and the free flow of \n     information, as expressed in Article 19 of the Universal \n     Declaration of Human Rights, and reaffirmed in the Geneva \n     Declaration of Principles adopted at the first phase of the \n     World Summit on the Information Society;\n       Whereas the U.S. Principles on the Internet's Domain Name \n     and Addressing System, issued on June 30, 2005, represent an \n     appropriate framework for the coordination of the system at \n     the present time;\n       Whereas the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and \n     Numbers popularly known as ICANN, is the proper organization \n     to coordinate the technical day-to-day operation of the \n     Internet's domain name and addressing system;\n       Whereas all stakeholders from around the world, including \n     governments, are encouraged to advise ICANN in its decision-\n     making;\n       Whereas ICANN makes significant efforts to ensure that the \n     views of governments and all Internet stakeholders are \n     ref1ected in its activities;\n       Whereas governments have legitimate concerns with respect \n     to the management of their country code top level domains;\n       Whereas the United States Government is committed to \n     working successfully with the international community to \n     address those concerns, bearing in mind the need for \n     stability and security of the Internet's domain name and \n     addressing system;\n       Whereas the topic of Internet governance, as currently \n     being discussed in the United Nations World Summit on the \n     Information Society is a broad and complex topic;\n       Whereas it is appropriate for governments and other \n     stakeholders to discuss Internet governance, given that the \n     Internet will likely be an increasingly important part of the \n     world economy and society in the 21st Century;\n       Whereas Internet governance discussions in the World Summit \n     should focus on the real threats to the Internet's growth and \n     stability, and not recommend changes to the current regime of \n     domain name and addressing system management and coordination \n     on political grounds unrelated to any technical need;

and\n       (2) therefore the authoritative root zone server should \n     remain physically located in the United States and the \n     Secretary of Commerce should maintain oversight of ICANN so \n     that ICANN can continue to manage the day-to-day operation of \n     the Internet's domain name and addressing system well, remain \n     responsive to all Internet stakeholders\n\n[[Page S12960]]\n\n     worldwide, and otherwise fulfill its core technical mission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/16/senate-section/article/S12960-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2581.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``End Child Poverty Act''.\n\n     SEC. __2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) More than 13,000,000 children in the United States who \n     are younger than 18 live below the poverty line.\n       (2) Most parents of poor children are playing by the rules \n     by working to support their families. Despite their efforts, \n     many of these parents still cannot help their children get \n     ahead. Seven out of 10 poor children live in a working family \n     and 1 poor child in 3 lives with a full-time year-around \n     worker.\n       (3) Poor children are at least twice as likely as non-poor \n     children to suffer stunted growth or lead poisoning, or to be \n     kept back in school. Poor children score significantly lower \n     on reading, mathematics, and vocabulary tests when compared \n     with otherwise similar non-poor children. In more than half \n     of poor households with children in the United States, the \n     members of the households experience serious deprivations \n     during the year, including lack of adequate food, utility \n     shutoffs, crowded or substandard housing, or lack of needed \n     medical care.\n       (4) Over 8,000,000 children under age 18 in the United \n     States lack health insurance. With a 2004 uninsured rate of \n     18.9 percent, poor children are more likely to be uninsured \n     than children generally.\n       (5)(A) The members of 1 in 6 households with children in \n     the United States are hungry or on the verge of hunger, \n     largely due to inadequate household income.\n       (B) Hungry children--\n       (i) tend to lack nutrients vital to healthy brain \n     development;\n       (ii) tend to have difficulty focusing their attention and \n     concentrating in school; and\n       (iii) often have greater emotional and behavioral problems, \n     have weaker immune systems, and are more susceptible to \n     infections, including anemia, than other children.\n       (6) Child poverty has risen significantly, by 1,440,000 \n     since 2000.\n       (7) The poverty rate for children in the United States is \n     substantially higher than that in most other wealthy \n     industrialized nations.\n       (8) Children in the United States are more likely to live \n     in poverty than any other age group in the United States.\n       (9) African-American and Latino children are much more \n     likely to live in poverty than White children. One third of \n     African-American children are low-income, as are nearly a \n     third of Latino children.\n       (10) Great Britain made a public commitment to cut child \n     poverty in half in 10 years, and end child poverty by 2020, \n     and it has already successfully lifted 2,000,000 children out \n     of poverty.\n       (11) Poverty is a moral issue and Congress has a moral \n     obligation to address it.\n\n     SEC. ___3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to set a national goal of cutting child poverty in half \n     within a decade, and eliminating child poverty entirely as \n     soon as possible; and\n       (2) to establish a Child Poverty Elimination Trust Fund as \n     an initial measure to fund Federal programs to achieve that \n     goal.\n\n     SEC. ___4.

Any detail shall not interrupt or otherwise affect \n     the civil service status or privileges of the Federal \n     employee.\n       (5) Voluntary service.--Notwithstanding section 1342 of \n     title 31, United States Code, the chairperson of the Board \n     may accept for the Board voluntary services provided by a \n     member of the Board.\n       (e) Compensation.--\n       (1) Pay.--Members of the Board shall serve without \n     compensation.\n       (2) Travel expenses.--Members of the Board shall be allowed \n     reasonable travel expenses, including a per diem allowance, \n     in accordance with section 5703 of title 5, United States \n     Code, when performing duties of the Board.\n\n     SEC. ___5.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING HEALTH CARE FOR \n                   CHILDREN BEFORE TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) There are more than 9,000,000 children in the United \n     States with no health insurance coverage.\n       (2) Sixty-seven percent of uninsured children live in \n     families with at least one full-time worker.\n       (3) According to the Center for Studying Health System \n     Change, uninsured children, when compared to privately \n     insured children, are--\n       (A) 3.5 times more likely to have gone without needed \n     medical, dental, or other health care;\n       (B) 4 times more likely to have delayed seeking medical \n     care;\n       (C) 5 times more likely to go without needed prescription \n     drugs; and\n       (D) 6.5 times less likely to have a usual source of care.\n       (4) More than half of these children are eligible for \n     coverage under either the State Children's Health Insurance \n     Program (SCHIP) or Medicaid, but are not enrolled in those \n     safety net programs.\n       (5) Most States, struggling with budget deficits, have \n     curtailed outreach efforts.\n       (6) A focus on simple and convenient enrollment and renewal \n     systems, as well as proactive outreach and educational \n     efforts, could help reach these children and reduce the \n     number of uninsured American children.\n       (7) Some States, seeing that the Federal Government is not \n     providing assistance to middle class families who can't \n     afford health insurance, are trying to extend coverage to \n     some or all children.\n       (8) State efforts to cover all children will not be \n     successful without financial assistance from the Federal \n     Government.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Senate should not vote to extend the capital gains \n     and dividend tax cuts, a majority of the benefits of which go \n     to households with incomes over $1,000,000, until Congress \n     has taken steps to ensure that all children in America have \n     access to affordable, quality health insurance;\n       (2) the Senate should vote instead to use the funds \n     generated by the expiration of the capital gains and dividend \n     tax cuts to further the goal of ensuring that children have \n     access to health insurance coverage by--\n       (A) awarding grants to States, faith-based organizations, \n     safety net providers, schools, and other community and non-\n     profit organizations to facilitate the enrollment of the \n     6,800,000 children who are currently eligible for enrollment \n     in the State Children's Health Insurance Program but who are \n     not enrolled;\n       (B) paying to each State with an approved State Children's \n     Health Insurance Program or Medicaid plan, an amount equal to \n     90 percent of the sums expended for the design, development, \n     implementation, and evaluation of enrollment systems \n     determined likely to provide more efficient and effective \n     administration of the plan's enrollment and retention of \n     eligible children; and\n       (C) establishing a grant program under which a State may \n     apply under section 1115 of the Social Security Act to \n     provide medical assistance under the State Children's Health \n     Insurance Program to all children in their State.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2597.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration be discharged from further \nconsideration and the Senate now proceed to S. Con. Res. 62.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the concurrent resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 62) directing the \n     Joint Committee on the Library to procure a statue of Rosa \n     Parks for placement in the Capitol.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senator from Connecticut and I wish \nto address a matter that just passed the Senate a few hours ago.\n  Mr. President, it is the honor and duty of this Senate to recognize \nthe greatness of extraordinary Americans. I am very proud that we have \ndone so today for Rosa Parks. With the passage of S. Con. Res. 62, the \nSenate has directed the Joint Committee on the Library to commission a \nstatue of Ms. Parks and place it here in the Nation's Capitol, so that \nAmericans who visit this place 100 years from now can see it, and \nreflect on how one woman's courage altered a nation.\n  Rosa Parks did not set out to become a hero on the evening of \nDecember 1, 1955. She was, like millions of other Americans, merely on \nher way home after a long day's work. She was a seamstress in \nMontgomery, AL. But her simple, profound act of civil disobedience was \nthe spark that ignited the modern civil rights movement.\n  I say to my friend from Connecticut that I was a teenager at the \ntime, living in Augusta, GA. The first 8 years of my life I lived in \nAlabama. In those days, I think the stereotypical reaction to white \nsoutherners was that they all must surely have been against what began \nthat evening with Rosa Parks's appropriate act of defiance. My parents \nare both deceased, but I remember how inspired they were as white \nsoutherners by the act of Rosa Parks. As I make my remarks tonight and \nlisten subsequently to the remarks of my good friend from Connecticut, \nI remember my parents, who were white southerners born into southern \nculture who realized that this was not right, and who admired greatly \nnot only Rosa Parks's act of defiance, but the later civil-rights bills \nthat were to come.\n  For far too many African Americans at that time, America did not live \nup\n\n[[Page S13040]]\n\nto its promise of liberty and justice for all. But thanks to Rosa \nParks, America was forced to look itself in the mirror, admit its \nfailing, and recommit itself to its founding ideals.\n\n  Rosa Parks was headed home that winter night on the Montgomery City \nbus system, which was segregated. Front-row seats were reserved for \nwhite passengers. Blacks were restricted to the back of the bus, and \nsometimes the middle. But if a white passenger demanded a black person \ngive up his or her seat, they were required to do so.\n  But on that first day in December 50 years ago, the white bus driver \ndemanded that four African Americans give up their seats so a single \nwhite man could sit. Three of them complied. Rosa Parks did not.\n  ``If you don't stand up, I'm going to call the police and have you \narrested,'' said the bus driver. But Rosa Parks had had enough. She \nreplied to the driver, ``You may do that.''\n  With this simple refusal, Rosa Parks set into motion a crusade that \nwould eventually awaken the conscience of our country.\n  Perhaps the time was right for a nation like America to erase the \nstain of segregation. But it was not preordained that the struggle \nwould start on that day, in that town, lit by one woman's courage and \nconviction. We will always thank Rosa Parks that it did.\n  Rosa Parks' life proved that one American with courage can unshackle \nmillions. Her passing on October 24, just a few weeks ago, left us with \nsadness, but also with deep gratitude for the gift she left all of us. \nBy honoring her in the Capitol, we show our gratitude.\n  I wish to thank my many colleagues who cosponsored this bill on both \nsides of the aisle, and particularly my good friend from Connecticut, \nSenator Dodd, with whom I have collaborated on a number of issues over \nthe years.\n  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once wrote that ``human progress never \nrolls in on wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless \nefforts of men.''\n  This bill helps ensure that Rosa Parks' efforts will never be \nforgotten.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me begin by commending my colleague from \nKentucky. I am pleased to be the lead sponsor with him on this \nresolution and he rightly points out that there are a number of \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle who have been very supportive of \nthis effort. In fact, I think we might leave this open this evening so \nthat others who wish to be cosponsors may do so before this evening is \ncomplete.\n  I want to particularly thank, in this Chamber this evening, Senator \nKerry of Massachusetts who was very interested in this issue and \nannounced his strong support early on of recognizing Rosa Parks. I also \nwant to thank Representative Jesse Jackson of the House and others on \nthe House side who are also interested in this issue. The House \nsponsors have taken a different approach to authorizing a statue of \nRosa Parks, but that bill has not yet been brought before the House for \ndebate. The action we take today is one way that we can guarantee that \nCongress can authorize, and immediately have funds to pay for, the \ncommissioning of this statue. I strongly support the efforts of my \ncolleague, Senator McConnell, to expedite this legislation.\n  I was honored to attend the funeral services here in Washington, DC \nfor Mrs. Parks. The words spoken that day by numerous people were far \nmore eloquent than anything I could add at this particular juncture. \nBut I was struck by the fact that this woman, who refused to give up \nher seat, who caused a nation to stand up and take note, was physically \na rather diminutive, quiet individual who had a long interest in civil \nrights. Her nonviolent act of defiance was not just a coincidental act. \nShe had been involved in the civil rights movements and had worked with \nthe NAACP and other organizations for sometime.\n  But as the Senator from Kentucky points out, on that particular day, \nshe was just not going to tolerate any longer a behavior that was so \nrepugnant to the founding principles of this democracy--that was a \ndenial of everything we stood for as a nation. With full recognition of \nthe consequences, her course of action precipitated a year-long boycott \nin Birmingham of the public bus system. And that was a great sacrifice \nfor the people of the city at that time. To sustain that effort for \nover a year is really quite a remarkable and significant effort.\n  It all began on that day some 50 years ago when this wonderful \nAmerican lady, on her own, decided to take an action that would awaken \nthe interest and collective conscience of a country to recognize, and \nacknowledge, the great scar of segregation that still existed in some \nparts of our Nation. And we realize that we have perhaps not yet \nreached that perfect union that our Founders intended and that each \ngeneration of Americans must be newly challenged to achieve it. Rosa \nParks was that challenge for her generation and by her solitary, \nnonviolent act, she changed the course of human history.\n  This is a long journey. It has been a painful one for many but \nbecause of people like Rosa Parks, we are getting closer to our \nFounders' goal of a perfect union. And that is why it is not only \nimportant to preserve and honor her legacy for future generations, but \nto hold her up as an example of what can be achieved when we challenge \nourselves to do better. She is an example to those oppressed in nations \naround the world that one person, in standing up for what is just and \nright, can make a difference.\n  Nelson Mandela once called her ``the David who challenged Goliath.'' \nPeople of nations across this globe owe a debt of gratitude to this \nremarkable woman for her courage that day, for her determination, and \nfor the inspiration she has provided. Now, when visitors come to the \nCapitol, they, too, can be inspired by this heroic American whose \ncourageous act sparked the flame of liberty and equality for African \nAmericans and minority groups in this country and around the world.\n  Oprah Winfrey spoke at the funeral services about what it meant to \nher as a young black woman to hear about Rosa Parks and what she had \ndone. By honoring Rosa Parks with a statue, placed in the most public \nplaces of honor in the Capitol, we will have a living symbol of that \nhope that Rosa Parks brought to millions of young black children 50 \nyears ago. And so generations of children can pass by her statue and be \ninspired by her story and courage and identify with her greatness.\n  We honored Rosa Parks by allowing her remains to lie in honor in the \nCapitol Rotunda. I was priveleged to have been a part of that most \nappropriate effort. It was an unprecedented event and the first time \nthat a woman had been so recognized. There have been others who have \nbeen so honored because of their service as President, or as a general \nor distinguished military officer, or some connection to the Congress, \nbut only once before had we honored a private citizen. To recognize \nthis extraordinary lady was a noble act and a proud achievement of the \nleadership of this Congress. Both Democrats and Republicans took time \nto honor this symbol of freedom by paying their last respects to her in \nthe most public of places, the Capitol Rotunda. And the American people \nwere invited in to share in her struggles and triumphs and pay their \nrespect to this great American, too.\n  The statue of Rosa Parks will be placed in a very hallowed location \nin the Capitol. The site has not yet been established, but it may be \nthat location will be in the National Statuary Hall. This resolution \nauthorizes, and indeed requires, that the Joint Committee on the \nLibrary consider that option. But it must be in a prominent place where \nthe public can be inspired by her, where Congress and staff can be \nreminded of her act of courage and her challenge to our leaders to do \nbetter. And each of us will be reminded of the opportunities in our \nlives to make a difference. Maybe not with the same dramatic results as \nRosa Parks achieved with her act, but every single citizen of this \ncountry will know that he or she has an opportunity to make a \ndifference, in a moment of challenge, to rise and to be courageous, to \nstand up for what is right.\n  It is a wonderful lesson for the younger generation to be reminded \nthat one person can make a difference. I often cite individuals who \nhave made a difference, such as the mother who lost a child as a result \nof a drunk driver and went on to found an organization in her basement \ncalled Mothers\n\n[[Page S13041]]\n\nAgainst Drunk Driving, or Lech Walesa, or now Rosa Parks.\n  Rosa Parks caused this Nation to take note of what it needed to do to \nend the scourge of segregation. She is not just a national hero, she is \nthe embodiment of our social and human conscience. It is an appropriate \nand fitting thing that we do here today. I am proud to be a part of it \nand I hope that generations to come for many, many years will walk past \nthe statue of Rosa Parks in our Nation's Capitol and make a quiet \ndetermination to find a moment when they may be as courageous and as \nnoble as this wonderful woman.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is important that today the Senate is \nhonoring a true national hero, Mrs. Rosa Parks. As you know, I \nintroduced legislation to honor Rosa Parks with a statue in National \nStatuary Hall. I thank the chair of the Rules Committee, Senator \nMcConnell, and the ranking member, Senator Dodd, for amending their \nlegislation to designate Statuary Hall as a venue for a tribute to this \ngreat American. I think it is important we ensure that the memory of \nRosa Parks is honored by placing a statue of her in the U.S. Capitol so \nfuture generations can understand her monumental efforts for civil \nrights and know the importance of living by her example still today.\n  I thank Senators McConnell and Dodd for working with me and amending \ntheir resolution to ensure that Statuary Hall is considered as a \npossible location for the statue of Mrs. Parks. I also thank the \nnumerous Senators who supported my legislation, S. 1959. I am \nsupporting Mr. McConnell's and Mr. Dodd's measure today because I \nbelieve it is paramount that we honor Rosa Parks in our Capitol, but I \nwant to be very clear that her statue should be in Statuary Hall.\n  On November 3, 2005, I introduced legislation to place a statue of \nRosa Parks in Statuary Hall in the Capitol. This is a location of great \nsignificance, particularly on this occasion and particularly with this \nindividual. While there are memorials for prominent African Americans \nin the Capitol Collection, none of those are located in the hall that \ngives a state-by-state account of our country's history. In the \nstruggle for civil rights, some were called to stand up to Bull \nConnor's fire hoses and police dogs--some to stand up to Klan \nterrorism--and some to stand up to state sponsored acts of violence. \nBut some were called simply to sit down--at lunch counters in \nGreensboro and Nashville and Atlanta--or on a bus in Montgomery. This \nsimple action of peaceful opposition to existing rules had a \nsignificant impact on the lives of all Americans. Her act of courage on \nDecember 1, 1955, inspired a movement that eventually brought about \nlaws to end segregation, ensure voting rights, end discrimination in \nhousing, and create a greater equality throughout this Nation.\n  It should be noted that I have been working closely with my \ncolleagues in the House of Representatives, particularly with \nRepresentative Jesse Jackson Jr. from Illinois, whose bill has over 175 \ncosponsors to honor Rosa Parks in Statuary Hall. It is identical in \ncontent to my original bill, S. 1959, to ensure that Mrs. Parks' statue \nis placed in Statuary Hall. When the House passes Representative \nJackson's bill, it is my intention to bring that legislation up for a \nvote in the Senate to ensure that her memory is enshrined in the most \nhallowed halls of our Government.\n  This week, Representative Jackson and I began a national week of \naction to pass our legislation honoring Rosa Parks with a statue in \nNational Statuary Hall. Our goal is to have Congress pass both bills by \nDecember 1, 2005--the 50th anniversary of Rosa Parks' courageous \ndecision not to move to the back of the bus.\n  Rosa Parks was one of our greatest American heroes, a woman whose \nquiet courage changed a country. She deserves the highest honors this \ncountry can give. I can think of no better way to honor the 50th \nanniversary of Rosa Parks' brave act against injustice than by passing \nlegislation that ensures that schoolchildren, Members of Congress and \npresidents visiting the Capitol can see how highly our Nation thinks of \nher, and that we need to follow her example of refusing to go quietly \nto the back of the bus.\n  Mr. ISAKSON.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2585) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n               (Purpose: To make a technical correction)\n\n       On page 1, line 7, at the end add the following: ``The \n     Joint Committee on the Library shall consider all locations \n     in the Capital, including Statuary Hall, the Rotunda, and the \n     Capitol Visitor Center.''\n\n  The concurrent resolution (S.

Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate Committee \non Veterans' Affairs, I am extremely pleased that the Senate will pass \nlegislation that will authorize a cost-of-living adjustment, COLA, for \nveterans' compensation for next year.\n  The Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2005 \ndirects the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to increase, as of December \n1, 2005, the rates of veterans' disability compensation, additional \ncompensation for dependents, the clothing allowance for certain \ndisabled adult children, and dependency and indemnity compensation for \nsurviving spouses and children.\n  This increase will be the same percentage as the increase provided to \nSocial Security recipients. The increase this year is one of the \nlargest in recent memory--4.1 percent. In my opinion, this increase \ncould not have come at a more crucial time. The COLA is enormously \nimportant to veterans and their families. It is critical that veterans' \ndisability compensation rates keep pace with the increasing cost-of-\nliving. Without it, these people would be unable to afford the simple \nnecessities of life. I note, it is well documented that home heating \nfuel costs will skyrocket this winter. The COLA increase goes a long \nway to ensuring no veterans are left out in the cold.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I thank all Senators that voted to support \nthis Nation's veterans.\n  The bill (S. 1234), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/16/senate-section/article/S13042-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 317, submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 317) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate regarding oversight of the Internet Corporation for \n     Assigned Names and Numbers.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today at the World Summit on the \nInformation Society, an agreement was announced to maintain the current \nstructure for managing the Internet. This agreement marks a critical \nstep toward ensuring the stability and security of the Internet and \npreserving its benefits not only for the United States, but for \ncountries across the globe.\n  In late October I joined with the other cochairs of the Internet \nCaucus in a letter to the White House urging the administration to \nstand firm in its position to protect the Internet and resist efforts \nto undo the structure that has worked so well so far. I also joined \nSenator Burns in offering a resolution to maintain the currently \neffective status quo on Internet governance. The agreement that now has \nbeen reached in Tunis to maintain the current structure for managing \ndomain names and the Internet is consistent with our efforts.\n  The value of the Internet is incalculable. The Internet has brought \nan unprecedented level of commercial exchanges in both the consumer and \nbusiness-to-business realms. It has spawned and prompted the \ndevelopment of new ideas, businesses and relationships. It has \nempowered people who have never had access to power and otherwise would \nlikely never have an opportunity to be heard, much less challenge or \ninfluence public policy and institutional power. It has introduced and \ncemented friendships across the globe, and it has distributed \ninformation and fostered greater understanding and awareness of others' \nideas and others' cultures. Becoming part of a global Internet \nenvironment has also shown us we are part of the wider world in which \nall of us live. It is values like these that no doubt our world \npartners are seeking to preserve in their proposals, yet would \nunwittingly undermine.\n  The United States developed and nourished the Internet. The open \neconomy and constitutional liberties that are the foundations of our \nNation allowed us the privilege and extraordinary responsibility to \nserve as the great incubator that has unleashed these spectacular \ndevelopments and benefits.\n  No doubt we can do even better. Some have benefited substantially \nmore than others. We have further strides to make before eradicating \nthe digital divide and narrowing the gaps between the haves and have-\nnots. We also need to be vigilant in maintaining the essential freedom \nand influences that have kept the Internet flourishing. We should work \nclosely with other countries to address challenges and concerns as they \narise. By proceeding prudently and knowledgeably, taking care not to \njeopardize the innovations and openness that have allowed the Internet \nto thrive, we can foster progress and continue to enjoy the benefits \nthe Internet continues to bring to the world.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter from the Internet \nCaucus cochairs to the White House and today's Associated Press article \n``Deal Reached on Managing the Internet'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 24, 2005.\n     Hon. George W. Bush,\n     The President of the United States, The White House, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Bush: As co-chairs of the Congressional \n     Internet Caucus, we are writing to applaud your position that \n     governance of the Internet should not be transferred to an \n     international government organization and to urge you to \n     communicate this position to the international community \n     during the upcoming World Summit on the Information Society \n     (WSIS) in Tunisia.\n       As you know, the Internet's domain name system (DNS) is \n     administered by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names \n     and Numbers (ICANN), a private, nonprofit organization based \n     in the United States that works closely with the U.S. \n     Department of Commerce. We believe that this privately-\n     operated approach fosters market principles and is the most \n     efficient way to administer the DNS. The greater the \n     government involvement in running the Internet's day-to-day \n     operations, the more likely that red tape and overly \n     burdensome regulations will result.\n\n[[Page S13064]]\n\n       However, the U.N., with the support of countries including \n     China, Iran, and Cuba, released a report earlier this year \n     which included proposals to take control of administration of \n     the Internet from the U.S.-based ICANN and give it to a \n     bureaucratic U.N. body. Recently, the EU has signaled that it \n     would also support having an international body oversee the \n     Internet. We believe that it is unacceptable for the U.N. to \n     administer the Internet, and are extremely concerned that the \n     EU would move toward this position.\n       The United States is uniquely positioned to protect the \n     fundamental principles of free press and free speech upon \n     which the Internet has thrived. The U.S. Constitution \n     guarantees that basic rights, and to cede control of the \n     Internet to countries with at best questionable records \n     regarding these rights could jeopardize the continued success \n     of the Internet and lead to significant restrictions on \n     access to the Internet's wealth of information.\n       With the WSIS convening next month in Tunisia, we urge you \n     to continue to take a strong stand for the principles that \n     have guided the administration of the Internet to date and \n     fostered the phenomenal growth of the Internet: ftee market \n     principles, the freedoms of speech and the press, and limited \n     bureaucratic involvement.\n       Thank you again for your work to ensure the freedom and \n     effective administration of the Internet. We look forward to \n     continuing to work with you on this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bob Goodlatte,\n       Member of Congress.\n     Conrad Burns,\n       United States Senator.\n     Rich Boucher,\n        Member of Congress.\n     Patrick Leahy,\n       United States Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 Deal Reached on Managing the Internet\n\n                            (By Matt Moore)\n\n       A summit focusing on narrowing the digital divide between \n     the rich and poor residents and countries opened Wednesday \n     with an agreement of sorts on who will maintain ultimate \n     oversight of the Internet and the flow of information, \n     commerce and dissent.\n       The World Summit on the Information Society had been \n     overshadowed by a lingering, if not vocal, struggle about \n     overseeing the domain names and technical issues that make \n     the Internet work and keep people from Pakistan to Canada \n     surfing Web sites in the search for information, news and \n     buying and selling.\n       Negotiators from more than 100 countries agreed late \n     Tuesday to leave the United States in charge of the \n     Internet's addressing system, averting a U.S.-EU showdown at \n     this week's U.N. technology summit.\n       U.S. officials said early Wednesday that instead of \n     transferring management of the system to an international \n     body such as the United Nations, an international forum would \n     be created to address concerns. The forum, however, would \n     have no binding authority.\n       U.S. Assistant Secretary of Commerce Michael Gallagher said \n     the deal means the United States will leave day-to-day \n     management to the private sector, through a quasi-independent \n     organization called the Internet Corporation for Assigned \n     Names and Numbers, or ICANN.\n       ``The Internet lives to innovate for another day,'' he told \n     The Associated Press.\n       Negotiators have met since Sunday to reach a deal ahead of \n     the U.N. World Summit on the Information Society, which \n     starts Wednesday. World leaders are expected to ratify a \n     declaration incorporating the deal during the summit, which \n     ends Friday.\n       While the summit drew thousands of people from around the \n     world, most western countries opted not to send their top-\n     ranking leaders, preferring instead to send government \n     workers and low-level figures.\n       However, other leaders were scheduled to attend, including \n     Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, Senegal's Abdulaye Wade \n     and Libyan leader Moamer Kadhafi. Venezuelan President Hugo \n     Chavez was due to fly to the summit Wednesday, organizers \n     said.\n       The summit was originally conceived to address the digital \n     divide--the gap between information haves and have-nots--by \n     raising both consciousness and funds for projects.\n       Instead, it has centered largely around Internet \n     governance: oversight of the main computers that control \n     traffic on the Internet by acting as its master directories \n     so Web browsers and e-mail programs can find other computers.\n       The accord reached late Tuesday also called for the \n     establishment of a new international group to give more \n     countries a stronger say in how the Internet works, including \n     the issue of making domain names--currently done in the Latin \n     languages--into other languages, such as Chinese, Urdu and \n     Arabic.\n       Under the terms of the compromise, the new group, the \n     Internet Governance Forum, would start operating next year \n     with its first meeting opened by Annan. Beyond bringing its \n     stakeholders to the table to discuss the issues affecting the \n     Internet, and its use, it won't have ultimate authority.\n       Viviane Reding, the EU Commissioner for Information Society \n     and Media, said the agreement paved the way for a progressive \n     forward motion in overseeing Internet governance.\n       ``This agreement was possible because of the strong belief \n     of all democratic nations that enhanced international \n     cooperation is the best way to make progress towards \n     guaranteeing the freedom of the Internet around the globe and \n     also to enhance transparency and accountability in decisions \n     affecting the architecture of the Web,'' she said.\n       ``The fact that the EU spoke with one voice in Tunis, and \n     had stood by its case for more cooperation on Internet \n     governance in the run-up to the summit, certainly strongly \n     influenced this positive agreement,'' she said.\n       U.S. Assistant Secretary of Commerce Michael D. Gallagher \n     said the compromise's ultimate decision is that leadership of \n     the Internet, and its future direction, will remain in the \n     hands of the private sector, although some critics contend \n     that the U.S. government, which oversees ICANN, if only \n     nominally, could still flex its muscle in future decisions.\n       ``The rural digital divide is isolating almost 1 billion of \n     the poorest people who are unable to participate in the \n     global information society,'' the agency said in a statement.\n       Ahead of the summit, rights watchdogs say, both Tunisian \n     and foreign reporters have been harassed and beaten. \n     Reporters Without Borders says its secretary-general, Robert \n     Menard, has been banned from attending.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 317) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 317\n\n       Whereas the origins of the Internet can be found in United \n     States Government funding of research to develop packet-\n     switching technology and communications networks, starting \n     with the ``ARPANET'' network established by the Department of \n     Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency in the 1960s and \n     carried forward by the National Science Foundation's \n     ``NSFNET'';\n       Whereas in subsequent years the Internet evolved from a \n     United States Government research initiative to a global tool \n     for information exchange as in the 1990s it was \n     commercialized by private sector investment, technical \n     management and coordination;\n       Whereas since its inception the authoritative root zone \n     server--the file server system that contains the master list \n     of all top level domain names made available for routers \n     serving the Internet--has been physically located in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas today the Internet is a global communications \n     network of inestimable value;\n       Whereas the continued success and dynamism of the Internet \n     is dependent upon continued private sector leadership and the \n     ability for all users to participate in its continued \n     evolution;\n       Whereas in allowing people all around the world freely to \n     exchange information, communicate with one another, and \n     facilitate economic growth and democracy, the Internet has \n     enormous potential to enrich and transform human society;\n       Whereas existing structures have worked effectively to make \n     the Internet the highly robust medium that it is today;\n       Whereas the security and stability of the Internet's \n     underlying infrastructure, the domain name and addressing \n     system, must be maintained;\n       Whereas the United States has been committed to the \n     principles of freedom of expression and the free flow of \n     information, as expressed in Article 19 of the Universal \n     Declaration of Human Rights, and reaffirmed the Geneva \n     Declaration of Principles adopted at the first phase of the \n     World Summit on the Information Society;\n       Whereas the U.S. Principles on the Internet's Domain Name \n     and Addressing System, issued on June 30, 2005, represent an \n     appropriate framework for the coordination of the system at \n     the present time;\n       Whereas the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and \n     Numbers popularly known as ICANN, is the proper organization \n     to coordinate the technical day-to-day operation of the \n     Internet's domain name and addressing system;\n       Whereas all stakeholders from around the world, including \n     governments, are encouraged to advise ICANN in its decision-\n     making;\n       Whereas ICANN makes significant efforts to ensure that the \n     views of governments and all Internet stakeholders are \n     reflected in its activities;\n       Whereas governments have legitimate concerns with respect \n     to the management of their country code top level domains;\n       Whereas the United States Government is committed to \n     working successfully with the international community to \n     address those concerns, bearing in mind the need for \n     stability and security of the Internet's domain name and \n     addressing system;\n       Whereas the topic of Internet governance, as currently \n     being discussed in the United Nations World Summit on the \n     Information Society is a broad and complex topic;\n       Whereas it is appropriate for governments and other \n     stakeholders to discuss Internet\n\n[[Page S13065]]\n\n     governance, given that the Internet will likely be an \n     increasingly important part of the world economy and society \n     in the 21st Century;\n       Whereas Internet governance discussions in the World Summit \n     should focus on the real threats to the Internet's growth and \n     stability, and not recommend changes to the current regime of \n     domain name and addressing system management and coordination \n     on political grounds unrelated to any technical need; and\n       Whereas market-based policies and private sector leadership \n     have allowed this medium the flexibility to innovate and \n     evolve: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That it is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) it is incumbent upon the United States and other \n     responsible governments to send dear signals to the \n     marketplace that the current structure of oversight and \n     management of the Internet's domain name and addressing \n     service works, and will continue to deliver tangible benefits \n     to Internet users worldwide in the future; and\n       (2) therefore the authoritative root zone server should \n     remain physically located in the United States and the \n     Secretary of Commerce should maintain oversight of ICANN so \n     that ICANN can continue to manage the day-to-day operation of \n     the Internet's domain name and addressing system well, remain \n     responsive to all Internet stakeholders worldwide, and \n     otherwise fulfill its core technical mission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/16/senate-section/article/S13065-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 2008\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.
