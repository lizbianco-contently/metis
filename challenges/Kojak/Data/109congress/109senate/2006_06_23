Mr. President, I am going to talk briefly about an issue \nI think is really very important dealing with the country of India and \nnuclear weapons that are possessed by India and other countries around \nthe world.\n  Yesterday, one of my colleagues in the Senate indicated that weapons \nof mass destruction had been found in Iraq. I guess he was referring to \nsome inert artillery shells that were produced in the 1980s for the \nIran-Iraq war. No one believes those are weapons of mass destruction. \nThat is an absurd claim. I think it has been described as absurd by \nnearly everybody. But since the subject of weapons of mass destruction \nhas been raised I want to make a few comments.\n  I have in my desk in the Senate a piece of metal. I ask unanimous \nconsent to show it on the floor of the Senate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This is from a Backfire bomber. It used to be part of a \nwing strut on a Soviet Backfire bomber. This bomber, presumably, \ncarried nuclear weapons to threaten the United States at some point. \nThe bomber doesn't exist anymore. The bomber's wings were sawed off and \nit was cut into small metal pieces. We paid for that under the Nunn-\nLugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program in which we spend American \ntaxpayers' money to dismantle former Soviet nuclear weapons and their \ndelivery systems--missiles, bombers, submarines.\n  I also have in my desk some chewed-up copper from the electrical \nwiring from a submarine that once carried nuclear weapons aimed at the \nUnited States. We paid money to dismantle weapons of mass destruction \nin the arsenal of the Soviet Union. So we didn't shoot this airplane \ndown. This piece of metal from a Soviet bomber was achieved because we \npaid for the saw that cut the wings off of the bomber. What a \nremarkably successful program to try to reduce the threat of nuclear \nweapons.\n  I think the threat of nuclear weapons is the greatest threat that we \nface. We have roughly 25,000 to 30,000 nuclear weapons on this Earth. \nThe loss of one nuclear weapon to a terrorist and the detonation of one \nby a terrorist in a major American city will cause a catastrophe unlike \nany of us can imagine. There are roughly 25,000 to 30,000 nuclear \nweapons in this world. Where are they? Are they safeguarded? Will \nsomeone steal one? Who is building more? Who wants nuclear weapons? \nWhat are we doing about that? These are critically important questions.\n  A former Secretary of Defense says that he believes the question is \nnot so much whether but when will a nuclear weapon be detonated in an \nAmerican city? A former Secretary of Defense says he believes there is \na 50-percent likelihood that within the next 10 years a nuclear weapon \nwill be detonated in a major American city. I don't know whether that \nis true or not. I do know this: this world is full of nuclear weapons. \nMore countries want to achieve the capability of possessing nuclear \nweapons. It is our responsibility--it falls to us as a world leader to \nstop the spread of nuclear weapons and begin to reduce the number of \nnuclear weapons. That is our job.\n  I am not very encouraged, frankly, by actions in the Congress in \nrecent years, turning down the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, \nsuggesting that we want to reserve the right to test nuclear weapons \nagain. The discussion in the administration and even some in Congress \nis that what we really need are new nuclear weapons, designer nuclear \nweapons, earth-penetrating bunker buster nuclear weapons. There is a \nsuggestion by some that nuclear weapons are perfectly usable. They are \nnot.\n  The only success we can measure will be the success by which we \nprevent another nuclear weapon from ever being exploded in anger on \nthis planet. That is the only success that can matter.\n  I want to talk a little about the nuclear agreement the Bush \nAdministration has reached with India, which I think undermines our \nnonproliferation policy of many years. It also undermines the Non-\nProliferation Treaty that we have signed, and many other countries have \nsigned. India has not signed it. It stops the proliferation of nuclear \nweapons. At least it says it is our resolve to stop the spread of \nnuclear weapons.\n  I want to talk about this new agreement that Secretary Rice, on \nbehalf of the President and others, has negotiated with India, and what \nit means for the job we have of stopping the spread of nuclear weapons. \nOne of our major periodicals in this country described a story that was \nnot reported much post-9/11. In the period post-9/11, my understanding \nfrom press reports was that our intelligence picked up some kind of a \nreport from their sources that a nuclear weapon had been stolen by a \nterrorist organization from the Russian stockpile of nuclear weapons \nand was prepared to be detonated by terrorists, I believe they said \neither in New York City or Washington, DC--in any event, one of \nAmerica's major cities. Those who picked up this rumor in the \nintelligence community were very concerned about it, very worried about \nit.\n  After some period of time it was determined that this was not a \ncredible rumor, but in retrospect the analysts determined that it is \nperfectly plausible. It is not unthinkable that a terrorist \norganization could acquire a nuclear weapon, or steal one from an \nexisting stockpile. It is not implausible that having stolen a nuclear \nweapon they could have detonated it in a major American city. That \nought to cause an apoplectic seizure in this country about the need to \nsafeguard against nuclear weapons, reduce the number of nuclear weapons \nthat now exist, and stop the spread of nuclear weapons.\n  It is our responsibility to provide the leadership to do that. That \ndoesn't fall to anyone else; it falls to us.\n  Let me describe how the nuclear deal with India fits into this. Many \ncountries want to possess nuclear weapons. North Korea, we believe, is \nnow building them, and perhaps has them. I believe the administration \nsaid they believe that North Korea has actually produced nuclear \nweapons. We understand that the country of Iran is doing things that \nwould lead it to be able to produce a nuclear weapon at some point in \nthe future. We are concerned about that. Our country and others have \nbeen trying to prevent that from happening.\n  Our country invaded Iraq because we believed it had weapons of mass \ndestruction. I heard a radio show this morning, with the fellow running \nthe show saying that wasn't the case; that we invaded Iraq because \nSaddam Hussein was a bad guy. That is not true at all. Saddam Hussein \nis an evil man. We found him in a rat hole. He murdered people in his \nown country by the thousands, and he likely will, following trial, meet \njustice. I hope so. But we attacked Iraq because we believed, our \nintelligence community believed, and the American people were told, and \nthe world community was told by Secretary Powell that Iraq possessed \nweapons of mass destruction that threatened the world and threatened \nus.\n  The point is that the threat of weapons of mass destruction is \nserious and real. It is serious and real because there are 25,000 or \n30,000 nuclear weapons in the world. We have a lot of them. Russia has \na lot of them. Other countries possess them. One of those countries is \nIndia.\n  Nowhere is the threat of nuclear war or nuclear terrorism, or the \nneed to safeguard nuclear weapons more important than in South Asia, \nthe home to al-Qaida, who seeks nuclear weapons. It is an area where \nrelations among regional nuclear powers--China, India, Pakistan--have \nhistorically been tense. India and China fought a border war in 1962. \nIndia and Pakistan fought three major wars and had numerous smaller \nskirmishes. After both detonated nuclear weapons in 1998 and declared \nthemselves nuclear powers, the\n\n[[Page S6447]]\n\nworld held its breath as India and Pakistan fought a limited war in \nKashmir. So this is a serious issue, one that is of great concern.\n  It is almost incomprehensible to me that the administration has \nagreed to a nuclear deal with India, a country that did not sign the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, that will gut the nonproliferation \ntreaty and allow New Dehli to dramatically expand its stockpile of \nnuclear weapons and possibly ignite another regional arms race of \nnuclear weapons. Giving legitimacy to the nuclear arsenal that India \nsecretly developed is not going to help us convince other countries to \ngive up their secret nuclear programs.\n  The nonproliferation treaty is a treaty that, if you describe it, \nputs people to sleep. ``Nonproliferation'' as a term doesn't even sound \nvery exciting. But it is at the root of the determination of whether we \nwill one day see nuclear weapons exploded in American cities.\n\n  We have to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. The nonproliferation \ntreaty isn't perfect, but there are a host of countries in this world \nwho have decided to forgo trying to acquire or build nuclear weapons \nbecause of it. They have done that so that they can get access to \npeaceful nuclear assistance for nuclear power that is allowed by the \ntreaty because the treaty would not allow access to technology for \nnuclear power to build nuclear powerplants unless the country signed \nthe nonproliferation treaty and agree to forego nuclear weapons. That \ntreaty has worked--not perfectly--but it has worked well enough.\n  India, as I said, has never signed it. Instead, it secretly built \nnuclear weapons in the 1970s and 1980s, which they revealed only after \nthe fact that Pakistan conducted its first test of nuclear weapons in \n1998. India and Pakistan are both countries which are subject to U.S. \nlaws--and international laws, for that matter--that prohibit sending \nnuclear fuel and technologies to states that are operating outside of \nthe nonproliferation treaty. Because India has very little domestic \nuranium, the application of those laws has severely constrained its \nability to expand its nuclear power industry, and it has restrained its \nability to expand its stockpile of nuclear weapons as well.\n  During this past year, New Delhi has stepped up efforts to get the \nassistance of our country to obtain nuclear fuel and reactor components \nso it can deal with an impending energy crisis. I understand their \ninterest and concern about their energy crisis, but this was an \nopportunity, I believe, to get India to abide by and to become a \nsignatory to the nonproliferation treaty and to cap its nuclear weapons \nprogram. Instead, the administration decided that it would initial an \nagreement that legitimizes India's nuclear weapons and which will make \nit substantially easier for India to produce more weapons grade \nmaterial for more nuclear weapons. I don't understand this at all.\n  I was dumbfounded to discover what the administration has done, in \nsecret, with no consultation with Congress at all. But the fact is, I \nhave here a copy of the legislation that the Administration wants \nCongress to pass so the treaty can be implemented even though the text \nof the agreement is not even complete. They have the skeleton of the \nagreement. They have decided we are going to say to India: It is OK \nthat you have decided you are going to create nuclear weapons outside \nof the nonproliferation treaty, but we will not have you suffer the \nconsequences of that so we will now begin to offer you technology and \nfuel so that you can have the ability to produce more nuclear \npowerplants for your own energy needs, and you will also be able to \nkeep some of those behind the curtain and produce additional nuclear \nweapons. We have said they can do that.\n  The agreement has not been written in its final detail, but even \nthough its detail isn't complete, we already have legislation \nintroduced in the Congress to say: That is OK. That is good. We \napprove. God bless you all.\n  I don't understand this at all. The fact is, this is a huge step \nbackwards for this country in providing leadership to stop the spread \nof nuclear weapons.\n  Here is what the deal does. The final text, I am told, has not been \nfinalized, but the substance is this: President Bush's plan will allow \nIndia to buy from the U.S. and other countries sensitive nuclear \ntechnologies that are now forbidden to India under the nonproliferation \ntreaty. That includes nuclear fuel, nuclear reactors, and advanced \nnuclear technology. In return, India has agreed to allow IAEA \ninspections and safeguards at 14 of its 22 existing and planned nuclear \nreactors. So 14 of India's reactors will be off-limits for the \nproduction of plutonium for India's nuclear weapons program.\n  But the agreement allows India to keep 8 existing and planned \nreactors outside of the agreement and free from international \nsafeguards. And it will allow New Delhi to decide entirely on its own \nwhich future reactors it will designate as civilian and therefore to \nsubmit to safeguards or not.\n  So the agreement allows India to keep at least eight nuclear reactors \nbehind the curtain and use them to produce nuclear weapons.\n  So we have essentially said that unlimited amounts of fissile \nmaterial for nuclear weapons can be produced at facilities not \nprotected by these safeguards, and it is just fine with us.\n\n  Well, that is not fine with me. It does not meet our responsibility \nas a world leader to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. By seeking \nexception to the rules for a country with which the United States \nwishes to build a special friendship, this nuclear deal would reinforce \nthe impression that our country's approach to nonproliferation has \nbecome selective, self-serving, inconsistent and unprincipled. This \ndeal will send a signal that the United States--the country the world \nhas always looked to as the leader in the global fight to stop the \nspread of nuclear weapons--is now deemphasizing nuclear \nnonproliferation and giving it a back seat to other foreign policy and \nother commercial concerns.\n  I think that is a huge mistake. If the United States is seen as \nchanging or bending the rules when it suits us, others will want to \nfollow suit. Pakistan has already said: Us, too. We would like some of \nthat. We would like to seek comparable treatment. Not long after the \nUnited States-India deal was announced, China and Pakistan began \ndiscussing additional reactor sales. I believe the United States-India \nnuclear agreement very likely will reduce the constraints on other \nstates that want to go nuclear.\n  In calculating whether to pursue nuclear weapons, a major factor for \nmost countries is, how will the United States react? What will the \nsanctions be if we decide to produce nuclear weapons to become part of \nthe club that possesses nuclear weapons? The sanctions, at least \nsuggested by the India deal, is: Don't worry. If we want your \nfriendship at some point, we might waive all of that and say that the \nnonproliferation issue is much less important than your friendship.\n  There is no question that what has happened is the administration, \nsecretly--with Secretary Condoleezza Rice and Ambassador Burns and \nothers--has negotiated a deal with the President's blessing that will \nmake it much easier for a country that did not sign the \nnonproliferation treaty to greatly expand its illegal nuclear arsenal. \nIt will allow India to access fissile material from overseas, buy \nforeign technologies and create a curtain behind which eight nuclear \nreactors can produce additional nuclear weapons in that region of the \nworld. That is a profound mistake, just a profound mistake.\n  I don't understand why this Congress will not decide that it has a \nvoice as well. The Administration is asking us to rubberstamp the \nagreement even before the agreement is fully written. It is an insult. \nThe legislation we are asked to approve is a rubberstamp. This Congress \nis being asked to say: Well, sign us up, yes, of course. Of course we \nagree. The geopolitics of this friendship is certainly more important \nthan restraining the growth of nuclear weapons or the spread of nuclear \nweapons. Sign us up. It doesn't matter.\n  I am a little tired of a town in which you have one view and one \npolitical party--the White House and the Senate--saying: Sign us up. We \nare all there. We are all hitched up. Whichever way you want to go, we \nwant to go.\n  I think this is the most significant mistake--and there have been \nvery significant mistakes in recent years--but this is one of the most \nsignificant mistakes I can conceive of.\n  Let me go back to where I started a minute ago. A colleague of mine \nyesterday said they found weapons of mass\n\n[[Page S6448]]\n\ndestruction in Iraq. Of course, they didn't. They didn't. But weapons \nof mass destruction, no matter where they are found in the future, \nought to be of great concern to all of us. We just passed a Defense \nauthorization bill that is going to spend about $10 billion on \nantimissile defense. Everyone is worried about North Korea testing a \nnew long-range missile. So we are going to spend $10 billion on \ntechnology to try to hit a bullet with a bullet. If anyone looks at the \nthreat meter--I don't think anybody does much anymore--they will \nunderstand one of the least likely threats our country will face is a \nrogue nation or a terrorist who acquires a nuclear warhead and puts it \non top of an intercontinental ballistic missile and aims it at our \ncountry and shoots it at about 18,000 miles an hour at the United \nStates.\n  By far, the most likely threat is the stealing of a nuclear weapon by \na terrorist organization, putting it on a container, loading the \ncontainer on a ship, and having that ship pull up to a dock in a major \nAmerican city at 3 miles an hour--not 18,000 miles an hour--and \ndetonating a nuclear weapon in the middle of an American city.\n\n  There are 25,000 to 30,000 nuclear weapons, we think, tactical and \nstrategic, in this world, the loss of one of which will be \ncatastrophic; the detonation of one of which in an American city will \nbe catastrophic--one. I am not talking about 5 nuclear weapons or 10 or \n30 or 100; I am talking about 1. In this new age of terrorism, our \nresponsibility is to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, be a world \nleader in stopping the spread of nuclear weapons, and reduce the number \nof nuclear weapons, trying to give teeth to the nonproliferation \ntreaty.\n  Instead, we are off making deals with India. Yes, India is a fine \ncountry. I want India to be a friend of ours. But I am not willing to \nabrogate the nonproliferation treaty and say to India: It is all right \nwhat you did to secretly produce nuclear weapons outside of the \nnonproliferation treaty. That is not all right with us. It ought not be \na signal we send to the rest of the world that it is all right with us. \nYet that is exactly what the deal with India is signaling: We will give \nyou the technology and the capability. You allow inspectors into 14 \nplants in the future, you can have 8 plants that you have behind the \ncurtain to produce nuclear weapons, and that is fine with us because \nthe geopolitics of this deal lead us to believe it is more important to \ngive you this agreement.\n  I think that is just profoundly wrong, and it is going to injure this \ncountry's national security in a profound way.\n  So, Mr. President, my understanding is there are people here already \nworking on this legislation to approve the deal--it is already \nintroduced--saying: Yes, yes, yes.\n  There was a former Governor in a Southern State--I won't use names \nbecause most of my colleagues will recognize it--but he was put in \nplace by a fellow who came to the Senate. But when he went back home on \nweekends he would kick the Governor out of the Governor's chair because \nhe wanted the Governor's office and he wanted to tell him what to do, \nand the guy would say: OK, OK, OK. They named him Governor OK because \nthat is all he ever said was OK. That is what is going on around here. \nYes, even with the India deal. It is OK. It doesn't matter what you do, \nit is OK.\n  It is not OK with me. It is not OK with me that we have legislation \nintroduced to approve a deal that hasn't yet been written in all of its \ndetail, but the architecture of which we know enough of to understand, \nat least from my standpoint, that this is a serious breach of faith for \nour responsibility to stop the spread of nuclear weapons.\n  So, Mr. President, I don't know when the President or when our \ncommittees will decide they want to take a break from amending the U.S. \nConstitution. I understand beginning next week we will have the second \nopportunity to express that this Congress thinks that the work of \nWashington and Franklin and Madison and Mason was a rough draft and we \nhave a lot of ideas and we ought to change the Constitution. If we can \ntake a break from amending the Constitution, I assume someone will try \nto bring to the floor of the Senate legislation that will give a big \nrubberstamp to the India deal.\n  I only wanted to be here today to say that when that happens, I will \ncertainly do everything I can to slow it down. I prefer to stop it. I \ndon't know if I can stop it. I will try to do that. If not, I will slow \nit down a lot, and we will have a long discussion about what the \nresponsibility is of this country to stop nuclear weapons in this day \nand age of terrorism.\n  Some don't care very much about that. They think there are other \nthings that are much more important. There is nothing much more \nimportant in the day of terrorism, in this new age of terrorism, than \nmaking certain that we never, ever have a nuclear weapon detonated in a \nmajor American city. How do you do that? You stop the spread of nuclear \nweapons. You reduce the stockpile of nuclear weapons. And you make sure \nthat we provide the aggressive, assertive leadership to try to keep \nnuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists and safeguard existing \nstocks even as we try to reduce the number. That is our responsibility. \nThe world looks to us for that leadership. And this, in my judgment, is \nnot providing the kind of leadership that gives me comfort.\n  For that reason, I will oppose the agreement that has been reached \nwith India and that has been announced, much to the surprise of most of \nus; in fact, I think to the surprise of probably everyone in Congress \nwho didn't know it was being negotiated.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I came to the floor to speak about the \nimportant issue of private property rights in this country, but I did \nnot realize the distinguished Senator from North Dakota was going to be \ntalking about another issue that is very important, and that is the \nproposed civil nuclear accord between the United States and India. It \nis a subject I have been studying. I am interested in it. I just \nhappened to be one of the two Senate cochairs of the United States-\nIndia caucus and, for that reason, I have been following the \ndevelopments in this proposal from the beginning.\n  As is so often the case, we agree on the ultimate objective, and that \nis to reduce proliferation of nuclear weapons, but we differ about the \nmeans. I happen to support this particular agreement because I think it \nis in the best interests of the United States. It will take another \nfriend of the United States--the world's largest democracy, composed of \nmore than 1 billion people, that has a good record for \nnonproliferation--and it will make us partners with them for peaceful \ncivilian use of nuclear power while avoiding the threat of \nproliferation and the possibility that terrorists might acquire a \nnuclear weapon or it might proliferate to some other irresponsible \nparty and then endanger the United States or our allies.\n  The Congress, of course, will have a chance to get very much involved \nin this issue. Next week, Chairman Lugar and Ranking Member Biden are \ntaking this matter up in the Foreign Relations Committee. They are \ngoing to mark up--I believe it is the Atomic Energy Act, if I am not \nmistaken, which is the one which needs to be amended if, in fact, \nCongress does consent to this agreement between President Bush and \nPrime Minister Singh of India.\n  I do know there are a lot of people watching to see just what the \nreaction of Congress and the United States to this agreement will be. I \nfor one believe it is an important step in our strategic relationship, \nin our growing friendship. It will be another way the United States and \nIndia can work together to make the world a safer place and the United \nStates can demonstrate its good will by providing civilian nuclear \ntechnology to a country that needs the energy.\n  We know how much the geopolitics of the search for oil has distorted \nour foreign relationships, so it is important that we find clean \nalternatives to oil and gas. That is what nuclear power provides, that \nclean, efficient alternative--although it has problems in that it can, \nin the wrong hands, be abused. It can be used to create nuclear \nweapons.\n  As we all know, India already has a nuclear weapon, so it is not a \nquestion of whether it is going to acquire one. It already has one. It \nhas demonstrated its responsibility and its willingness to work with \npeace-loving partners like\n\n[[Page S6449]]\n\nthe United States in a way that looks to this alternative of civilian \nnuclear energy but at the same time makes sure that the dangers of \nproliferation are reduced to a minimum.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/23/senate-section/article/S6449-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE KELO DECISION\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the main reason I wanted to come to the \nfloor today was to talk about the important issue of private property \nrights. Today marks the 1-year anniversary of one of the most \ncontroversial decisions ever handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court, and \nthat is the case of Kelo v. the City of New London. In that decision, \nthe Court held by a 5-to-4 vote that the government may seize private \nproperty, whether it be a home or small business or other private \nproperty, for the purpose--not of public good but, rather, to transfer \nthat same property to another private owner simply because the transfer \nwould create an increased economic benefit to that community.\n  What made this such a profoundly alarming decision was that it \nrepresented a radical departure both from what the Constitution says--\nthat the power of government to condemn private property should be used \nonly for public use--and it represented a radical departure from the \ndecisions handed down interpreting that constitutional provision over \nthe last 200 years.\n  After all, protection of homes and small businesses and other private \nproperty against government seizure or unreasonable government \ninterference is a fundamental principle of American life and really a \ndistinctive aspect of our form of government. Indeed, private property \nrights rank among the most important rights outlined by the Founding \nFathers when this country was created. Thomas Jefferson wrote that the \nprotection of such rights is:\n\n        . . . the first principle of association, ``the guarantee \n     to every one of a free exercise of his industry, and the \n     fruits acquired by it.''\n\n  These protections were enshrined in the fifth amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution which specifically provides that private property shall \nnot ``be taken for public use without just compensation.'' The fifth \namendment thus provides an essential guarantee of liberty against the \nabuse of power by eminent domain by permitting the government to seize \nprivate property only for ``public use'' and only upon paying just \ncompensation.\n\n  The Court's decision in Kelo was sharply criticized by Justice Sandra \nDay O'Connor in her dissent, in which she wrote:\n\n       [The Court] effectively [has] . . . deleted the words ``for \n     public use'' from the Takings Clause of the fifth amendment \n     and thereby ``refuse[d] to enforce properly the Federal \n     Constitution.''\n\n  Under the Court's decision in Kelo, Justice O'Connor warns:\n\n        . . . the specter of condemnation hangs over all property. \n     Nothing is to prevent the State from replacing any Motel 6 \n     with a Ritz-Carlton, any home with a shopping mall, or any \n     farm with a factory.\n\n  She further warns that, under Kelo, under the Supreme Court's \ndecision just 1 year ago ``any property may now be taken for the \nbenefit of another private party,'' and she said, ``the fallout from \nthis decision will not be random.''\n  Indeed, as noted in a friend-of-the-court brief filed by the National \nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People and the AARP and \nother organizations:\n\n       [a]bsent a true public use requirement, the takings power \n     will be employed more frequently. The takings that result \n     will disproportionately affect and harm the economically \n     disadvantaged and, in particular, racial and ethnic \n     minorities and the elderly.\n\n  Again, that is the brief of the National Association for the \nAdvancement of Colored People and AARP and others.\n  Suffice it to say that the Kelo decision was a disappointment. What I \nfind particularly troubling is that the Kelo case is just one of many \nexamples of the abuse of the power of eminent domain throughout our \nNation. Its use for private development is now widespread. The \nInstitute for Justice has documented more than 10,000 properties either \nseized or threatened with condemnation for private development during \nthe 5-year period between 1998 and 2002. Despite the fact that so many \nabuses of that power were already occurring, the Kelo decision is \nparticularly alarming, and local governments, the condemning \nauthorities most often, have become further emboldened to take property \nfor private development.\n  As this pattern has continued elsewhere, courts very quickly used \nthis decision to reject challenges by owners to the taking of their \nproperty for other private parties. In 2005, for example, a court in \nMissouri relied upon Kelo in reluctantly upholding the taking of a home \nso that a shopping mall can be built. As the judge commented:\n\n       The United States Supreme Court has denied the Alamo \n     reinforcements. Perhaps the people will clip the wings of \n     eminent domain in Missouri, but today in Missouri it soars \n     and devours.\n\n  I firmly believe legislative action is appropriate and necessary, and \nI am not alone in that belief. Several State legislatures have taken \nimmediate action. Indeed, my home State of Texas passed legislation \nthat was signed into law by the Governor last summer that protects \nprivate property from seizure for purposes of economic development. But \nit is also necessary and appropriate that Congress take action \nconsistent with our authority under the Constitution to restore the \nvital protections of the fifth amendment. That is why the week after \nthe Court handed down its decision I introduced S. 1313 entitled ``the \nProtection of Homes, Small Businesses, and Private Property Act of \n2005.'' I am delighted that other Senators have joined in that in broad \nand bipartisan support, including the immediate support shortly after \nit was filed of the Senator from Florida, Mr. Bill Nelson.\n  Today I am happy to report that a total of 31 of our colleagues have \njoined me as cosponsors of this important bill. This bill would ensure \nthat the power of eminent domain is exercised only for public uses, \nconsistent with and guaranteed by the fifth amendment of the \nConstitution. Most important, though, it would make sure the power of \neminent domain would not simply be used to further private economic \ndevelopment interests.\n  The act would apply the standard to two areas of government action \nwhich are clearly within Congress's authority to regulate: No. 1, all \nexercises of the power of eminent domain by the Federal Government \nitself; and No. 2, all exercises of the power of eminent domain by \nState and local governments using Federal funds.\n  While we work to protect private property rights, we are mindful that \nthe language we craft could have far-reaching implications. There is no \nquestion that where appropriate, eminent domain can play an important \nrole in ensuring that true public uses are preserved. But now, just 1 \nyear after the Supreme Court shut the door on Suzette Kelo and her \nfellow homeowners in New London, CT, it is imperative that Congress act \nsoon to ensure that private property remains free from the long arm of \ngovernment so that no American will have to worry about the Federal \nGovernment being involved in taking their private property for private \ndevelopment.\n  Chairman Specter of the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which I am \nproud to serve, is working with me on legislation that I hope he will \nchoose to move soon through the committee. I look forward to working \nwith him and my other colleagues to develop a solution that reaffirms \nour commitment to the protection of private property rights, one that \nwill help stem the tide of egregious abuses of private property rights \nthat we have seen throughout the Nation by the illegitimate use of the \npower of eminent domain.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/23/senate-section/article/S6449-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6449-S6450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STEM CELL RESEARCH\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, just a few days ago U.S. researchers at the \nNational Institutes of Health announced they were able to help \nparalyzed rats move again by using embryonic stem cells from mice. This \nstudy is evidence that these stem cells will likely treat and cure \npeople with spinal cord injuries or nerve-destroying illnesses such as \nLou Gehrig's disease, MS--multiple sclerosis--muscular dystrophy, and \nother things.\n  On this breakthrough, Dr. Elias Zerhouni, Director of the National \nInstitutes of Health, issued the follow statement:\n\n\n[[Page S6450]]\n\n\n       This work is a remarkable advance that will help us \n     understand how stem cells might be used to treat injuries and \n     disease and begin to fulfill their great promise. A \n     successful demonstration of functional restoration is proof \n     of the principle and an important step forward. We must \n     remember, however, that we still have a great distance to go.\n\n  The doctor is right. There is no question that much work remains to \nbe done before science will know if they can apply his advances to \nhuman beings. We have, as the doctor said, a great distance to go, and \nif the Senate doesn't expand the President's stem cell research policy, \nit will only make this great distance even longer.\n  Under the President's stem cell policy, Federal research funds can be \nused only on a small number of these stem cell lines that were created \nbefore August 9, 2001. This restriction excludes newer and more \npromising stem cell lines. These limitations only serve to further \ndelay progress for research that could ultimately benefit a broad range \nof diseases and conditions.\n  One year and one month ago, the House of Representatives passed H.R. \n810, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. This legislation would \nexpand President Bush's 2001 policy for Federal funding for stem cell \nresearch and permit Federal researchers at the National Institutes of \nHealth, with the strongest oversight in the world, to finally explore \nthe many possibilities stem cell research holds.\n  Over the past year, I have repeatedly asked the distinguished \nmajority leader to find time to consider this bill, but my requests \nhave been met by inaction.\n  As a result, millions of Americans who could benefit from the cures \noffered by stem cell research have been forced to wait. They have \nwaited through weeks dedicated to issues such as defining marriage. \nThey have waited through weeks dedicated to issues such as the estate \ntax. They have waited through weeks dedicated to special interests and \nthe majority's well-connected friends. And next week, I am told we are \ngoing to spend it on flag burning. They even waited through a Health \nWeek that had nothing to do with getting America health care. How we \ncould have a Health Care Week in the Senate and not consider stem cell \nresearch is very difficult for the American people to understand.\n  A month ago, the 1-year anniversary of the passage of the House bill, \nSenator Frist once again said he would find time for the Senate to \nconsider stem cell this summer. Summer is here. We have had time for \nmarriage, we have had time for the estate tax, and we are going to have \ntime next week for flag burning. Shouldn't we have time for stem cell \nlegislation? But here we are on June 23. Another month has passed, and \nstill we don't have a commitment to take up stem cell research \nlegislation. That is not acceptable. The news this week that scientists \nwere able to regrow damaged nerves in rats using embryonic stem cells \nis more evidence of the great promise of this research.\n  We need a new direction. We need to bring this legislation to the \nSenate floor and give hope to victims of Lou Gehrig's, diabetes, \nParkinson's, muscular dystrophy, lupus, and other diseases that could \npossibly be cured by stem cell research.\n  Every day, I hear from Nevadans who want the Senate to act on the \nissue of stem cell research so our researchers may fully explore the \ngreat promise of stem cells. Here is one example of what I hear. It is \nfrom one woman from Henderson, NV. She wrote me a letter expressing the \nhope that stem cells offers her and her family.\n  Her letter says, among other things:\n\n       .  . . My 22-year-old son was in a diving accident just two \n     weeks after graduating from high school and is now a \n     quadriplegic. So instead of heading off to college on a \n     soccer scholarship that autumn, he found himself being fitted \n     for a wheelchair and a life of total dependency on others . . \n     . while they [stem cells] may not cure him to the point of \n     walking again, they will certainly provide him with an \n     opportunity to improve the quality of his life. He wants to \n     be able to feed himself, brush his own teeth, wash his hands \n     and face when he wants to . . . I know you support stem cell \n     research but I just wanted to give you my support and the \n     support of our entire family as you fight the fight for those \n     who can't fight for themselves. . . .\n\n  Think of the hope of this mother when she heard on the news this week \nthat research has shown that animals can regenerate the cells to bring \nback neurological functions. Think of how she must have felt when that \ngave her hope.\n  There are a number of very important issues which this body needs to \nconsider this summer and this session. There is nothing more important \nto the American people and to this mother than stem cell research.\n  In the days ahead, everyone should be on notice that we are going to \ndo everything we can to have a debate on stem cell research. If we \ncan't find floor time for this, we will have to force it upon this \nbody. We must do this. There is limited time. We have to go forward. We \nhave waited far too long. The distinguished majority leader is a man of \nhis word. He said he would bring this to the Senate floor. I am \nconfident and extremely hopeful that he will do that. Lacking that, we \nwill have to figure out a way to do it ourselves.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/23/senate-section/article/S6450-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6450-S6451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO TERRY MEINERS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Terry Meiners, \na fellow Louisvillian and well-known radio personality. Mr. Meiners is \nnot just a local institution on Kentucky's airwaves, but also a loving \nfather.\n  This fall, for the first time both of Terry's two sons will leave \nhome for college: eldest son Max, 20, will return to Western Kentucky \nUniversity, and younger son Simon, 17, will enroll at the University of \nKentucky. Terry has a great relationship with both of his sons and he \nhas done an excellent job of preparing them for adulthood.\n  As we have just celebrated Father's Day, I thought it appropriate to \nshare with my colleagues the story of Terry Meiners and his two sons. \nOn June 18 of this year, the Louisville Courier-Journal published an \narticle highlighting Terry's family life, career, and accomplishments, \nas well as his importance in the Louisville community. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Courier-Journal, June 18, 2006]\n\n                   What Kind of Dad is Terry Meiners?\n\n                           (By Angie Fenton)\n\n       It's 8:30 a.m., and Terry Meiners sits solemnly on a high-\n     backed metal chair looking out over the lush greenery \n     surrounding his pool.\n       He doesn't utter any of the quick-witted comebacks and zany \n     ramblings that are his trademark on his afternoon drive-time \n     show on WHAS radio. Instead, on this morning, he soaks up the \n     silence, broken only by the soft sound of a manmade waterfall \n     that cascades nearby and the sharp chirps from a pair of \n     cardinals flitting among the trees.\n       Soon, Meiners knows, the silence will reach painful \n     proportions when his eldest son, Max, 20, returns to Western \n     Kentucky University in the fall and his younger son, Simon, \n     17, starts his freshman year at the University of Kentucky.\n       ``I cried like a baby when Max rolled out of here (as a \n     freshman) at WKU,'' recalled Meiners, 49. ``It was torturous, \n     but I realized what a great passage it is for a kid to roll \n     out of his dad's driveway and into a wide open space.''\n       Once Meiners could no longer see Max's car careening down \n     the road, ``I sat in his room and let the tears roll--and let \n     it ride,'' he said.\n       After all, that's the way Meiners lives life, as if it were \n     one big ride with unexpected adventures, where heartbreak is \n     a part of the journey you've got to take in stride.\n       ``My dad is like a carpe diem kind of guy,'' Simon said, as \n     his brother poured milk into a bowl of cereal. ``He tries to \n     lead by example.''\n       One of the most beneficial lessons Meiners' young men have \n     learned from him is ``preparedness--and don't ever depend on \n     anyone,'' Max said.\n       Meiners also has taught his sons to laugh often.\n       The threesome share an affinity for ``The Simpsons.'' They \n     crack jokes, talk politics and quip easily with one another.\n       ``I've learned from my dad to live life to the fullest,'' \n     Simon said, before admitting that he's been guilty of \n     trampling that fine line between full and full of it.\n       In May, Simon surprised his dad on-air by admitting that he \n     would walk at Manual\n\n[[Page S6451]]\n\n     High School's commencement ceremony later that night, but \n     wouldn't receive his diploma because of his participation in \n     a senior prank involving mayonnaise and condoms.\n       ``I had to laugh to myself, but then my daddy genes kicked \n     in right away,'' Meiners said. ``I said, `Well, you know \n     we're going to have to talk about this later.' ``\n       Simon has since received his diploma after making amends \n     with the school, but he's also had a bit of punishment meted \n     out by his father: He'll be without wheels for his first \n     semester at UK.\n       ``I'm going to introduce him to a part of his body he's \n     never known before: his thumb,'' Meiners said.\n       The apple doesn't fall far from the tree, though, which is \n     why Meiners said he's firm but fair when it comes to holding \n     his sons accountable.\n       Meiners earned a bit of notoriety himself back in 1976 when \n     he broke a water pipe in Boyd Hall at UK after swinging on a \n     ceiling sprinkler.\n       ``It was during finals week at Christmastime, and they \n     couldn't shut the water off. The floor caved in, water \n     flooded the dorm and everybody had to sleep on mats at Alumni \n     Gym across the street,'' Meiners said. ``I was not a hero.''\n       The university booted Meiners out of the dorms ``and that \n     effectively ended my college career,'' he said. ``I was \n     already working in radio and went in to work on Monday and \n     said, `Well, I guess that didn't work out.' ''\n       Meiners has made it a habit of embracing a laissez-faire--\n     ``let do, let go, let pass''--attitude. ``I never get tired \n     of getting up in the morning and starting over. I tell my \n     boys all the time, `I can't wait to see what happens next.' \n     ''\n       But Dad can get real serious too.\n       ``You try coming home at 4 in the morning,'' Simon said.\n       ``And he's really serious about preparing for very odd \n     situations,'' Max added, which prompted a barrage of jokes \n     about how Meiners hides flashlights and other ``just in \n     case'' necessities in obscure places throughout the Anchorage \n     home.\n       Still, said Max, ``I admire his total passion for \n     everything he does in life. Whatever he does, he does \n     wholeheartedly.''\n       That includes grieving for his mother, Norma Jean Meiners, \n     who died on Dec. 12.\n       Just days after her death, Meiners was back on-air candidly \n     sharing his loss. Fans flooded his personal Web site with \n     well-wishes.\n       But his sons were concerned.\n       ``He lost weight from stress--we were worried about him,'' \n     Max said. ``I know he has 13 brothers and sisters, but \n     sometimes it's like he doesn't have anyone to talk to.''\n       Yet, Meiners did what he somehow always seems to do: Let it \n     ride and roll with it.\n       ``The only thing you can do is will yourself into a \n     positive feeling. I try to teach my kids . . . to bring a \n     positive attitude to everything they do,'' Meiners said.\n       ``I am abundantly grateful for everything we have,'' he \n     said.\n       Meiners is also thankful for what blossomed in his life \n     after his mother's death.\n       ``It's given me an avenue to speak to my father (Mel) like \n     I've never before,'' Meiners said. ``My family and I, we've \n     surrounded my father.''\n       Even as they prepare to leave, Meiners' sons have \n     surrounded their father too.\n       ``I love my dad, and I'm thankful for everything he's done \n     for me,'' Max said. ``We've been through so much in the past \n     six months, this Father's Day will be special.''\n       Meiners agreed.\n       ``My perfect Father's Day is not possible. I'd like to go \n     back in time and remedy my missteps. But we're here now, and \n     I stand before (my sons) flawed but willing to learn,'' \n     Meiners said.\n       ``The bottom line is that more than anything, I want to \n     make sure my sons are men of integrity. That's all that \n     matters. And I'm happy to report they are.''\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if you search the State of Nevada, you will \nfind many elder statesmen. But you won't find any finer than Judge \nLloyd D. George.\n  Judge George is my friend, and Nevadan through and through.\n  Judge George moved to Las Vegas in 1933, when he was just 3 years \nold. His family's business was moving sand and gravel. He recalls his \nhouse as being built on two railroad lots and remembers Las Vegas at \nthe time as a ``slow city.''\n  Las Vegas has grown a lot since 1933, and so has Lloyd George.\n  A graduate of Brigham Young University and University of California \nBerkeley Law School, he has been an institution in our State's legal \ncommunity, as both a lawyer and a judge.\n  In 1984, President Ronald Reagan nominated Judge George to the U.S. \ndistrict court, and he quickly won Senate confirmation. In 1992, he \nbecame chief judge of the Nevada District, a position he held until \n1997.\n  Today, Judge George is a retired senior U.S. district judge, but he \nstill comes in to work every day. His continued service is a testament \nto Judge George's commitment to the law and the people of Nevada. All \nof us here recognized that commitment when we named the Las Vegas' \nFederal courthouse the ``Lloyd D. George Federal Building and U.S. \nCourthouse'' in the year 2000.\n  Mr. President, I began by calling Judge George a statesmen, which is \nexactly what he is.\n  When statesmen speak, the community has an obligation to listen. \nWhich is why I rise to submit Judge George's moving 2006 Memorial Day \nremarks into the Congressional Record. His words paint a vivid picture \nof the sacrifice America's heroes made at Iwo Jima, and they remind us \nof our obligation to carry their memories with us today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Lloyd George's remarks be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Memorial Day Address--Iwo Jima\n\n                   (By Lloyd D. George, May 26, 2006)\n\n       Before World War II, the Island of Iwo Jima was considered \n     tiny and insignificant. After the February 19, 1945, invasion \n     of the island, where one hundred thousand men fought for over \n     a month for control of an area only about a third the size of \n     Manhattan, Iwo Jima became gargantuan in the history of \n     warfare and heroism.\n       Both sides understood the strategic importance of the small \n     island. It had two airfields, and had been used by Japanese \n     fighters to attack American bombers on their way to targets. \n     Americans also wanted control of the island as a base for \n     their own aircraft.\n       The name Iwo Jima means Sulfur Island in Japanese. The five \n     mile long, two mile wide island had soil of volcanic ash, \n     soft enough to create extensive tunnels and underground \n     fortifications for its 22,000 Japanese defenders, but too \n     soft on the surface for the invasion forces to dig even an \n     adequate foxhole for protection. And the 546 high Mount \n     Suribachi at the southern end of the island provided the \n     defenders a vantage-point from which they could lay down a \n     withering fire onto the beach.\n       One of the Iwo Jima veterans we pay tribute to, Chester \n     Foulke, recounts running back after carrying ammunition to \n     Marine machine gunners, and falling as if he had been hit in \n     order to stop the hail of bullets which were spraying all \n     around him.\n       Another honoree, Larry Odell, credits flamethrowers, \n     carried by Marines or in small tanks, for ultimately \n     defeating the entrenched Japanese. The Japanese had years to \n     construct a sixteen mile complex of reinforced tunnels \n     connecting fifteen hundred man-made caverns. Attacks came \n     upon the Marines from virtually anywhere, day or night, \n     through warrens, spider holes, caves and crevices.\n       The ferocious nature of the battle was unrivaled. Sulfur, \n     the namesake of the island, turns red when it melts under \n     heat. So, too, the soil and rocks of the island were often \n     turned red from blood as the battle raged on. Of the 70,000 \n     Americans engaged in a battle, there were 26,000 casualties, \n     almost 7,000 of whom were killed. Out of the 22,000 Japanese \n     soldiers on the island, only 212 were taken prisoner. When \n     told of the casualties during the battle, President Roosevelt \n     visibly wrote: ``It was the first time [throughout the entire \n     war] that anyone had seen the President gasp in horror.'' \n     Indeed, the Battle of Iwo Jima, which displayed the fanatic \n     fervor of the Japanese, and the heavy casualties suffered by \n     forces combating them, influenced the American decision to \n     use atomic bombs to end the war.\n       Amid the overwhelming death and destruction at Iwo Jima, \n     uncommon valor was common. The image of six Marines raising \n     the American flag after taking Mount Suribachi on the fifth \n     day of fighting stands as a symbol not only of the island and \n     the battle, but of the entire war. Another local honoree, \n     Parke Potter, was in one of three companies to take the \n     mountain. He also helped improvise a makeshift flagpole by \n     wiring together scraps of iron pipe.\n       Every single American who fought at Iwo Jima was valiant in \n     preserving freedom and democracy. More medals for valor were \n     awarded for action on Iwo Jima than in any battle in the \n     history of the United States. The Marines were awarded \n     eighty-four Medals of Honor in World War II. In just the \n     month of fighting on Iwo Jima, they were awarded twenty-seven \n     Medals of Honor. We will never forget those who descended \n     into the depth of hell that month 61 years ago, so that we \n     and future generations, might exist above it. And we honor \n     those who sacrificed their futures that we might have ours.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/23/senate-section/article/S6451-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6451-S6452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO JUDGE R.W. DYCHE III\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a great \nleader in public service, Judge R.W. Dyche III of London, KY. Judge \nDyche is retiring from the Kentucky Court of Appeals, Third Appellate \nDistrict, First Division, after 20 years of honorable service. He began \nhis legal career as a clerk for the law firm of Allen & Bledsoe, and \nafter the firm dissolved,\n\n[[Page S6452]]\n\nhe opened his own office. He accepted an appointment as a judge of the \n27th Judicial District in 1978 and 8 years later was appointed to the \nKentucky Court of Appeals.\n  Judge Dyche plans to take some time off to begin his retirement. From \nthere he said he has a couple of possibilities lined up. I am sure his \nwife Jane and his sons Robert and John are looking forward to seeing \nmore of him.\n  On June 12 of this year, The Sentinel Echo published an article \nhighlighting Judge Dyche's accomplishments while in office as well as \nthe excellence with which he carried out his job. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the full article be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        [From the Sentinel Echo]\n\n                  Judge Dyche Retiring After 20 Years\n\n                         (By Carl Keith Greene)\n\n       Twenty years after his appointment and subsequent election \n     to the Kentucky Court of Appeals Judge R.W. Dyche III will \n     retire on June 20.\n       Dyche, 55, who began his career as a law clerk for Baxter \n     Bledsoe and Larry Allen, served also as Laurel District Judge \n     for eight years.\n       ``I look forward to a new chapter, learning new things, \n     learning different things, I've become even more convinced \n     lately that when you quit learning you begin dying. I'm \n     learning a few new things,'' he said in an interview \n     Thursday.\n       Dyche entered the legal profession because, ``It's all that \n     ever interested me. I had a phase of electronics and \n     electrical engineering. But starting about my freshman year \n     in high school it's all that ever interested me.''\n       He said the best thing about being a judge for him is \n     ``getting to see the good side of humanity. Unfortunately, \n     along with that you also see the bad side.''\n       He said the good side is made up of generosity, love, \n     attorneys who go out of their way to represent their client \n     well--sometimes at no cost--people who just want to do the \n     right thing.\n       On the bad side, he has seen families who fight, or people \n     who abuse or neglect children. He said these are the two \n     worst scenarios.\n       Though it is hard to pinpoint a typical case Dyche has \n     heard, he said in the criminal side, anymore, is a drug case, \n     and generally, the most common grounds for claimed error is \n     illegal search and seizure.\n       ``Very often the drugs are found on the person or in close \n     proximity and the only out they have is to say the search is \n     illegal.''\n       In civil court, ``unfortunately domestic things are growing \n     and growing and growing. It's such a good thing that we're \n     going to get a family court here soon,'' he said.\n       Dyche estimated there are approximately 75 percent of \n     affirmations of lower court cases and 25 percent reversals.\n       He said the case that stands out in his memory is from \n     about 1988 or 1989 ``where a child was taken from the mother \n     at the hospital before she ever got the chance to show \n     whether she could be a good mother, based on past history and \n     predictability. I wrote an opinion reversing that saying, it \n     could be under very close supervision but she should be \n     given the chance.''\n       He said he prides himself, and his staff, on being able to \n     write opinions that litigants can understand, not written in \n     what is called ``legalese'' but written in plain English and \n     short concise form so they can understand why they won or \n     lost.\n       Dyche is a 1968 graduate of London High School. He earned \n     his bachelor's degree from Danville's Centre College and his \n     law degree at the University of Kentucky College of Law in \n     1975.\n       He and his wife of 27 years, Jane, also a lawyer, have two \n     sons, Robert, 24, who is in law school and John, 13, an \n     eight-grader at North Laurel Middle School.\n       In his years in the Laurel judicial system he has seen the \n     court system grow from one circuit judge, Bob Helton; one \n     district judge, Lewis Hopper; one trial commissioner, Dyche; \n     and one pre-trial services officer, Fred Yaden.\n       Now there are two circuit judges, two district judges, at \n     least two trial commissioners, and three or four pre-trial \n     officers, he said. The case load has, with the county, grown \n     so much.\n       ``I can remember in the late 70s when Les Yaden was sheriff \n     there was Les, Oscar Brown, Earl Bailey as deputies and \n     Evelene Greene and Les' daughter Janie making up the entire \n     Sheriff's office staff.''\n       Now there are many, many who are needed.\n       Looking ahead, Dyche said he is going to take some time off \n     to start out with, and is exploring, a couple of \n     possibilities.\n       ``I'm certainly not going to be idle,'' he said.\n       He said he has learned a few things about doing his job \n     since he began the journey.\n       ``I came into this at age 27 single, and early on I was \n     having and I was lecturing a father, `Oh you need to do this, \n     you need to do that. Here's what you do with your son.' I was \n     giving him down the road. The guy looked at me and said, \n     ``Buddy, you got any children?'' I said `no.' He said `huh.' \n     ''\n       He concluded, ``I'm much more understanding when things \n     don't go exactly as you planned in raising children.''\n       ``I appreciated how good everybody's been to me, the \n     cooperation of the people, my staff, Sandy Slusher and Julie \n     Ledford, and particularly my friend Fred Yaden. I'll be \n     around. I won't go far.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                           A Tribute to Dyche\n\n          (By Sandy Slusher, Appeals Court Judicial Secretary)\n\n       Working at the Court of Appeals has been the highlight of a \n     career and life that I thought would never happen. I took a \n     job years ago with the law firm of Allen & Bledsoe. Robbie \n     Dyche was in law school and clerked at the firm. I found him \n     a most interesting person when he was in the office.\n       When the firm dissolved, Robbie decided to open his own \n     office. He asked if I would like to work for him, and I \n     eagerly accepted. That was 30 years ago. His practice grew \n     but he realized public service was truly his calling. In 1978 \n     he accepted an appointment as district judge under the new \n     judicial reform system, Eldon Keller, (the Circuit court \n     Clerk at the time), hired me as a deputy clerk. I still was \n     able to work with Judge Dyche, as well as Judge Lewis Hopper.\n       In 1986, Judge Dyche was appointed to the Kentucky Court of \n     Appeals and asked if I would like to work as his secretary. \n     The judge, Julie Ledford, our staff attorney, and I went to \n     Frankfort together to be sworn in.\n       In Judge Dyche's office, we have formed a small family unit \n     supporting each other through divorce, marriage, births, \n     deaths graduations, illnesses both in the office and in \n     extended family members. We have celebrated with each other \n     at the happy times, and embraced and consoled each other \n     through the heartbreaking moments. It had been so good.\n       Throughout Judge Dyche's tenure our office policy has been \n     to write opinions that are concise, strictly based on law, \n     easily understood by the average citizen as well as the \n     judiciary, and rendered as soon as possible. Matters \n     involving child custody always took precedent over other \n     matters and Judge Dyche consistently would volunteer to take \n     additional cases involving child custody in order to fast \n     track these matters through the Court.\n       I have formed friendships that will endure for the \n     remainder of my time on earth. If the opportunity presented \n     itself, I would do it all over without a moment of \n     hesitation!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/23/senate-section/article/S6452-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6452-S6453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    COMMENDATION OF TIMOTHY E. LESHA\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to commend the \nexemplary work of Tim Leshan, who is leaving the National Human Genome \nResearch Institute at the National Institutes of Health to become the \ndirector of government relations and community affairs at Brown \nUniversity.\n  For the past 5 years, Mr. Leshan has served the National Human Genome \nResearch Institute with great distinction. As branch chief of policy \nand program analysis at the Institute, he provided focus and leadership \nin numerous areas of public policy on genetics.\n  He served as the congressional liaison during the completion of the \nHuman Genome Project and the International HapMap project, and was the \nInstitute's planning and evaluation officer.\n  As liaison to the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the \nWhite House, he has facilitated contacts between the director of the \nInstitute and numerous Federal, State, and international policy makers.\n  Mr. Leshan has guided policy development for the Institute on issues \nrelating to genomic medicine, intellectual property, and regulation of \ngenetic tests. He has also facilitated the resolution of complex policy \nissues for all of NIH with respect to the National Library of \nMedicine's PubChem database, and provided technical assistance to the \nHouse and Senate appropriations committees and authorizing committees. \nHe also had a particularly important leadership role in the development \nof legislation against genetic discrimination and on privacy \nprotections for genetic information.\n  He has provided impressive technical advice to many of us in the \nSenate in drafting legislation on genetic nondiscrimination and health \ndisparities. One of Tim's major regrets as he leaves the Institute is \nnot having seen the passage and signing of genetic nondiscrimination \nlegislation. Hopefully, action on that legislation will be completed \nbefore the end of the current session of Congress, and I am sure Tim \nwill be there at the signing as a principal adviser for all of us on \nthe bill.\n  Before joining the Institute, Mr. Leshan was the director of public \npolicy for the American Society for Cell Biology, where he cofounded \nthe Coalition for the Advancement of Medical\n\n[[Page S6453]]\n\nResearch, and staffed the Joint Steering Committee for Public Policy. \nEarlier, Mr. Leshan had worked in government relations at the Kennedy \nSchool of Government at Harvard University, and also at Duke \nUniversity.\n  Through his contributions to public policy, health, and privacy, Mr. \nLeshan's work has exemplified the best of government service, and the \nimpact that such dedicated service can have for the Nation as a whole.\n  I extend my warmest wishes to Mr. Leshan in his new responsibilities \nat Brown University, and on behalf of the Congress and the country \ngratitude for his outstanding service to NIH, Congress, and the \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/23/senate-section/article/S6453-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOT ALL GUNS ARE CREATED EQUAL\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, crime \nstatistics indicated a growing threat posed by a military-style \nsemiautomatic assault weapons in the hands of criminals. A 1994 report \nby the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, ATF, \ndetermined that while assault weapons made up only 1 percent of the \nguns in circulation in the United States at that time, they accounted \nfor up to 8 percent of the guns used in crimes, ``thus making them \npreferred by criminals over law-abiding citizens 8 to 1.'' The ATF \nrelied on data such as this to support the establishment of a federal \nban on assault weapons. Such a ban was enacted by Congress as part of \nthe 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and was signed \ninto law by President Clinton.\n  Following the enactment of the assault weapon ban, the National \nInstitute of Justice, an agency within the Department of Justice, \nconducted a study that was mandated by Congress on the short-term \nimpact of the statute. The study found that crimes involving assault \nweapons dropped 20 percent in the year following enactment of the law. \nAdditional research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nfound deaths caused by guns dropped from 38,505 in 1994 to 29,573 in \n2001.\n  Ten years after the assault weapons ban was passed, Los Angeles Chief \nof Police Bill Bratton said:\n\n       Since the assault weapons ban was passed in 1994, we have \n     seen a 66 percent decline in the frequency of assault weapons \n     use in crime. Violent criminals love these weapons because \n     they give them far more firepower than conventional weapons \n     that greatly increases their capacity to kill. We cannot \n     allow these weapons to get back into their hands.\n\n  On May 8 of this year, two Fairfax County police officers were shot \nto death by an 18-year-old armed with multiple guns, including an AK-\n47-style assault rifle. Unfortunately, assault rifles like the one \nreported in this attack, as well as many other similar assault weapons, \nare once again being legally produced and sold as a result of the \nexpiration of the assault weapons ban.\n  In 1994, I voted to establish of the assault weapons ban and 10 years \nlater I joined a bipartisan majority of the Senate in voting to extend \nthe ban for another 10 years. Unfortunately, despite the overwhelming \nsupport of the law enforcement community, the ongoing threat of \nterrorism, and the bipartisan support in the Senate, neither the \nPresident nor the majority's congressional leadership acted to protect \nAmericans from assault weapons like the one used in the attack on the \nFairfax County police station. As a result, 19 types of previously \nbanned military-style assault weapons are once again on the streets and \nin the neighborhoods of our cities and towns.\n  Congress must take up and pass common sense gun safety legislation to \nhelp prevent such tragedies from occurring in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/23/senate-section/article/S6453-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6453-S6454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PASSAGE OF THE FISCAL YEAR 2007 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION \n                                  BILL\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, first and foremost, I want to thank the \nmembers of the U.S. Armed Forces for their service to our country. \nThese servicemen and women are performing admirably under difficult \ncircumstances all over the world. Our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \nmarines, along with their families, are making great sacrifices in \nservice to our country. I am pleased to support a Defense Department \nauthorization bill that will help these people who are serving the \ncountry with such courage.\n  I supported a number of good provisions in the Senate bill, such as \nthe rejection of the President's proposal to increase TRICARE \nenrollment fees and co-payments, increased funding for training \nprograms for our nation's authorized Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil-\nSupport Teams, and increased funding for nonproliferation programs. \nAnother aspect of the bill that I strongly support is the increased \nfunding for force protection equipment. I have heard from a number of \nWisconsinites over the years that they or their deployed loved ones \nwere fighting for their country in Iraq without the equipment they \nneeded. This situation is unconscionable, and my colleagues and I have \nworked hard to address it. The additional $950.5 million for force \nprotection equipment, including $559.8 million for additional up-\narmored humvees and $100 million for counter-IED vehicles, in this bill \nabove what was requested in the President's proposed budget further \nensures that our troops have the equipment they need to perform their \nduties on the ground.\n  I am pleased that the Senate approved the Military Family Support Act \namendment that I offered with Senator Jeffords. This amendment is \ndesigned to assist military families struggling with the long-term \nabsence of a family member. Under this legislation, the Office of \nPersonnel Management is directed to administer a pilot program \nauthorizing Federal employees, who have been designated ``caregivers'' \nby a member of the Armed Forces, to use their earned leave time in a \nmore flexible manner while a family member is deployed overseas. This \namendment also encourages the Department of Labor to solicit private \nbusinesses to voluntarily offer more accommodating leave time to \ncaregivers affected by these deployments.\n  This bill also authorizes funding for a provision I authored in last \nyears' Department of Defense authorization bill establishing the \nCivilian Linguist Reserve Corps, CLRC, pilot project. It became very \nclear after the attacks of September 11, 2001 that the U.S. Government \nhas a dearth of critical language skills. The 9/11 Commission report \ndocumented the disastrous consequences of this deficiency which, \nunfortunately, we still have not made enough progress in addressing \nover 4 years after the 9/11 tragedy. I am pleased that this bill \nincluded the CLRC pilot project.\n  I am also pleased that I was able to pass a Buy American Act \nreporting requirement for the Department of Defense. This reporting \nrequirement is similar to the reporting requirement that I have worked \nto enact for the past 3 years through the appropriations process and \nrequires the Department of Defense to report annually the dollar value \nof any items purchased that were manufactured outside of the United \nStates; an itemized list of all applicable waivers granted with respect \nto such items under the Buy American Act; and a summary of the total \nprocurement funds spent by the federal agency on goods manufactured in \nthe United States versus on goods manufactured overseas. Additionally, \nthe amendment requires the Department of Defense to make this report \npublicly available to the maximum extent possible. I will continue to \nwork to ensure a similar permanent reporting requirement is extended to \nall Federal agencies.\n  I also authored successful amendments to the bill that require the \nadministration to develop a comprehensive strategy for establishing \nstability and fighting terrorism in Somalia and to study of the \nfeasibility of establishing an United States regional combatant command \nfor Africa. In addition, the bill includes an important amendment I \noffered to strengthen the Special Inspector General for Iraq.\n  Unfortunately, I was not able to get other amendments of mine \nadopted. I filed a straightforward amendment that would have made life \na little easier for our servicemembers and their families when they are \ncalled up to duty or transferred. When this happens now, servicemembers \noften face cellular phone early termination fees or the prospect of \npaying the monthly bill for a cell phone they cannot use until the end \nof their contract--up to 2\n\n[[Page S6454]]\n\nyears. My amendment would have treated these cellular phone contracts \nthe same way that we already treat residential and automobile leases--\ngive the servicemember the right to terminate the contract without \nbeing charged an additional fee. Despite the support of the National \nGuard Association of the United States, the Enlisted Association of the \nNational Guard of the United States, and the Military Officers \nAssociation of America, I was not able to get this amendment adopted. \nWhile I was disappointed in this result, I will continue to fight to \nmake sure that servicemembers are not financially punished for \nvolunteering to protect this country.\n  I was also disappointed that another amendment of mine was not \naccepted that would have extended the Department of Defense's ability \nto purchase fruits and vegetables from local farms. My amendment would \nhave helped both servicemembers and schools served by the Department of \nDefense programs and local farms and communities benefit from the \nprograms.\n  I also introduced amendments to the authorization bill that mirrored \na bill I introduced last year; the Veterans Enhanced Transition \nServices Act, VETS Act. This bill includes provisions that would help \nensure that all military personnel have access to the same transition \nservices as they prepare to leave the military to reenter civilian \nlife, or, in the case of members of the National Guard and Reserve, as \nthey prepare to demobilize from active duty assignments and return to \ntheir civilian lives and jobs or education while remaining in the \nmilitary.\n  The VETS Act is supported by a wide range of groups that are \ndedicated to serving our men and women in uniform and veterans and \ntheir families, and I was pleased to honor this support by introducing \nthe amendments to the Defense authorization bill. We should ensure that \nour troops receive the benefits to which their service in our Armed \nForces has entitled them, and while these amendments were unfortunately \nnot included in the final version of the bill, I will continue to work \nto see that these provisions become law.\n  I will also continue to fight for the redeployment of our forces in \nIraq so that our country can refocus on fighting the terrorist networks \nthat attacked us on 9/11. I offered an amendment with Senator Kerry \nthat would have required U.S. forces in Iraq to redeploy by July 1, \n2007. While the amendment failed, I was pleased to be joined by 12 of \nmy colleagues in addressing the fact that the President's policies in \nIraq are damaging our country's national security. I am glad that more \nand more of my colleagues are recognizing what the American people \nalready know--that we need a plan to redeploy our troops from Iraq.\n  Mr. President, I must note with disappointment that this bill \ncontinues the wasteful trend of spending billions of dollars on Cold \nWar era weapons systems while at the same time not fully funding the \nneeds of the military personnel fighting our current wars. I also think \nthe Senate missed some opportunities when it rejected amendments that \ncould have made the bill better. However, on balance, this legislation \ncontains many good provisions for our men and women in uniform and \ntheir families and that is why I supported it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/23/senate-section/article/S6454-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6454-S6455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate approved the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2007. I was pleased \nto vote in favor of this bill. I wish to express my deepest gratitude \nand respect to Chairman Warner and Ranking Member Levin for their \ntireless dedication to making sure this legislation was passed in a \nspirit of bipartisanship. I am honored to be part of their efforts to \nbuild a stronger, safer America.\n  This legislation is good for our troops, good for Colorado, and good \nfor America.\n  Our troops--the men and women who selflessly defend the democratic \nway of life both here and abroad--deserve nothing less than our \nsteadfast support. I was pleased that we were able to show that support \nin a significant way with the passage of this Defense Authorization \nAct.\n  First of all, starting at the beginning of next year, all military \npersonnel will receive a 2.2-percent pay raise. This extra money in the \npockets of our servicemembers will go a long way as they continue to \nsimultaneously serve our country and work to provide for their own \nfamilies.\n  Second, the Senate has sternly rejected the Pentagon's ill-conceived \nincrease in the medical fees for retirees. This is important to our \nlong-term commitment to provide for those who have served our country \nwith dedication and determination.\n  As part of this Nation's commitment to taking care of the families of \nour servicemembers, this legislation also authorizes a pilot program to \npromote early childhood education for military children affected by the \nrelocation of military units or overseas deployments.\n  For our wounded soldiers, we are enacting strong requirements to make \nsure they receive an audit of their pay, and setting up a toll-free \ncall assistance center for military personnel and next of kin who are \nexperiencing pay problems. We need to take care of our wounded \nveterans, and this is one small step that will go a long way in meeting \nthat goal. Along those same lines, we are also authorizing $10 million \nfor pilot projects to address the growing problem of post-traumatic \nstress disorder.\n  This legislation will also strengthen our troop levels for ground \nforces, adding 30,000 more troops to the Army's end-strength, 5,000 \nmore troops to the Active-Duty Marines, and 17,000 more troops to the \nArmy National Guard. I strongly support these provisions.\n  Additionally, the Defense Authorization Act supports several programs \nthat our troops rely on to successfully complete their missions. There \nis money for new helicopters to replace those lost in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom: $71.0 million to purchase UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters, and \n$333.1 million to purchase CH-47 Chinook helicopters.\n  There is over $950 million for protective equipment for our fighting \nmen and women, including over $550 million for up-armored HMMWVs.\n  This legislation also provides over $2 billion in funding for new \ntechnologies to help keep our troops protected from improvised \nexplosive devices, IEDs. Every American knows that IEDs pose one of the \nmost terrible threats to the safety of our servicemembers currently in \nIraq. It is our responsibility to protect our fighting men and women \nfrom that evolving threat to the best of our ability.\n  All told, the Defense Authorization Act of fiscal year 2007 is very \nstrong on providing for our troops, and I wholeheartedly support that \neffort.\n  In addition, Mr. President, I am proud of the significant, Colorado-\nspecific funding in this bill that will solidify Colorado as America's \ncrown jewel for national defense and homeland security.\n  Specifically, the bill designates $130.7 million for military \nconstruction projects in Colorado. This includes $26 million for Fort \nCarson to build a combat services support complex for special operating \nforces and another $24 million for the next phase of construction of \nthe airfield arrival/depart complex.\n  At Buckley Air Force Base, $10.7 million is authorized for \nconstruction of the consolidated fuels facility, and another $7 million \nis authorized for a new Air National Guard Squadron operations \nfacility.\n  At Schriever Air Force Base, $21 million is set aside for \nconstruction of the Space test and evaluation facility.\n  And finally, there is $42 million authorized for chemical weapons \ndemilitarization construction for Pueblo Chemical Depot.\n  Funds for the Base Realignment and Closure, BRAC, authorized in this \nlegislation will bring another $202 million to Fort Carson. There is \n$118 million for the construction of a brigade combat team complex and \n$84 million for the construction of a division headquarters for the 4th \nInfantry Division relocating from Fort Hood, TX.\n  I am also pleased to note that this legislation authorizes $10 \nmillion to purchase interoperable communications equipment for \nNORTHCOM. Earlier in the year I added an amendment to the budget \nresolution to provide that $10 million for NORTHCOM. Interoperable \ncommunications are absolutely necessary for NORTHCOM to be able to \nrespond as quickly and effectively as possible to a homeland security \nemergency.\n\n[[Page S6455]]\n\n  I am also extremely pleased that several amendments I offered were \npassed by the Senate.\n  My Chemical Weapons Convention amendment sends an extremely strong \nmessage to the Department of Defense that the Senate will no longer \nstand for schedule or funding delays regarding the destruction of \nchemical weapons. Pueblo Chemical Depot needs to be rid of its chemical \nweapons stockpiles. The Department of Defense needs to commit the \nresources to ensure it happens as quickly as possible. With my \namendment, the entire Senate spoke with one voice in agreement.\n  Another amendment I offered and had included in the Senate bill will \nchange the name of the death gratuity to fallen hero compensation. I \nhave stated this before, but I believe the term ``death gratuity'' to \nbe a poor description of the compensation this Nation provides to the \nfamilies of fallen servicemembers. To my way of thinking, anyone who \nhas worn the uniform of the Armed Forces is an American hero, and this \nsmall name change will be extremely meaningful to the bereaved families \nof those servicemembers who die while on active duty.\n  I am also pleased that Chairman Warner and Senator Levin have worked \nwith me to accept an amendment that requires the Secretary of the Army \nto complete a study on the High Altitude Aviation Training Site, HAATS, \nin Eagle County, CO. HAATS is operated by the Colorado National Guard, \nand I could not be prouder of the school and its mission. Helicopter \npilots trained at HAATS are safer in mountainous and environmentally \nchallenging terrain. This study I have proposed will strengthen the \nschool and will help raise its level of visibility in the Army.\n  I also cosponsored a number of important amendments that have been \nincluded in the Senate's bill. One amendment will ensure the Pentagon \nprovides the citizens of southeastern Colorado with the information \nthey have been asking for regarding the Pinon Canyon Maneuvering Site. \nAnother helps provide contractors at Pueblo Chemical Depot with \nincentives to finish by the deadline. On a national level, I was proud \nto cosponsor a fiscally responsible amendment authored by Senator \nMcCain that requires future money for ongoing military operations to be \nproperly budgeted and paid for, instead of continuing to use emergency \nfunding in a way that avoids oversight. And I was pleased to cosponsor \na successful amendment to strengthen the mandate of the Special \nInspector General for Iraq Reconstruction.\n  During consideration of this bill, the Senate engaged in many hours \nof debate regarding the course of U.S. policy in Iraq. I was proud to \nbe a cosponsor of the Levin-Reed amendment that built upon last year's \nSenate consensus that 2006 should be a year of transition in Iraq. \nWhile this amendment was not successful, I believe that the debate was \nimportant, and that Congress must continue to search for constructive \nand responsible ways to help ensure success in Iraq by insisting on \nmore direction and clarity in U.S. policy. Our brave men and women in \nuniform are doing such a remarkable job in Iraq. We need to work hard \nhere in Washington to ensure that our policy is worthy of their \nefforts.\n  Our troops need every opportunity for success. This funding bill, and \nthe amendments and projects it contains, send a powerful message to our \ntroops and the enemies they bravely face: this country supports our men \nand women in uniform. Our brave service men and women are the best in \nthe world, and this bill will ensure they have the training, supplies, \nand materials they need to continue to produce such positive results.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/23/senate-section/article/S6455-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          U.S. POLICY IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the policy in Iraq is not working and must \nchange. The current plan does not have incentives that encourage the \nIraqis to take full responsibility for their own security or to make \nthe difficult compromises necessary for a unity government to work.\n  We have been in Iraq fighting this war for more than 3 years. The \nUnited States has sent hundreds of thousands of our finest troops to \nliberate Iraq from a brutal dictator. More than 2,500 have died for \nIraq's freedom and close to 20,000 have been wounded, many very \nseriously. America has also spent more than $300 billion fighting the \nwar in Iraq.\n  Those sacrifices continue. We have about 130,000 troops in Iraq today \nand, regrettably, we will have more deaths and injuries before this war \nis over. We will also continue to spend tens, if not hundreds, of \nbillions of dollars more in fighting this war.\n  I believe that we need a change and we need a change now. That change \nis the Levin-Reed amendment currently before us.\n  This amendment says that we will begin a phased redeployment of our \ntroops by the end of 2006.\n  This will force the Iraqis to take responsibility for their own \nsecurity and to do so soon. They will have to replace our redeployed \ntroops with Iraqi troops. This will create incentives to build their \nown police and military because some time soon they will not be able to \ncount on Americans doing those jobs. This will also encourage them to \nput aside their political differences and agree on a government that \nworks.\n  This action will not come as a surprise to the Iraqis or anyone else. \nLast year, by a vote of 79 to 19, the United States Senate said 2006 \n``should be a period of significant transition to full Iraqi \nsovereignty, with Iraqi security forces taking the lead for the \nsecurity of a free and sovereign Iraq, thereby creating the conditions \nfor the phased redeployment of United States forces from Iraq.'' What \nwe are now saying is it's time for the phased redeployment to happen.\n  The Levin-Reed amendment that I voted for says that ``the current \nopen ended commitment of United States forces in Iraq is unsustainable \nand is a deterrent to the Iraqis making the political compromises and \npersonnel and resource commitments that are needed for the stability \nand security of Iraq.''\n  Reducing the U.S. role in Iraq also reduces the arguments made by the \ninsurgents and terrorists that they are fighting an occupying army. \nWhen Iraqis are in charge of security, they will be forced to decide if \nthey are going to continue to fight their own government and their own \nmilitary or work together to rebuild their own country.\n  We are not pulling out or abandoning the Iraqi people. We are moving \nto a support role while the Iraqis take the lead. That is what phased \nredeployment means.\n  It is time for the Iraqis to work together and build their future. We \ncannot do that for them. This amendment sets in place a plan to provide \nthe conditions for them to do it themselves. We have done our part. \nThey must do their part and they must do it soon\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/23/senate-section/article/S6455-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6455-S6456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THIRTY-FOURTH ANNIVERSARY OF TITLE IX\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today marks the 34th anniversary of title \nIX. Since 1972, title IX has opened doors to athletics, education and \nsuccess for millions of young women across our Nation. For 34 years, \nthe program has increased participation under Republican and Democratic \nadministrations, because title IX is not about politics it is about \nhelping young women realize their dreams.\n  The statistics are amazing--millions of young women breaking down \nbarriers. But behind these numbers, the lives of these women have been \nimproved because of the changes brought about through title IX.\n  I have seen how title IX has changed the experience of women in my \nown family. When I went to school 30 years ago, the atmosphere was much \ndifferent. Back then at Washington State University, I could only \nparticipate in a few sports, and women receiving athletic scholarships \nwas unheard of.\n  The difference between my daughter's generation and my own could not \nbe more stark. Women of my generation never had the chance to go to \ncollege on a sports scholarship, even though many deserved them. Some \nof my daughter's friends have done just that.\n  I am so proud of my home State of Washington, which is the first \nState in the Nation to boast two women Senators and a woman Governor. \nIt is also home to WNBA champions the Seattle Storm.\n  There is no doubt that title IX has opened doors for women over the \npast\n\n[[Page S6456]]\n\n34 years. The challenge for all of us today is to make sure that those \ndoors of opportunity stay open for our granddaughters and great-\ngranddaughters.\n  As we celebrate the anniversary of this important law, I urge \nPresident Bush and Secretary of Education Spellings to protect existing \ntitle IX policies and give every young girl in American the chance to \nexperience the roar of a crowd--and not just cheer from the sidelines.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/23/senate-section/article/S6456-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                        U.S. Army LT Shaw Vaughn\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment of the Senate's \ntime to remember a Coloradan who was lost to us last week in defense of \nthis Nation.\n  Shaw Vaughan was a loving and supportive son and older brother, an \navid hunter and fly fisherman. One of his most prized possessions was \nhis 1969 Jeepster Commando, an off-roading vehicle he had personally \nrebuilt, affectionately named Hercules. Hercules sits quiet today, its \nred finish gleaming undimmed in the mountain sun.\n  U.S. Army LT John Shaw Vaughan, of Edwards, in Eagle County in my \nState of Colorado, was killed on June 7 in Mosul, Iraq. Lieutenant \nVaughan was a young man with his entire life before him: He was a mere \n23 years old, and had been in Iraq only a month.\n  As a middle school student, Shaw Vaughan caught the eye of our \nmilitary leaders for his regional science fair project: comparing the \naccuracy of store-bought ammunition with that assembled by him. He \ngraduated Battle Mountain High School in 2001 and attended the \nprestigious Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, FL. \nUpon graduation, Lieutenant Vaughan was 1 of only 70 cadets, out of \n5,000, to receive a much-sought-after assignment in military \nintelligence in the infantry. It was a high honor, reflecting his \nintellect, work ethic, and commitment to our Nation.\n  Lieutenant Vaughan was stationed in Alaska, a part of our country he \nhad visited with his family years earlier. I guess you could say that \nAlaska had ``hooked'' the fisherman in Lieutenant Vaughan, and he was \nlooking forward to his service there after he completed his time in \nIraq.\n  Lieutenant Vaughan was eager to get to Iraq, to serve with his unit. \nIn his e-mails and phone calls back home, Lieutenant Vaughan spoke of \nhow strongly he felt about America's mission in Iraq. He told stories \nof Iraqi families leading him into their homes, telling him horror \nstories of their families' sufferings under the brutal regime of Saddam \nHussein.\n  As one newspaper in my home State observed, it seems that every story \nabout Shaw Vaughan was different, and yet, the same: ``one of a great \nguy and a courageous man lost too soon.''\n  In Act III of William Shakespeare's classic Henry V, King Henry says \nwith pride, ``As I am a soldier, A name that in my thoughts becomes me \nbest ''\n  I will think of this today as I bow my head in prayer for the loss of \nLieutenant Vaughan, a life of such great promise that was snuffed out \ntoo soon. LT Shaw Vaughn took pride in his life as a soldier, and it is \ntruly a name that, in all of our thoughts, becomes him best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/23/senate-section/article/S6456-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  THE 125TH ANNIVERSARY OF MILLER, SD\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to the \n125th anniversary of the founding of Miller, SD. Miller is the county \nseat of Hand County, and a center of commerce and civic-mindedness. I \nam proud to recognize Miller on this historic occasion.\n  The site for the town was selected by Henry Miller in 1881 as he came \nnorth from Benton County, IA. An immigrant train was secured from \nChicago that brought 22 men to the site. The men drew lots for claims \nand formed the town plat on a 40-acre area. Shortly a grocery store, \nhardware store, hotel, and lumber yard were established. A metropolitan \nhall was also built in order to hold public meetings, dances, and other \nsocial events.\n  Miller is still a thriving community, with two high schools, a public \nlibrary, Hand County Memorial Hospital, the Miller Press weekly \nnewspaper, many civic organizations, numerous churches, and a variety \nof stores.\n  The people of Miller will be celebrating the quasquicentennial June \n30 through July 4. Some of the scheduled events include a stage \nperformance of ``$400, 40 Acres and Fortitude: The Making of Miller,'' \nschool reunions, softball, a parade, fireworks, and community potluck. \nThese activities will serve to bring this close-knit community even \ncloser together.\n  I am proud to publicly honor the progressive and innovative community \nof Miller on this important milestone. Even 125 years after its \nfounding, Miller continues to be a vibrant addition to our wonderful \nState, and I once again congratulate them on this achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/23/senate-section/article/S6456-3", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE 125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF BALTIC, SD\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to the \n125th anniversary of the city of Baltic, SD.\n  Baltic was founded in 1881 by Richard Franklin and Justin Pettigrew. \nBaltic, originally named St. Olaf, came into being when the Milwaukee \nRailroad laid down track between Dell Rapids and Sioux Falls. A weigh \nstation was established on the current site of Baltic. This development \nwas quickly followed by the construction of the power dam and the St. \nOlaf Roller Mill, the latter being the work of the town's founders, \nFranklin and Pettigrew. The flour mill was located on the Big Sioux \nRiver and used water as its main source of power, producing 120 barrels \nof flour each day. In 1884, a bridge was built between Sverdrup and \nDell Rapids townships over the Big Sioux River. In 1890, the first \nschool house was built and the first church, Baltic Lutheran, was \nconstructed in 1903. In 1907 three lamp posts were purchased in order \nto light the city streets. Baltic had several population booms, one in \nearly 1900 and another in the 1970s.\n  Baltic's placement on the Big Sioux River has brought people to the \ncommunity and increased the town's commercial importance. Today, Baltic \nis a progressive community of about 900 citizens. They have many \nthriving businesses including a post office, co-op, seed company, bank, \nand the Baltic Beacon newspaper. Baltic is also home to the Baltic High \nSchool Bulldogs.\n  Baltic will be celebrating its 125th anniversary on July 1 through \nJuly 4 with a number of events, including a community block party.\n  Even 125 years after its founding, Baltic still exemplifies what it \nmeans to be a great South Dakota community. I am proud to publicly \nhonor Baltic on this memorable occasion, and congratulate the people of \nBaltic on their achievements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/23/senate-section/article/S6456-4", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:16 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Brandon, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4890.

A bill to amend the Mandatory Victims' Restitution Act to \nimprove restitution for victims of crime, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senators Grassley, \nDurbin, DeWine and Collins in introducing legislation called the \nRestitution for Victims of Crime Act of 2006. This legislation will \ngive Justice Department officials the tools they say are needed to help \nthem do a better job of collecting court-ordered restitution and other \nfederal criminal debt.\n  Over the past several years, the Government Accountability Office \nconducted at my request and the request of others a study of the amount \nof federal criminal debt owed victims and the reasons why much of it is \nstill uncollected. The GAO's findings revealed what many victims \nalready know, that the current system for collecting restitution and \nother federal criminal debt is failing those it is intended to help.\n  Let me describe what criminal debt is. You go to court. Someone is \nconvicted of a crime, and a fine is levied. The question is, Is that \nfine being paid? Or you go to court and the judge assigns guilt to a \ndefendant and says: You must make restitution. So that becomes a debt.\n  The problem is that the amount of uncollected restitution and other \nfederal criminal debt has spiraled upward while the percentage of that \ndebt ultimately recovered for crime victims has plummeted. The amount \nof uncollected federal criminal debt skyrocketed from $6 billion in \n1996 to over $41 billion by the end of fiscal year 2005. That's a \nnearly sevenfold increase in uncollected criminal debt owed to the \nvictims of federal crimes. Some $15 million in criminal debt ordered by \nfederal courts in North Dakota remained uncollected at the end of 2005, \naccording to information from the Justice Department.\n  The percentage of debt that is collected or recovered for crime \nvictims in the form of restitution has fallen to embarrassingly low \nlevels. According to the GAO, Federal criminal justice officials \ncollected an average of just 4 cents on every dollar that has been \nordered in restitution and other criminal debt. This is restitution \nordered by the courts to be paid to crime victims from those who \nperpetrated the crime.\n  The victims of crime deserve better. At the very least, crime victims \nshould not be concerned that their prospects for financial restitution \nare being diminished because criminal offenders are frittering away \ntheir ill-gotten gains on lavish lifestyles and the like.\n  There is plenty of blame to go around for our failure to aggressively \ntackle this criminal debt problem. Some of the Nation's top law \nenforcement officials did not pursue a number of major recommendations \nmade by the GAO in 2001 and again in 2004 and 2005 to boost our \nembarrassingly low criminal debt collection rate. These officials only \nstarted to take this matter seriously after I added language to an \nomnibus spending bill that required the Attorney General to establish a \njoint federal task force to develop a strategic plan for improving \nfederal criminal debt collection. Second, Congress has not yet held \nextensive hearings about the federal government's recent track record \non criminal debt collection and the related GAO reports.\n  I understand that criminal debt collection can be a tough job. It may \nbe impossible to collect the full amount of restitution owed to victims \nin some cases. Clearly criminal debt collections may be more difficult \nin cases where convicted criminals are in prison, ill-gotten gains are \nalready gone or these criminals are without any other financial means \nto pay their full restitution. However, GAO's work also made clear that \nmore financial assets could be recovered.\n  Let me tell you why I and my colleagues have introduced this \nlegislation. I had the GAO review a number of\n\n[[Page S6458]]\n\nwhite-collar financial fraud cases and report what is happening with \nrespect to these cases.\n  I will cite some examples.\n  One offender, someone who was judged to be guilty criminally in the \nFederal court system, and his immediate family owned and resided at \nproperty that was worth millions of dollars. Yet he was not making the \nfull restitution that had been ordered by the court to the victim.\n  Two offenders in Federal court cases who were ordered to make \nrestitution to victims took overseas trips while on supervised release \nbut had not made restitution to the victims.\n  One offender and his family established trusts, foundations, and \ncorporations for their assets about the same time that they closed many \nof their bank and brokerage accounts and had not paid restitution to \nthe victims of their crime.\n  Over the course of several years, one offender converted to personal \nuse hundreds of millions of dollars obtained through illegal white-\ncollar business schemes.\n  Several years prior to one judgment, one offender's minor child, who \nis now an adult, was given the offender's entire company. As of the \ncompletion of the GAO's work, that company had employed the offender. \nRestitution still had not been paid to the victim.\n  One offender and his family rented a very lavishly furnished \nresidence--which they had previously owned--from a relative. The \noffender still had not made restitution he was ordered to pay.\n  Again, unpaid restitution and other criminal debt has gone from $6 \nbillion to $41 billion over the last decade. We think that is an \noutrage. We have worked with the Justice Department as a result of the \nthree GAO reports, and because of that, we have put together a \nbipartisan piece of legislation. The legislation is comprised of the \ncomprehensive package of recommendations by the Justice Department that \nstem in large part from the work of the Task Force on Improving the \nCollection of Criminal Debt. Justice Department officials believe these \nchanges will remove many of the current impediments to better debt \ncollection.\n  For example, Justice Department officials described a circumstance \nwhere they were prevented by a court from accessing $400,000 held in a \ncriminal offender's 401(k) plan to pay a $4 million restitution debt to \na victim because that court said the defendant was complying with a \n$250 minimum monthly payment plan and that payment schedule precluded \nany other enforcement actions. Our bill would remove impediments like \nthis in the future.\n  This legislation will also address a major problem identified by the \nGAO for officials in charge of criminal debt collection; that is, many \nyears can pass between the date a crime occurs and the date a court \norders restitution. This gives criminal defendants ample opportunity to \nspend or hide their ill-gotten gains. Our bill sets up pre-conviction \nprocedures for preserving assets for victims' restitution. These tools \nwill help ensure that financial assets traceable to a crime are \navailable when a court imposes a final restitution order on behalf of a \nvictim. These tools are similar to those already used by Federal \nofficials in some asset forfeiture cases and upheld by the courts.\n  Our bill has the support of the administration, and the support of \nmany victims organizations.\n  I have a long list of them: The National Center for Victims of Crime, \nMothers Against Drunk Driving, National Organization for Victims \nAssistance--all of these organizations support the legislation we are \nintroducing today--the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, \nParents of Murdered Children, Inc., Justice Solutions, the National \nNetwork to End Domestic Violence, National Association of VOCA \nAssistance Administrators. The list is rather substantial. It also \nincludes U.S. Attorney Drew Wrigley in Fargo, ND, who said this \nlegislation ``represents important progress toward ensuring that \nvictims of crime are one step closer to being made whole.''\n  That is the basis on which we introduce this legislation. Among other \nthings, our bill would clarify that court-ordered Federal criminal \nrestitution is due immediately in full upon imposition, just like in \ncivil cases and that any payment schedule ordered by a court is only a \nminimum obligation of a convicted offender. It would allow Federal \nprosecutors to access financial information about a defendant in the \npossession of the U.S. Probation Office--without the need for a court \norder. This legislation would also clarify that final restitution \norders can be enforced by criminal justice officials through the Bureau \nof Prisons' Inmate Financial Responsibility Program. Our bill would \nhelp ensure better recovery of restitution by requiring a court to \nenter a pre-conviction restraining order or injunction, require a \nsatisfactory performance bond, or take other action necessary to \npreserve property that is traceable to the commission of a charged \noffense or to preserve other nonexempt assets if the court determines \nthat it is in the interest of justice to do so. In addition, this \nlegislation would clarify that a victim's attorney fees may be included \nin restitution orders, including cases where such fees are a \nforeseeable result from the commission of the crime, are incurred to \nhelp recover lost property or expended by a victim to defend against \nthird party lawsuits resulting from the defendant's crime. It would \nalso allow courts in their discretion to order immediate restitution to \nthose that have suffered economic losses or serious bodily injury or \ndeath as the result of environmental felonies. Under current law, \ncourts can impose restitution in such cases as a condition of probation \nor supervised release but this means that many victims of environment \ncrimes must wait for years to be compensated for their losses, if at \nall.\n  Let me make a couple of final points. First, while this legislation \nreflects the entire set of recommendations from the Justice Department \nto improve Federal criminal debt collection, it may not include every \npossible improvement to the current system. For instance, the GAO has \nsuggested making willful failure to pay court-ordered restitution a \ncriminal offense. This is already the case for criminal defendants who \nwillfully fail to pay a court-ordered fine. It is my hope the Senate \nJudiciary Committee will consider this and any other helpful \nimprovements when it reviews this legislation.\n  In summary, Senator Grassley and myself and others believe that it is \noutrageous that unpaid criminal debt ordered by Federal courts to be \npaid by criminals now exceeds $40 billion. That is wrong and it ought \nto be dealt with. Our legislation will do so in a thoughtful, \nbipartisan way. It is legislation that is supported by the \nadministration and by Republicans and Democrats who have joined in this \nlegislation.\n  With the Justice Department's help, we can make criminal debt \ncollection a top priority once again. That is good news for the \ncriminal justice system and great news for crime victims.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS (for himself and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 3563. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct \nstudies to determine the feasibility and environmental impact of \nrehabilitating the St. Mary Diversion and Conveyance Works and the Milk \nRiver Project, to authorize the rehabilitation and improvement of the \nSt. Mary Diversion and Conveyance Works, to develop an emergency \nresponse plan for use in the case of catastrophic failure of the St. \nMary Diversion and Conveyance Works, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the St. Mary \nDiversion and Conveyance Works and Milk River Project Act of 2006. In \n1903, Secretary of Interior Hitchcock authorized construction of the \nMilk River Project as one of the first five reclamation projects under \nthe new reclamation service. Two years later, construction was \nauthorized for the St. Mary Diversion Facilities. Completed in 1915, \nthe Milk River Project and the St. Mary Diversion Facilities have been \nin operation for nearly 100 years with minimum repairs and \nimprovements.\n  The Milk River Project and the accompanying St. Mary Diversion \nFacilities are known as the Lifeline of the Hi-Line. The St. Mary and \nMilk River basins are home to approximately 70,000 people with a meager \nper capita income of approximately $19,500. Most of these people \ndepend--directly or indirectly--on the project and would be\n\n[[Page S6459]]\n\ndramatically impacted by its failure and the loss of water.\n  The Milk River is the backbone of the region's agricultural economy. \nIt provides water to irrigate over 110,000 acres on approximately 660 \nfarms. This project provides municipal water to approximately 14,000 \npeople. Fisheries, recreation, tourism, water quality, and wildlife are \nall impacted by the water flow.\n  But now the St. Mary Diversion Facilities and the Milk River Project \nare facing catastrophic failure. The steel siphons have leaks and slope \nstability problems. Landslides along the canal and the deteriorated \ncondition of the structure make the project an unreliable water source.\n  As authorized in 1903, the Milk River Project is operated as a \nsingle-use irrigation project. Since completion, nearly 100 percent of \nthe cost to operate and maintain the diversion infrastructure has been \nborne by irrigators. The average annual O & M cost from 1998 to 2003 \nwas $420,000, of which irrigators were responsible for 98 percent. In \naddition, irrigators are responsible for reimbursing reclamation for \nthe initial construction costs of the diversion facilities. Maintenance \ncosts have increased with the accelerating deterioration of the aging \nfacilities.\n  In 2003, the St. Mary Rehabilitation Working Group was formed to \naddress the pressing needs of the system. This broad coalition of \ninterests came together to find workable solutions. This legislation is \na result of their efforts and dedication.\n  The St. Mary Diversion and Conveyance Works and Milk River Project \nAct of 2006 will provide a feasible and comprehensive approach to \nrehabilitating the aging and deteriorating infrastructure while still \nmeeting the needs of the folks in Montana. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues in the Senate to move this important piece of \nlegislation forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM (for himself, Mr. Talent, and Mr. Isakson):\n  S. 3564. A bill to provide for comprehensive border security and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that I \nbelieve offers us an opportunity to move forward in the immigration \ndebate. My bill takes a first-things-first approach. It is imperative \nthat we secure our borders now. This first step cannot--and should not \nhave to--wait for a ``comprehensive'' solution. Once we secure our \nborders, we can look at all of the other illegal immigration related \nissues that remain. There is a bipartisan consensus on what needs to be \ndone on border security and the provisions that make up this consensus \nwere included with other more controversial elements in S. 2611--the \nComprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006. While the other body is \nholding hearings on the ``comprehensive'' part of that bill, we should \nnot hold our border security hostage.\n  My bill will significantly increase the assets available for \ncontrolling our borders. It provides more inspectors, more marshals, \nand more border patrol agents on both the northern and southern \nborders. It provides new aerial vehicles and virtual fencing--camera, \nsensors, satellite and radar coverage, et cetera. It increases our \nsurveillance assets and their deployment, and provides for new \ncheckpoints and ports of entry. It includes Senator Sessions' amendment \nfor greater fencing along our southern border, including 370 miles of \ntriple-layered fencing and 500 miles of vehicle barriers. It also \nprovides for the acquisition of more helicopters, powerboats, motor \nvehicles, portable computers, radio communications, hand-held global \npositioning devices, night vision equipment, body armor, weapons, and \ndetention space.\n  While we know these resources will be critical improvements, it does \nnot just throw resources at the problem. My bill requires a \ncomprehensive national strategy for border security, surveillance, \nports of entry, information exchange between agencies, increasing the \ncapacity to train border patrol agents and combating human smuggling. \nIt enhances initiatives on biometric data, secure communications for \nborder patrol agents, and document fraud detection. It includes Senator \nEnsign's amendment to temporarily deploy the National Guard to support \nthe border patrol in securing our southern land border. Additionally, \nit increases punishment for the construction of border tunnels or \npassages.\n  When our borders are not secure, it is our cities and counties are on \nthe frontlines, particularly those closest to the borders. \nUnfortunately, the negative impacts of illegal immigration are not \nlimited to our border towns. Recently I worked with communities in \nSoutheastern Pennsylvania--Allentown, Easton, Bethlehem, Reading and \nLancaster--as well as the U.S. Attomey for the Eastern District of \nPennsylvania, Pat Meehan, to get one of the six recent Anti-Gang \nInitiative grants given by the Department of Justice. This area, called \nthe Route 222 Corridor, was the only nonmetropolitan area to receive \none of the $2.5 million grants to combat growing criminal activity in \npart because of illegal immigrants. However, I raise this issue here \nbecause U.S. Attorney Meehan's letter explains this issue very \nsuccinctly. He stated ``[e]ach city is seeing extensive Latino \nrelocation to its poorer neighborhoods and housing projects. Once \nlargely Puerto Rican, the minority populations are increasingly from \nCentral America. Simultaneously, Mexican workers migrate to the \nagricultural areas around Lancaster, creating a southern link to \ncriminal networks. The urban core is therefore transient, poor, non-\nEnglish speaking and often undocumented . . . In this fertile \nenvironment, the Latin Kings, Bloods, NETA and lately MS-13, are \nrecruiting or fighting with local gangs for control of the drug \nmarkets. Violence is a daily byproduct.''\n  My bill provides relief for cities, counties and States dealing with \nincreased costs because of illegal immigration--specifically those \ncaused by the criminal acts of illegal immigrants. There are four \nprograms included in my bill to address these issues. First, there are \ngrants to law enforcement agencies within 100 miles of the Canadian or \nMexican borders or such agencies where there is a lack of security and \na rise in criminal activity because of the lack of border security, \nincluding a preference for communities with less than 50,000 people. \nSecond, local governments can be reimbursed for costs associated with \nprocessing criminal illegal aliens such as indigent defense, criminal \nprosecution, translators and court costs. Third, State and local law \nenforcement agencies can be reimbursed for expenses incurred in the \ndetention and transportation of an illegal alien to Federal custody. \nFinally, reimbursements are available for costs incurred in prosecuting \ncriminal cases that were federally-initiated but where the Federal \nentity declined to prosecute. In addition, my bill requires the \nSecretary of Homeland Security to provide sufficient transportation and \nofficers to take illegal aliens apprehended by State and local law \nenforcement officers into custody for processing at a detention \nfacility operated by the Department, and that the Secretary designate \nat least one Federal, State, or local facility in each State as the \ncentral facility to transfer custody to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  This bill also expedites the removal of criminal aliens from \ncorrectional facilities and expands border security programs through \nthe Department of Commerce such as the Carrier Initiative, the Americas \nCounter Smuggling Initiative, the Container Security Initiative, and \nthe Free and Secure Trade Initiative.\n  Throughout the debate on immigration reform, I have consistently \nstated that the first thing we must do is secure our Nation's borders. \nWhile the House and Senate are working to come to an agreement on the \nbroader issues in the immigration bill, I am pleased to be introducing \nthe Border Security First Act today with my colleague from Georgia, \nSenator Isakson, and my colleague from Missouri, Senator Talent, \nbecause our borders must be secured now--not later. In the post 9/11 \nworld we live in, our national security depends on our border security. \nWe need to know who is coming into our country, where they are from, \nand what they are doing here. We must put first things first--we must \nsecure our Nation's borders.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 5403, the Safe and \nTimely Interstate Placement of Foster Children Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5403) to improve protections for children and \n     to hold States accountable for the safe and timely placement \n     of children across State lines, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I rise to speak on passage of the \nSafe and Timely Interstate Placement of Foster Children Act. This \nlegislation seeks to expedite the interstate placement of foster \nchildren into the safe and nurturing families they so desperately need \nand deserve. In doing so, it encourages and provides incentives to \nStates to help expedite the completion of home studies, which are all \ntoo often the cause or delays in interstate placement cases.\n  Nationwide, there are currently over 500,000 children in foster care, \nand more than 2,500 in my home State of Arkansas. On trips back home \nand in meetings with my constituents, I have listened to the many \nheartbreaking tales of children who continue to suffer needlessly \nbecause of barriers to their timely placement. While a recent increase \nin the number of adoptions has allowed many of these children to spend \nless time in foster care homes, an unacceptably large number still \nencounter barriers that delay their timely placement. This is \nparticularly the situation for children placed across State lines. In \nfact, recent reports indicate that interstate placements take an \naverage of one year longer than placements within a State.\n  The situation is unacceptable, and I am grateful that we are \naddressing this issue by taking a step forward. Although we are taking \nthat step here today, we must also recognize that we are improving a \nprocess, not fixing it. In cooperation with our State child welfare \nagencies and State court systems, we need to continue working to finish \nthe task before us by carefully evaluating improvements that result \nfrom passage of this legislation and looking at other ways Federal and \nState agencies can work together in the future to make interstate \nplacements work even better.\n  We must work together to provide both better guidelines for the \nprocess of gaining approval for sending children across State lines \nwhile allowing States the much-needed flexibility to cater them to \ntheir specific circumstances. We must work together to find a way to \nset deadlines that expedite the processing of home studies yet does not \nset unrealistic timelines on our States. We must work together to find \nbetter ways to ensure more efficiency in the process while also taking \neach State's circumstances under consideration.\n  In short, we must continue working together to ensure that no more of \nour children are unnecessarily stuck in foster homes because of \nbureaucratic inefficiencies, unnecessary delays, and red tape. We can \ndo better by these children. The opportunity to grow up in a nurturing, \nloving, and stable family is something that none of us should take for \ngranted. It is our duty in this Congress to ensure that these children \nare not denied this opportunity, but given timely placement with the \nhome and the family that each and every one of them deserve.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and any statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 5403) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this bill, H.R. 5403, the adoption bill, is \na bill that is aimed at improving protection for children. It holds \nStates accountable for the safe and timely placement of children across \nState lines.\n  I am gratified we have passed this bill today to help our children \nwho are in foster care. Finding permanent and loving homes for foster \ncare children is the first order of a compassionate society. Far too \noften, these children bounce from one temporary situation to another \nand then to another, never finding a permanent loving family.\n  The bill we passed just a few moments ago speeds their placement by \nmaking interstate placements easier, particularly with extended family. \nI, in particular, commend the former majority leader of the House, Tom \nDeLay, for his passionate crusade for at-risk children. A foster parent \nhimself, Tom has worked tirelessly on adoption and foster care issues \nduring his long service in the House of Representatives.\n  It is a fitting tribute to Tom DeLay's service that the House passed \nthis bill on his last day in office. And I am gratified we just passed \nit a few moments ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/23/senate-section/article/S6463-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 5638\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, today I would like to applaud my \ncolleagues for passing S. 2370, the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of \n2006.\n  My friend, the senior Senator from Delaware, Mr. Biden, and I \ncosponsored this legislation. We were joined in our efforts by Senators \nFrist, Reid of Nevada, DeMint, Mikulski, Martinez, Nelson of Florida, \nHagel, Nelson of Nebraska, DeWine, Talent, Allen, Burns, Boxer, \nBunning, Kerry, Salazar, Lieberman and Thune; all of whom are original \ncosponsors of this bill.\n  I particularly thank my colleague, the senior Senator from Indiana, \nMr. Lugar, for his leadership on this issue. He has been instrumental \nin fashioning language on the important question of how the United \nStates addresses the challenges posed by the new Hamas-dominated \ngovernment in the West Bank and Gaza.\n\n[[Page S6464]]\n\n  The elections of January 25 in the West Bank and Gaza produced the \nfrightening result of a majority of Hamas supporters in the Palestinian \nparliament. Since that time, Hamas has demonstrated its continued \nunwillingness to accept Israel's right to exist and to accept the prior \ncommitments made by the Palestinian Authority. It has also failed to \nrenounce terror. That is antithetical to our security interests in the \nMiddle East and it is clearly unacceptable to this Senate.\n  Our bill would do the following: it would restrict assistance to the \nPalestinian Authority, PA, unless the Hamas-led PA has publicly \nacknowledged Israel's right to exist, has recommitted itself to all its \nprior agreements with Israel, has made progress toward dismantling \nterrorist infrastructure, and has instituted fiscal transparency. This \nbill would essentially deny visas to certain PA officials and restrict \ntheir travel to the United States. It also limits diplomatic \ninteraction with Palestinian terrorist groups. Finally, this bill \ncontains rigorous audit and oversight requirements to ensure compliance \nwith its provisions.\n  In short, this legislation urges the current Palestinian Government \nto take another step toward joining the community of peaceful nations \nand to step away from the ranks of terrorism.\n  Let me also tell you what this bill does not do. It does not cut off \nassistance to the Palestinian people with respect to food, water, \nmedicine, sanitation, and other basic human needs. Thus, humanitarian \nassistance that does not go through the Hamas-led PA will continue. \nMoreover, funding for democracy programs will also be continued.\n  Both Senator Biden and I appreciate the need not to punish the \nPalestinian people for actions their government may take. Our concern \nis with terrorism and with terrorists and in providing Hamas the proper \nincentives to embrace peace and to abandon the proterror stance they \nhave taken up until now. As Prime Minister Olmert said this week before \na joint session of Congress: such legislation ``sends a firm, clear \nmessage that the United States of America will not tolerate terrorism \nin any form.''\n  Democracy is about more than just elections, it is also about \nresponsible, accountable governance. The Palestinian elections a few \nmonths back reflect this fact. International observers indicate that \nthe elections were essentially free and fair--which in and of itself is \ncertainly a good thing. I strongly support democratic elections. That \nsaid, any right-minded person deplores the result of those elections \nthat placed a proterror party at the helm of parliament.\n  A key part of democratic governance is that elected officials are \nresponsible for the actions they take. If Hamas persists in sponsoring \nterror, rejecting Israel's right to exist and refusing to accept prior \ncommitments made to Israel, then they should be held accountable for \ntheir actions, and be prepared to forfeit the prior foreign aid \ninvestments in the West Bank and Gaza paid for by American taxpayers. \nThe PA's budget is dependent in large part by foreign assistance, and \nHamas has been put on notice by the United States and many in the donor \ncommunity about the steps it must take in order to receive assistance \nin the future.\n  Foreign assistance is not an entitlement. It is not a free lunch. \nForeign aid is an act of generosity from the American people to other \nnations, and it should be conducted in furtherance of U.S. interests \nand those of our allies. It must not be given to organizations that \nactively work against those interests. Ramas, as it now stands, is just \nsuch an organization.\n  The ball is squarely in Hamas's court. It can either work for the \ngood of its citizens as an accountable democratic government should, or \nit can continue to act as a terrorist organization to the profound \ndetriment of its citizens and the prospects for peace in the region.\n  I close by recognizing the hard work of staff on this legislation. In \nparticular, I thank Bob Lester, Brian McKeon, Puneet Talwar, Paul \nClayman, and Brian Lewis.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I support the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism \nAct of 2006, of which I am the lead cosponsor.\n  The political rise of Hamas presents us with a difficult policy \nchallenge. None of us want to see a penny of American taxpayer money \ngoing to a Hamas-led government that refuses to meet the basic demands \nnot just of the United States, but of the international community, \nincluding the so-called Quartet of the United States, the European \nUnion, Russia and the United Nations. Those demands are that Hamas \nrecognize Israel, renounce violence, and accept past agreements.\n  At the same time, the situation in the Palestinian Territories is an \nexplosive one, with potentially disastrous consequences for the \nPalestinian people, Israel and the entire region. Tensions between \nFatah and Hamas militias have been escalating in recent weeks. 165,000 \nPalestinian Authority employees have not been paid in months. Avoiding \na genuine humanitarian crisis and a descent into a Palestinian civil \nwar will require diplomatic flexibility and sustained American \nengagement.\n  In this sensitive environment, my friend from Kentucky and I have \ntried to find the right balance between isolating Hamas, while \nsimultaneously not doing anything to harm the Palestinian people. So \nlet me say a few words to clarify what our bill does--and does not--do.\n  First, it sends a clear message: the United States will provide no \ndirect assistance to a Hamas-led government unless it meets the three \nconditions--acknowledging Israel's right to exist, renouncing violence \nand accepting past agreements between Israel and the Palestinian \nAuthority. We must not retreat from insisting that these three \nconditions be met.\n  The bill affirms support for a two-state solution to end the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict, something that Hamas rejects. The bill also \nrequires the administration to report on steps it is taking to urge \nother nations to refrain from providing financial assistance to Hamas. \nIn addition, it places restrictions on diplomatic contacts with, and \nmovements by, representatives of Hamas.\n  But in dealing with Hamas, it is important that we keep our strategic \nobjectives clear. While our intention is to pressure Hamas to accept \nthe same terms that bound previous Palestinian governments, it is not \nin the interest of either the United States or Israel to be seen as \npunishing the Palestinian people. It is critically important that in \npressuring Hamas we make it clear to the Palestinian people that it is \nHamas that is failing them, not the international community. We must \nmaintain the moral high ground.\n  That is why our bill allows for assistance to continue to support the \nbasic needs of the Palestinian people. It permits assistance to the \nPalestinians, through non-governmental organizations, for things such \nas food, water, health, medicine, and sanitation, as well as for \ndemocracy promotion, human rights, and education.\n  It also recognizes the important distinction between Palestinian \nPresident Mahmoud Abbas--who has committed to the Road Map and a \nnegotiated two-state solution--and Hamas, by incorporating exemptions \nto support Abbas in fulfilling his duties as President.\n  Lastly, our bill creates an Israeli-Palestinian Peace, Reconciliation \nand Democracy Fund to support organizations that are trying to build \nbridges between the two societies through the promotion of democracy, \ncivil society development and reconciliation between Israelis and \nPalestinians.\n  My friend from Kentucky and I have been able to make important \nchanges to address the most significant issues raised by the \nadministration and the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. \nThese include broadening the President's waiver authority as well as \nnarrowing the focus of the bill to the Hamas-controlled Palestinian \nAuthority. I look forward to continuing to work with the administration \nas the bill moves forward.\n  Mr. President, Hamas has a decision to make. It must respond to \ninternational demands and, even more important, be responsive to the \nPalestinian public which voted for reform, but not poverty, \ninternational isolation and a government that can't pay its own bills \nor keep the lights on. If Hamas ultimately proves unable to provide for \nits own people, it won't be\n\n[[Page S6465]]\n\nbecause of the restrictions in this legislation. It will be because \nHamas is either unable or unwilling to make rational policy decisions \nover destructive terror and xenophobic ideology.\n  Simply put, Hamas must choose between bullets and ballots, between \ndestructive terror and constructive governance. It cannot have it both \nways. The legislation I have sponsored with my colleague, the senior \nSenator from Kentucky, is an attempt to clarify the choices for Hamas \nand to make clear our rejection of a group that is committed to terror.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the McConnell \namendment at the desk be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a \nthird time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statements relating to the measure be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4542) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill (S. 2370) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I wish to make a brief comment on the \nlegislation. I congratulate my colleague, Senator McConnell, for \nleading on this amendment as the primary sponsor of the Palestinian \nAnti-Terrorism Act of 2006.\n  Although all our colleagues have had the opportunity to review and \nexpress their support for this act, very briefly, I would like to at \nleast comment on a couple of things that it does that are very \nimportant to the United States and our international relations.\n  The bill itself states that it shall be U.S. policy ``to support a \npeaceful, two-state solution to end the conflict between Israel and the \nPalestinians in accordance with the Performance-Based Roadmap to a \nPermanent Two-State Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict. . . \n.''\n  It also promotes democracy and the cessation of terrorism and \nincitement in institutions and territories controlled by the \nPalestinian Authority and urges members of the international community \nto avoid contact with and refrain from financially supporting the \nterrorist organization Hamas until it agrees to recognize Israel, \nrenounce violence, disarm, and accept prior agreements, including the \nroadmap.\n  This is a very important piece of legislation, one that has been led \nby Senator McConnell. I know he has made several comments and has \ncomments in the Record on this important bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/23/senate-section/article/S6465-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR MONDAY, JUNE 26, 2006\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
