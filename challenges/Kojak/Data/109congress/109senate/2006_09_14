I encourage all of our colleagues to help the \nmanagers so we can finish that bill sometime in the late afternoon \ntoday. It means not doing our usual thing of trying to talk and spend a \nlot of time and then voting later into the night. We really do want to \nfinish this late this afternoon. Senators are reminded that rollcall \nvotes are likely throughout the day and that the filing deadline for \nsecond-degree amendments is 10 a.m. this morning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/14/senate-section/article/S9577-7", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9577-S9578]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SAFETY AND SECURITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, for this month's session of 4 weeks on the \nfloor of the Senate prior to our recess for the elections, we have \nfocused and will continue to focus on the safety and security of the \nAmerican people.\n  There are a lot of issues that need to be dealt with that we are \ndealing with in committees and in conference, but the focus on the \nfloor very much is the safety and security of families listening right \nnow, and to our colleagues and their families. We know, having seen \nwhat had come close to happening with the events in Great Britain in \nterms of the terrorist attacks and the plot there that was foiled, we \nare at risk in this country. Therefore, it is our obligation to address \nthese issues and to do it in a way where we know we are equipped to \nboth obtain information that can undercut these plots and foil the \nterrorists in whatever activity they are dreaming up.\n  In addition, we have a challenge that is being addressed in committee \ntoday, was addressed in committee in the House yesterday, in terms of \nthe terrorist tribunals and military commissions. It needs to be \nunderstood by my colleagues and the American people that the detainees \nwe have today--the enemy combatants, people who have wished us harm, \npeople who planned the 9/11 attack--until we act in Congress, in this \nSenate, they simply cannot be tried. They cannot be brought to justice. \nThat is where we are today. That is why there is so much appropriate \nfocus on making sure our Government, our military personnel, our \nintelligence officers have the tools they need to keep us safe.\n  So those two issues, the surveillance issue and the military \ncommissions and tribunals, are issues we are addressing, again, in \ncommittee. The President has placed a bill before this body. I \nintroduced it about a week and a half ago. That language is available, \nand I encourage my colleagues to study that.\n  Mr. President, that brings me to the issues of security that I \nmentioned in terms of surveillance, the detainees\n\n[[Page S9578]]\n\nwho are at Guantanamo Bay. Senator McConnell and Senator Specter and I \nactually visited that naval base last week and learned a lot.\n  We have border security we are addressing in the Department of \nDefense appropriations bill that we passed a week and a half ago that \nis in conference and in our Homeland Security appropriations bill, both \nof which aggressively address border security. So we have border \nsecurity. We have port security. We have the military commissions that \nare being addressed for those individuals at Guantanamo Bay. We have \nsupport for our troops in terms of maintaining our security through the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill that is currently in \nconference. And then we have the whole issue of surveillance.\n  Today we are going to finish on port security. We all know--and we \nare reminded by the events surrounding our reminiscences of 9/11 with \nthat fifth anniversary--we are fighting a war against radical \nideologues. These are militant extremists, and they have a single-\nminded goal of destroying our Nation. Increasingly, people are \nrealizing that, but it is taking these reminiscences and the \nremembering of the great tragedy of 9/11, coupled with the reality of \nwhat very well could have happened to hundreds and, indeed, thousands \nof Americans if that plot had not been uncovered by the British.\n  We know the terrorists are not going to stop. And it is not just a \nwar in one part of the world, it is a war against an ideology. They are \nnot going to stop at anything. The enemy is creative. I mentioned the \nattacks that could have emerged out of the plot which was uncovered by \nthe British. Who would have ever deemed imaginable a day when business \ntravelers could not be carrying contact lens solution in their carry-\non. It is because of an attempt with a ``Gatorade'' bomb.\n  The terrorists are always thinking. They are always thinking of how \nthey can stay one step ahead of even what our imagination is. They are \nsearching for our weak points. They are seeking ways to exploit our \nweak points. That is why we have to remain vigilant, and that is why we \nhave to address these issues on the floor. The substance of the bill \nthat is on the floor does just that, the port security bill. That is \nvigilance.\n\n  Nowhere is it clearer to me that we have to be vigilant than at \nAmerica's 300 maritime ports of entry. We talk about border security. \nWell, part of border security is port security. It is a border we have \nto close and appropriately monitor to prevent the terrorists from doing \nus harm.\n  These ports are economic centers. As economic centers, our more than \n300 sea and river ports are targets in and of themselves. For people \nwho want to hurt us, want to hurt our economy, they can become a \ntarget. These ports become even more attractive when they are close to \nurban centers. These ports facilitate the rapid dissemination of cargo \nfrom around the globe to each of our cities and towns. Thus, we know \nthe terrorists, when they want to hurt us, would potentially address \nthese ports.\n  We have done a lot to secure our ports, but the fact remains, they \nare too porous. That brings us back to the importance of this bill. The \nbill before us plugs the holes that exist. It toughens security \nstandards for all cargo. And it strengthens and improves programs \ndesigned to screen cargo at foreign ports and secures the international \nsupply chain from the very start to the very end.\n  Technologies have advanced. We have developed more accurate detection \ntools. But we are not using those tools throughout our system. We are \nnot using them universally. Terrorists have access to stealthier \nweapons, and that is a huge vulnerability just asking to be exploited \nif we do not keep up, if we do not keep pace. That is why we must pass \nthis bill tonight.\n  The bill establishes a risk-based grant program to help assist ports \nwith training personnel and implementing new security standards. The \nmen and women who operate our ports are our first line of defense. We \nhave entrusted these stewards of security with a serious, with a grave \nresponsibility.\n  Accordingly, the bill ensures that the Department of Homeland \nSecurity will move forward with background checks for all port workers \nso we know who is on the ground at these critical facilities. It sets \nup procedures for resuming port operations and trade safely and quickly \nafter a terrorist attack to help minimize any effect or any shock to \nour economy. It establishes the appropriate protocols to ensure that if \na terrorist does strike, our ports are not closed longer than \nnecessary.\n  And importantly, we also need protocols in place so we do not reopen \nports too early. An incident at a port could be a red herring, a \ndistraction to disguise other, more damaging terrorist activities.\n  These are just a few of the highlights of the Port Security \nImprovement Act. At its core, it is a multipronged approach to plugging \nthe holes that exist in port security. It institutionalizes multiple \nand redundant security layers. From the factory of origin to cargo \ncontainer, from cargo container to port warehouse, from port warehouse \nto cargo ship, from cargo ship to the port of calling, and from the \nport of calling to the final destination, at each step this bill \ntoughens our standards. We are making it harder for a terrorist's dirty \nbomb to hide anonymously in a cargo container. We are making it harder \nfor terrorists to tamper with cargo containers. We are making it harder \nfor terrorists to use our ports as target practice. And we are making \nit harder for terrorists to use our ports to stealthily gain access to \nthe rest of our homeland.\n  The terrorists we face have a radical agenda. They are ever-vigilant \nin monitoring and assessing our weaknesses and always looking for new \nways to harm us. We must be ever-vigilant in identifying our weaknesses \nand minimizing and eradicating them. That is what this Port Security \nImprovement Act does. It is my hope my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting it and in passing this important piece of legislation this \nafternoon.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/14/senate-section/article/S9578-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9578]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I said yesterday I am thankful to be part \nof the Republican majority that understands that September 11, 2001, \nchanged the way that we must look at the world. Republicans are \ncommitted to taking action and not just talking about making America \nsafer.\n  We must track, capture, and eliminate our terrorist enemies before \nthey attack us. We must provide the President and our military with \nevery legal tool available to fight this war against Islamic \nextremists, and we must secure our homeland by securing our borders and \nports.\n  Unfortunately, the Democratic Party does not seem to understand the \ntrue threat that we face with Islamic extremists. Instead, Senate \nDemocrats continue to prove that they are dangerously naive about the \ngrave danger of global terrorism.\n  Radical Islamic jihadists have made no secret of their goal, which is \nthe complete subjugation of the world to their extreme form of Islamic \nnationalism.\n  Osama bin Laden said the attacks of 9/11 were ``an unparalleled and \nmagnificent feat of valor'' and ``a great step toward the unity of \nMuslims.''\n\n[[Page S9579]]\n\n  According to the al-Qaida charter:\n\n       There will be continuing enmity until everybody believes in \n     Allah. We will not meet [the enemy] halfway, and there will \n     be no room for dialog with them.\n\n  The Iranian President has called for a world ``without the United \nStates and Zionism,'' saying that the West's ``doomed destiny will be \nannihilation, misfortune, and abjectness,'' and telling other nations \nthat in order to have good relations with Iran, they must ``bow down \nbefore the greatness of the Iranian nation and surrender.''\n  Horrendous attacks in India, Madrid, London, as well as recent \narrests in Canada, Miami, and the foiled London airplane plot have \nshown that terrorists and their state sponsors have the determination \nto back up their rhetoric with action.\n  President Bush and my Republican colleagues have proved that we \nunderstand the nature of the enemy we are facing and that we must be \njust as determined as they are.\n  Let's be clear. Republicans are not the ones fighting to preserve the \nstatus quo. Preserving the status quo is what we did for 8 long years \nunder the Clinton administration--simply responding with a law \nenforcement mindset while Islamic extremists attacked us and built and \nfinanced their worldwide network of terror.\n  Now Democrats would have us return to the Clinton status quo--a pre-\nSeptember 11, head-in-the-sand philosophy of ``don't listen, don't \ntrack, don't challenge.''\n  Republicans understand the world changed on September 11 and that we \nare fighting a dynamic and committed enemy. As we have responded to \nterrorists, they have adjusted their tactics, and we are continually \nevaluating and adapting our strategy to meet this evolving threat.\n  If we don't show the resolve to defeat radical Islamic terrorists in \nAfghanistan, Iraq, and Lebanon, we will never defeat them anywhere. No \none understands the stakes better than the terrorists. That is why \nthere is no in-between choice in Iraq. Either we cut and run and allow \nit to become a safe haven for terrorism and staging grounds for future \nattacks or we stay until victory over the terrorists is achieved and \nIraq is a stable partner in democracy.\n  Republicans have proved that we will do what it takes to secure our \nhomeland from all enemies. We are committed to completing our current \nmission in Iraq and Afghanistan with victory and honor and to create a \nnew generation of freedom and security, of peace and prosperity, for \nAmerica and the world.\n  The unfortunate truth is that when it comes to securing America's \nhomeland, the Democrats are dangerously naive. They think if we pull \nout of Iraq, the terrorists will leave us alone. They have abandoned \nthose in their own party who dare to disagree with the most radical \nliberals of the far left. Democrats, with the help of their misguided \nallies, such as media outlets like the New York Times, have signaled to \nthe terrorists that America is tired, discouraged, and ready to quit, \nencouraging the terrorists to expand their attacks around the world.\n  Not content to simply heckle from the sidelines, Democrats have \nactively fought to block the tools that are critical to stopping future \nattacks. In fact, Senate Democrats united this week in opposition to \nthe terrorist surveillance program, proposing an amendment to the port \nsecurity bill that denounces this program that has saved American \nlives.\n  Just last Thursday, Democrats showed their continued tendency to \nflip-flop when they issued a media statement outlining their latest \nsecurity agenda, pledging to ``work to . . . ensure our intelligence \nagencies have the tools they need to defeat the terrorists.'' Then, 1 \nshort hour later, they again played procedural games to block the \nJudiciary Committee from further consideration of the National Security \nSurveillance Act of 2006.\n  The Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn, got it right when he said:\n\n       It's little wonder that Democrats have a credibility gap \n     with the American people on the issue of national security. \n     Saying one thing [and then] doing another . . . doesn't help \n     our efforts to win this war.\n\n  This week, Senate Democrats continued to prove they are willing to \nput politics ahead of the security and safety of American families by \ntrying to kill the port security bill with partisan amendments.\n  The Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, openly admitted the \nDemocratic strategy of playing politics with national security. \nYesterday, Congress Daily reported Senator Schumer ``conceded Democrats \nwere seeking to score political points'' and quoted my Democratic \ncolleague saying: ``This is politics at its very best.''\n  I believe the American people have a different view of the partisan \ngames the Senate Democrats are playing. I think they believe that this \nis politics at its very worst.\n  If Democrats spent half as much time fighting terrorists as they do \nthis administration, America would win this war a lot faster.\n  Democrats claim to be the ones listening to the American people, but, \nunfortunately, they are just posturing to win an election. Mr. \nPresident, I invite my Democratic colleagues to stop these political \ngames and to join us in helping to win this war on terror and securing \nAmerica's homeland.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to talk about our \nstatus in this fight against Islamic extremism around the world.\n  When the terrorists struck the World Trade Center on September 11, \n2001, America was forced to realize that we were at war. We did not ask \nfor this war. This conflict was brought to us by individuals who \nbelieve that America is evil. This is an enemy that hates us because we \nare a free nation, and our citizens are free to pursue their dreams and \nchart their own destiny.\n  The day the World Trade Center towers fell, our world--or at least \nour comprehension of it--changed forever. Our enemy stepped onto our \nsoil, destroyed our buildings, killed more than 3,000 of our citizens, \nand made clear their intentions. They want nothing less than to cause \nour demise.\n  The world has changed much since that horrific day. Unfortunately, \nthe will to fight extremists who planned and executed September 11, and \nmany other attacks around the globe, has wavered since then. The united \nresolve of many nations has softened dramatically.\n  As Americans, we have no choice but to lead the way with an \nunwavering commitment to this fight. Remember, they asked for this \nfight. They, long ago, declared war on America and the free world and \nlong before September 11 began attacking and killing our citizens.\n  They challenged us many times over the years and received little more \nthan empty rhetoric and a slap on the wrist for such atrocities as \nstriking the USS Cole, the first World Trade Center bombings, \ndestruction of the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia and the Marine \nbarracks in Lebanon; and, of course, they attacked our Embassies in \nAfrica.\n  We were at war, but we didn't even know it. For too long we ignored \nthe words of these terrorists. We attributed their declarations of hate \nas mere rantings of lunatics.\n  Time has shown us that the words of these Islamic extremists must be \ntaken seriously, and we must continue to act decisively to stop them \nfrom achieving their aims.\n  In an effort to steal our collective resolve, it is important to \nremind ourselves just who the enemy really is in this global war \nagainst Islamic fascism. For too long America has seen our enemies \nthrough a prism that casts them in the mold of conventional powers, but \nthe Islamic fascists are a different breed. They fight for no flag, nor\n\n[[Page S9580]]\n\ndo they adhere to any international agreement. They fight outside the \nbox; whereas, our sense of what is right and wrong constrains us to \nadhere to recognized rules of engagement.\n  We all know the self-professed leader of al-Qaida is Osama bin Laden. \nHis call to arms for his disciples is: Death is better than living on \nthis Earth with the unbelievers amongst us.\n  We know Iraq is central to the war on terror because Osama bin Laden \nsaid it is. He said:\n\n       The most serious issue today for the whole world is this \n     third world war that is raging in Iraq.\n\n  Zawahiri, Osama bin Laden's deputy, described Iraq as ``the place for \nthe greatest battle of Islam in this era.''\n  Remember the blind sheikh? He was responsible for the 1993 World \nTrade Center bombing. From his prison cell, he has called on Muslims \neverywhere to ``tear them apart, ruin their economy, instigate against \ntheir corporations, destroy their embassies, attack their interests, \nsink their ships, and shoot down their airplanes; kill them on land, at \nsea, in the air; kill them wherever you find them.''\n  Those were their words, Mr. President. We are at war with an enemy \nthat wants to see America wiped off the map. This is an enemy bent on \ndestruction and Islamic domination--or at least their vision of Islam. \nTheir goal is to establish a violent political utopia across the Middle \nEast--which they call a caliphate--where all would be ruled according \nto their hateful ideology.\n  Osama bin Laden has called the 9/11 attacks, in his words, ``a great \nstep toward the unity of Muslims and establishing the righteous \ncaliphate.'' There are reports that some of Osama bin Laden's \nsupporters believe that he is the Mahdi, the 12th Imam. The Mahdi will \nlead believers in Islam to victory over the infidels, ushering in an \nera of peace and justice.\n  Even Iran's President is on record as instructing America, in his \nwords:\n\n       If you would like to have good relations with the Iranian \n     nation in the future, bow down before the greatness of the \n     Iranian nation and surrender. If you don't accept to do this, \n     the Iranian nation will force you to surrender and bow down.\n\n  Those are the Iranian President's own words. It is not farfetched to \nbelieve that with nuclear weapons in his possession, he would use them \nto usher in this cataclysmic confrontation that he seeks. We must take \nthese threats seriously and act accordingly.\n\n  Remember, the terrorists are traitors to their own faith trying, in \neffect, to hijack Islam itself. The enemy of America is not our many \nMuslim friends; it is not our many Arab friends. Our enemy is a radical \nnetwork of terrorists and every government that supports them.\n  The terrorists' directive commands them to kill Christians and Jews, \nto kill all Americans, and make no distinction among military leaders, \nordinary troops, and civilians, including women and children. They want \nto overthrow existing governments in many Muslim countries such as \nEgypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan. They want to drive Israel out of the \nMiddle East. They want to drive Christians and Jews out of vast regions \nof Asia and Africa. These terrorists kill not merely to end lives but \nto disrupt and end a way of life. With every atrocity, they hope that \nAmerica grows fearful, retreating from the world and forsaking our \nfriends. They stand against us because we stand in their way.\n  We cannot be deceived by their pretenses to piety. We have seen their \nkind before. They are the heirs of all the murderous ideologies of the \n20th century.\n  By sacrificing human life to serve their radical visions, by \nabandoning every value except power, they follow the path of fascism \nand Nazism and totalitarianism. They will follow that path all the way \nto where it ends: In history's unmarked graves of discarded lies.\n  This is not, however, just America's fight. And what is at stake is \nnot just America's freedom. This is the world's fight. This is \ncivilization's fight. This is the fight for all who believe in progress \nand pluralism, tolerance, and freedom.\n  The war we fight today is more than a military conflict; it is the \ndecisive ideological struggle of the 21st century. Make no mistake: \nthis is an enemy we cannot appease; this is an enemy we must defeat.\n  On September 11, 2001, and the days immediately following, this \ncountry stood united. We stood ready to protect all Americans. We must \ncontinue to show a united front against this enemy. We must understand \nthat what we say has great consequences. If our enemy sees the country \ndivided, it will also see an opportunity and a path to victory.\n  During our Civil War, General Lee often read northern papers to gauge \nthe mood of the population in the North. As he saw the political \ndiscourse and the division among northern leaders prior to Gettysburg, \nhe believed that it would take only one more victory to win the war. \nLucky for us, the victory never came, but we can learn from Lee's \nlesson.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 more seconds.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, al-Qaida reads our newspapers and watches \nour television stations. They see the lack of resolve in some of our \nleaders and they seek to exploit it. This is the time to lead, a time \nto unite, and a time to defeat an enemy that wants to bring an end to \nfreedom around the world. We must lay down our party labels as \nRepublicans, Democrats, or Independents and become Americans. We must \nnot tire. We must not falter. We cannot fail.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

But in \nlight of the rantings that went on for the last 30 minutes in the \nChamber from my two colleagues on the other side, I would like to state \nfor the Record that America is not tired of fighting terrorism. America \nis tired of the wrong-headed and bone-headed leadership of the \nRepublican Party that has sent $6.5 billion a month to Iraq, when the \nfront line was Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. America is tired of \nleadership which led this country to attack Saddam Hussein when we were \nattacked by Osama bin Laden, and which captured a man who did not \nattack the country and left loose a man who did.\n  Americans are tired of bone-headed Republican leadership that \nalienates our allies when we need them the most.

They are the ones who are in charge, and Osama \nbin Laden is still loose.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/14/senate-section/article/S9580-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9580-S9581]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RECOGNIZING LOUISIANA'S MADISON PARISH SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, now I will speak about what I came to \nthe floor to speak about. We have had a very difficult time in \nLouisiana and Mississippi and the gulf coast this year, in part because \nour resources are short because our country is involved in so many \nother things, and I can appreciate and understand the dilemmas. But we \nstill have a great effort underway to rebuild Louisiana, Mississippi, \nand the gulf coast. So we have been moving steadily ahead in fits and \nstarts because, of course, this was an unprecedented disaster. And \nwhile it really wasn't a natural disaster for Louisiana, it was a \nmanmade disaster because our city went under water and the region, \ncounties in Mississippi and parishes in Louisiana--for instance, one of \nour parishes, not New Orleans which we have heard a lot about, but St. \nBernard Parish which sits right outside of New Orleans, 75,000 people \nlive there, and every home was destroyed and every church was ruined\n\n[[Page S9581]]\n\nand every business was destroyed. They were ruined not just because of \nthe storms and the hurricanes which come and there is nothing much we \ncan do to stop them, but because the levees broke which the Federal \nGovernment is supposed to maintain, and because of spending money in \nother places and not protecting people in their homes.\n  So as my colleagues know, we had water 15 feet high that stood for up \nto 6 to 8 and sometimes 10 weeks in some places. Our communities have \nbeen struggling with how we might better approach the recovery should \nsomething--and I see my colleague from Seattle, WA--should a tsunami \nhit Seattle, which is a major, very important American city, or should \na category 5 storm hit Long Island like it did in 1938 when only a few \nhundred thousand people lived there but now millions of people do. We \nneed to do a better job of responding. So Congress has been involved in \nthat for this last year, and I predict will be involved in it for many \nyears to come until we get it right.\n  But one of the things that we did get right is that the northern \nparishes of Louisiana came to the aid of those from the southern \nparishes, and one of those parishes that I am here to speak briefly \nabout is Madison Parish. It is a small parish up in the northeastern \npart of our State, and it is a poor parish. It has great natural \nresources and very vibrant and vital agricultural land, but it is quite \npoor, generally. It is a district with only 3,000 students in school. \nBut as the people fled from south Louisiana and south Mississippi and \nsoutheastern Texas to flee from the rising water of the storms, many of \nthem found their way to Madison Parish.\n  Madison Parish superintendent Michael Johnson led this effort to \nabsorb several hundred students into a very small school system that \nwas already overburdened. The storm didn't, of course, hit Madison \nParish directly but, of course, indirectly they were impacted by some \nhigh winds that made it up to north Louisiana, and were mostly impacted \nby students and families who ran there for shelter. There were many \nshelters put up. Superintendent Johnson, as many superintendents in \nnorth Louisiana, reached out their hands and, without a lot of help, \nwithout any textbooks, without a lot of information about how this was \nsupposed to happen, took the children in. Not only did children find a \nsafe place in Madison Parish school systems to attend school because \ntheir schools in south Louisiana were ruined, but with all of this, \nMadison Parish was one of the parishes that improved their test scores \nsubstantially on the last LEAP test given in Louisiana. Not only did \ntheir scores improve, but students and educators in Madison Parish at \nthe same time were welcoming evacuated children with open arms.\n  Madison Parish is not the only parish that saw a substantial rise in \ntest scores this year. Beauregard Parish has also done well. We are \nvery proud of all of our school systems that did better in a very \ndifficult year, but most certainly we are proud of those small, poor, \nrural school systems that, with good leadership, are making substantial \nprogress.\n  We don't talk enough about education on the floor of the Senate, in \nmy view, and we don't often at all talk about the small areas of our \ncountry that are making extraordinary progress in less populated areas. \nWe talk a lot about New York and Chicago and Los Angeles, but we don't \nalways get to hear about small places that are not even recognizable \nsometimes to many people on the map. But since I visited Madison Parish \nrecently and had a great tour of north Louisiana, I thought I would \ntake a minute to come and praise publicly this particular \nsuperintendent and to call attention to many of our superintendents \nwho, despite the fact that we keep cutting their Federal funding, are \nmanaging to meet these high standards and to lift their children up and \nto make their school system and others better for the future of our \nStates and our region.\n  Superintendent Johnson has been the impetuous for Madison Parish's \nrecent success. Interestingly, Superintendent Johnson was working as \nsuperintendent of schools for New York City's District 29 when \nterrorists attacked the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. \nSuperintendent Johnson took over in August before Hurricanes Katrina \nand Rita hit and proceeded with the same positive energy he embodied in \nNew York. The Madison Parish School District now has improved their \nLEAP test scores by reducing the percentage of students scoring \nUnsatisfactory and increased the percentage of students scoring Basic \nand above. They have also reduced suspensions at the elementary and \nmiddle school levels.\n  Not only have their scores improved, but the students and educators \nof Madison Parish have welcomed the evacuated children with open arms. \nUnder Superintendent Johnson's leadership, they used their resources to \nprovide the children lunch, buy clothes, books and other necessary \nitems. They provided increased after school programs so these students \nwould spend less time in shelters and have some sense of normalcy. The \nstudents and staff helped the displaced children and teachers begin to \nreplace their personal possessions and helped them work through their \nfeelings in the crisis. This was something that Superintendent Johnson \nunderstood very well from his experiences in New York and added to his \nsuccess in caring for the children taken in after Hurricanes Katrina \nand Rita by Madison Parish.\n  As students come back into southern Louisiana and begin the new \nschool year, I would like to recognize how beautifully our students \nwere welcomed into schools systems like Madison Parish. Superintendent \nJohnson and his community are an example of the best in our society--\nthe generosity and compassion that is found in the hearts of our \npeople. I also want all of us to look to the Madison Parish School \nSystem and to Superintendent Michael Johnson as an example of how a low \nperforming school can, not only turn their scores around, but offer \nhelp to those students who are less fortunate.\n  Thank you to all students, teachers, principals and superintendents \nwho have taken that extra step and worked harder, improved their test \nscores and opened their arms and hearts to those who were affected by \nthe storms. We should all live by this example. In closing, I would \nlike to express my gratitude to the Madison Parish schools system and \nto Superintendent Michael Johnson for taking education seriously and \nimproving their test scores while providing a safe, healthy learning \nenvironment for all children.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/14/senate-section/article/S9581-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9581-S9582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING ANN RICHARDS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise this morning on a very sad note \nfor all of us who knew a very special, wonderful woman by the name of \nGovernor Ann Richards. Last night she left this world, but she left \nbehind a tremendous spirit that many of us will carry on. She was the \nkind of woman who could walk into a room and light it up, no matter \nwhere she was. She was a Governor of Texas, and I know that State knew \nand loved her well, but the rest of the country also loved her.\n  I was privileged to know this wonderful, compassionate human being. \nShe made me laugh, she made me think, and she made me remember what I \ncared most about in this country. Her loss is a tragic one certainly \nfor the State of Texas, certainly for the country, but absolutely for \nevery one of us who knew her.\n  I know many people will be speaking throughout the next several days \nabout the loss of Governor Richards, but I just wanted, on behalf of so \nmany of us who cared for her so much, to express our condolences to all \nof her family, to her friends, to everyone who knew her, and to let \nthem know that we will not forget and we will continue to carry her \nmessage of hope and passion as we continue in our lives.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, how much time do the Democrats have \nremaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 10 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 4 \nminutes of that time, if I could.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to \nadd to Senator Murray's heartfelt and beautiful tribute to Governor Ann\n\n[[Page S9582]]\n\nRichards. Many of us woke up this morning to read the newspaper and \nwere stunned by the news that Governor Richards had passed away.\n  Many of us, of course, knew of her illness and that she struggled \nwith it and fought it bravely, but I am not sure how many understood \nhow close she was to death's door.\n  As a neighbor of hers who grew up right over the border from Texas, \nand as a young woman in the legislature, Ann Richards was at the top of \nthe list of women I looked to early in my career. I did not have too \nmany women to look to because there were just not that many women in \npublic office in this country in 1976, the year when Governor Richards \nstarted her political career as Travis County Commissioner. There were \n604 women in state legislatures nationwide. Not only was she an \noutstanding leader but she was an extraordinary administrator. I \nremember her days as State treasurer of Texas and followed many of her \nguidelines to leadership in trying to manage the budget of Texas. I \nfollowed that lead in trying to manage the budget of Louisiana. She \nshowed that women could not only hold county commissioner seats, but \nhigh-level executive offices, managing finances and money. She become \nGovernor of one of the largest States in America and served with \nextraordinary ability.\n  But more than just her service to the public at large, which was \ntremendous to the State of Texas and the country, Ann Richards \nencouraged women to think of things that had never been thought of \nbefore that women could to serve in corporate board rooms and as \nGovernors and, hopefully, one day as President of the United States. \nAnd today, thanks to women like her, 1,686 women serve in state \nlegislatures across the country. Without women such as Ann Richards, \nthose dreams would never materialize or would be decades away.\n  There was a quote in the paper that I chuckled at because Governor \nRichards said once she didn't want to be remembered for keeping a clean \nhouse. She thought that women should be remembered for things greater \nthan just how well they could vacuum how well they could cook or how \nwell they could do things associated with the home.\n  While I do not in any way diminish the contribution that we make as \nwives and as mothers or diminish any of the things that we do inside of \nour homes that keep our families happy and keep our society going, I \nwant to say emphatically that I agree with her. I hope women who are \nborn and grow up today really think about what they want their \ntombstone to say.\n  Ann was always that kind of woman. She was born not only to be all a \nwoman could be, but all a person could be, all a leader could be. Very \nfew women in the generations that I am familiar with have accomplished \nthat as well as she did. It is with great sadness that we recognize her \npassing, and I am sure there will be a more formal recognition in the \nSenate Chamber among men and women remembering the contributions this \nextraordinary American made to our country, to the world, to women and \ngirls everywhere.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu).

Under the previous order, there will be 1 hour \nfor debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank my colleagues for yielding.\n  Mr. President, earlier this week we all commemorated the fifth \nanniversary of 9/11. Much of that day was spent here and around the \ncountry discussing whether after 5 years we are safer and whether we \nare safe enough. While we have made real progress with respect to the \nsecurity of our nuclear powerplants, with respect to airport security, \nfar too little has been done to secure our Nation's seaports, railways, \ntransit systems and, I might add, hundreds of chemical plants around \nthis country.\n  After 9/11 we also recognized the need to protect our seaports. In \n2002 we passed the Maritime Transportation Security Act, which was the \nstart of developing a national and regional maritime security plan or \nplans. This legislation also required the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to help ports develop individual security plans and directed \nCustoms and Border Protection to design a system for receiving \ninformation on ships' cargoes before they docked at a U.S. port.\n  Now, 4 years later, we are finally taking the next step. Still, port \nsecurity has never received the same level of attention as airport \nsecurity, and part of this is because 9/11 tragically exposed the \nvulnerabilities of our ports and it has been burned into our memories. \nI think it is also because most Americans do not have any direct \ninteraction with a seaport on a daily basis, a weekly basis, a monthly \nbasis or, in some cases, ever. However, a growing number of Americans \nhave begun to recognize what an appealing target our seaports can be \nfor terrorists.\n\n  First of all, many ports, including the ones we have in my State and \nthe States of New Hampshire, Maine, and Washington, are located in or \nnear densely populated urban areas. Also, ports are vital to the \neconomy of our country. They are used by farmers to try to get their \nproducts to market and also industry to export products, but also we \nimport everything from chemicals to oil and gas. As a result, many of \nus have concluded we must place a higher priority on addressing any \nvulnerability at our ports before any terrorist attack takes advantage \nof them. I applaud the work of Senator Collins and the great work \nSenator Lieberman has done with her helping to craft this, and also the \nstaffs and Senator Murray and her staff.\n  The American Association of Port Authorities believes that to do so \nwill require roughly $400 million a year for physical enhancements for \nports in this country. The bill before us would authorize Congress to \ndo just that.\n  Now, $400 million is a lot of money, but it is significantly cheaper, \nI think we will agree, than responding to a devastating attack after \nthe fact. My port, the Port of Wilmington, has received about $2 \nmillion since 9/11. The State has provided a fair amount of money, as \nhas our port authority. These funds have been used, in part, to\n\n[[Page S9583]]\n\nhelp build a gated entrance with cameras, with security checks, and to \nfence and light the port's perimeter.\n  While we are grateful to receive Federal support for these important \nsecurity measures, our port, like many others, will require additional \nassistance. Some of that we should provide ourselves within our State. \nFor some of that we look to the Federal Government for help. Obviously \nthere is not enough funding for everyone to get everything they need. \nHowever, ports in Oklahoma, ports in Kansas, ports in Tennessee and \nKentucky have all received port security grants over the years, as have \nports along the eastern and western gulf coast. At the same time, the \nPort of Wilmington--I am told it is the busiest port on the Delaware \nRiver and the port of entry for much of our Nation's food supply, \nespecially for the east coast--has been forced to make do with less. \nTherefore, I am pleased this bill requires the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to conduct a risk analysis of our Nation's seaports and \nestablish a priority for security funding.\n  The Port of Wilmington also participated in something called a \nTransportation Security Administration pilot program, a program \ndesigned to screen port workers and block individuals with a terrorist \nconnection from accessing sensitive areas at our ports. This pilot \nprogram was supposed to be the first step toward establishing a \nnational program, with identification cards and equipment that could \nread biometric information, such as fingerprints and retinal patterns. \nBut the Department of Homeland Security ended this pilot program before \nthe national screening and identification system was ready. The \nnational system was supposed to be implemented by last summer, but it \nhas yet to occur. The implementation date, I am sorry to say, continues \nto slip. Now we are being told the ports will receive official \nidentification cards by the end of this year, but the essential card \nreaders will not be ready until sometime next year. That doesn't make a \nlot of sense.\n  This program is moving forward far too slowly, and that is why I \noffered an amendment, when the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee debated port security, to require the Department of \nHomeland Security to issue its regulations on the worker screening \nprogram not next year but by the end of this year. The bill before us \ntoday takes a slightly different approach but still addresses the need \nto get this important program up and running as soon as possible. Under \nthe Port Security Improvement Act, this bill, the Department of \nHomeland Security would be required to fully implement the worker \ncredentialing program at 10 ports by next summer and at all ports by \nJanuary 1, 2009.\n  Let me conclude by saying that this week we have also passed rail and \ntransit security amendments, something that is long overdue. I strongly \nsupport them. After the train bombing in Madrid 2 years ago and the \nLondon Underground attacks last summer, many of us hoped we would take \nsteps to prevent a similar kind of attack here. But to date, the \nFederal Government has done far too little to address transit and rail \nsecurity needs in this country. In fact, rail and transit security \nreceived less than 3 percent of the funding that has been dedicated \nthus far to airport security.\n  I want to be honest with you. Protecting our rail and transit lines \nwill not be an easy task. Almost 10 billion transit trips were taken in \n2004, and transit accommodates more than 16 times the number of daily \ntravelers than do our Nation's airlines--16 times. There are more and \nmore people using rail transit every day so they can avoid traffic and \nhigh gasoline prices. Also, it is much more difficult to protect an \nopen system such as the ones at bus stops and train stations than it is \nto guard the closed systems we have at airports. You cannot physically \ncheck every bag that is brought onto a commuter train or ID every \nperson who boards a bus, nor do I believe we ought to. The rail transit \nsystems can only work if they are fluid. I believe long lines of people \ntaking off their shoes to get on a train or bus would render them \nlargely unworkable.\n\n  As much as anything, though, what we need to do in order to reduce \nthe likelihood of a debilitating attack on our transit and rail systems \nis to improve surveillance, more security officers, use of canines, and \nheavy reliance on the use of new technologies. This requires strong \nleadership, vision, and enthusiasm for attacking the unique challenges \nof securing rail and transit.\n  It also requires effective partnerships. The Federal Government needs \nto be one of those principal partners. So far, the Department of \nHomeland Security has only shown a strong appetite for preventing the \nsort of attack that led to its creation. The White House proposes \nlumping together all nonaviation security into one competitive grant \nprogram, with less than 15 percent of the funding proposed for aircraft \nsecurity. That is less than 15 percent for all of them--transit, ports, \nrail, and so forth.\n  Further, the tiny sums that have been appropriated for rail security \nhave been very slow to move. Last year, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity took 9 months just to start sending appropriated funds to \nState and local transit authorities. I realize they can't turn the \nspigot on overnight, but 9 months? We can do better than that, and we \nneed to. Rail and transit security should not be controversial issues. \nWe know we need to upgrade the emergency exits and surveillance \nequipment at train stations. Further, we need to hire more police \nofficers, we need to train and deploy more bomb-sniffing dogs, and we \nhave to develop more sophisticated equipment that would allow us to \ndetect threats without unduly slowing commute times. It will require \nsmart people, a strong focus, and good leadership. That is why we must \npass rail security legislation that lays out a national approach and \nframework.\n  While I am very happy we adopted the rail and transit security \namendment to this bill, I simply cannot understand why this legislation \nhas been so difficult to get passed and signed into law. What is \ncontroversial about hiring bomb-sniffing dogs or improving \nsurveillance? Nothing. The threat has simply not been taken seriously.\n  How much more time do I have, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 45 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. CARPER. I hope this casual approach to a dangerous threat ends \nwith the adoption of the rail and security amendments this week. I \nstrongly support their passage and urge our leadership to fight to \nmaintain them in the bill with the amendments we send to the President.\n  In conclusion, it has been 5 years since 9/11; 5 years of hearing \nthat we need to take threats seriously and realize we live in a \ndangerous world. It is time we act on those words and protect the \nmillions of Americans who rely on rail and transit every day, and on \nour ports, just as this legislation would better protect our ports and \nthe communities around them in the years ahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield my time.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are in a time where we have equally \ndivided time, and I am going to give 5 minutes to the Senator from \nArkansas off of our time and ask unanimous consent that any quorum \ncalls that occur from here on are equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Arkansas is recognized for 5 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4959\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the managers of this legislation. \nThey have done a fantastic job in getting us to where we are today. \nAlso, I thank Senator Talent of Missouri, who has been my cosponsor on \nthe amendment I wish to visit with you about, very briefly, today.\n  Port Security remains a major vulnerability for this country, and \ntied to port security is trucking security.\n  The 9/11 Commission identified foreign trucking entities entering the \nUnited States as a top homeland security concern. The DOT inspector \ngeneral has recommended that various security enhancements to the \ntrucking\n\n[[Page S9584]]\n\nsecurity provisions in this bill be made. This goes back to 2004, but \nthey have largely been ignored since that time.\n  If you look at the reality of the situation in which we find \nourselves today, we have NAFTA, where NAFTA allows foreign trucks to \ncome into the United States within 25 miles of the U.S. border. They \ncan pass between Mexico and Canada. But what we have found in reality \nis that, although most are playing by the rules, and that is good, \nthere are some truckdrivers and trucking companies violating the \nprovisions of U.S. law by delivering goods and picking up goods far \noutside the scope of where they are supposed to do it.\n  Trucking is very important to this country. It may not be very \nexciting to some people, but it is very important to this country \nbecause 70 percent of our Nation's cargo is carried by truck.\n  It is also important to homeland security because trucks have been \nused in terrorist attacks in years past. What Senator Talent and I are \ntrying to do with our amendment--and the managers have graciously \nagreed to accept it in the managers' package--is to direct the \nDepartment of Transportation and the Department of Homeland Security to \nfirst verify legal status of all licensed commercial truck drivers \noperating in the United States. Right now there are about 11 million of \nthose, and there are about 40,000 new ones every month.\n  First, we have to verify legal status.\n  Second, we eliminate commercial driver's license fraud. Of course, we \nknow that it is not perfect. We will probably not eliminate every \nsingle incident of that, but we are going to make a very serious stab \nat eliminating as much as possible.\n  Third--this is very important--we give State governments and local \nlaw enforcement uniform guidelines and tools for enforcing immigration \nviolations by truckers who are operating beyond the scope of their \nauthority.\n  This is something that we have seen in Arkansas--I am sure that \nSenator Talent has seen it in Missouri--and all around the country. \nPeople on the ground down in the trenches, local law enforcement--in \nour case, it is the highway police--don't have any clear direction on \nwhat they can do if they find someone who is driving illegally under \nthese circumstances.\n  We do all this and give them 1 year to comply with this amendment.\n  We are basically taking areas that have been identified by the 9/11 \nCommission or by the DOT inspector general, and we are holding DOT's \nand DHS's feet to the fire to make sure they do the right thing when it \ncomes to immigration and homeland security.\n  It is a win-win-win across the board. It is good for the United \nStates economy, it is good for our trucking industry, and it is good \nfor United States security and homeland security. It will reward the \ngood guys and punish the bad guys.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Arkansas for \nhis involvement on this issue. He is a terrific member of the Homeland \nSecurity Committee. I appreciate his many contributions.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n          Amendments Nos. 5016, 5017, 5018, and 5001, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send three amendments to the desk for \nmyself, Senator Grassley and Senator Snowe.\n  There is a Wyden amendment, No. 5001, at the desk.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, if the Senator will withhold for 1 minute \nuntil we have a chance to see what those are. I don't have the package \nin front of me.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Wyden amendment is on the definition \nof change, my amendment pertains to anchor handling, the Snowe \namendment is with regard to a conveyance extension, and the Grassley \namendment is with regard to technical corrections.\n  These were erroneously left out of the managers' package which we \nprocessed last evening.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these four amendments be considered as \nadditions to the managers' package, that they be considered en bloc and \nagreed to en bloc, and the motions to lay on the table be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendments were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5016\n\n (Purpose: To provide a phased and temporary anchor movement exception \n                              for Alaska)\n\n     SEC. ------.

Is there further debate on the amendments? If \nnot, without objection, the amendments, as modified, are agreed to en \nbloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 4923, as modified, and 4986, as modified) were \nagreed to.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, very shortly we will be voting on cloture \non the Port Security Act. I urge my colleagues to support the cloture \nmotion. We hope to be able to complete action on this bill by 5 o'clock \nthis afternoon. We are working toward that goal.\n  Senator Murray and I are happy to talk to our colleagues, but we will \nbe moving through the amendments at a very rapid pace after cloture is \ninvoked, as I hope it will be. We have made great progress on this \nbill. It is\n\n[[Page S9586]]\n\nan important bill for our homeland security, and I urge all of our \ncolleagues to support the cloture motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are about to vote on cloture on a very \nimportant maritime cargo security bill. This is a bill that will have a \nsignificant impact on the Nation's security, as it is implemented. A \nnumber of people have been working on the floor for the last several \ndays to work our way through amendments. I think a lot of progress has \nbeen made, and I am very pleased with the number of improvements that \nhave been made to this bill over the last several days.\n  When this bill is finally passed out of the Senate and conferenced \nwith the House, which I hope will occur shortly, and signed by the \nPresident, we can all say that in a bipartisan way we have \nsignificantly made a difference in the lives of all Americans.\n  In a moment we will be voting on cloture. That means this bill is \nvery close to the end. We have a few amendments we are going to be \ndealing with, but both the Republican leader and the Democratic leader \nhave been clear they want this bill finished by early afternoon. That \nmeans if any of our colleagues on our side have an amendment they need \nto have discussed, they need to talk with us during this cloture vote \nor their amendment will not be considered. So I urge anybody on my side \nwho has an amendment out there, an issue that needs to be dealt with, \nto talk with us during this coming cloture vote.\n  Mr. President, with that, I urge my colleagues on my side to vote for \ncloture and to move this very important piece of legislation forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, be allowed to speak for 10 minutes as \nin morning business immediately after the cloture vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would not object. If the Senator could \nwithhold for just 1 minute to let me check on my side.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I would be happy to withhold.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would ask the Senator from Maine to \nmodify her request so that following the 10 minutes for the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania that Senator Baucus be allowed to the speak for 10 \nminutes on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so modify her unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I so modify my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on H.R. \n4954, the Security and Accountability for Every Port Act, shall be \nbrought to a close? The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

On this vote, the yeas are 98, the nays are 0. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the \naffirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Authority for Committees to meet\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I have 10 unanimous consent requests for \ncommittees to meet. They have the approval of the leaders. I ask \nunanimous consent that these requests be agreed to and printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would make an inquiry. I inquire of the \ndistinguished majority leader if the Senate Armed Services Committee \ncould be added to that list and, therefore, be able to continue our \nhearing.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, right on top of the 10 requests is the \nunanimous consent request that the Armed Services Committee be \nauthorized to meet during the session.\n  For the information of our colleagues, there had been an objection \nearlier today. I talked to the appropriate Members and that was readily \nagreed to. So the Armed Services Committee will be able to meet \naccordingly any time today.\n  Again, for the information of our colleagues, I ask the chairman of \nthat committee to indicate what time they will resume the meeting.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished leader. With the \nconcurrence of the distinguished ranking member, Mr. Levin, we have \nagreed to resume in open session a markup in the Armed Services \nCommittee in Hart 216 at 2:15.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. To make sure that the Record is clear, there has never \nbeen and has not been any objection--I am sure the majority leader \nwould concur--any objection from this side at any time to the Armed \nServices Committee meeting today.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. That is well known to \nthis Senator--that the Senator from Michigan and that side of the aisle \nhas been totally cooperative in having a markup.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I believe I have consent to speak for 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                         Terrorist Surveillance\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nbriefly about two subjects: One, the legislation providing for judicial \nreview for the President's terrorist surveillance program; and, second, \nwhat we are going\n\n[[Page S9587]]\n\nto do to comply with Hamdan v. Rumsfeld.\n  The Judiciary Committee reported out three bills yesterday. S. 2453, \nwhich is my bill, provides that the surveillance program will be \nsubmitted to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. There is no \ndoubt that the President's program violates the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, which purports to be exclusive. But if there is \nconstitutional authority under Article 2, that constitutional authority \ntrumps the act. The only way there can be a determination on that is to \nhave a court weigh the seriousness of the threat as opposed to the \ninvasion on privacy.\n  This legislation, S. 2453, does not authorize the President's \nprogram, contrary to the assertions of many people. What it does is \nsubject the President's program to judicial review. It does not mandate \nreview because, understandably, the President does not want to curtail \nhis institutional authority.\n  What I have sought to accomplish is to have this program reviewed; \nand the President has made a commitment, confirmed by the White House, \nthat this program will be submitted for judicial review.\n  There has been a contention raised that there is an inconsistency \nbetween Senator Feinstein's bill, S. 3001, and my bill, S. 2453, and it \nis not true. The provision in Senator Feinstein's bill says that the \nFISA is the exclusive means for wiretapping. That is true, unless the \nstatute is superseded by a constitutional provision.\n  My bill, S. 2453, says that nothing in the act limits the President's \nconstitutional authority, because a statute cannot limit the \nPresident's constitutional authority.\n  We will be moving ahead, I hope shortly, with the leader calling the \nbill to the floor so that we can make a determination on judicial \nreview to see to it that whatever wiretapping is going on is judicially \napproved. It may be that some cases will come up collaterally. There \nare a number of cases in district courts. The one in Portland may have \nstanding. I do not propose, in my legislation, to strip any court of \njurisdiction where a case has been started and has proceeded. I think, \nin the course of business, the matters ought to be referred to the FISA \ncourt, but not for any jurisdiction stripping where courts have \nproceeded.\n  With respect to the activities of the Congress seeking to comply with \nthe ruling of the Supreme Court of the United States in Hamdan v. \nRumsfeld, the primary responsibility goes to the Armed Services \nCommittee. The Judiciary Committee does have jurisdiction because title \n18 of the Criminal Code is implicated and we have jurisdiction over the \ninterpretation of the Geneva Conventions.\n  There have been a number of controversial issues raised on which I \nwould like to comment. One provision relates to classified information. \nIt is my view that it is indispensable to have witnesses confront their \naccusers and know what the evidence is. Common Article 3 of the Geneva \nConventions provides that there has to be an affording of all judicial \nguarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized people. I \nthink that would include telling somebody what the evidence is before \nthey have a significant penalty which might include the death penalty.\n  We have a Confidential Information Protection Act which sets the \nguidelines that I think ought to be applicable here. The consequence \nis, if you cannot produce the evidence for the defendant to hear, the \ncase may have to be dismissed. But that will not prejudice the \ngovernment here because these individuals can be detained as enemy \ncombatants for an indefinite period of time.\n  So we will not disclose sources and methods; we will not release \nanybody; we may not convict them if we can't produce the evidence, but \nthey will be detained and not present a threat.\n  There is an issue raised as to coerced confessions. I do not believe \nthat we can tolerate that and be consistent with United States law or \nconsistent with the Geneva Conventions. Coerced confessions are unfair \nand they are unreliable.\n  With respect to Common Article 3, the Judiciary Committee has \nsubmitted for consideration and inclusion in the legislation being \nconsidered by the Armed Services Committee amendments to section 303 on \nwar crimes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, with respect to the controversy about \nwhether there ought to be included the provisions of the Detainee \nTreatment Act, I believe that they should be because they further \ndelineate what would constitute a violation of Common Article 3. But I \ndo not believe they ought to be exclusive or foreclose other \nconsiderations under Common Article 3. In addition to the specification \nof the crimes under the War Crimes Act, which I have submitted, it \nwould be useful to have the provisions of the Detainee Treatment Act \nincluded, which are the fifth amendment, the eighth amendment and the \n14th amendment, where there has been considerable judicial \ninterpretation as to what are prohibited acts.\n  General Hayden, Director of the CIA, thinks that is necessary in \norder to be able to give comprehensive advice.\n  I personally do not know that the interrogation has to go beyond what \nis in the Army Field Manual. In a visit to Guantanamo, the chief \ninterrogator handling some 32 interrogators and thousands of \ninterrogations thinks that the Army Field Manual is sufficient. It may \nor may not be. The CIA wants greater latitude, but there is some \nassurance of congressional oversight because the interrogation tactics \nhave to be submitted to the Intelligence Committee. One other point \nthat I want to comment on is my concern about the inclusion of habeas \ncorpus relief. I believe that it is important to retain jurisdiction of \nthe Federal courts on habeas corpus. This was a contested issue under \nthe Detainee Treatment Act, but we have seen that the only real firm \nguidance has come from the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  In three cases regarding detainees from June of 2005, Jose Padilla, \nHamdi, and the Hamdan v. Rumsfeld decision, the Congress has been \nunwilling or unable to act. I introduced legislation for military \ncommissions shortly after September 11 as did other Senators. We didn't \nact. We punted to the Supreme Court.\n  These issues, regrettably, experience has shown, are just too hot to \nhandle by the Congress. The Supreme Court of the United States under \nthe rule of law has enforced compliance of detainees, and now \ncompliance for those who are to be tried for war crimes under the \nGeneva Conventions' terms as well as under title 18.\n  It is simply insufficient to limit the great rift which seems \nembodied in our habeas corpus statute.\n  I have had some discussion with Senator Levin, who is on the floor at \nthe present time, about offering an amendment if in fact the bill comes \nfrom the Armed Services cutting out habeas corpus.\n  It is my hope that we can move reasonably promptly to S. 2453 so that \nthere may be set in motion the procedures to have the Federal courts \nrule on the constitutionality of the President's electronic \nsurveillance program.\n  It would be highly desirable to bring the entire program under the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act. There are provisions in Senator \nFeinstein's bill, S. 3001, which I have cosponsored, that I believe \nwould enable us to bring individual live warrants for causes which \noriginated in the United States and go overseas.\n  I have been advised that the calls which originate overseas are so \nnumerous that it is not possible to have individual live warrants. So \nthat under these circumstances the most that can be accomplished is to \nhave the program submitted to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nCourt.\n  In one of the four hearings on this bill, four former judges of the \nFISA Court appeared and testified and commented that the bill was \npractical, that there was sufficient standing, that there were \nlitigable issues and that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \ncan handle it. They can handle it as a matter of expertise because of \ntheir extensive experience, and they can handle it because their \nproceedings are closed so that there is not a public disclosure of \nstate secrets.\n\n[[Page S9588]]\n\n  It may be, as I said very briefly earlier, that one of the cases \ncoming out of Federal courts--there has been a decision from Detroit, \nand there is a case pending in San Francisco--my review of those cases \nsuggests to me that the case which is coming out of Portland I think \nwould have standing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairperson of \nthe Homeland Security Committee for yielding me the time. I yield the \nfloor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n     SEC. 303. WAR CRIMES ACT AMENDMENT.\n\n       Section 2441 of title 18, United States Code is amended by \n     replacing subsection (c)(3) with the following:\n       ``(3) which constitutes any of the following serious \n     violations of common Article 3 of the international \n     conventions signed at Geneva 12 August 1949, when committed \n     in the context of and in association with an armed conflict \n     not of an international character:\n       ``(1) Torture.--Any person who commits, or conspires or \n     attempts to commit, an act specifically intended to inflict \n     severe physical or mental pain or suffering (other than pain \n     or suffering incidental to lawful sanctions) upon another \n     person within his custody or physical control for the purpose \n     of obtaining information or a confession, punishment, \n     intimidation, coercion, or any reason based on discrimination \n     of any kind, shall be guilty of a violation of this \n     subsection. `Severe mental pain or suffering' has the meaning \n     provided in 18 U.S.C. 2340(2).\n       ``(2) Cruel or inhuman treatment.--Any person who commits, \n     or conspires or attempts to commit, an act intended to \n     inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering (other \n     than pain or suffering incidental to lawful sanctions), \n     including severe physical abuse, upon another person within \n     his custody or physical control shall be guilty of a \n     violation of this subsection. `Severe mental pain or \n     suffering' has the meaning provided in 18 U.S.C. 2340(2).\n       ``(3) Performing biological experiments.--Any person who \n     subjects, or conspires or attempts to subject, one or more \n     persons within his custody or physical control to biological \n     experiments without a legitimate medical purpose and in so \n     doing endangers the body or health of such person or persons \n     shall be guilty of a violation of this subsection.\n       ``(4) Murder.--Any person who intentionally kills, or \n     conspires or attempts to kill, or kills whether intentionally \n     or unintentionally in the course of committing any other \n     offense under this section, one or more persons taking no \n     active part in the hostilities, including those placed out of \n     active combat by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other \n     cause, shall be guilty of a violation of this subsection.

Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMontana is recognized for 10 minutes.\n\n\n                           Extenders Package\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, yesterday I tried to get the Senate to \npass a bill extending the 2005 expired tax provisions, what we call the \nextenders package. The majority leader objected at that time and stated \nthat it was his desire that the extenders continue to be part of the \nso-called ``trifecta'' package, married with estate tax relief and a \nminimum wage increase. I told him yesterday of my concern that since \nthat strategy has already failed a number of times, and I don't think \nthere is much hope of any change, and it is time to let the popular tax \nextenders package pass.\n  I want to take the leader at his word that there is hope for change. \nBut I also read comments yesterday by one of our Senate colleagues \ntasked by the majority leader to try to find a solution to all of this, \nand that Member of that so-called task force is quoted as saying, ``My \ncounsel is to do it in the lame duck session.''\n  I very much oppose that. I don't think it makes any sense to push all \nof this in a lame duck. Let me tell you why.\n  Last week, I asked the IRS Commissioner at a hearing of the Finance \nCommittee what the drop-dead date was for tax extenders. By drop-dead \ndate, I mean what is the latest date by which the IRS can receive \nchanges to tax law and still have time to print and distribute tax \nforms for the 2006 tax year. He told me October 15. That is the drop-\ndead date. Clearly, that is after the recess and that is why this \nstrategy makes no sense.\n  It makes no sense because after that date, it is very difficult for \nthe IRS to print up the forms and, more than that, a lot of mistakes \nwill be made.\n  Yesterday, I joined my good friend, the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, in releasing an analysis of just how the IRS will deal with \nall of these changes. Let me tell you what they concluded.\n  Senator Grassley said upon releasing this analysis that, ``A delay of \nlegislative action beyond the anticipated recess date of September 29 \nwill cause hardship, tax compliance problems, and\n\n[[Page S9589]]\n\nconfusion for the millions of taxpayers who claim these widely-\napplicable tax benefits.''\n  It is just a mess that we need not cause.\n  I also add that Senator Grassley's counterpart in the House, the \nchairman of Ways and Means Committee, said, ``My job is to be \nresponsible to the taxpayers, not a bureaucracy to make its job \neasier.''\n  I might also add that we are here to get the extenders passed for the \ntaxpayers, to help taxpayers because taxpayers need this relief.\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee went on to say that, ``The \nfailure to extend expired tax cuts will at best cause administrative \nsnafus for the IRS and at worst cause taxpayers to miss out on the tax \nbenefits they are entitled to.''\n  This is a taxpayer problem--one that we should address now before we \nrecess.\n  I would also like to point out something else which I think is \nimportant. A resolution was passed yesterday by the House Republican \nStudy Committee. They surveyed their members, and developed a list of \nfive priorities. One of these priorities adopted by the 110-member \ngroup in the House Republican Study Committee was to ``pass a clean tax \ncut extenders bill.''\n  I would guess that group would be invested as much anyone else in \npassing the so-called trifecta bill, but even the 110 members in the \nother body have decided it is time to move on and pass the extenders.\n  There are more than 3 million teachers who have been buying classroom \nsupplies who are waiting for their deduction to be restored. There are \nmore than 12 million families in States with sales taxes, including \nmany in the leader's home State of Tennessee, hoping they can deduct \nthose sales taxes, just like families in income tax States. And there \nare more than 20,000 businesses hoping for this worker credit, that \nhave hired the hard-to-employ workers who have been on long-term public \nassistance, people who simply want to get back into the workplace, and \nneed a boost from the work opportunity credit. Those taxpayers are \nhoping the Senate gets this passed.\n\n  Just this morning I received a letter signed by more than 600 \nAmerican companies and 164 trade associations representing thousands of \nsmall, medium, and large companies employing high-tech workers in \nresearch. They urged us to end this ``cloud of uncertainty.'' They are \nvery concerned we are not going to pass this in time.\n  As I have said a couple of times, there are companies that have to \nrestate their financials because of Congress's failure to pass these \ntax incentives which expired last year. It has not been the law for \nabout 9 months, and they have to start restating their earnings on \nfinancial reports because of Congress's ineptitude, Congress's \nincompetence in not passing and continuing the research and development \ntax credit, teachers deduction, tuition deduction, and sales tax \ndeduction.\n  School started just a short while ago. There are teachers who go to \nWal-Mart to get supplies for their classroom because the school \ndistrict is not providing enough to them. We should be giving them a \ntax deduction. School started and we are not giving it to them anymore. \nIt makes no sense. It is wrong. It shows the competency of this \nCongress in doing its business is now very much in question.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I am happy to yield.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I compliment and applaud the leadership \nof Senator Baucus in working to get the retired tax incentives renewed.\n  Did I hear the Senator correctly, the welfare-to-work and work \nopportunity tax credits expired at the end of 2005? Is it true that \nthese credits have expired and we in Washington have yet to renew them, \nand 20,000 businesses have not been able to use this important tool?\n  We are here to provide tools to businesses to grow the economy, to \ngrow the jobs. I know the good Senator from Montana traveled his State, \nas I did in Arkansas, in August. People are concerned about the \neconomy. They are concerned about their jobs.\n  We are talking 20,000 businesses? Did I hear the Senator correctly?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator is correct. That is the number that use this \nwork opportunity tax credit. We are trying to employ people. People are \ntrying to get to work.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. That is amazing. The objective is to get people off \nwelfare, get them independent and into the jobs.\n  I think I heard the Senator correctly, as well, because we failed to \nrenew the teacher expense deductions, more than 3 million \nschoolteachers nationwide--and there are a tremendous amount of \nArkansas schoolteachers who give out of their own pockets to bring \nthose supplies in their classrooms--those teachers are going to be \npaying higher taxes this year if we don't act now?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If we do not enact this legislation and make it \nretroactive this year.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, we have had numerous opportunities to \nrenew important tax incentives. Earlier this year we had an opportunity \nin the tax reconciliation. The priority was to deal with tax cuts that \nhad not even expired or were not going to expire--the dividend \ndeduction and the capital gains.\n  With tax cuts that have expired, businesses are not going to be able \nto take advantage of work opportunity tax credits, in research and \ndevelopment. We know we are falling behind in stem cell research. We \nhave businesses that want to make those investments in research and \ndevelopment and be the best they can be in the global marketplace.\n  These businesses have not been able, is that correct, to realize that \ntool and use that tax deduction for at least the first three quarters \nof this year?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is right, at a time when other countries give very \ngenerous assistance to their companies in developing research and \ndevelopment so those countries can compete in the global economy.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Once again, I applaud Senator Baucus's leadership and \nhis tenacity to come out and say we have a limited amount of time left.\n  We have businesses out there that want to grow, that need the tools \nto grow. Yet these issues, things that we do every year to put into the \ntoolboxes of our business, corporate America, our teachers, and others \nto be able to do the incredible things that make America great. Yet we \nare just sitting here. We are not doing it. They are being held hostage \nbecause we want to put all these eggs into one basket.\n  I have been very outspoken about my support for the estate tax \nreform, but there is no reason these extenders should be held hostage \nto all of these other things that people want to crowd into one basket.\n  The bottom line is, by failing to renew these incentives, as Senator \nBaucus has said, for responsible behavior such as savings and getting a \ncollege education, we are raising the taxes on many of our hard-working \nAmerican families this year.\n  I applaud the Senator and I appreciate and am grateful for the \nleadership.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. And the answer to the Senator's implied question is, yes, \nall of that will occur if we do not get this passed. That is correct.\n  I see another colleague on the Senate floor who may have a question \nto ask.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 2 additional \nminutes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am compelled to object because we have \nanother Senator coming over shortly for an amendment. I have promised \nthe Senator from Nebraska and the Senator from Montana that they would \nhave a few minutes to talk about their amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I say to my good friend, we are talking about 2 minutes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. It will come out of the time of the Senator from \nNebraska because we have the Senator from New York coming at 12:45 for \nhis amendment. I have no objection with that understanding--that it \nwill come out of the time of the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I think the Senator has a question to ask.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the \ncommittee and appreciate very much his leadership.\n\n[[Page S9590]]\n\n  I rise to state I support what Senator Baucus has proposed. It \naffects a number of Nebraska teachers, Nebraska families. I appreciate \nwhat the Senator is doing.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nDurbin, Wyden, Biden, Lautenberg, Nelson of Nebraska, Conrad, Sarbanes, \nLeahy, and Byrd be made cosponsors of my amendments Nos. 5003 and 5004.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I do not object.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Now I proceed----\n  Ms. COLLINS. To the objectionable part.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. On the part of some.\n\n\n                  Unanimous-Consent Request--H.R. 4096\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nCalendar No. 326, H.R. 4096; that the Senate adopt my amendments Nos. \n5003 and 5004, which is the agreed-upon tax extenders package, the bill \nbe read the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, the Senate return to the port security bill--which is \nnot objected to--and all this occur without intervening action.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I object. The \nleader objected yesterday. This is the same issue. He has asked I make \nthis objection known.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, at this point I suggest time be yielded \nto the Senator from Nebraska and the Senator from Montana to briefly \ndiscuss a pending amendment of the Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4945\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I appreciate the distinguished \nchairman from Maine. I ask my colleagues, Senators Burns and Craig, who \njoin with me--Senator Burns is here--I ask unanimous consent that my \namendment No. 4945 be in order notwithstanding rule XXII. I know there \nwill be an objection to it, but I also know that Senator Burns would \nlike to speak to it if possible, before the objection is entered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, a point of order does lie against this \namendment because it is not germane postcloture.\n  Prior to objecting to the Senator's unanimous consent request, I am \nhappy to withhold so that the Senator from Montana may address this \nissue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am very supportive of the Senator from \nNebraska on this issue. I wish we could have gotten a vote and not have \nto deal with a point of order. I don't think the fires we have had in \nMontana and the dry weather we have had in Montana yield to a point of \norder. We do have people hurting.\n  I appreciate the work done by the Senator from Nebraska. We will \ncontinue this exercise, passing an emergency disaster package for \nagriculture before we go home. I appreciate him allowing me some time.\n  I pass along to the Senate and Montanans we are having a drought. In \nfact, our water is only testing 85 percent moisture.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I do object to the request of the Senator \nfrom Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I am very sympathetic to the concerns of both Senators \nbut, unfortunately, this does not belong on the port security bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent it be in order to make the \nfollowing point of order, en bloc. I make a point of order that the \nfollowing amendments are not germane postcloture: amendment No. 4967, \noffered by Senator Stabenow; amendment No. 4957, offered by Senator \nClinton; amendment No. 4943, offered by Senator Clinton; and amendment \nNo. 4958, offered by Senator Clinton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct, the point of order is \nsustained, and the amendments fall, en bloc.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I further make a point of order that \namendment No. 4945, offered by the Senator from Nebraska, as modified, \nis also not germane postcloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4930, as Modified\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise in support of an amendment that is \npending. It will be voted on at 3:30, as I understand.\n  The amendment is very simple. It mandates--no test study, no pilot--\nit mandates we inspect all cargo that comes here for nuclear weapons \nwithin 4 years.\n  I have offered this amendment, frankly, out of frustration. This is \nsomething that can be done. This is something that is being done. This \nis something where the technology is working. Yet we refuse to move \nforward.\n  I come from New York. Obviously, we lived through September 11. \nHowever, I stay up at night sometimes worried about the worst tragedy \nthat could befall us. There is nothing worse, in my opinion--and there \nare a parade of ``horribles'' with the terrorists--than a nuclear \nweapon exploding in America. It would change our lives so dramatically \nfor so long for those who survive. If we were ever going to focus on a \nsingle issue, this should be it.\n  But for 4 years I have come to the Senate--my good friend from \nMinnesota has done very good work on this, my colleague from Maine has, \nmy colleague from Washington has.\n  They say: We are not ready. Let's do a pilot. Let's study it. Let's \nimprove the technology.\n  My colleagues, what has changed with me is that I visited the Hong \nKong Port run by Hutchison Whampoa last April, along with the Presiding \nOfficer. And we saw it working in two lines. Trucks went through--it \ndid not hold them up--and they were inspected for nuclear weapons in a \nsystem that everyone who has looked at it says works.\n\n  So what are we waiting for? The cost is not large. It is estimated, \nonce it is up and running, the cost would be about $8 a container. Yet \nit costs $2,000 to move a container from Hong Kong to the West Coast. \nIt works. The cost is reasonable. We are not asking the Federal \nGovernment to pay for it. In a competitive container world, it probably \nwill not even be passed on. That minimal .2 percent addition to the \ncost of a container will probably not be added on.\n  So now is the time, my colleagues. We can have another excuse and \nwait another year and do another pilot, work more on the security and \non the technology, or we can implement something now. The Homeland \nSecurity Department, in my opinion, is derelict in this responsibility. \nThey have dithered and dallied. Every time we have offered amendments \nto put an adequate amount of money in to fund this, it has been cut by \nthis body and by the other body.\n  The frustration, when we know we can really protect the people of \nthis country and we let special interests, we let the fact that we need \nmoney for something else--although I do not know what else is more \nimportant--stand in our way. It is a monument to why people are \nfrustrated with Washington.\n  Again, you and I have seen it, I say to the Presiding Officer. We \nhave seen this technology at work. Hutchison Whampoa stands by it. \nTheir leader was so frustrated that he implemented it himself in Hong \nKong. And everyone who has studied it says it works. Would it take a \nlittle while for all these foreign ports, the 40 ports of the CSI, to \nset this up? Yes, but not very long. And when you compare this to the \ndanger we face, all of the arguments against mandating that our \ncontainers be inspected for nuclear weapons fade away.\n  Mr. President, I salute my colleagues who have offered other \namendments. I salute my colleagues who have worked on the bill. It is a \ngood step forward. But there is a glaring deficiency. We need a \nmandate. We have been patient long enough. It works. It can protect us. \nIt is not expensive. What are we waiting for?\n  I urge my colleagues, I hope, I pray we can have a broad bipartisan \nmajority for this amendment because--coming from New York, I feel this \nkeenly--we do not want to be in the ``what if'' situation. God forbid, \nthe worst has happened, a nuclear weapon has been\n\n[[Page S9591]]\n\nsmuggled in on a container and exploded on our shores. We do not want \nto be in a situation where we say: What if What if we had done more. \nBecause clearly, as of now, we are not doing enough.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I share the deep concerns of my friend, \nhigh school classmate, colleague from New York, where I grew up, about \nthe danger of a nuclear weapon, the danger of a weapon of mass \ndestruction being smuggled into this country in 1 of 11 million \ncontainers. We have, no doubt, the same vision. We want America safe.\n  That is what we have been doing here. That is what the work of the \nSenator from Maine and the Senator from Washington is about and what we \nhave put forth in the underlying bill that will change.\n  By the way, there were a lot of things in homeland security that I \nwas frustrated with.\n  We spent 3 years, the Permanent Committee on Investigations spent 3 \nyears on this issue, studying it, holding hearings. I encourage my \ncolleague from New York to go to Hong Kong to take a look. My colleague \nand the Presider Officer went to Hong Kong and took a look at the \nsystem that is operating on 2 lanes out of 40 to see what we could do \nto put in place a system that would scan each and every container that \ngoes through. It is a wonderful system.\n  What we need is action. That is what we did yesterday. We got action. \nWe have in this bill a pilot project that will put in place, in \nmandates, in directives, not a mandate of what is going to happen in \n2008 and 2010, not playing into the sloganeering of ``scan every \ncontainer,'' but the reality of action today to immediately put in \nplace a pilot project to see if we can make it work in a wider, more \nsystematic way.\n  I am taken aback when I hear my colleague talk about ``we do not need \nany pilot projects'' and ``we do not need any test study.'' We have a \nsystem in place in Hong Kong now that is 2 lanes out of 40. It is a \nwonderful system. What happens is--I call it kind of a moving CAT \nscan--trucks come in and they kind of go through this device, ISIS \ndevice, and it takes a scan of what is inside the truck. It has a \nradiation portal monitor, so you end up getting images. I have watched \nthe images. Hong Kong is a CSI--Container Security Initiative--port, so \nI have worked with our folks there. But when a radiation alarm goes off \nin Hong Kong, our folks do not have the capacity to inspect it. There \nis no followup from us. The images that are received are not processed \nby the folks in Langley or somewhere else. They are not coordinated \nwith what we do on national security. So you have in place a concept \nwhere we have to see whether it works. That is what we should be doing: \naction. That is what this is about.\n  It was fascinating; I was reading an editorial in the New York Times \nand was somewhat taken aback. I am trying to understand the motivation \nfor moving forward with this amendment. This is what I call a wave-the-\nmagic-wand amendment, that we are going to tell people we are mandating \nsomething we have already got on the table in front of us, something to \ntest whether it works. That is what we should be doing.\n  I think, by the way, people in this country are frustrated with \nWashington when we promise things or sloganeer about something as \nimportant as this issue and somehow project the sense we are doing \nsomething when we are not doing anything, when there is already action \nin place--action, action--a pilot project and then a mandate that the \nDepartment, in 120 days, tells us: OK, what are the results. Show us \nhow you have integrated this system which is now working in two lanes \nin Hong Kong--not integrated into anything in our operation--show us \nthat it works, and then requiring the Secretary of Homeland Security, \nevery 6 months, to come back to Congress and report on the status of \n100 percent scanning, with specific criteria laid out. That is good \ngovernment. That is good policy. In the end, I hope it is good \npolitics.\n\n  I worry that this is about politics. There was an editorial, I have \nto say, in the New York Times, I believe today, and I was somewhat \ntaken aback. It criticized Secretary Chertoff. That is OK. The Times \ncan do that. I have criticized him on a number of occasions. But then \nthe editorial talks about this issue of 100 percent scanning and then \nraised this issue of the cost of scanning--it is a small surcharge--and \nthen it goes on to say: When it comes to homeland security, the Bush \nadministration has completely allowed corporate profits to trump \nsafety--as if somehow, because the cost of this is $20 per container, \nthat is why we are not moving forward mandating it today.\n  I want to step back. The way I became aware of the Hong Kong project \nwas because of the private sector that said: Senator, you have to see \nthis. We are willing to pay it. The cost is not an issue. The private \nsector is willing to pay $20 a container to ensure security. God forbid \nthere is a nuclear device that goes off, we shut down the entire import \nof goods into this country, and we devastate our economy. So this is \nnot a money issue from the private side. This is maybe the old ex-mayor \nin me saying: This is kind of the practicality of making sure we have \nsomething that works.\n  The Washington Post, in an editorial in June, said it very clearly:\n\n       ``[I]nspect 100 percent of containers'' is a slogan, not a \n     solution, and we hope lawmakers resist the temptation to use \n     it in the election season to come.\n\n  The election season is upon us. It is getting very close. This body, \nyesterday, moved forth with an amendment to put in place a pragmatic, \nrealistic action-oriented way in which we can move to 100 percent \nscreening. We put in place a pilot project to make sure what we are \ndoing works and it makes sense.\n  We will spend, by the way, billions on this, not in the cost of the \ncargo but in setting these scanning systems up in the, what, over 700 \nports throughout the world. And 147 are major ports. We are going to be \nspending a lot of money on this, but the issue is not money, it is \ndoing it right. Let us step away from the sloganeering.\n  I am going to say this as to the idea of something being half-baked. \nIf you put something in the oven and it is going to be really tasty \nwhen it is done, it is going to be really delicious, that is something \nfully baked. And you make sure it is baked in a way so when you eat it, \nyou do not get sick. Half-baked is when you get something in the end \nthat is the right thing--we believe, in the end, each and every \ncontainer will be screened.\n  Right now, we have in place the screening of high risk. It is in this \nbill. Right now, we have the Department saying, before our Homeland \nSecurity Committee, by the end of next year, each and every container \nwill be screened for a radiologic or nuclear weapon--by next year. But \nit will be done in our country. The goal is to have it pushed out, to \nhave that screening done before it gets here. We do not need a half-\nbaked way, a sloganeering way, and to simply say we are going to \nmandate something in the future, without any path to get there. We have \nthe path. We have done it right. I hope my colleagues reject the \nSchumer amendment and stick with what we did yesterday because it \nreally makes sense.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for \nhis leadership on this issue and for his excellent comments. This issue \nwas debated at length yesterday, so I am going to make my comments very \nbrief.\n  I do oppose Senator Schumer's amendment. I do not think it is \npractical at this point to require 100 percent scanning of 11 million \ncontainers coming into this country. And it ignores the very real \nimprovements that are included in the underlying bill.\n  I am disappointed to hear the Senator from New York describe our bill \nas yet another study or yet another pilot project. It is way more than \nthat. It has a layered security system that greatly strengthens the \nContainer Security Initiative, the C-TPAT Program, the automated \ntargeting system. And it includes the provisions we added yesterday at \nthe behest of the Senator from Minnesota that will help us move toward \n100 percent scanning when it is\n\n[[Page S9592]]\n\nfeasible and practical, when the technology is there and able to be in \nan integrated system.\n  It also ignores the fact that our bill includes a mandate--a mandate, \nI would say to the Senator from New York--that the Department of \nHomeland Security has to install radiological monitors in the 22 \nbusiest ports by the end of next year, which will result in 98 percent \nof all cargo being screened for radiation, and addresses the issue the \nSenator has raised about a nuclear bomb or the makings of a dirty bomb.\n  So this bill does a great deal. I must say, it disappoints me to hear \nthe Senator imply that it does not, even though we disagree on this one \nparticular issue. This has been a bipartisan bill. Senator Murray has \nworked very hard on it, as well as many of the rest of us.\n  But let me sum up the problems by reading from a recent letter from \nthe World Shipping Council because I think it really says it best. I \nask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       World Shipping Council,\n\n                                                September 7, 2006.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Homeland Security & Government \n         Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Chairman: We understand that the Senate is \n     expected to consider shortly legislation to enhance cargo and \n     port security. We write to communicate the World Shipping \n     Council's support for legislation that will enhance the \n     security of both American ports and the international supply \n     chain. Previously, the House of Representatives passed the \n     SAFE Port Act (H.R. 4954). We hope that the Senate \n     legislation will reflect in part this House bill, will \n     further strengthen cargo and port security, and will enable \n     this enhanced security legislation to become law this year.\n       During debate on this port security legislation, we \n     understand that there may be an amendment which would propose \n     to require 100% container inspection. Earlier this year, the \n     House voted down a similar measure in its debate over the \n     SAFE Port Act. Like the House, we urge you to vote No on any \n     such amendment for the following reasons.\n       One-hundred percent container inspection proposals purport \n     to be a cheap and effective way to ensure security. They are \n     neither. It also fails to address fundamentally important \n     security questions, it would disrupt American commerce, and \n     it would cause foreign retaliation against American exports.\n       American commerce would be ground to a halt because there \n     is no practical way to analyze or inspect the scanning images \n     before vessel loading because it is too labor intensive and \n     no technology currently exists to do the analysis, the \n     proposal faces a dilemma that it clearly fails to address. \n     Assuming the proponents intend that every container's \n     scanning images must be inspected and approved before vessel \n     loading, the costs of compliance and costs of gridlocked \n     commerce would be enormous. It changes who the government \n     trusts to perform container screening without a hearing, a \n     pilot program, or a rational deliberative process.\n       The proposal would effectively end Customs' Trade \n     Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT), without so much as a \n     hearing on the issue. This amendment rejects the strategic \n     concept that there is low risk cargo that does not require \n     inspection, and in doing so, it rejects many U.S. and \n     international governmental efforts to create programs that \n     reward supply chain participants for enhancing the \n     security of their supply chains by inspecting their cargo \n     less frequently. The proposal also undermines the \n     Container Security Initiative (CSI), as CSI is an \n     international cooperative program pursuant to which other \n     governments have agreed to work with the U.S. government \n     to review and inspect containers that are determined to \n     present a security risk, not to inspect every container.\n       Lastly, the proposal will harm American exporters. The U.S. \n     applies virtually no radiation screening and no inspection to \n     its exports. The amendment proposes that the rest of the \n     world must subject their exports to processes and procedures \n     that the U.S. does not apply to its own commerce. Congress \n     should expect the United States' trading partners to consider \n     imposing reciprocal requirements on U.S. cargo should these \n     proposals be enacted.\n       The SAFE Port Act established a rational and deliberative \n     process to study and evaluate the deployment of such \n     container inspection technology abroad and all the relevant \n     implementation issues associated with such systems. Senate \n     legislation that mirrors this approach is the correct way to \n     address this important issue.\n       In conclusion, we look forward to working with you on the \n     important issues of cargo and port security. And, we request \n     that you oppose any 100% container inspection amendment.\n           Sincerely yours,\n\n                                          Christopher L. Koch,\n\n                                                  President & CEO.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. The letter reads, in part, as follows:\n\n       One-hundred percent container inspection proposals purport \n     to be a cheap and effective way to ensure security. They are \n     neither. It also fails to address fundamentally important \n     security questions, it would disrupt American commerce, and \n     it would cause foreign retaliation against American exports. \n     . . .\n       The proposal would effectively end Customs' Trade \n     Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT), without so much as a \n     hearing on the issue. This amendment rejects the strategic \n     concept that there is low risk cargo that does not require \n     inspection, and in doing so, it rejects many U.S. and \n     international governmental efforts to create programs that \n     reward supply chain participants for enhancing the security \n     of their supply chains by inspecting their cargo less \n     frequently.\n\n  It also undermines the Container Security Initiative. That is the \ninternational cooperative program where we station our inspectors in \nforeign ports and work with the governments that host those ports.\n  There are so many arguments against this amendment, Mr. President. \nThe Washington Post said it very well in an editorial earlier this week \nas well. Most of all, let us remember what the implications are.\n  I have visited the port in Seattle and have seen the VACIS machines \nthat do the x rays. It took approximately 4 minutes to do that x ray of \nthe container and then another 15 minutes to analyze the image. If you \ndo that with even the completely low-risk cargo, and you think of the \nfact that we have 11 million containers coming into this country, you \nare diverting resources away from inspections of high-risk cargo. It \nwould create a massive backlog of cargo at our ports.\n  Now, as I have indicated, the technology is improving. I am glad the \nSenator from Minnesota set the record straight on what is and what \nisn't being done in Hong Kong at this time, where only two lanes are \nbeing scanned and the images are not being read and integrated into a \nsecurity system. But we are going to keep improving the technology. We \nhave a requirement that the Secretary report on this issue to us every \n6 months after the pilot project in three foreign ports--after we have \nthe results.\n  So we are moving in that direction, but let's do so in a practical, \neffective, efficient way. That is what the underlying bill does, \nparticularly as strengthened by the Coleman-Collins-Stevens amendment.\n  Mr. President, we have tried very hard in this bill to make sure that \nwe strike the right balance and put into place a security regime that \nis going to make our ports and our people safer. But we have done it \nwithout hampering the vital trade that manufacturers, retailers, and \nfarmers in this Nation depend upon. I think we struck the right \nbalance, and I am going to move to table the Schumer amendment, with \nthe time of the vote to be determined at a mutually agreed upon time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I want to briefly answer my colleagues. \nOf course, I have tremendous respect for what they have done and are \ntrying to do. It is certainly true that my colleague from Minnesota was \nthe first to talk about the system in Hong Kong.\n  I will make two points. First, it is true that we will put mandates \nhere in the United States. We have them in New York in one of our \nports. One, it is not close to being as sophisticated, effective, or as \nspeedy as what is done in Hong Kong. It is not as good a system. \nSecond, we don't have to debate the technicality of the system. We all \nknow, as my friend from Minnesota said, that we have to push this \noutward, because if a nuclear weapon is on a container or a ship in New \nYork Harbor that hasn't docked or been unloaded onto a truck and it \nexplodes, the same terrible consequences exist for the people of New \nYork, Los Angeles, Seattle, or anywhere else that has a major port.\n  I will make one other point. My colleagues argue for patience. My \ncolleagues argue we have to do this in a certain way. If this were 1 \nyear after 9/11, or 2 years after 9/11, I would agree. In fact, I did. \nI wanted to offer amendments like this 2, 3, and 4 years ago. But I \nbelieve this. I believe nothing\n\n[[Page S9593]]\n\nwill get homeland security and the shipping industry and the world \ncommunity to act and get something done better than a mandate. As long \nas they know they can delay, as long as they can go to DHS and present \n10 reasons why this should not be done, DHS, which has shown absolutely \nno enthusiasm for doing this, will get nothing done.\n  If this were danger No. 37 on the list, maybe, again, we should not \nhave the tough measure--I would say it is tough--of imposing this. I \nassure my colleagues--we all know how the world works--a deadline will \nget DHS, the shipping industry, and all of the other players to act and \nget this done better than any other method.\n  So, again, I salute what my colleagues have done, and I remind my \ncolleague from Maine that I have said this is a good bill. In fact, I \nvoted for cloture, despite the urging of some of my colleagues, because \nI think it is a good bill. On the issue of nuclear security, of \ninspection of containers for radiological material, no one can say that \nwe have done a good job--not this Senate, not the House and, most of \nall, not this administration and the Department of Homeland Security.\n  The time is now to force everybody to act. The danger is too great. I \nhave offered this amendment after years--not months, not days, but \nyears--of trying all of the other ways to get homeland security and, \nfrankly, our two bodies to act. So I am grateful to my three \ncolleagues, all of whom have done yeomen's work in this area. But we \ncan do more. I suggest to all of my colleagues here that this amendment \nwill get us to do a lot more than any other amendment proposed thus \nfar.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I reiterate the great respect I have for \nmy colleague from New York. He is concerned about this area and he is \npassionate about safety.\n  I want to make it clear that we are not counseling patience. We are \nnot asking for delay. It is just the opposite. What we are doing and \nwhat we have done and what we did yesterday was action. What we are \nobjecting to is an amendment that offers no real increase in security. \nWe are objecting to an amendment that doesn't do anything, doesn't move \nthe ball forward. It gives an opportunity to talk about 100 percent \nscanning, and it may end up in some commercial somewhere. I hope that \nis not what this is about.\n  The amendment doesn't do anything. It doesn't push the ball forward. \nThis is not about patience. I am not very patient when it comes to \nmaking sure we are doing everything possible to protect against the \npossibility of a nuclear weapon being smuggled into this country, and \nthat is what this bill does.\n  The amendment is to put in place a pilot project, move quickly; that \nis what it does. The amendment is to require 100 percent screening of \nall high-risk containers. That is what it does. We heard in committee \nthe other day from the Secretary of Homeland Security, saying we can \nhave 100 percent screening of all cargo containers for radiological \ndevices by next year.\n  We are not counseling patience. We are supporting action and \nobjecting to an amendment that offers no increase in safety. It doesn't \nmove the ball forward at all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I will move to table the Schumer \namendment, with the understanding that the time for a vote will be at a \nmutually agreed-upon time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The minority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. What is the matter before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment before the Senate is the \nSchumer amendment.\n  The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last Friday the Senate Committee on \nIntelligence released a bipartisan report that discussed Iraq's links \nto terrorism and the use of information provided by the Iraqi National \nCongress. These reports provided the American people with important \ninsights into these critical issues.\n  Unfortunately, the administration chose to redact--that is a word \nused around here meaning to black out--important portions of these \nreports that a bipartisan majority of the Intelligence Committee \nbelieves could have and should have been released to the American \npeople.\n  Last night, I handed a letter to the distinguished majority leader \ninforming him of my intent to offer an amendment to declassify one of \nthese sections.\n  I will, at an appropriate time, ask unanimous consent that I have the \npending amendment set aside to offer my amendment. I am not going to do \nthat right now.\n  I do ask unanimous consent that a copy of my letter to Senator Frist \nbe printed in the Record.\n       There being no objection, the material was ordered to be \n     printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 13, 2006.\n     Hon. William H. Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leader Frist: Late last week the Senate Select \n     Committee on Intelligence on ``a bipartisan basis released \n     reports that discussed Iraq's weapons of mass destruction \n     program and its links to terrorism and the intelligence \n     community's use of information provided by the Iraqi National \n     Congress. These reports provided the American people with \n     important insights into these critical issues.\n       Unfortunately, the Administration chose to classify certain \n     important portions of these reports that should have been \n     released to the public. A bipartisan majority of the \n     Intelligence Committee disagreed with the Administration's \n     decision to classify certain portions of the report's \n     findings and conclusions and said that classifying this \n     information is ``without justification.''\n       In my view, the Administration's decision to classify one \n     particular portion of the report--a section discussing a CIA \n     document about the alleged meeting in Prague between 9/11 \n     hijacker Mohammed Atta and an Iraqi intelligence officer--is \n     especially troubling and lacking in justification. As you may \n     know, as recently as this Sunday on national television, Vice \n     President Cheney left open the possibility that such a \n     meeting may have occurred. However, a bipartisan majority of \n     the Intelligence Committee, after thoroughly reviewing \n     relevant intelligence reports and assessments, concluded ``no \n     such meeting occurred.'' The continued classification of \n     sections referencing this meeting only serves to prevent the \n     American public from knowing the full facts about this \n     matter.\n       The classified version of the Intelligence Committee's \n     report, including the sections dealing with the alleged Atta \n     meeting, are available for all Senators to review in the \n     Committee's offices in room SH-211. I urge you to join with \n     me to encourage all members to review his text so they \n     understand its importance and why that text can and should be \n     made available to the American people.\n       In light of the importance of this issue, I also think it \n     is important that the Senate act to declassify those portions \n     of the text on pages 96, 97, and 98 of the Intelligence \n     Committee's report that are currently redacted but do not \n     involve sources and methods.\n       I plan to offer an amendment on that subject to the \n     legislation currently pending in the Senate. Notwithstanding \n     the procedural situation on the floor, I hope you will join \n     with me to offer this important amendment, permit the Senate \n     to act on it, and support its swift adoption.\n       While I understand that S. Res. 400 spells out a process \n     for the Senate to declassify information, that process is a \n     lengthy one that is likely to take us well beyond your \n     announced adjournment date for the U.S. Senate. Therefore, in \n     light of the importance of this issue, I think it is \n     appropriate that the Senate act expeditiously to declassify \n     this material.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Harry Reid,\n                                                      U.S. Senate.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, again, before I get to the need for this \namendment, let me be clear. This is about good government. It has \nnothing to do with politics. I notified the distinguished majority \nleader of my intentions to speak this afternoon, well in advance--not \ntoday; I advised him yesterday--so the majority leader--indeed, every \nMember of the Senate--knows this is not a partisan effort but, rather, \na serious effort to ensure the Senate fulfills its responsibilities to \nthe American people.\n  I sincerely hope that the majority leader has had time to think about \nthis important amendment and will join with me today to get it agreed \nto.\n  The fact is, the White House was wrong to classify portions of the \nphase II report, as both Republicans and Democrats on the Intelligence \nCommittee have said.\n  This chart states as follows:\n\n       The committee disagrees, however, with the Intelligence \n     Community's decision to classify certain portions of the \n     report's findings and conclusions . . . the Committee \n     concludes that the Intelligence Community's\n\n[[Page S9594]]\n\n     decision to classify this information is without \n     justification.\n\n  This was made public last Friday from the report.\n  For the record, this is not my conclusion. This is not a Democratic \nconclusion. This is a bipartisan conclusion of the Republican-led \nSenate Intelligence Committee.\n  Again, here is what they said:\n\n       The Committee disagrees, however, with the Intelligence \n     Community's decision to classify certain portions of the \n     report's findings and conclusions . . . the committee \n     concludes that the Intelligence Community's decision to \n     classify this information is without justification.\n\n  A majority of the Republicans and Democrats in the Intelligence \nCommittee came together and concluded that the administration's \ndecision to keep information from the American people was without \njustification.\n  We talk about redaction. It is a word we use more often than I would \nthink we should, but we are using it here today. I will show everyone \nin this chart what a redaction looks like. Here is the information I \nhad in a letter to the majority leader where I said everyone should go \nupstairs and look at what these redacted sentences say.\n  This is not just any redaction. Although, obviously, I cannot discuss \nthe specific content of this, the Intelligence Committee's report does \ncontain some publicly available information that I can discuss.\n  According to unclassified sections of the committee's report, this \nsection contains information from a CIA document about the alleged \nmeeting in Prague between September 11 hijacker Mohammed Atta and an \nIraqi intelligence officer. That is from page 135 of the report on \nterrorism, page 174 of the Democratic additional views.\n  As we all know, the alleged meeting referenced here was an important \npart of this administration's case for going to war. To this day, the \nmeeting continues to be used by the administration officials to justify \nwhy we are still engaged in a war in Iraq. Obviously, this is an \nimportant piece of information as we assess how we got where we are \ntoday in Iraq and what we need to do to go forward in Iraq.\n  For all my colleagues, though, I want you to know, as important as it \nis, I would not be here today pressing the declassification of this \ninformation if I thought disclosing it to the American people would \ncompromise our intelligence sources and methods. It doesn't.\n  A number of members of the Intelligence Committee who know exactly \nwhat this blacked-out section says, and have heard the administration's \ncase for classifying it, have told me that significant portions of this \npassage can be declassified immediately with no harm to our national \nsecurity, no revealing of sources and methods. Nor would I be here \ntoday if I thought the process of declassifying information spelled out \nin S. Res. 400 would work in this case.\n  S. Res. 400 talks about how we declassify information. As anyone who \nhas taken a look at S. Res. 400 will quickly see, the process is a very \nlengthy process--so long, in fact, that it is impossible that the \nSenate would be permitted to express its views on an issue prior to the \nmajority leader's announced adjournment date.\n  This amendment, the Reid-Rockefeller-Levin amendment, would provide \nthe American people with information they have a right to know now. \nThis amendment would not harm our national security. To the contrary, \nit will help ensure that we have a better informed Senate debate and a \nbetter informed American public, a critical underpinning of any \neffective national security policy.\n  I express my appreciation because he has just come to the Senate, to \nthe ranking member of the Intelligence Committee. I want the Record to \nbe spread with the fact of how much I appreciate, the Democratic \nSenators appreciate, the Nation appreciates, the Senator's dedicated \nwork.\n  It has been tough sledding. The Senator has been dignified in his \napproach. I so appreciate the tireless efforts of the Senator. Most \nSenators are in the public eye. That is our job. The Senator's job is \nnot to be in the public eye. The Senator spends days of his legislative \nlife in a room in the Hart Building, in secret proceedings. Nothing can \nbe said that goes on in that room. That is where the Senator spends his \ntime. I so appreciate the Senator's dedicated service to our country.\n  Before I offer this unanimous consent request to set aside the \npending amendment and have my amendment heard, I ask the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia if he has some remarks he would like to \nmake.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, first of all, I totally appreciate \nand totally do not deserve the kind comments of our leader from the \nState of Nevada, but I heard them and I won't forget them and I didn't \nmind them at all.\n  Before the Senate Intelligence Committee was able to release last \nweek two sections of phase II that we have been working on in prewar \nintelligence in Iraq, we submitted the report to the intelligence \ncommunity for declassification review.\n  Overall, the declassification process on the phase II report produced \na final product that was a substantial improvement, I have to say, over \npast efforts, including the committee's heavily redacted July 2004 \nphase I report. Yet there were notable instances of overclassification \nin the final phase II report released September 8.\n  The committee, in its report, disagreed with the intelligence \ncommunity's decision to classify certain portions of the report's \nfindings and conclusions. In its decision to keep this information from \nthe public, which is what this is about, the intelligence community was \nunable to demonstrate to the committee that disclosing the redacted--\nthat is, what is blacked-out--the redacted information in question \nwould compromise sensitive sources and methods or otherwise harm the \nnational security.\n  The committee, therefore, on a bipartisan basis, concluded in its \nreport, which was reported out unanimously, that the intelligence \ncommunity's decision to classify this information that we are talking \nabout is without justification. Those are the words in the report, \n``without justification.''\n  The Reid-Rockefeller-Levin amendment addresses the most egregious \ninstance in the committee's Iraq report where the cloak of \nclassification is being used improperly to keep critical information \nfrom the American people. Specifically, the amendment seeks to overturn \nthe intelligence community's unjustified decision to classify it--that \nis what this amendment is trying to do--and not only overturn, but the \nunjustified decision to classify in its totality the section of the \nIraq report referring to a CIA document about the alleged meeting in \nPrague between 9/11 hijacker Mohamed Atta and an Iraqi intelligence \nofficer.\n\n  As the unclassified text of the committee report states, the CIA \ndocument referenced in these redacted paragraphs expresses concerns \nabout the alleged Prague meeting in the context of a public speech by \nPresident Bush planned for March 14, 2003.\n  For the information of Senators, the committee concluded in its \nSeptember 8 Iraq report that the intelligence community was correct \nwhen it assessed prior to the war that there was no credible \ninformation--I repeat, no credible information--that Iraq was complicit \nin or had foreknowledge of the September 11 attacks on the United \nStates or any other al-Qaida strike. The committee also concluded in \nits report, after exhaustive review of relevant intelligence reporting, \nthat the alleged Atta meeting in Prague did not occur.\n  Significant portions of the redacted passage of the report concerning \nthe alleged Atta meeting, if not the entire three paragraphs, can be \ndeclassified without revealing sources and methods--that is, without \ncompromising in any way intelligence--or otherwise harming national \nsecurity. The decision to keep from the public--the public of the \nSenate, the public of the United States of America--this revealing \ninformation about the use of intelligence information prior to the Iraq \nwar represents an improper use of classification authority by the \nintelligence community, the effect of which is to shield the White \nHouse.\n  I urge my colleagues to go to the Intelligence Committee offices and \nread the classified portions of the Iraq report--Senators can do that; \nall Senators can do that, do it in those particular rooms, and they can \ndo it freely--including the sections dealing with\n\n[[Page S9595]]\n\nthe alleged Atta meeting. Senators should read the report and draw \ntheir own conclusions about whether information known prior to the war \nis being kept from the American people for reasons unrelated to \nprotecting national security.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I am happy to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like the Senator from West \nVirginia to clarify one point, if he might. We have two bodies of \ninformation. One is part of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence \nreport--unclassified, public knowledge. We have another body of \ninformation which is classified. I would like to ask the Senator from \nWest Virginia strictly about the first.\n  The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report that was issued \nlast week--unclassified and public knowledge, which the Senator has \nreferred to, and particularly as it relates to the alleged meeting in \nPrague, the Czech Republic, involving Mr. Atta, who was one of the \nterrorists involved in the \n9/11 attacks--if I heard the Senator from West Virginia correctly, the \nreport of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, an unclassified \nand public report, stated no such meeting occurred; is that correct?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I might ask the Senator from West Virginia \nthe following: So when Mr. Tim Russert of ``Meet The Press'' asked Vice \nPresident Dick Cheney, on September 10, this last Sunday, ``And the \nmeeting with Atta did not occur?'' and the Vice President replied, ``We \ndon't know,'' does that contradict the published, unclassified report \nof the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that, in fact, we do \nknow the meeting did not occur?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I would say to the Senator from Illinois that he is \ncorrect, it does contradict that, and moreover this contradiction has \nbeen carried on by a number of high officials in this Government for a \nvery long period of time in spite of intelligence which they knew which \nsaid this meeting never took place.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding for the \nquestion.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. In closing, I urge my colleagues to not only read \nthe information blacked out, redacted--those are pages 96, 97, and 98--\nread those of the report, but also to consider it in the context of the \nunclassified, publicly released section on the alleged Atta meeting in \nPrague that precedes these pages. It sounds complicated, but it is not. \nJust go read it and you will understand.\n  I think Senators will find the information classified by the \nadministration on these three pages does not involve intelligence \nsources and methods as much as it does provide insight into the warning \nbells that were going off all over about the alleged Atta meeting in \nthe context of a Presidential speech a week before the Iraq war \ncommenced. This is information on the use of prewar intelligence which \nthe White House does not want the American public to have because it \nwould be embarrassing.\n  The Senate cannot allow this misuse of classification authority to \nstand. I urge my colleagues to support the Reid-Rockefeller-Levin \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I once again thank the minority leader and yield the \nfloor.\n  (At the request of Mr. Rockefeller, the following statement was \nordered to be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this past Friday, the Senate \nIntelligence Committee released a report that, among other issues, \nlooks at what we have learned after the attack on Iraq about the \naccuracy of prewar intelligence regarding links between Saddam Hussein \nand al-Qaida. The report is a devastating indictment of the Bush-Cheney \nadministration's unrelenting and misleading effort to convince the \nAmerican people that Saddam Hussein was linked with al-Qaida, the \nperpetrators of the 9/11 attack.\n  Before the war, President Bush said: ``[Y]ou can't distinguish \nbetween al-Qa'ida and Saddam when you talk about the war on terror,'' \nand: ``This is a man [Saddam] that we know has had connection with al-\nQa'ida. This is a man who, in my judgment, would like to use al-Qa'ida \nas a forward army.''\n  But the report released by the Intelligence Committee on Friday tells \na different story. The report quotes the CIA's June 2002 assessment \nthat ``our assessment of al-Qa'ida's ties to Iraq rests on a body of \nfragmented, conflicting reporting from sources of varying \nreliability.'' That same CIA report said that ``the ties between Saddam \nand bin Ladin appear much like those between rival intelligence \nservices.''\n  The Intelligence Committee's report quotes a January 2003 prewar CIA \nassessment that ``Saddam Husayn and Usama bin Ladin are far from being \nnatural partners;'' that Saddam has ``viewed Islamic extremists \noperating inside Iraq as a threat;'' and that ``the relationship \nbetween Saddam and bin Ladin appears to more closely resemble that of \ntwo independent actors trying to exploit each other.''\n\n  Those accurate prewar assessments didn't stop the administration from \nmaking many false and misleading statements trying to link Saddam \nHussein and al-Qaida before the war. What is doubly shocking is that \nthe false statements continue to this day.\n  Just last weekend, the Vice President said on ``Meet the Press'' that \n``The evidence we also had at the time was that he [Saddam] had a \nrelationship with al-Qaeda.''\n  And the Secretary of State told Fox News earlier this week that \n``There were ties between Iraq and Al Qaida.''\n  Just read the Senate Intelligence Committee's bipartisan report. \nThose statements are simply not supported by the intelligence, prewar \nor postwar.\n  Three weeks ago, the President said in a press conference that Saddam \nHussein ``had relations with Zarqawi'' the recently killed terrorist.\n  The Intelligence Committee's report demonstrates that statement to be \nflat out false. The committee report discloses, for the first time, the \nCIA's previously classified October 2005 assessment that Saddam's \nregime ``did not have a relationship, harbor, or turn a blind eye \ntoward Zarqawi and his associates.''\n  But neither the CIA's assessment nor the committee's report has \nstopped the false statements. Just last Sunday, the Vice President said \non ``Meet the Press'' that ``We know that Zarqawi . . . fled and went \nto Baghdad and set up operations in Baghdad in the spring of '02 and \nwas there from then, basically, until basically the time we launched \ninto Iraq.''\n  Just last weekend, the Secretary of State told CNN ``We know that \nZarqawi ran a poisons network in Iraq. . . . So was Iraq involved with \nterror? Absolutely, Iraq was involved with terror.''\n  And just this week, Tony Snow, the White House spokesman said ``there \nwas a relationship'' between Saddam and Zarqawi.\n  Don't they read the CIA's assessments? If they do and disagree, they \nshould say so. Again, the CIA's October 2005 assessment said, flat out, \nSaddam's regime ``did not have a relationship, harbor, or turn a blind \neye toward Zarqawi and his associates.''\n  There are many more misleading statements. In the fall of 2001, the \nCzech intelligence service provided the CIA with reporting based on a \nsingle source who stated that the lead 9/11 hijacker Mohammed Atta met \nwith an Iraqi intelligence officer in Prague in April 2001.\n  On December 9, 2001, Vice President Cheney was asked about the report \non ``Meet the Press.'' The Vice President said, said that ``. . . it's \nbeen pretty well confirmed that the [9/11 hijacker Mohammed Atta] did \ngo to Prague and he did meet with a senior official of the Iraqi \nintelligence service in Czechoslovakia last April, several months \nbefore the attack.''\n  On March 24, 2002, the Vice President told ``Meet the Press'' that \n``We discovered, and it's since been public, the allegation that one of \nthe lead hijackers, Mohammed Atta, had, in fact, met with Iraqi \nintelligence in Prague . . .''\n  But the Intelligence Committee's report declassifies, for the first \ntime, a July 2002, a Defense Intelligence Agency paper that said \n``Muhammad Atta reportedly was identified by an asset (not an officer) \nof the Czech [ ] service only after Atta's picture was widely \ncirculated in the media after the attacks, approximately five months \nafter the alleged meeting occurred'' and that ``there is no \nphotographic, immigration or other documentary evidence indicating Atta \nwas in the Czech Republic during the time frame of the meeting.''\n\n[[Page S9596]]\n\n  Two months later, in September 2002, CIA published it's assessment \nthat ``evidence casts doubt'' on the possibility that the meeting had \noccurred and that ``The CIA and FBI have reviewed the reporting \navailable so far and are unable to confirm that Atta met al-Ani in \nPrague.''\n  None of those assessments stopped the Vice President from continuing \nto suggest that the report of the meeting was evidence that Saddam's \nregime was linked to the 9/11 attackers. On September 8, 2002, in a \n``Meet the Press'' interview the Vice President said that the CIA \nconsidered the report of the meeting ``credible,'' although, again, \nthat same month the CIA said that there was evidence that ``cast \ndoubt'' on it having occurred.\n  In January 2003, still before the war, the CIA published an \nassessment stating that, ``A CIA and FBI review of intelligence and \nopen-source reporting leads us to question the information provided by \nthe Czech service source who claimed that Atta met al-Ani.'' The \nJanuary 2003 paper stated that CIA was ``increasingly skeptical that \nAtta traveled to Prague in 2001 or met with IIS officer al-Ani'' and \nthat ``the most reliable reporting to date casts doubt on this \npossibility.''\n  But the Vice President continued to be undeterred by the CIA's \nskepticism. In September of 2003, 8 months after the CIA said that the \nmost reliable reporting cast doubt on the possibility of a meeting \nbetween Atta and the Iraqi intelligence officer, Vice President Cheney \nwas still citing it as having possibly occurred.\n  On January 19, 2004, a full year after the CIA expressed serious \ndoubts about the meeting and the fact that not a shred of evidence had \nbeen found to support the claim of a meeting, the Vice President told \nthe Rocky Mountain News that the Atta meeting was ``the one that \npossibly tied the two [Saddam and the 9-11 attackers] together to 9/\n11.''\n  Six months later, on June 17, 2004, the Vice President was asked \nwhether Iraq was involved in 9/11. The Vice President said ``We don't \nknow. . . . We had one report, this was the famous report on the Czech \nintelligence service, and we've never been able to confirm it or to \nknock it down. We just don't know.'' The Vice President may not have \n``known'' but the intelligence community sure as heck didn't believe--\nfor a long time before the Vice President's statement--that the meeting \ntook place.\n  Now the Senate Intelligence Committee's report says that ``Postwar \nfindings . . . confirm that no such meeting occurred.''\n  But just last Sunday, before a nationally televised audience, the \nVice President was asked whether the meeting occurred. The Vice \nPresident replied ``We don't know.''\n  The Intelligence Community does know. The Senate Intelligence \nCommittee knows. The bipartisan report we released last week says \n``Postwar findings . . . confirm that no such meeting occurred.''\n  The intelligence assessments contained in the Intelligence \nCommittee's unclassified report are an indictment of the \nadministration's continuing misleading attempts to link Saddam Hussein \nto al-Qaida. Portions of the report which have been kept from public \nview provide some of the clearest evidence of this administration's \nfalse statements and distortions.\n  Among what remains classified, and therefore covered up, includes \ndeeply disturbing information. Much of the information redacted from \npages 96, 97, and 98 of the public report does not jeopardize any \nintelligence sources or methods. The continued classification of that \nentire portion of the report reeks of a coverup by the administration. \nThe Senate should not go along. The public is entitled to the full \npicture. Unless this report is further declassified, they \nwon't.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Levin would be here, but he is, to \nsay the least, tied up in the Armed Services Committee. He has been \nworking with others to get a bipartisan measure to the floor so we can \ndeal with the detainee problem that was brought to a head by the \nSupreme Court in the Hamdan decision.\n  I do wish to say that Senator Levin, during Senator Rockefeller's \nincapacity, was a real stalwart working with us. He kept Senator \nRockefeller informed at his home on a daily basis as to what was going \non in that committee. We very much appreciate Senator Levin's efforts. \nHe is really overworked. He had his responsibilities for Armed \nServices, but he filled in very well for the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia. We are glad Senator Rockefeller is back and in better \nshape than when he left. He is stronger than ever, and we are very \nfortunate to be able to work on this side of the aisle with these two \nwonderful Senators.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, notwithstanding rule XXII, \nthat amendment No. 5005, to declassify certain text of the Report of \nthe Select Committee on Intelligence on Post-War Findings about Iraq's \nweapons of mass destruction program, still be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BOND. Reserving the right to object, first, let me clarify, this \nis not classification----\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, is there an objection or not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Missouri object?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I regret the decision of the majority. I really do. \nThere will be ample time for my friend from Missouri to speak. I wish \nto speak for a few more minutes. No matter the issue or the costs to \nthe American people, I am sorry to say, partisanship is the order of \nthe day in this Republican Senate. On such an important matter as this, \nI had hoped we could set aside our partisan differences and work \ntogether. This is not the case.\n  Our amendment will not be adopted, but it is not we who will pay the \nprice. The real consequences will be paid by this institution and the \nAmerican people.\n  The Senate has lost and the American people have lost once again \nbecause the Republicans have chosen to rubberstamp a bad decision by \nthe Bush White House. They have put the administration's political \nstanding ahead of this body's constitutional obligation and their own \npolitical interests ahead of the Nation's interests.\n  Again, the American people have lost because, again, they have been \ndenied an opportunity to fully understand the facts behind President \nBush's rush to war in Iraq. The decision to keep this revealing \ninformation from the public represents an abuse of classification \nauthority by the Intelligence Committee. They have shielded the White \nHouse at the expense of America's security.\n  More than 3 years into the war in Iraq--longer than it took in World \nWar II in the European theater--the principal underpinnings of the \nadministration's case for war have been undermined, if not obliterated, \nby events on the ground and Friday's Intelligence Committee report.\n  We learned long ago that Saddam did not possess weapons of mass \ndestruction, that he did not have stockpiles of chemical weapons, that \nhe did not have stockpiles of biological weapons, and that he did not \nhave nuclear capabilities.\n  Further, we know definitely from the Intelligence Committee report on \nFriday that another administration claim--that Saddam Hussein had ties \nwith al-Qaida--is totally and completely unfounded. Of course, that \ndoes not stop this administration from repeating this charge. This next \nchart shows exactly what I am talking about. Look at what has been said \nin recent weeks. And the colloquy between the distinguished whip and \nthe ranking member of the Intelligence Committee certainly showed this \nand will show it again.\n  Here is what was said:\n\n       [Saddam Hussein] had relations with Zarqawi.\n\n  President Bush said this in August of this year, late August of this \nyear.\n  The Senate Intelligence Committee report:\n\n       [T]he Regime did not have a relationship with, harbor, or \n     turn a blind eye toward Zarqawi.\n\n  This did not stop the President from saying ``[Saddam Hussein] had \nrelations with Zarqawi.'' This is not a truthful statement.\n\n[[Page S9597]]\n\n  On September 10, just last Sunday, the Vice President said, on ``Meet \nThe Press,'' at 10:30 in the morning--he was asked the question by Tim \nRussert, ``And the meeting with Atta did not occur?''--keep in mind, \nthis is after the report was made public Friday, 2 days before this--\nand the Vice President said, ``We don't know.''\n  The Senate Intelligence Committee report says no such meeting \noccurred. It is against this backdrop that I offered the Reid-\nRockefeller-Levin amendment. We have an administration that continues \nto misstate the record and prevent the public from getting additional \ninformation that will shed further light on their misstatements. And \n``misstatements'' is an understatement. We have a Republican-controlled \nCongress that actively aids and abets the administration in these \npursuits.\n  Mr. President, we need a new direction. For too long, this Republican \nCongress has put its own security ahead of the security of the American \npeople. Today is a good example of that, and it is too bad for the \nAmerican people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise in very strong opposition to \nSenator Reid's amendment. The amendment simply directs the release of \nthree pages in the classified version of the committee's phase II \nreport on the accuracy of prewar intelligence assessments. I just think \nthis amendment is an irresponsible, very dangerous way to seek the \nrelease of classified information and would set a very dangerous \nprecedent.\n  To my knowledge, this action is unprecedented--the full Senate \nconsidering a bill that has nothing to do with the subject matter that \nis now being discussed and for the Senate not to declassify the \ninformation but to simply release classified information. I can \nprobably conjure up a lot of other different attempts to do this and \nput the full Senate in the position of trying to release classified \ninformation.\n  While we are at war, what the Democratic leader is proposing is that \nthe Congress unilaterally release information that our intelligence \nprofessionals--not the administration--that our intelligence \nprofessionals have determined to be protected from disclosure. Again, \nto my knowledge, the Senate has never taken such a drastic step.\n  Now, the Democratic leader's amendment is not about port security. In \nfact, the amendment will do nothing to enhance our security. The Senate \nshould not adopt a precedent that allows one Senator to release \nclassified information for whatever purpose that he or she would deem \nfit or for their own purposes.\n  Before I proceed any further, however, I must take issue with the \nmanner in which the committee action on the matter of declassification \nhas been characterized. Senator Reid claims that a bipartisan majority \nof the Intelligence Committee voted to include in the report a \nstatement that the committee disagreed with the administration's \ndecision--I will repeat, the administration's decision--to classify \ncertain portions of the report's findings and conclusions and said that \nclassifying of this information is without justification.\n  In actuality it was the intelligence community, not the \nadministration, that made the decision to protect the sensitive \ninformation contained in those three pages. That decision was based on \nthe community's judgment--their judgment--I know Senators Rockefeller, \nReid, and others may disagree with the community--concerning sources \nand methods.\n  More important, the committee actually classified the \ndeclassification this way, and I am quoting from our report:\n\n       The committee recognizes that classification decisions are \n     often difficult, requiring a careful balancing of our \n     responsibility to protect the national security sources and \n     methods with the need for the appropriate transparency of the \n     intelligence activities.\n\n  That says it, and it is a very difficult task that one faces when you \nare approaching that kind of a challenge. Overall, the declassification \nprocess on this report--and I am quoting again--``was a substantial \nimprovement over past efforts.''\n  That is what the committee said. I know that doesn't include the \nthree pages that the Democratic leader, Senator Rockefeller, and others \nwould like to have released. It would still be classified, but it would \nbe released in a bill that has nothing to do with intelligence matters. \nIt is important to understand that this was a broad, bipartisan \nstatement relating to a number of issues. Several Senators, many \nSenators, this Senator, had things they would have liked to have seen \ndeclassified. I worked overtime with the intelligence community in \nregard to the section on the Iraqi National Congress, to make sure that \nall of that report was in, all of the nuances and history would be \ndeclassified. Did I get everything I wanted? No, but I got a large \nportion of it.\n  The committee, however, made no specific reference to the issue that \nSenator Reid brought to the floor today. There was that generic \nstatement that I just said earlier. I am very familiar with the \nmaterial that the Senator seeks to publicly release. I agree with the \nIntelligence Community that this material does contain sensitive \ninformation that would damage our intelligence sources and methods. I \nbelieve it is properly classified. I supported the report's statement \nthat there are certain portions of the report that I believe should \nhave been declassified. This is not one of them.\n  The information the Democratic leader wants to release is very \nsensitive. Mr. President, it is CIA operational traffic between an \nundercover overseas field station and CIA headquarters. This type of \ncorrespondence exists to permit the rapid informal flow of information \nand operational guidance needed to execute the mission of the CIA. It \nis not formal intelligence reporting. It is not a finished intelligence \nassessment drafted and coordinated to support policymakers, as has been \nindicated, and it is not routinely available or needed by anyone \noutside of the CIA. It must be handled with care.\n  Now, the next question, obviously, is why? Because the release of \nunevaluated information and CIA operational traffic would potentially \ndamage the relationships with foreign country security services that \nwork closely with the CIA. These foreign services do so with the \nexpectation that their words and their actions will remain \nconfidential. Additionally, declassification and public release of such \ncorrespondence would certainly impinge upon the speed and frankness \nthat marks this correspondence. CIA's effectiveness is reduced when \nthis happens.\n  For these reasons, and others that cannot be discussed publicly, this \ninformation should not be released. In short, this amendment would \ndamage our sensitive sources and methods by recklessly disclosing \nproperly classified information--again, not by the administration but \nby the intelligence community.\n  There is another way to do this. It is the proper way. A number of \nMembers on both sides of the aisle, including this Senator, have issues \nconcerning the declassification of these reports. They have agreed to \nwork with the National Archives Public Interest Declassification Board, \nwhich is the proper way to do it, to review and, hopefully, further \ndeclassify some of the remaining redacted portions. This review process \nwill look at all of the information that remains classified, not just \nthe information singled out in Senator Reid's amendment. I think this \nis a much more responsible approach.\n  I hope my colleagues will proceed in that manner. That is how we \nintend to proceed in the Intelligence Committee in regard to \nclassification and declassification. I oppose this amendment, and I \nurge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I have yielded the floor, but I will answer the \nSenator's question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator because I am not on the committee, the \nSenate Intelligence Committee released a report last week, and he \nstands by the findings--at least the majority section. I asked the \nquestion of my Democratic colleague, Senator Rockefeller, which I would \nask of you. In that Senate Intelligence Committee report relative to \nthe alleged meeting in Prague involving Mohammad Atta, the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence report says that\n\n[[Page S9598]]\n\nno such meeting occurred. I would like to ask the Senator from Kansas \nthis: When the Vice President was asked on Sunday on ``Meet the Press'' \nby Mr. Russert the following question: ``And the meeting with Atta did \nnot occur?'' he replied, ``We don't know,'' is that statement by the \nVice President consistent with the report that you signed and issued to \nthe public on the previous Friday?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, responding to the Senator from Illinois, \nthat is a hypothetical. I did not watch ``Meet the Press.'' I have not \nstudied the Vice President's comments other than what the Senator has \nsaid. My name is not Tony Snow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Will the chairman yield for another question?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Yes, I certainly yield to my friend and colleague.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Thank you very much. I am sure that the Senator is \naware, having talked about the importance of the operational cables, \nthe foreign service, and all these kinds of things that there are in \nour report--or in the report there are at least 30 specific references \nto operational cables. I am looking at page 31 of the prewar assessment \npart. CIA operational table, December 2002, the INC part. And there are \ntwo on page 68--two CIA cable references that are declassified. Is the \nSenator aware of that, that we have done this 30 times at least in our \nreport?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. It is my understanding that the operational cables and \nthe INC reports are two separate reports.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. That is correct. But there are 30 in various parts \nof this that are operational cables specifically referred to, which \nare----\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Basically, the decision is made by General Hayden in a \nletter I would be delighted to read on the floor of the Senate, except \nthat it is classified. He goes down specifically, exactly the comments \nI have made in a very generic way as to why he didn't declassify them. \nOne report is INC and one is on the accuracy of the prewar assessments \nregarding weapons of mass destruction. I don't understand the point.\n  By the way, the general indicated that he will provide us a letter \nthat is not classified outlining why the CIA Director feels very \nstrongly that this should not be released.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. What the CIA Director reportedly is saying, and the \nchairman of the full committee indicates, is that operational cables \ncannot be identified publicly. I am saying that they are identified 30 \ntimes in our two reports.\n  I direct my colleagues' attention to these 30 specific examples from \nthe committee's two reports found on page 31 of the report on Post War \nFindings and pages 41, 43, 67, 68, 69, 70, 72, 76, 77, 78, 80, 82, 86, \n87, 104, and 107 of the INC report.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, let me say to my friend from West \nVirginia, however, if I might, and my friend from Illinois, I don't \nspeak for the Vice President. I ask the Senator to address that \nquestion to the Vice President. It is the information in the cable \nwhich is classified, not the format. I think the distinguished vice \nchairman is talking about the format in another report as opposed to \nthe report that Senator Reid quoted from, and it is that information--\nthe cable which is classified, again, by the intelligence community. \nThe Senator knows how hard we have both worked to get both reports \ndeclassified, to the extent that the American people could at least \nknow what is going on and let the chips fall where they may. That does \nnot include, however, a decision when the DNI and the Director of \nCentral Intelligence insist that basically the information in the cable \nis classified.\n  I suppose that in future debates on any bill--and it could be port \nsecurity or the farm bill or any bill that really doesn't pertain to \nintelligence--somebody can say, you know, I think there is a portion of \nsome intelligence report, or any intelligence, that ought to be \nreleased even though it is classified. If we start doing this, if we go \ndown the slippery slope with regard to having this body in executive \nsession or otherwise decide to release classified information, we may \nas well replace ``E pluribus unum'' up there with the New York Times. \nIt is a dangerous precedent.\n  There is a way to do that. We have a committee set up to go to the \nreview board to see if we can get the most declassification possible. I \nagree with the Senator that too much is classified. That is a given. In \nthis particular case, I think you have to rely on--or you should rely \non the CIA Director and the Director of National Intelligence who say \nwe are going to lose allied support.\n  The Senator knows that every week we get a courtesy call from various \npeople who come in and who are our counterparts representing other \ncountries. The bottom line is: Why can't you Americans keep quiet? So, \nconsequently, I think that has an aspect of this. That has entered \ninto, I think, part of the DNI's involvement here and decisionmaking, \nas well as the CIA Director's involvement. It is a canard of the first \norder to say it was the administration. It is not. It is the people who \nwork with this every day.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I say to the chairman of the full committee, is the \nSenator aware that on page 31, the prewar assessment part of the \nreport, there is a reference at the bottom, as I indicated, to the CIA \noperational cable of December 20, 2002. The Senator indicated the \nsubstance is not included, but I will read from the report:\n\n       In addition, the Committee is examining the facts \n     surrounding a December 20, 2002, cable from the relevant CIA \n     station [this is all available to the American public today] \n     which transmitted comments from a letter to the DCI and a \n     discussion with the Chief of Station from the head of the \n     foreign intelligence service that handled CURVE BALL. The \n     cable noted that the head of the foreign intelligence service \n     intelligence said experts from a number of foreign \n     intelligence services had analyzed the CURVE BALL information \n     and believed ``the information was plausible''--et cetera, et \n     cetera.\n\nIn other words, the content is right here.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I would just simply say to my \ndistinguished friend and colleague, and to let everybody know who is \nlistening to this debate, it is an interesting debate; it is a unique \ndebate. It sets a precedent that I don't agree with. But simply because \nwe are having this discussion doesn't mean we are not friends and \ncolleagues and trying our very best to do a job under very difficult \ncircumstances. But we do defer--or at least I think we should defer--to \nthe intelligence professionals here who work with this material. If \nthey make a mistake, we are all over them.\n  So we are at war. Let's let the Public Interest Declassification \nBoard take a look at these reports. That was the suggestion by Senator \nWyden, picked up by Senator Bond, endorsed by myself and I think by the \nSenator from West Virginia. That is the proper way to go about it, not \nin this format, when we don't even have a bill that pertains to this \nand where we are setting a precedent where all of a sudden somebody can \nsay: Oh, I think we should release even though it is classified.\n  Once we start down that road, I would say to my dear friend, we will \nnever hear the end of it. We will have everything else declassified. We \ncould conceivably, with all the furor in regards to the ABC documentary \nover the handling of 9/11, get into reports and get into Presidential \nfindings and everything else. I just don't think that is appropriate. \nSo there is a way to do it. Let's do it the proper way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I want to join in support of the chairman of \nthe committee. It is important to realize this was not classified after \nthe fact. This was classified information.\n  Now, we cannot say on the floor why this must remain classified. \nThere are good and sufficient reasons for this, unlike some of the \nother cables which have been cited by the distinguished vice chairman \nof the committee, why this one should not be released.\n  We are witnessing something here that is very, very disturbing. The \nminority leader said that partisanship is the order of the day because \nwe have objected to this unwarranted effort to misuse and abuse the \nintelligence process to score political points. This approach, \nregrettably, is something that has been used going back to 2003 when \nthe Democratic staff in the Intelligence Committee laid out a partisan \npolitical game plan to use intelligence to try to beat President Bush \nand Vice\n\n[[Page S9599]]\n\nPresident Cheney in 2004. They laid out a game plan and they stayed on \nit. They stayed on it through phase I. Phase I took 2 full years during \nwhich we exhaustively examined all of the documents, interviewed \nanybody that might have information on whether there was an intentional \nmisleading or misrepresentation or pressure to change the estimates of \nthe intelligence analysts and thwart the process.\n  We reviewed that process exhaustively. At the end of it, our \nbipartisan conclusion was there was no evidence of any pressure to \nchange findings of the Intelligence Committee; there was no effort to \nmislead or misuse the information of the intelligence analysts or the \nintelligence estimates.\n  Regrettably, our Democratic colleagues were not satisfied with that. \nThey wanted to continue the battle. So we initiated a second backward \nlook into history that I think was a tremendous waste of time--phase \nII--to go back and say: Well, maybe we missed something. We are going \nto go back and look at the intelligence prior to the commencement of \nOperation Iraqi Freedom and see if we can't find some misstatement, \nsome misstep by the administration.\n  Well, President Bush is not running again. I don't know whether they \nwant to try to impeach him or whether they just want to try to score \npoints in the 2006 election campaign. But whichever thing they are \ndoing, it is a blatant partisan effort to take what should be the \nbipartisan, even nonpartisan, Intelligence Committee and drag it \nthrough the political mire of name-calling and rock-throwing.\n  I think it is time for us to hit the baloney button on this and say: \nWe have wasted now 2 more years in the Intelligence Committee going \nback and trying to defeat or impeach President Bush, and we have not \nbeen successful.\n  Let me mention something about this. All of this hype is about things \nthat were added--much of it is about things that were added as comments \nto one of the two reports that we reported out of the Intelligence \nCommittee. The Democrats chose to make extraneous allegations now that \nwill be considered in a later report that is yet to be finalized by the \ncommittee, to look into statements made by administration officials and \nMembers of Congress, to see whether they were inaccurate or if there \nwas a misuse of the intelligence estimates that were available at the \ntime. I have looked at them and I have seen some significant \noverstepping in statements that were made. Regrettably, those \nstatements primarily came from Members of Congress, some on the other \nside of the aisle, who went too far. They went beyond what the \nintelligence estimates said.\n  Now, we have focused in this process on what the final intelligence \nestimates were. There are thousands--perhaps hundreds of thousands--at \nleast tens of thousands of operational cables. They bring in different \npoints of view. There are 16 different intelligence agencies that may \nhave points of view. Do those all come to the policymakers? Of course \nnot. The intelligence community is responsible for coming up with a \nNational Intelligence Estimate, a community assessment that goes to the \npolicymakers, whether that is the President, the Vice President, or \nthis body. We get the final product.\n  Now, any time you want to, you can go back and look at all kinds of \noperational cables. You can find cables at any one time saying it is \ndaytime and others say it is night, a third one saying it is dusk, and \na fourth one saying it is dawn. But that is not what is given to the \npolicymakers.\n  We ask the Intelligence Committee to use their best judgment. And as \nfar as this cable, which has been properly classified--and we will not \ngo into why it is properly classified--this cable was one communication \nto the headquarters, and it was not the only one. There were many, many \nmore.\n  Looking back on it, we have a much better idea of what went on. But \nthe whole purpose of this, the whole purpose of our Democratic \ncolleagues in phase II, was to find grounds to defeat President Bush in \n2004 or perhaps impeach him in 2006 or maybe in 2007. Well, we have \nbeen looking in the rearview mirror far too long. We have been looking \nbackwards. We spent 2 full years, the staff of the Intelligence \nCommittee spent hundreds of hours, reviewed tens of thousands of \ndocuments, over 1,000 interviews, and they found that there was no \nmisuse, no abuse of the intelligence process, no pressure on the \nanalysts.\n\n  So we have a lot of things that we ought to be doing. We have a lot \nof work in the Intelligence Committee because we have to implement the \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission. One of the key recommendations \nconcerning intelligence in the 9/11 Commission report was to set up a \nnational security post in the Department of Justice to coordinate \nbetween the FBI and the CIA. Regrettably, our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle are holding up the appointment of the man who is \nsupposed to fill that position to ensure that there is good information \nand good exchanges of information between the FBI as a law enforcement \nbody and the intelligence agencies. And we have a lot of other things \nto do because there are still problems that we have to work out in the \nnew structure of the Director of National Intelligence.\n  I have been asking plaintively why we cannot look at the continuing \nthreats, do oversight and deal with some of the questions and problems \nwe have. The answer is we have to complete phase II, and phase II has \nhad, again, hundreds and hundreds of hours of work by our staff, work \nthat could have been used on other points. Regrettably, what we are \nhearing on the floor and what we are seeing in some of the reports \ncoming out of the Intelligence Committee is an effort to politicize \nintelligence. I deeply regret the fact that so much of this has been \nmisquoted in the report issued, the largely Democratic report issued \nfrom the intelligence community. There was a tremendous amount of \ncherry-picking of selected pieces of information that did not come from \nthe National Intelligence Estimates, to say that statements by some \nadministration officials were not based on sound evidence.\n  We have learned a lot. We have learned a lot since we went into Iraq. \nWe learned that our intelligence wasn't good, state-craft and trade-\ncraft were not properly executed. Where there were dissenting views, \nthose dissenting views were not conveyed up the line to the \npolicymakers. That was us and that was the administration. And we are \ntrying to change that. We are trying to make sure that dissenting views \nare explored, that policymakers know if there is a division.\n  Now, looking back with hindsight, we could say that many of the \nstatements made here on the floor and made by the administration were \nnot accurate. The question is, Were they based on the best National \nIntelligence Estimates at the time? We found out in phase I that they \nwere.\n  The effort to do more declassification is very important. The \nchairman of the committee, Senator Roberts, Senator Wyden and I and the \nvice chairman have asked the Public Interest Declassification Board and \nthe National Archives to look at and investigate what has been \nclassified to see if more of it could be declassified. Because I, as \nmost of my colleagues, want to have as much that is not sensitive or \nrevealing sources and methods to be disclosed, so we can evaluate where \nwe stand. But for this one, I understand full well the reason it is \nclassified, and I am not going to say why. But when we disclose \nintelligence, we risk sources. Unfortunately, when we prosecuted the \n1993 World Trade Center bombers, the prosecution had to turn over a \nlist of 260 names of potential suspects. They turned it over in that \ncourt proceeding and, subsequently, several years later in a raid in an \nAfrican nation they found in the al-Qaida playbook the names of all \nthese people. When we disclose who we are talking to, their names get \ndisclosed. And regrettably, some of them have been murdered. But it is \nnot just the individual source who is at risk.\n  We have repeatedly chipped away at the confidence of our allies to \nwork with us in the war on terror by disclosing sources and methods \nover the years. Friendly services are saying--and CIA leaders have told \nme directly--that our allies in the field are rethinking if and to what \nextent they can work with us because the Americans cannot keep a \nsecret. This effort to declassify operational traffic involving \noverseas entities could devastate the confidence of our allies in \ncooperating\n\n[[Page S9600]]\n\nwith American intelligence and obliterate the confidence of American \nintelligence officials in the United States Congress, who will be \ntaking their discrete communications among themselves and broadcasting \nit to the entire world.\n  I can't think right now of a single more devastating action that will \nreverse what we have been trying to fix in the U.S. intelligence \ncommunity than this, to say that if you share anything within the \nintelligence community or even with the Intelligence Committee, it is \ngoing to get out. People don't want to share the most sensitive \nintelligence when it could get out and not only disclose the \ninformation, but put at risk the sources and methods by which it is \nbeing obtained.\n  For that reason, I regret that the minority leader has attempted to \nmake a partisan battle out of something that did not have to do with \nthe National Intelligence Estimate. It was not a final product of the \nIntelligence Committee. Therefore, it had no place in the effort to \ndetermine what kind of information got to the top policymakers in the \nadministration.\n  There were lots of conflicting pieces of information going through \nthe chain. What we properly looked at was how those were handled and \nwhat they gave to policymakers. There is no evidence, no evidence, \nnone, zero, zip, none--that this evidence was ever shared with the top \npolicymakers.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I had the honor to serve on the Senate \nintelligence subcommittee for 4 years. It is an awesome assignment. \nThat committee can suck up more time from a Senator's schedule than any \nother assignment I can think of. I easily spent half of my time in \ncommittee in the Senate Intelligence Committee room, and I am almost \ncertain that I didn't attend half of their meetings. There were so many \nmeetings. The information is voluminous. It is cloaked in initials and \nreferences which take the longest time to understand. I will honestly \ntell you by the end of my 4 years I had come to understand more and \nmore about the intelligence community and come to understand more and \nmore about what to look for and listen for. So my hat is off to all of \nmy colleagues in the Senate, Democrat and Republican, who serve on this \ncommittee. It is a massive assignment, and they have a massive \nresponsibility--to measure the efficacy of our intelligence operations \nas well as their reports.\n  I can't think of another committee in Congress--I might say the Armed \nServices Committee is close--that has such an awesome responsibility. I \nwant to preface my remarks by saluting all of the members of the \nIntelligence Committee for giving their time to this effort.\n  But I will tell you, there is no more frustrating assignment in \nCongress either because you will sit there for hour after weary hour, \nday after weary day, week after week, and month after month listening \nto all of this information, being sworn not to repeat a word of it--\nimagine. The only questions you can ask are in the room. The only \nstatements you can make are in the room. It is classified information. \nWe wouldn't want to risk the life of a single American or ally or \nsomeone helping our cause, so we are extra careful.\n  I lived through this as we made the momentous and historic decision 4 \nyears ago to go to war in Iraq. After sitting there for months, \nlistening to the experts within the Bush administration talk about what \nthey knew about Iraq, I drew my own conclusions from what they said. \nAnd I would walk outside that committee room stunned to hear the public \nstatements that were being made in direct contradiction.\n  Elected officials and appointed officials in this administration were \nsaying things about Iraq and its threat to the United States which were \ninconsistent with the information being given to us in the Senate \nIntelligence Committee. Yet, being sworn to secrecy, I could not say a \nword. It was a frustrating situation.\n  I reached the conclusion that the information within the room was \nmore compelling than the headlines outside the room. I joined 22 of my \ncolleagues in the Senate in voting against the authorization to go to \nwar. And our subsequent investigation found that those inside the room \nknew a lot more than the politicians outside the room because we found \nno weapons of mass destruction, we found no nuclear weapons, we found \nno connection between al-Qaida the terrorist group responsible for 9/\n11--and Saddam Hussein. We found no evidence to support the notion that \nsomehow nuclear materials were coming in from Africa to Iraq.\n  Despite statements made by the President in the State of the Union \nAddress, none of that was found. So we knew, after our invasion, after \ncareful investigation, that the statements made to the American people \nwere wrong. The American people were misled. The American people were \ndeceived. So the Senate Intelligence Committee set out to try to get to \nthe bottom of it.\n  The first phase of its investigation was to find out what happened at \nthe intelligence agencies. If they had conflicting information, how did \nthis occur? I happened to be on the committee when this report was \nmade. It was an important disclosure that, in fact, our intelligence \nagencies had let us down. Their information was not reliable, was not \nsound, and many times misled a lot of people. That is a fact.\n  But phase II of this investigation by the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee was going to really talk about whether these public \ndisclosures were made and whether they, in fact, misled the American \npeople. It took almost 2\\1/2\\ years for that to be prepared, 2\\1/2\\ \nyears, despite repeated promises by the chairman of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee that it would be a priority item and be taken \ncare of. It is unfortunate that it took so long. It is unfortunate that \nthe Democratic leader, Senator Reid of Nevada, had to threaten a closed \nsession of the Senate to force this issue, to finally come up with the \nphase II report.\n  But it is a good thing he did because the phase II report, which was \npublicized last week for all of America, in unclassified form, in \npublic form, made it clear. The report concluded the administration \nrelied on known fabricators and liars, including the infamous Ahmed \nChalabi and his Iraqi National Congress to justify the war. Chalabi and \nothers fed the administration consistently false information about \nIraqi weapons of mass destruction and nuclear weapons.\n  Members of the intelligence community had warned that this Ahmed \nChalabi, the darling of many people in this administration, was, in \nfact, a fraud. Despite this, despite this fact, this man was invited to \nsit in an honored place at the President's State of the Union Address.\n  He was unreliable. His organization was not only not trustworthy, it \nwas penetrated by the Iranians, who sadly do not share many, if any, of \nour values.\n  But the administration still eagerly embraced this source, this \nunreliable, untrustworthy source. Some of the information that he gave \nfound its way into one of the most important documents our Government \nissues, the National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq. That is a \ncompilation of all the gathered intelligence from all the different \nreliable sources of our Government and other places, to try to have an \naccurate picture of the situation before a military invasion, before we \nrisk the first American life. And the lies and fabrications and \ndistortions of this man were part of that National Intelligence \nEstimate.\n  In fact, some of his testimony found its way into statements made by \nour former Secretary of State Colin Powell before the United Nations to \ntry to justify to the world our invasion. That presentation marked a \nlow point in what I consider an otherwise highly distinguished career \nof service by General Powell.\n  The committee report which we saw last week spells out the \nmisinformation from Chalabi and others that was used to justify the \nwar. It shows clearly there was no connection, none, between Saddam \nHussein and al-Qaida. That is now a bipartisan conclusion. It is \npublished. It has been verified from intelligence sources. The debate \nover that question should now officially end.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, could I ask the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois a question? On what page is there a bipartisan statement that \nthere was no connection between al-Qaida and Iraq?\n\n[[Page S9601]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will get the page reference and give it to you in a \nmoment.\n  Mr. BOND. Because we also found in there a reference that there was a \nmeeting and two contacts.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if I might? I do control the time?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator controls the time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will get the page reference for the Senator. I would \nlike to continue my remarks, if I may.\n  The bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee reached these \nconclusions but this report, especially the public version, doesn't go \nas far as it might. As the vice chairman, the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia, and other colleagues wrote in their additional \nviews:\n\n       The committee's phase II investigation has been \n     significantly limited by the majority's refusal to examine \n     issues and documents relevant to our inquiry when the issues \n     and documents came close to the White House.\n\n  The point that is being made today, and has been debated back and \nforth, is how much of this document that has not been released to the \npublic, should be released.\n  As you can see, several pages, many pages, are blacked out. \nInformation is blacked out. The official word is ``redacted.'' So this \ndebate has gone back and forth about how much should have been \nredacted, how much should have been released. I will not get into the \nspecifics because I wouldn't want to disclose anything that I should \nnot. But I will say the Senator from Nevada asked by his motion, his \namendment, that we consider opening at least one or two pages of this \nreport that reflect directly on statements made by the Bush \nadministration.\n  The other side, Senator Bond and others, have suggested that we \nshould not ask these questions, that we are looking in the rearview \nmirror about things that happened a long time ago.\n  I view this quite a bit differently than my colleague from Missouri. \nWhat we are talking about are statements and justifications made by \nthis administration to justify the invasion of a country, to justify a \nwar. I believe the greatest breach of trust in a democracy is when the \nleaders mislead the people, and the worst of these is when the people \nare misled into a war. I can think of nothing worse.\n  To ask specific questions about the nature of how we were misled into \nthis war is certainly not ancient history, unworthy of comment or \nreview. It goes to the heart of who we are and what we are as a \ndemocracy.\n  So many of us listened, startled by statements made by Vice President \nCheney on ``Meet The Press'' last Sunday. Scarcely 2 days after the \nreport of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Vice President \nCheney and other members of the administration made statements directly \ncontradicted by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report that \nhad just been released. Let me be specific.\n  First, if I could, the chart with the ``Meet the Press'' show, Mr. \nRussert asked the Vice President, `` . . . and the meeting with Atta \ndid not occur?''\n  Vice President Cheney said, ``We don't know.''\n  This was an important meeting. It was a meeting that was suggested \nhad occurred by the Vice President and others involving Mohamed Atta, \nthe leader of the 19 who were responsible for the attack on September \n11, a meeting which supposedly occurred in Prague. Mr. Russert is \nasking: Did it or did it not occur?\n  Vice President Cheney says, ``We don't know.'' He said that as of \nlast Sunday.\n  The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report says, ``No such \nmeeting occurred.''\n  That is not the only reference. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, \n``CNN Late Edition,'' same day, said:\n\n       We know that Zarqawi . . . ran a poisonous network in Iraq.\n\n  The Senate Intelligence Committee report says the following, ``the \nregime''--in Iraq--``did not have a relationship with, harbor, or turn \na blind eye towards Zarqawi.''\n  Then, just yesterday or the day before, September 12, Tony Snow the \nPresident's Press Secretary, said ``there was a relationship between \nSaddam and Zarqawi,'' directly contradicting this report.\n  This, sadly, is a pattern which is unacceptable. For the leaders in \nthis administration--the Vice President, the Secretary of State, and \nthe President's Press Secretary--to continue to mislead the American \npeople about facts they now know are not true is unacceptable. If we \nare going to move forward in this country effectively, on a bipartisan \nbasis, it has to be based on truth and honesty. As members of this \nadministration continue to misrepresent the justification for the war \non Iraq and the circumstances in Iraq, is it any wonder that a majority \nof the American people are now raising serious questions about their \ncompetence and judgment when it comes to these important foreign policy \ndecisions? That is the reason for this moment on the floor today, this \ntime that we have taken from the business of the Senate, because it \nreally goes to the heart of the issue here. It goes to the heart of the \nissue which the American people are consumed with as they realize that \n2,679 of our brave soldiers have now died in Iraq and 19,000 are \nseriously injured.\n  This morning, Senator Obama and I had a town meeting. We do each \nThursday morning here. And one of those soldiers, blinded and severely \ninjured in Iraq, came to visit with us. He was there with his wonderful \nand brave wife who stood by his side, and other soldiers, doing his \nbest to get back on his feet and put his life back together.\n  That is what this debate is about. This isn't a waste of time over \npolitics. It is a question about the foreign policy of this Nation, the \nprotection of this Nation, and most importantly whether it is time to \nmove in a new direction.\n  The Vice President of the United States said in the course of his \nappearance on ``Meet the Press'' when he was asked about the invasion \nof Iraq:\n\n       It was the right thing to do, and if we had to do it over \n     again we would do exactly the same thing.\n\n  Clearly, no lessons have been learned by this administration because \nwe sent too few troops into a situation which was not clearly planned \nnor clearly explained to the American people. We sent them without the \nnecessary equipment they needed to protect themselves. We shortchanged \nthem in terms of the number of forces, equipment, and training they \nneeded--and lives were lost.\n  We now know, as well, that the justification for the war did not turn \nout to be true. There were no weapons of mass destruction, and we are \nthere with 145,000 of our soldiers and marines risking their lives for \nAmerica, even as we stand in the safety of this country today.\n  I might say to the Senator from Missouri that I have just been handed \nby my staff a reference which he might want to consider: page 63 of the \nreport which he signed. Page 63 said Saddam has ``viewed Islamic \nextremists operating inside of Iraq as a threat.''\n  That statement is inconsistent with the conspiracy theory heard \nthrough some media channels that somehow Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida \nwere in concert working toward the devastation which occurred on 9/11.\n  I would suggest that there is more which I could go into and don't \nhave the time at this moment. But the report makes it clear--and most \neveryone who has taken an objective view of this makes it clear--that \nto continue to suggest this relationship with al-Qaida is just plain \nwrong.\n  I am going to conclude because I think this is an important debate \nand one which should continue. It is one that continues in households \nacross America, not just in the homes of families of soldiers, those \nanxious parents and loved ones praying for the safety of our men and \nwomen in uniform, but also in every other home across America that \ntruly wants to be safe and wants to make sure that our men and women in \nuniform are protected, that we do everything in our power to make this \na safe nation.\n  We have offered amendments on the Senate floor to put the 9/11 \nrecommendations into law so we will be safe at home. Sadly, they were \nrejected on partisan rollcall. But I can only hope that soon we will \nreturn to the bipartisan spirit of 5 years ago when we worked together. \nIt would be in the best interests of our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n[[Page S9602]]\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for \ncalling my attention to page 63. I don't see the information there. It \ndoes, on page 65, talk about George Tenet saying the intelligence \nindicates that the two sides at various points discussed safe haven, \ntraining, and reciprocal nonaggression. And in the report there are \nthree instances of contact cited between al-Qaida and the Iraqi \nGovernment.\n  I also would just follow up on my statement that some of us in this \nbody were misled by the inaccurate intelligence estimates presented to \nus by the community. For example, I see this classic statement:\n\n       When you look at what Saddam Hussein has had at his \n     disposal in terms of chemical, biological and perhaps even \n     nuclear weapons, we cannot ignore the threat that he poses to \n     the region and the fact that he has fomented terrorism \n     throughout his reign.\n\n  That was from Senator Dick Durbin on ``CNN Larry King Live,'' on \nDecember 21, 2001.\n  But I think we want to get back to the port security bill. I have \nbeen asked by Leader Frist to pass along from a letter just received \nfrom CIA Director GEN Michael Hayden.\n  General Hayden said:\n\n       The amendment offered by Senator Reid, seeks to declassify \n     and make public CIA internal communications that include \n     personal commentary and judgment. We hold these kinds of \n     cables to the highest standard of secrecy within our \n     organization, and would only share them outside of CIA under \n     certain specific conditions.\n       I provided this information over the objection of many of \n     my officers, after receiving assurances from the Chairman \n     that it would be treated as highly sensitive material. That \n     is why I am so disappointed that this amendment is being \n     considered at this time. In addition, I am deeply \n     disappointed that some have already characterized the cable's \n     contents in the media.\n\n  He also talks about the information coming in from Chiefs of Station.\n  He said:\n\n       No COS has ever written one of these cables expecting it to \n     be made public, and no COS will use his channel again without \n     fearing it will become public, if Congress demands \n     declassification.\n\n  He also said:\n\n       Further . . . it contains pre-decisional executive branch \n     information.\n\n  Finally, he said:\n\n       Lastly, a critical way in which our Nation gathers \n     intelligence is with the support of our liaison partners. If \n     these partners fear that their support for CIA activities \n     will be made public, it will make them reluctant to cooperate \n     with my agency. This will, I assure you, curtail the \n     intelligence made available to the CIA and could create gaps \n     in the final intelligence made available to policymakers. I \n     ask your help in defeating this effort in the Senate, and for \n     your help in protecting both CIA's sources and methods as \n     well as our ability to work cooperatively with the Oversight \n     Committees.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACT1NG PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Port Security Act \nof 2006, the underlying bill we are discussing in the Senate here this \nafternoon.\n  I want to start by commending the steadfast dedication of my \ncolleague, Senator Murray, from the State of Washington, and Senator \nCollins for their hard work in moving this legislation through the \nSenate, and certainly Senator Stevens and Inouye for their leadership \non this issue.\n  I want to say that Senator Murray has done great work both here in \nWashington, DC, and at home in the State of Washington to close \nsecurity gaps. And I have enjoyed working with her to make sure that \nour ports in Washington State are more secure.\n  Port security ought not to be an afterthought or an extra security \nmeasure when we are talking about securing our borders or securing our \ncommunities. It should be one of our key priorities. Washington State \nknows how critical these ports are to our economy and to our way of \nlife. There are ports all along our shore lines from Seattle to \nVancouver, Bellingham, and other cities. They create jobs. They drive \neconomic growth for the entire northwest. And in the Seattle-Tacoma \narea, the ports are the third-busiest in the Nation, with over 11,000 \ncontainers passing through Seattle and Tacoma daily.\n  That's more than 4 million containers a year. That is more than \n100,000 workers in the Puget Sound area including longshoremen and \nfreight forwarders and others who depend on the ports of Seattle and \nTacoma for their jobs. And certainly they want to see them safe and \nsecure. Last year the ports of Seattle and Tacoma combined to move more \nthan $45 billion in revenue from imports and $12 billion in U.S. \nexports. But these are not just the homes--these ports--to \ninternational trade.\n  Puget Sound is also the home to America's largest ferry \ntransportation system, with more than 26 million passengers and 11 \nmillion vehicles traveling throughout Puget Sound and to and from \nBritish Colombia. Despite these numbers of trade and economic \ndevelopment and of passenger movement and cargo container movement, \nthere are still clear vulnerabilities.\n  For too long, too little has been done, I believe, to protect our \nports and to improve the protections on our ferries. This bill will \ntake a step forward on both of those issues. Right now we are \ninspecting the contents of less than 3 percent of the more than 6 \nmillion containers entering our country each year. Most of this \ninspection occurs after the container is off loaded and sitting on the \ndocks of a U.S. port. The reality is that by then it is too late. And \nso working on point-of-origin issues is very important as my \ncolleagues, Senators Murray and Collins understand.\n  The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which Senators Coleman \nand Levin lead, issued a report in March that stated we are only \ninspecting 0.34 percent of all containers destined for the United \nStates overseas and of those that were considered high-risk containers, \nwe are only inspecting about 17.5 percent.\n  Given this low inspection rate, it is really no surprise that each \nyear we find illegal immigrants stowed away on cargo containers \ndestined for the United States. This spring, 22 Chinese stowaways were \napprehended at the Port of Seattle. So if illegal immigrants know that \nthey have a good shot at entering the United States in cargo containers \nbecause of our failure to inspect the contents, it ought to be no great \nleap of imagination to expect that terrorist organizations might also \nhave the same idea. In fact, the C.I.A. has reported that a weapon of \nmass destruction is most likely to be delivered in the United States by \na cargo container entering a seaport. But the problems extend beyond \nour failure to inspect cargo.\n  We have no standards for container locks and seals. We have \ninadequate funding for critical research and development of screening \ntechnology. We have no international security standard for conducting \nterror and background checks on port workers. That is why, again, the \npoint-of-origin issue and working internationally is so important.\n  The accuracy of cargo manifest information submitted to customs is \nalso a major problem, especially when we're using this information as \npart of a system--the Automated Targeting System or ATS--to identify \nhigh-risk cargo. We recently, at the Port of Seattle had this made \nclear to us. That is when in August, Customs identified two suspicious \ncontainers and set them aside for inspection. They thought that there \nwere things contained in there that bomb-sniffing dogs detected were \nexplosives. Thankfully for us in the Puget Sound area, it was a false \nalarm.\n  But it made all too clear the potential for disasters at our ports \nwith today's standards. With the high risk of terrorists placing \nweapons of mass destruction in containers during transit, we need to \nbegin securing container doors with tamper-proof locks and seals, \ninstead of what we are doing today, which sometimes can often be just a \n10-cent zip lock or the equivalent.\n  Many containers are filled with cargo from more than one source, \nwhich also makes this transfer and tracking challenging. In fact, \nduring a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, the CEO of the \nPort of Seattle, Mic Dinsmore, put it this way--quote--``as ships make \nits way to the U.S., it might well stop at several other ports. \nThroughout this process, at least seven different handlers may have \naccess to the containers before it even arrives in the United States. \nEvery stage in the supply change creates additional hurdles for \nmonitoring this cargo.''\n  That's why we need to make improvements as this legislation does, to\n\n[[Page S9603]]\n\nimprove the systems that hold the shippers accountable for accurate \ninformation like is required under the Customs-Trade Partnership \nAgainst Terrorism. C-TPAT is a good start. But as has been reported, \nthere is more to be done, particularly validating the participants of \nthis program. Senator Murray has been a leader in this area in working \nwith Operation Safe Commerce, a program to identify ways to better \nsecure the supply chain, including cargo containers. But these threats \nare real, and we can't wait any longer.\n  This legislation makes important critical improvements to the current \nregime. It authorizes $400 million for port security grants and it \nmakes improvements to the Container Security Initiative, a program that \nis important right now for inspecting cargo, as I said, at the point of \norigin; and with the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism \nprogram, the public-private initiative that secures that supply chain.\n  This legislation directs the department to establish minimum \nstandards for container security, and it authorizes the Department of \nHomeland Security to accelerate the deployment of radiation detection \nequipment. It also authorizes the testing of systems to improve \nscanning of containers overseas. To make this possible, I was proud to \ncosponsor this legislation earlier this summer in directing the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to conduct a pilot program where we \nhave seen at the Port of Hong Kong good result from this technology \nthat I think will help us move closer to our goal for 100 percent \ncontainer inspection.\n  Now, this pilot program is just initiated at three foreign ports, and \nwe will need to work hard at expanding it. This underlying bill also \nincludes language to us in improving the screening for our ferry \nsystems in Washington state, particularly those coming into the United \nStates from Canada. Right now some ferry runs from Canada aren't being \nscreened for explosives before departing for the United States. In an \nF.B.I. Report in 2004, the National Threat Assessment named vehicle-\nborne explosives as the type of weapon that al-Qaida would most likely \nuse for a maritime attack. The lack of explosives screening not just \nimpacts the passengers on board the ferries, but those communities and \ncoastal regions where this ferry transportation exists. That's why this \ninclusion in the underlying bill is so important for us in the \nnorthwest.\n  To build on many of the other critical provisions in this bill, there \nare two amendments that I offered that were included. The first would \nimprove inspection of foreign ports, the point of origin for cargo \nentering the United States. The U.S. has an obligation to ensure that \nour international strict security standards and a way to enforce them.\n  We're only going to be as safe as the inspection process that our \nforeign partners implement. The Coast Guard is authorized under the \nMaritime Transportation Security Act to conduct inspections of foreign \ncountries and their ports to validate their compliance with the \nInternational Ship and Port Facility Security code, ISPS.\n  Currently the Coast Guard only has 34 inspectors as part of the \nagency's international port security program to review the more than \n140 countries that are shipping cargo to the United States. To date the \nCoast Guard has only been able to inspect ports in about 59 out of \nthose 140 countries. We need to reinforce this relationship. We need to \nmaintain a standard with these foreign governments, these ports, these \nprivate sector entities to ensure that we have adequate intelligence \nand security measures and that they are in place before these ships \nheave and are destined for the United States. That is why I am proud to \nsponsor an amendment with Senator Snowe, the chairwoman of the Coast \nGuard Subcommittee that would authorize the Coast Guard to add \nadditional personnel to complete the inspection of foreign ports by the \nend of 2008 and maintain a 2-year cycle for reinspection. Currently the \nCoast Guard maintains a reinspection cycle about every 4 to 5 years, so \nthis basic step, I believe, is critical to gathering adequate \ninformation--gathering adequate information about cargo entering the \nUnited States before it reaches our ports. It also helps us identify \ncountries who are not compliant with International standards and helps \nus identify those high-risk vessels and cargoes. But we have to also \nimprove at home our ability to scan for those containers that are going \nto be loaded onto rail cars.\n\n  So the second amendment, that I am glad that the managers of this \nunderlying package have accepted, directs the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to establish an Intermodal Rail Radiation Detection Test \nCenter and test technology that can scan containers on rail for \nradiation. Now, currently, the U.S. Customs officials do not scan \ncontainers that are loaded directly on to rail. For us in the Pacific \nNorthwest, this is an important issue since so much of our cargo comes \nthrough our Ports and onto rail systems and is then moved throughout \nthe United States. Though scanning containers transported on rail cars \ndoes present a formidable challenge, we must step up to that challenge.\n  The 2006 Government Accountability Office report on combatting \nnuclear smuggling stated ``to speed seaport development and to help \nensure that future rail deployments proceed on time, we recommend that \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security in cooperation with the Commissioner \nof C.B.P. develop procedures for effectively screening rail containers \nand implementing new technologies to facilitate this.''\n  Just a few weeks ago, I had a chance to tour the Pacific Northwest \nNational Laboratory in Richland, WA, where they are teeming with \ncustoms and--teaming with customs and border protection to develop and \ntest this technology to scan rail transport containers for radiation. \nMany container ports and transport--container ports and transport \ncompanies are moving to on-dock rail systems to reduce the costs and \nimprove efficiency and lessen the Environmental impact of using trucks. \nSo more and more of the container business is moving towards rail. For \nexample, the Port at Tacoma helped lead the way in this transition as \nthe first port in the U.S. to develop an on-dock intermodal rail yard. \nSo today, approximately 72 percent of the cargo arriving at the Port of \nTacoma is transported by rail directly from the terminal. So we want to \nmake sure that there is a screening process available that will help us \nmake sure that the United States in cargo rail-transported shipments \nare more secure. This underlying language in the bill will help us get \nthe right technology test done and the right deployment of the \ntechnology.\n  Since 9/11 we have taken many steps to enhance security \ninfrastructure of our seaports, but further improvements can and must \nbe made. We know the challenges that are facing us, and we know what \nwould happen if a terrorist struck our ports. Millions in my State \nlive, work, and commute around Puget Sound. Many are mere yards from \nthe port, making it a very devastating impact on the populace of Puget \nSound. If such an environmental disaster would happen. And the economic \nimpact, I should say, would also be disastrous. We saw in 2002, when \nthe west coast had a closure of a few of our ports, it cost our \nnational economy $1 billion a day. So the Ports of Seattle, Tacoma, \nVancouver, Everett and our other major ports are gateways to supplies \nand products corning to the entire Nation through the State of \nWashington. Without them, everything from jobs, productivity and \neconomic growth slows down or stops. By making a real commitment to \nimproving security at our ports and the cargoes that move throughout \nour country, we will have a more secure Nation. We will create jobs and \na faster economic growth for the entire country. So I want to commend \nthe managers of this legislation for their commitment in moving this \nlegislation at this time and continuing to push on this difficult task. \nBut I also want to remind my colleagues, as one port security expert \nsaid, Stephen Flynn of the Council on Foreign Relations--quote--``We \nare living on borrowed time.''--So I believe the measures in this Port \nSecurity legislation are long overdue, and I hope my colleagues work to \nsee it passed this afternoon.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4995 and I ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4995.\n\n(Purpose:) To require the placement of balss-resistant cargo container \n                 on all commercial passenger aircraft)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. BLAST-RESISTANT CONTAINERS.\n\n       Section 41704 of title 49, United States Code, is amended \n     by adding at the end the following: ``Each aircraft used to \n     provide air transportation for individuals and their baggage \n     or other cargo shall be equipped with not less than 1 \n     hardened, blast-resistant cargo container. The Department of \n     Homeland Security will provide each airline with sufficient \n     blast-resistant cargo containers 90 days after the Department \n     of Homeland Security's pilot program is completed''.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Is this amendment \ngermane?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment is not germane.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I make a point of order that it is not germane.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The point of order is sustained.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very disappointed. We have looked \nthrough this bill and we have seen an amendment that we believe gives \nSenators the opening to offer this. It was coming from the other side. \nIt was the Burns amendment that dealt with an issue close to this. I \nwill not argue that.\n  What I say to my colleagues today is this: We are very fortunate we \nhave a homeland defense bill before the Senate. We are very fortunate \nSenators Collins and Murray work in a bipartisan way on a homeland \nsecurity bill that deals with port security. We are further blessed \nthat Senators have the guts to step up and offer amendments dealing \nwith rail security and transit security. They were agreed to, thereby \nbroadening the scope of this bill.\n  However, it is amazing to me that after we have observed and marked \nthe fifth anniversary of September 11 we would turn away from a simple \namendment that I am offering, which costs as much money as it takes for \nthe war in Iraq in 5 hours--5 hours of the war in Iraq. We could take \nthat amount of funding and make sure that on every passenger plane in \nthis country that carries cargo there would be at least one blast-\nresistant cargo container.\n  Everyone lauded the 9/11 Commission. Let's see what they said about \nthis.\n\n       The TSA should require that every passenger aircraft \n     carrying cargo must deploy at least one hardened container to \n     carry any suspect cargo.\n\n  That is the 9/11 Commission Report. That is dated July 22, 2004.\n  The other side is objecting on some thin parliamentary threat and \nhiding behind it. It is outrageous. I cannot wait to tell the people of \nthis country that for 5 hours of the cost of the war in Iraq, every \nairplane that has cargo\n\n[[Page S9606]]\n\nwould have at least one blast-resistant container so that if there is a \nbomb on that plane it will be contained. because only the suspect cargo \nwould go into that particular container.\n\n  I do not understand what we are doing here. We have a good bill. We \ncan make this bill better. The first thing I heard from my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle is, oh, they did not want the airlines \nto have to pay the $15,000 per container--$15,000. It is a $150 million \naircraft, but they did not want the airlines to pay $15,000. Fine. I \nsaid we will make sure the Transportation Security Agency gets those \ncontainers to the airlines. That is fine. That is fair.\n  The Homeland Security Department now has a test program. We know \nthese things work. So let all of America hear it today. For all the \ntalk about the 9/11 Commission Report and how great it was and how fair \nit was and how bipartisan it was, how good it was, how clear it was, \nthis very simple recommendation that every passenger aircraft carrying \ncargo must deploy at least one hardened container to carry any suspect \ncargo, this Republican Senate would not allow a vote.\n  You are going to hear all kinds of words about why it is not germane, \nand we are doing something else somewhere else. Do you know what? This \nis simple. This would do the trick. This is not costly. It would not \neven rate an asterisk in the Federal Government.\n  So I am very sad to see that we cannot vote on this amendment. But I \nwill be back another day with it. You can be sure of that.\n  I thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on \nthe motion to table the Schumer amendment No. 4930 occur at 4 p.m., \nwith no second degrees in order prior to that vote. I further ask \nconsent that following that vote, the bill be read a third time, and \nthe Senate proceed to a vote on passage of the bill, with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, if I could just ask that Senator Schumer \nbe given 2 minutes to speak prior to the vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I modify my request to ask that there be \n4 minutes equally divided.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to there being 4 \nminutes equally divided between both sides before the vote?\n  Ms. COLLINS. No objection, and I so modify my request.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, before that time commences, I want to \nanswer the Senator from California. Canine teams are the most effective \nway to screen cargo transporter and passenger planes. Dogs can screen \nlarge quantities of cargo more quickly than any other available \nmethods. One dog team can screen all the cargo on a 777 in 13 minutes.\n  Now, there is just no reason for these containers that the Senator \nfrom California wants to use, no reason to permit high-risk cargo \naboard an aircraft. The hardened containers would only be able to \ncontain a blast of limited quality of explosive material and would only \nbe available for wide-body aircraft.\n  That amendment is not pertinent to this bill. This is not an airplane \nbill. This is not an aircraft bill. It is not an airline bill. It is a \nport and railroad security bill. That is why I objected. And I thank \nthe Chair for ruling it was not germane.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if I may respond, this is not my idea, I \nsay to my good friend from Alaska, with whom I have had many good \ndebates. This is a recommendation of the 9/11 Commission. We all know \nthere are sniffing dogs going through the airports. I voted to make \nsure that happened. But we also know we are talking about a layered \ndefense.\n  I want to know what the Senator from Alaska would say if this cargo \nblew up on a plane. I do not think he would be down here saying: Well, \nI supported making sure we had canine teams. I will tell you right now, \neither we are going to do homeland defense or we are not.\n  The Senator is right, this is a port security bill. But we have \nbroadened it. I know he was not thrilled about that, and neither was \nthe other manager. They wanted to keep it to port security. Why? Why \nnot keep our people safe, not only when you are dealing with port \nsecurity but with air security and rail security and transit security?\n  So this idea I have laid out here is not my idea. It is directly from \nthe \n9/11 Commission Report. And let the Record show that all kinds of talk \nabout, oh, how safe we are because we have the canine teams, that is \njust part of a layered defense. The 9/11 Commission knows this, \nunderstands this.\n  It would have been very simple to have a vote on this amendment and \nadd this very simple, inexpensive addition to this bill. But I guess it \ngoes back to what Mr. Chertoff said the other day. I guess it just is \nnot a priority. He said: Oh, we are going to go bankrupt protecting \nthe people. I am basically paraphrasing what he said. Bin Laden wants \nus to go broke, he said. No. Bin Laden wants to kill us. Yes, he wants \nto kill us.\n\n  So why are we walking away from a 9/11 Commission recommendation that \ncosts as much as 5 hours of the war in Iraq? The Record will show what \nhappened here today.\n  Mr. President, I thank you and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4942\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I just want to say a few words about \nan amendment, No. 4942, that was accepted in the managers' package.\n  On April 28 of this year, the administration announced a plan to \ncheck ``all individuals seeking access to port facilities. . . .'' They \nwanted to check all individuals seeking access to port facilities. The \nplan was to check these individuals' names against the terrorist watch \nlist and to check for citizenship status. But a major loophole was \ncreated when it intentionally left out port truck drivers from this \nprocess.\n  Now, we are reminded that when the first attack on the World Trade \nCenter, in 1993, took place, the explosives were hidden in a van. When \nthe Murrah Building in Oklahoma City was blown up, the explosives were \nhidden in a van. And not to recognize that these trucks entering a port \narea could be carrying anything--whether it is taking cargo containers \nout of the port that had been brought to our shores from foreign ports \nor whether it is taking an empty cargo container back into the port--my \ngosh, you could almost hide a tank in one of those.\n  So to me it really did not make sense when the Department of Homeland \nSecurity's excuse was that it was simply too hard to do, to vet all of \nthese truck drivers who come in, and get them an ID card to show they \nhave been checked for any security concerns. Certainly, I do not think \nthat is a valid excuse when it comes to protecting us from a terrorist \nattack. ``Too hard'' is never an acceptable reason. Just look at our \nbrave troops in Iraq and in other places, places of great danger. No \none is saying it is too hard. They are doing their duty to protect all \nof us and our interests.\n  One of the largest truck driver labor organizations in the world \nfully supports my amendment. They know they have nothing to hide, and \nthey want to know that their workplaces are secure from terrorism.\n  The amendment simply requires that the IDs of truck drivers who have \naccess to secure areas of ports be checked against terrorist watch \nlists and to confirm their American citizenship.\n  Earlier this year, DHS Customs Enforcement agents did an \ninvestigation of port truck drivers. Of about 10,000 port truck drivers \nworking in the Port of New York and New Jersey, almost half had \ncriminal histories. Some had been charged with the possession of \nmillions of dollars of stolen pharmaceutical goods, or trying to \nsmuggle cocaine and Iranian carpets into the United States.\n  This failure to check port truck drivers along with all other port \nworkers is\n\n[[Page S9607]]\n\na dangerous shortcut. It is unacceptable. When it comes to protecting \nour security, we do not seek shortcuts. We do not want to. We want full \nmeasures taken to keep us, our families, our constituents, and the \npeople in the area safe.\n  I want to thank the manager, the Senator from Maine, and Senator \nStevens from Alaska for accepting this amendment. It will help make \nsure our attempts for security are better fulfilled. I thank them. and \nI thank the chairman for working with me on this important issue. I \nunderstand there may be concerns with some technical aspects of my \namendment, but I think it is clear that everyone here recognizes the \nproblem of not checking port truck driver names against the terror \nwatch list and for citizenship status.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I agree and I commit to working with the Senator to see \nthat we do our best to make this law.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4930, as Modified\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there are \n4 minutes equally divided between the proponents and opponents of the \nSchumer amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I will yield myself 1 minute, and then I \nwill reserve a minute for after Senator Schumer speaks.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to table the \namendment offered by the Senator from New York, which would require \n100-percent scanning of all 11 million cargo containers entering the \nUnited States, regardless of whether they are incredibly low-risk \ncontainers or high-risk containers.\n  Now, the amendment that was adopted yesterday, the Coleman amendment, \nprovides for 100-percent scanning of high-risk containers. The bill \nbefore us has a pilot program in three foreign ports to find out: Is it \nfeasible and practical? Is the technology available? Can we, in fact, \ndo 100-percent scanning without significantly slowing the flow of \ncommerce? Right now it appears that we cannot do that. The technology \nis not there. But eventually we will be able to get to that goal. The \napproach in the Schumer amendment ignores the technological limitations \nwe now have.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator reserves the remainder \nof her time.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time be equally divided.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Let me say this amendment is a very simple one. It says within 4 \nyears we must have all of our cargo inspected for nuclear weapons. We \nhave been trying to do this for 5 years--close to 5 years--and what we \nhave gotten is a lot of studies, pilot projects.\n  And now I have seen it with my own eyes. Others have here, too. It \ncan be done. It is done in Hong Kong on two lines. It costs about $8--\nonce it is fully going, per container, nothing because it costs $2,000 \nto send a container over.\n  This does not cost the taxpayers any money. And this is the \ngreatest--greatest--terrorist act that could befall us: a nuclear \nweapon smuggled into this country and exploded, God forbid. Can any one \nof us say we have done everything we can to stop it? No.\n  The fact that this amendment has drawn such controversy and has \nfocused attention on the issue has shown that when you put in a \ndeadline, you get things done.\n  When you do pilot projects and studies--especially because Department \nof Homeland Security has not done a very good job in this, the most \nimportant of areas--you will get delay. If you want to wait another 5 \nyears, vote against this amendment. But if you care about protecting \nthe security of America and preventing the greatest act of terror that \ncould befall us, you will vote for this amendment to impose deadlines--\nbecause we know it can be done--and make our country more secure once \nand for all. We cannot afford to wait any longer, Mr. President.\n  I urge a ``yea'' vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine is \nrecognized for 1 minute.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, once again, I will explain the provisions \nof the bill. It has a layered system of security for our cargo and, by \nthe end of next year, it requires that the 22 busiest ports in the \nUnited States, which handle 98 percent of all cargo containers, will \nhave installed the equipment to screen for radiation, for radiological \ndevices, including a nuclear device. So it is not just studies and \nplans, as the Senator from New York repeatedly says; it has specific \nmandates.\n  The Coleman amendment, adopted yesterday, requires 100 percent \nscreening and scanning of all high-risk containers. But the fact is \nthat we do not yet have feasible, efficient, practical technology in \nplace to allow us to do 100 percent scanning of all containers without \nsignificantly slowing container movement, producing a backlog, and \nharming our economy.\n  I move to table the Schumer amendment, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second? There \nis a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

The Senate will come to order. \nSenators will please take their conversations off the floor.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that each side have 5 minutes, \njointly, to make final statements on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Hearing none, there is 5 \nminutes equally divided.\n\n\n                          Land Ports Security\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, securing our seaports against terrorist \nthreats is a critical issue, and I commend Chairman Collins and Senator\n\n[[Page S9608]]\n\nLieberman for their hard work on the bill we are debating today, the \nPort Security Improvement Act of 2006. Senators Collins and Lieberman \nhave negotiated this bill not only with members of the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee but also with members of \nthe Commerce and Finance Committees; they deserve our thanks for their \ntireless efforts.\n  While seaports are the focus of this bill, I would like to point out \nthat land ports are equally important ports of entry into this country; \nthey also suffer security gaps, and they also receive attention in this \nbill. Right now, about 11 million containers enter this country by ship \nthrough our seaports; another 11 million containers enter this country \nby truck through our land ports. According to the Department of \nHomeland Security, DHS, for example, the northern border has 6 of the \ntop 10 truck border crossings in the country, including the No. 1 \ncrossing point in the Nation, the Ambassador Bridge in Detroit. In \nfact, the Ambassador Bridge is currently the largest trade link that \nthe United States has with another country, connecting Detroit, MI, and \nWindsor, Ontario with nearly 10,000 trucks crossing daily transporting \ngoods worth nearly $110 billion per year. Over 60 percent of all trucks \ncrossing the northern border take place in southeast Michigan.\n  Over the past 5 years, we have increased border staffing and security \nalong our land borders and made progress in installing radiation \ndetection equipment at land ports of entry. Today, for example, 100 \npercent of all trucks entering Michigan are screened by radiation \ndetection equipment. But there is more to be done; we need better \nequipment to detect currently hard-to-detect nuclear materials and to \nanalyze currently unreadable cargo images, such as images of trash \ncontainers on trucks entering the United States from Canada. Among \nother provisions, this bill directs the Secretary of DHS to enhance \ncargo security research, which I support.\n  The bill also takes a number of other steps to improve container \nsecurity at land ports of entry, even though land ports are not the \nprimary focus of this bill. Chairman Collins, am I correct that a few \nprovisions in the bill would strengthen container security at both the \nland ports of entry as well as the seaports?\n  Ms. COLLINS. You are correct, Senator Levin. The bill contains \nprovisions which would strengthen security measures for containers \ntransiting either land or sea ports of entry.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is my understanding that the following provisions in \nthe bill, for example, would apply to all containers, whether they \nmoved by truck or by ship: section 201, which would call on the DHS \nSecretary to establish a strategic plan to enhance the security of the \ninternational supply chain; section 211, which would codify the Customs \nTrade Partnership Against Terrorism Program; section 301, which would \nestablish the Office of Cargo Security Policy; and section 303, which \nwould increase research into ways to strengthen cargo security.\n  Is it your understanding that these provisions would apply to \ncontainers traveling through both the seaports and land ports?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Yes, it is the intent of the bill that those provisions \napply to all containers, whether transiting U.S. seaports or land ports \nof entry.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank you for your time and for helping me to underscore \nan important point, that this bill would strengthen security measures \nfor all types of shipping containers, at both sea ports and land ports \nof entry.\n\n\n                                 twics\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for working with me \non this important amendment. The amendment that I offered and which is \nincluded in the managers' package codifies the current proposed \nregulations governing the issuance of transportation worker \nidentification credentials--often known as TWIC cards. My amendment \nwould codify in statute a number of offenses which would bar \nindividuals from receiving TWIC cards if they have been convicted, or \nfound not guilty by reason of insanity, of a number of particularly \nheinous offenses. The amendment would also bar individuals from holding \nTWIC cards if they have been convicted of or found not guilty by reason \nof insanity within the last 7 years or have been incarcerated in the \npreceding 5 years for certain other offenses. This amendment will \nprovide the Nation with assurances that the hard-working men and women \nat our ports are trustworthy.\n  It is my understanding that this language will be the Senate position \nin conference and that my colleagues will fight to protect this \nlanguage and to ensure that the conference report contains the DeMint \namendment.\n  I am particularly pleased to hear that Cochairman Inouye has agreed \nto fight for this amendment in conference. Is that understanding \ncorrect?\n  Mr. INOUYE. The Senator is correct that his amendment will be the \nposition of the Senate. I can assure the Senator I will work to protect \nthe Senate position in conference.\n  Mr. DeMINT I thank my colleagues for working with me on this \namendment and look forward to the port security bill's passage.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate adopted amendment \nNo. 4951, which I offered to the Port Security Improvement Act of 2006, \nto require all recipients of grants from the Department of Homeland \nSecurity--DHS--to report to the Department on the expenditures made \nfrom these Federal funds.\n  I offered this amendment in response to recent testimony by the U.S. \nGovernment Accountability Office--GAO--which found it difficult to \ntrack expenditures made from the $11 billion in Federal grants awarded \nto States and localities to improve emergency preparedness, response, \nand recovery capabilities. Specifically, William O. Jenkins, Jr., \nDirector of the GAO's Center for Homeland Security and Justice, stated \nthat, ``What is remarkable about the whole area of emergency \npreparedness and homeland security is how little we know about how \nstates and localities (1) finance their efforts in this area, (2) have \nused their federal funds, and (3) are assessing the effectiveness in \nwhich they spend those funds.''\n  Currently, the Department requires States and localities applying for \ngrants to submit an ``Investment Justification'' outlining \nimplementation plans and detailing how the Federal funds are expected \nto be used to meet homeland security goals, objectives, and \ncapabilities. Additionally, the Department requires States and \nlocalities that receive funds to file a Categorical Assistance Progress \nReport twice a year on how the Federal assistance allocations were used \nto meet homeland security goals and objectives. However, grant \nrecipients are not required to disclose specific homeland security \nexpenditures.\n  Early in the formation of DHS, grant recipients were required to \nreport expenditures for homeland security equipment, plans, training, \nor exercises. This amendment will simply reinstate the requirement. \nWith such a process in place, I hope DHS and the GAO will be able to \nreport to Congress, and the American taxpayers, on the effectiveness of \nthe grant programs and the use of Federal funds.\n  I am pleased my colleagues joined me in supporting this amendment to \npromote greater accountability and transparency in the use of \ntaxpayers' money.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to support passage of H.R. 4954, the \nPort Security Act. This bill will improve security at our ports and it \nis a step in the right direction. It will invest more money and \ncoordinate programs to improve cargo screening, hire more personnel to \nincrease physical security at ports, require background checks for port \nworkers, and expedite deployment of radiation detection equipment to \nprevent the smuggling of nuclear material into our ports. All of these \nmeasures represent a better and smarter approach towards port security \nand homeland security generally. But we need to do much more.\n  It has been 5 years since the 9/11 attacks and sadly we still have \nmuch more to do to prevent a repeat of that catastrophe. We are \ntroubled that this Congress has failed to implement many of the changes \nsuggested by the 9/11 Commission more than 2 years after their final \nreport. For example, the Commission urged us to improve border security \nthrough a more efficient entry-exit screening system. Despite the \nnational outcry to beef up border\n\n[[Page S9609]]\n\nsecurity as we have seen during the ongoing immigration debate, we have \nyet to adequately address this problem.\n  The 9/11 Commission also recommended that we develop smarter plans to \nsecure not only our air transportation system but also our rail and \nmain transit systems. As the terrorist attacks in Madrid in 2004 and \nLondon in 2005 taught us, terrorists are more than willing and able to \nattack our trains, buses, and subway systems.\n  And even though we have spent billions to better protect air \npassengers, we must better screen for explosives in checked baggage and \nair cargo. The plot to use liquid explosives uncovered by British \nintelligence services in August revealed that we are unable to properly \nscan for all explosives. We can and must do more to protect these \nvulnerabilities against attack.\n  Unfortunately, what needs to be done to improve homeland security is \nnot limited to the transportation sector. For example, we must also do \nmore to improve security at our nuclear powerplants and chemical \nfactories. Study after study has shown that a tragic attack on one of \nthese facilities could kill thousands of Americans.\n  Such a bleak assessment of what still needs to be done--a full 5 \nyears after 9/11--should gravely concern us. It is no wonder that a \nmajority of Americans do not feel safer. According to an ABC News poll \ntaken last week, 74 percent of Americans said they were concerned about \nthe possibility of more major terrorist attacks in the United States. \nThat same poll also found that 60 percent said more should be done to \nstop terrorists from striking again. Clearly, public sentiment demands \nthat we improve homeland security. Passage of the port security bill \nwill demonstrate that we can work together to make America safer. While \nthis marks progress, it is just one piece of a much larger homeland \nsecurity puzzle that we need to tackle. This must be our No. 1 priority \nand I urge my colleagues to continue working together towards this \ngoal.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is about to \npass the Port Security Improvement Act of 2006.\n  This week our Nation observed the tragic anniversary of September 11, \n2001. Five years after that horrific attack on our country, we honor \nthose who lost their lives, and pay tribute to the heroism of the first \nresponders who selflessly risked, and even gave, their lives in the \nrescue and recovery missions. Since that day, Congress has taken some \nactions to improve domestic preparedness and readiness, but there is \nmuch more we must do to help protect Americans from the threat of \nterrorism on our own soil. We must finish the job of implementing the \nbipartisan September 11 Commission's recommendations, including \nstrengthening the security of our ports. Let us not get sidetracked \nfrom what should be our No. 1 priority, the fight against terrorism, \nand this port security bill is a key component in that fight.\n  Ports are a critical part of our Nation's infrastructure and an \nattack on our ports would have devastating consequences for the U.S. \nand the global economy. It is therefore of the utmost importance that \nour ports have adequate security measures put in place. That is why I \nsupported a number of good provisions in this port security bill, such \nas the establishment of minimum security standards for all cargo \nentering the U.S., the requirement of radiation screening at the 22 \nbusiest U.S. ports, and increased funding for the important port \nsecurity grant program.\n  I was especially gratified to support the Murray amendment that \nextends certain Customs and Border Protection fees. While this might \nnot appear to be much on first glance, this amendment was the \ndifference between just authorizing these improved protections and \nproviding the funding to put them in place. And it provides this \nfunding in a responsible manner without adding to the deficit.\n  I was disappointed that the Senate rejected an amendment offered by \nSenator Schumer, which I cosponsored, that would prohibit foreign cargo \nfrom entering the U.S. unless the container has passed through an \nintegrated scanning system and be tested for nuclear and radiological \nmaterials. This amendment would require, within two years, every \ncontainer entering the U.S. from a foreign port designated under the \nContainer Security Initiative--CSI--to be scanned before being loaded. \nThis would cover the vast majority of transatlantic and transpacific \ncargo and be scaled up to scan all cargo within 4 years.\n  I was also disappointed that the Senate rejected the amendment \noffered by Senator Menendez that would have required the Department of \nHomeland Security to develop a plan to incrementally increase the \namount of cargo scanned for all threats until 100 percent of cargo was \nexamined. Congress needs to finish the job of implementing the \nbipartisan 9/11 Commission's recommendations to improve our national \nsecurity, including heightened screening of cargo that passes through \nour Nation's ports.\n  I also supported the amendment of Senator Reid, which contained a \nnumber of important provisions addressing national security needs that \nare not addressed in the underlying bill. It is unfortunate that the \nSenate was unwilling to expand the scope of the bill to consider other \nmatters relevant to fighting terrorism and protecting Americans. While \nI did not support every provision in the Reid amendment--it did not do \nenough to put this administration's flawed Iraq policy on the right \ncourse, for example--the Senate missed an important opportunity when it \nrejected that amendment.\n  Mr. President, I will vote for this bill because it provides funding \nfor many important port security needs. However, our Nation's \nvulnerabilities demand more and I will continue to work to ensure that \nour vital homeland security needs are met.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, as this Congress comes to a close, it is \nimportant to ask: Have the Congress and the White House done everything \npossible to make the American people safe?\n  Unfortunately, I am afraid the answer is ``No.''\n  Just over a year ago, we all witnessed in horror the tragically inept \nresponse to Hurricane Katrina. Despite claims that DHS and FEMA had put \ntheir house in order after the Hurricane, just last week a GAO report \nraised concerns that adequate safeguards are still not in place to \nproperly respond to a catastrophe.\n  Despite the fact that the 9/11 Commission gave 5 Fs and 12 Ds in its \nfinal report, an appalling number of the Commission's recommendations \nhave still not been implemented--including recommendations regarding \nemergency preparedness and response, transportation security, border \nsecurity, and intelligence reform.\n  Too many of our first responders still lack adequate equipment, \nresources, communications interoperability, and--just as important--\ntraining. Making matters worse, as local law enforcement agencies are \nforced to take on more homeland security responsibilities, the \nadministration keeps proposing cuts to law enforcement funding.\n  Our borders are broken and lawless, allowing millions of people to \ncross the border without the government knowing who they are or why \nthey are here. Meanwhile, border security programs remain under-funded \nand the National Guard has been strained to the limit.\n  Funding for air cargo security has declined by about 25 percent over \nthe past 3 years, while a comprehensive baggage screening system is not \nexpected to be in place until 2024.\n  Incredibly, there are still no minimum standards regulating security \nat our chemical facilities which remain vulnerable to attack. For \nreasons which I cannot understand, the Republican leadership has either \nrefused or been unable to schedule floor time for a strong, bipartisan \nchemical security bill which has already been reported out of \ncommittee.\n  The American people deserve better. They deserve a Congress that will \nput partisan politics to the side and put homeland security first. So \nwhile I am proud to stand here and support this important, bipartisan \nport security bill, I do so with the understanding that it is only a \nfirst step on the long road toward adequately protecting our homeland.\n  Almost 5 years to the day after the September 11 attacks, more than 2 \nyears after the 9/11 Commission warned us about the need to address \nport security, and more than half a year after the Dubai Ports World \ncontroversy\n\n[[Page S9610]]\n\nbrought port security to the front pages, the Senate is finally \naddressing this important issue.\n  The wait is unfortunate, because the issues at stake are serious. \nOver 11 million shipping containers enter the United States via our \nports each year. Those containers carry roughly 2.4 billion tons of \ngoods worth more than $1 trillion--and some expect those numbers to \ndouble over the next 20 years. It goes without saying that an attack on \nour ports would cause economic catastrophe.\n  The average shipping container originating overseas will pass \nthrough, on average, over a dozen intermediate points before it arrives \nin the U.S.--each providing an opportunity for terrorist infiltration. \nWeapons smuggled into the country through one of our ports could cause \nunspeakable loss of life.\n  Only about 6 percent of containers arriving at U.S. ports are \ncurrently inspected before they enter the country and that we do not \nhave a comprehensive plan to restart the economy in the event of a \nterrorist attack on our ports.\n  So I am happy that we have finally taken up this important, \nbipartisan piece of legislation--and I commend Senators Collins, \nLieberman, Murray, Inouye, and Stevens for their leadership on the \nissue. And while the legislation isn't perfect, it would take important \nsteps toward securing our ports and protecting our economy.\n  First, I am pleased that the bill establishes a pilot project in 3 \nforeign seaports to screen every container entering the United States \nfrom those ports. This is a long-overdue first step.\n  I am also pleased that the bill requires the screening for \nradiological material of each container entering the United States.\n  The bill also includes important provisions requiring DHS to develop \nenhanced protocols governing the resumption of trade in the event of an \nattack on our ports and a comprehensive strategic plan regarding \nmaritime cargo security.\n  I am also pleased that the bill improves and expands key port \nsecurity programs such as the Container Security Initiative and the \nCustoms-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism; and that it authorizes \nimportant risk-based port security grant programs.\n  Improving our port security isn't impossible. Just look at Hong Kong. \nWhile we inspect only about 6 percent of incoming containers, the port \nof Hong Kong has implemented new screening procedures that achieve 100 \npercent inspection. While this bill won't get us to 100 percent \ninspection overnight, it is an important--and long overdue--first step.\n  Furthermore, I would like to thank my colleagues for supporting my \namendment to create a Rural Policing Institute--RPI--at the Federal Law \nEnforcement Training Center, FLETC. FLETC does a fantastic job training \nFederal, State, and local law enforcement officials. But FLETC does not \nhave sufficient resources dedicated specifically toward training rural \nlaw enforcement officials. So the Rural Policing Institute would \nevaluate the needs of rural and tribal law enforcement agencies; \ndevelop training programs designed to address the needs of rural and \ntribal law enforcement agencies, with a focus on combating meth, \ndomestic violence, and school violence; export those training programs \nto rural and tribal law enforcement agencies; and conduct outreach to \nensure that the training programs reach rural and tribal law \nenforcement agencies.\n\n  As Attorney General, I learned that a small investment in law \nenforcement training can pay great dividends. By ensuring that our \nrural and small town law enforcement officers have the training they \nneed to protect their communities, the RPI will help law enforcement \nagencies better protect the safety and security of their communities.\n  Finally, I am proud to cosponsor an amendment that would make the \nTransportation Technology Center, Inc.--TTCI--in Pueblo, CO, a part of \nthe National Domestic Preparedness Consortium--which is the principal \norganization through which the Department of Homeland Security \nidentifies, develops, tests, and delivers training to state and local \nemergency responders.\n  The TTCI does an outstanding job training first responders from the \nrail and mass transit sectors, the chemical industry, government \nagencies, and emergency responders from around the world. Each year, \nroughly 1,700 first responders go to Pueblo to participate in TTCI's \noutstanding training programs. TTCI's inclusion in the National \nDomestic Preparedness Consortium will allow it to improve its already \noutstanding services.\n  Our first responders are the finest in the world, and they deserve \nthe best possible training and facilities. This bill is an important \nstep in that direction.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Senate is about to pass the Port \nSecurity Improvement Act of 2006. This important legislation is the \nresult of months of hard work between the Committee on Finance, which I \nchair, the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, and the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. I thank again \nChairman Stevens and Chairman Collins, as well as Senator Coleman, \nSenator Inouye and Senator Lieberman, and of course Senator Baucus, the \nranking member on the Finance Committee, for coming together with me to \nproduce a significant and balanced piece of legislation that advances \nboth the trade and economic security interests of our Nation.\n  As I have noted previously, those who intend harm to our Nation seek \nto inflict economic as well as physical injury. We must be mindful of \nboth concerns as we defend the homeland. I am pleased to say that we in \nthe Senate have done our part. The committees of jurisdiction came \ntogether, worked together, and produced a bill that will empower the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, and in particular the U.S. Customs and \nBorder Protection, to better meet the dual responsibilities of securing \nthe homeland and protecting the economic security of our Nation. Our \nlegislation has been on the floor for a week, during which the Senate \nhas worked its will. I look forward to working out our differences with \nthe House so that we can get this legislation to the President's desk \nas soon as possible.\n  I want to take a moment to thank the many staff who have worked so \nhard and so long to make this legislation a reality. On the Finance \nCommittee, that begins with my chief counsel and staff director, Kolan \nDavis, whose skilled leadership is key to the advancement of my agenda \non the committee. My international trade counsel, Stephen Schaefer, \ndeserves special mention. Stephen is a very smart trade counsel, a \ncreative problem solver, and a dedicated public servant. Tiffany \nMcCullen Atwell, my international trade policy adviser, also deserves \nspecial mention. Tiffany was tireless in her efforts and a very strong \nand effective advocate for the Finance Committee. Together, their hard \nwork and advocacy contributed significantly to the development of this \nlegislation. I also want to recognize the other members of my trade \nstaff, David Johanson, who serves me as international trade counsel, \nand Claudia Bridgeford, my international trade policy assistant. Their \nsupport is critical to my success.\n  Senator Baucus's trade staff also deserves recognition. The \nDemocratic staff director on the Finance Committee, Russ Sullivan, and \nthe deputy staff director, Bill Dauster, worked well with my staff \nthroughout the process. I also appreciate the efforts of Brian Pomper, \nSenator Baucus's chief, international trade counsel, and in particular \nSenator Baucus's international trade adviser, Anya Landau, who worked \nso closely and so well with my staff in this effort. And I want to \nacknowledge the other members of Senator Baucus's trade staff, \nDemetrios Marantis, Chelsea Thomas, Janis Lazda, and Mary Lisa Madell.\n  Finally, I would like to thank Polly Craighill, senior counsel in the \nOffice of the Senate Legislative Counsel, for the many hours she put \ninto drafting and improving this legislation. Not only is Polly a \nperfectionist, but she also drives others to meet her high expectations \nand for that I am personally grateful. The bill before the Senate is \nmuch improved by virtue of her patience, dedication, and expertise.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to offer a comment on an aspect of \nthe port security bill, included in the managers' package. The IP-\nenabled voice communications and public safety provisions will \nencourage the use of E-911\n\n[[Page S9611]]\n\nby Voice over Internet Protocol providers. I want to thank Senator \nStevens for removing language from the initial amendment that would \nhave delayed implementation of this public safety program. The \nprovisions that were removed would have needlessly endangered lives. \nAccordingly, the modification was essential. As Americans increasingly \nuse IP-enabled voice communications, there is an increasing necessity \nto ensure these callers have access to their local 911 public safety \nanswering points in case of emergency.\n  The language of the initial amendment would have provided gaping \nloopholes for VoIP providers to avoid 911 obligations. It would have \ndelayed the Federal Communications Commission's rules regarding \nimplementation of 911 requirements on VoIP providers; grandfathered \nsubscribers who signed up prior to December 31, 2005--meaning those \nsubscribers would not be assured that when they called 911 they would \nreach their local first responders; and would have authorized other \nbroad ``waivers'' from the rules.\n  I want to thank the firefighters--specifically the International \nAssociation of Fire Chiefs and the International Association of Fire \nFighters--for bringing these important public safety concerns with the \ninitial amendment to our attention. Through their diligence, we have an \namendment that will promote the deployment of critical 911 services, \nrather than delay it. This is crucial to assist America's first \nresponders, including local fire, EMS and police officials, in their \nefforts to save lives.\n  As the port security bill moves forward, it is critical that the \ncompromise reflected in this important public safety amendment be \nmaintained. I appreciate the assurances made by the managers to protect \nthis important compromise. All Americans deserve the very best \nemergency response system. This amendment now helps accomplish that \ngoal.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, today, the Senate accepted an important \namendment to this port security bill to protect longshoremen and \nprivate sector marine terminal operators from any adverse consequences \nthat could result from government cargo screening activities. The \namendment was coauthored by Senator Kennedy and myself, and I thank the \ndistinguished Senior Senator from Massachusetts for his leadership on \nthis issue. I also thank the floor managers, Senators Collins, Stevens, \nColeman, Lieberman, Inouye, and Murray for their vital assistance.\n  After September 11, Congress mandated that the administration begin \nscanning shipping containers upon their arrival at U.S. ports. In \nresponse to this congressional mandate, U.S. Customs has begun using \nso-called ``VACIS machines'' to screen cargo on U.S. marine terminals. \nThese machines are enormous imaging systems that use gamma ray \ntechnology to produce radiographic images of the contents inside the \nshipping containers. Some of these systems are truck mounted and can be \npassed over containers and others are operated by actually driving the \ncontainer through the machine. With these devices, Government officials \ncan determine the possible presence of many types of contraband. \nEventually, every port in the country will have the machines on site.\n  There is no question that these machines are crucial to our port and \nnational security, but they also have the potential to expose maritime \nworkers to low levels of radiation. The National Academy of Science \nrecently concluded that exposure to any additional radiation above \nbackground levels poses an incremental risk to the exposed individual.\n  This incremental risk of exposure to radiation, regardless of how \nsmall, is enough to trigger significant liability for employers under \nthe Longshore and Harbor Worker's Compensation Act.\n  The amendment that I offer today addresses the issue of this low \nlevel radiation exposure in two ways: First, it requires the Secretary \nof the Department of Homeland Security to develop and implement new \nprotocols to protect the safety of port workers. If indeed it is \npossible that radiation exposure can be further reduced, hopefully to \nzero, we should do so. The tens of thousands of dedicated maritime \nworkers in this Nation's ports deserve nothing less than to know that \nthe Federal Government has done everything possible to prevent any \nexposure to additional radiation caused by these cargo screening \nmachines.\n  The second part of the amendment allows the operators of marine \nterminals nationwide to receive financial reimbursement if their port-\nbased employees become ill due to the low levels of radiation emitted \nby these machines.\n  Unfortunately, if we do not include this amendment today, maritime \nemployers will be on the hook for thousands of radiation exposure \nclaims because the Federal Government exposed their workers. Congress \nhas placed the operators of marine terminals in a no-win situation. On \none hand, we are asking the industry to support Government port \nsecurity efforts, while on the other hand leaving them vulnerable to a \npossible litany of radiation exposure claims from their workforce if \nthey do cooperate.\n  If a port worker believes that he or she was harmed because the \nFederal Government exposed the worker to radiation, the worker's \ncomplaint is with the Federal Government, not his or her employer.\n  Accordingly, I only ask for fairness for the businesses that operate \nmarine terminals in Savannah, Boston, Seattle, and other American \nseaports. These businesses are in no way responsible for any radiation \nhazard brought about by congressional mandate. All these businesses \nhave done is cooperate with the Federal Government. Therefore, this \namendment also stipulates that the Federal Government should reimburse \nemployers for any employee claims of injuries caused by exposure to \nradiation.\n  In closing, I thank Senator Kennedy and his staff and the floor \nmanagers and their staff for their assistance with this important \nmatter.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support, urging \npassage of the Port Security Improvement Act. As an original sponsor of \nthis measure, I am hopeful we will have a full and vigorous debate, but \nultimately pass this important legislation for Virginia and America.\n  The Port of Virginia is a vital part of Virginia's economy, and its \nsecurity is key to continued economic prosperity of Virginia. Recently, \nI visited the Norfolk International Terminals to see and receive \nbriefings on what has been implemented to secure our port against \nterrorism and other illicit activities. Fortunately, the Virginia Port \nAuthority has been proactive in assessing its security needs and \nimplementing plans and infrastructure to meet those requirements. The \nPort of Virginia is on the leading edge of port security, which will \nhelp ensure the flow of commerce, but more importantly will ensure the \nsafety of the American people. The Port of Virginia is an outstanding \nexample for other ports around the country and the Port Security \nImprovement Act will help move other port facilities in that direction.\n  Following the September 11 terrorist attacks, our Government \nlogically focused first on protecting the Nation's airports and \ncommercial airlines. In the years since, we have received disturbing \npredictions and reports on the vulnerability of our Nation's ports. \nClaims that a nuclear weapon could be smuggled into the U.S in a \ncontainer or that a biological or chemical weapon could be disbursed \nthrough our port system are grim reminders that must remain vigilant \nagainst this threat.\n  Since 9/11, the Congress and the administration have taken a number \nof steps to strengthen security at America's ports. We have required \nadvance manifests, so we know what is supposed to be in containers \nreaching U.S. shores. Our Government has also negotiated agreements \nwith dozens of countries to allow Customs and Border Protection, CBP, \npersonnel to inspect loaded ships destined for the United States. And \nwe have employed scanning devices at ports around the country to detect \nradiation emanating from cargo. And while there is often talk that \ncargo entering the U.S. is not being scanned, the fact is that 70 \npercent of cargo arriving at U.S. ports is scanned by CBP for \nradiological material.\n  These and a number of other initiatives have vastly improved the \nsecurity at our ports. However given the gravity of the threat from al-\nQaida and other terrorist groups, we must continue to take steps to \nmaximize our ability to\n\n[[Page S9612]]\n\ndetect and prevent potential future attacks.\n  To do so, the Senate Commerce, Homeland Security and Finance \nCommittees have collaborated to craft the Port Security Improvement \nAct. This legislation outlines the next steps the federal government, \nport authorities and cargo shippers need to take to protect our \ncountry.\n  The bill provides that the Department of Homeland Security, DHS, \ndevelop and implement a plan to deploy radiation detection capabilities \nto the Nation's 22 busiest ports by 2007. In addition, the measure \noutlines future requirements to make sure cargo entering the U.S. by \nvarious modes of transportation is properly scanned and random physical \nsearches are carried out where appropriate.\n  In the years since September 11, much has been made about how we \nguarantee the people entering our ports or working at out ports are not \na security threat. Also, many questioned how we make sure credentials \nto enter ports cannot be duplicated. Our legislation, this bill, the \nPort Security Improvement Act would implement the Transportation Worker \nIdentification Credential, TWIC, that DHS has been working on for the \nlast few years. TWICs would be required at the 10 busiest ports by 2007 \nand the next 40 strategic ports by 2008.\n  Global trade has become the engine of the U.S. and global economy and \nour ports are the gateways that keep our economy vibrant. We all agree \nthat security of our ports is paramount, but we must also address how \nnew requirements impact the flow of commerce. The Port Security \nImprovement Act allows DHS to establish a Customs-Trade Partnership \nAgainst Terrorism--CTPAT--program that will allow importers to \ncooperate with the government to secure their own supply chain. \nDepending on the level of cooperation and security, importers would \nreceive a lower risk assessment as part of the algorithm DHS uses to \ndetermine what cargo requires further inspection. This provides a \nreasonable choice for importers--if you are as forthcoming as possible \nand your risk for delay will dramatically decrease, if not, your cargo \ncould be held up to ensure its contents are safe.\n  We cannot ask State and local officials to fund these security \nimprovements without assistance. However as stewards of the taxpayers, \nwe have an obligation to use their hard-earned money as effectively as \npossible. Our bill would amend existing law so that future grants are \nallocated on a risk basis. This is an important change that will ensure \nwe are addressing the areas most likely to come under attack.\n  We have made real progress in securing our ports in the last few \nyears. And yet we all understand we still must do more to protect the \nAmerican people. Passing the Port Security Improvement Act is the way \nto do that. I urge my colleagues to supports its passage.\n  In closing, I would like to thank Chairwoman Collins for her steady \nleadership on this issue. It has been a pleasure working with Senator \nCollins. She has worked diligently to build consensus among all \ninterested parties and has produced a bill that strikes the right \nbalance on security requirements and incentives. Senator Collins \ndeserves all our admiration and gratitude for her considerate, \noutstanding steering of this significant measure that will protect \nAmerica.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Port Security \nImprovement Act because our country's ports are vital to our national \nsecurity, military capability, and economy. Our economy depends on \nmoving goods via our ports and rail. Our security depends on ports that \nare safe and protected from attacks. We must pass this bill to keep our \nports and America safe.\n  Since 9/11, we have a new world order. We are fighting a global war \non terror. Ports are now a high-threat target for terrorism. We need to \nkeep our ports safe from those with predatory intent. Approximately 11 \nmillion containers come into the United States each year and 19,000 \ncontainers daily. Shippers declare what is inside, but who really knows \nwhat is in there. It could be weapons or explosives.\n  We need to improve our port infrastructure. This means providing \npersonnel training and installing better gates and security cameras. We \nmust also upgrade our technology. We need tamper-proof latches on \ncontainers to prevent terrorists from slipping bombs or weapons into a \ncontainer. Yet Federal aid for port security is Spartan and skimpy. The \nPresident provided no funding for port security grants in his budget.\n  The Port of Baltimore just celebrated its 300th anniversary. The port \nis a part of me. My great-grandmother came to American through the port \nof Baltimore. Growing up, the port was part of my life. The \nlongshoremen, truckdrivers and Merchant Marines who worked at the port \nwere my neighbors. They were hard working, patriotic Americans. They \nshopped at my father's grocery store. I knew the history of the port \nbecause it was the history of my community.\n  The Port of Baltimore is an economic engine for Maryland and America. \nIt creates jobs, including 42,000 maritime-related jobs in Maryland and \nalmost 20,000 direct jobs. The port generates nearly $6 billion a year \nin salaries and revenues.\n  I have been fighting to upgrade and protect our Port of Baltimore for \nmore than 20 years. In the beginning, it was fixing the twists and \nturns in our channels that were a safety risk. Today, it is threats \nthat were unthinkable years ago. Keeping our port and our people safe \nfrom terrorism is one of my top priorities. I have fought for more port \nsecurity funding in Baltimore to upgrade entry gates and perimeter \nfencing, install new surveillance equipment, and purchase new patrol \nboats. The Coast Guard estimates that $8 billion is needed to address \nport security nationwide. Congress needs to listen to the Coast Guard \nand provide the needed funding to protect our ports.\n  This bill is good for the Port of Baltimore and America. It would \nprovide $400 million in port security grants when President Bush \nprovided no funds for these grants. Last year, the Port of Baltimore \nreceived $1 million in port security grants, but they need $7 million. \nIt needs these funds for surveillance and explosive detection \nequipment, perimeter security, and computer equipment to collect cargo \ninformation. This bill would also install radiation detection equipment \nat the 22 largest ports in the United States, including Baltimore. It \nis the 14th largest port for foreign cargo. This equipment is vital to \ndetect dirty bombs and to protect the people of Maryland and the \ncountry.\n  We need to make sure the Port of Baltimore and all ports across \nAmerica are safe, secure, and growing. The Port of Baltimore is vital \nto Maryland's future because an investment in the port is an investment \nin the State's economy. I am proud that this is the 300th anniversary \nof the port, but we need to make sure that the next generation \ncelebrates the 400th anniversary. Mr. President, it is time to make \nport security a priority in the Federal law books and the Federal \ncheckbook. I urge passage of this critical and long overdue \nlegislation.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the attached \nletter from the Supply Chain Security Coalition be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                         SCSC,\n\n                                                September 7, 2006.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \n         Affairs,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: We understand that the Senate will \n     take up port security legislation in the very near future. We \n     are writing to express the Supply Chain Security Coalition's \n     support for strong legislation that will improve the security \n     of our ports and the global supply chain, while also ensuring \n     the continued strength and vitality of the U.S. economy. \n     Toward this end, we worked to help pass H.R. 4954, the SAFE \n     Ports Act, which the House of Representatives approved on May \n     6, 2006 on a vote of 421-2. It is our hope that the Senate \n     legislation will closely mirror those aspects of the House \n     bill that build upon the multi-layered, risk assessment model \n     currently used by the Department of Homeland Security and \n     which have worked to keep our ports safe for the last several \n     years.\n       However, while we strongly support improving the security \n     of our nation's ports, we will oppose any proposal or \n     amendment that would require all U.S. bound cargo containers \n     to be scanned for radiation and density, so called ``100% \n     scanning'' amendments. Such amendments would require every \n     container to be scanned in a foreign port before the \n     container is loaded on a vessel destined for the U.S. Such a \n     mandate is unrealistic\n\n[[Page S9613]]\n\n     and could potentially decrease security by forcing containers \n     to sit for extended periods of time, which would then put \n     them at greater risk of tampering. A 100 percent scanning \n     mandate would also divert resources away from the current \n     successful risk assessment approach, which utilizes \n     sophisticated risk-analysis tools to determine which \n     containers may pose a risk and ensures that those containers \n     are handled appropriately. Finally, such a mandate has the \n     potential to significantly impede the flow of commerce. \n     According to the World Shipping Council, when the U.S. \n     Customs and Board Protection Agency (CBP) currently scans \n     questionable cargo, it takes 1-3 days to release that \n     container back into the stream of commerce. With 11 to 12 \n     million containers entering the U.S. every year, it is \n     obvious that a mandate of 100% scanning has the potential to \n     do significant damage to the flow of goods and to the U.S. \n     economy.\n       Rather than mandating 100% scanning, we believe port \n     security legislation should authorize additional testing and \n     evaluation of scanning technology. Both the ``GreenLane \n     Maritime Cargo Security Act'' passed by the: Senate Homeland \n     Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the House-\n     approved SAFE Ports Act address this issue by calling for \n     pilot projects to test the effectiveness and operational \n     ability to conduct 100 percent container scanning. In \n     addition, the House bill requires the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security to conduct an evaluation of scanning systems, taking \n     into consideration false alarm rates and other operational \n     issues, the impact on trade, the need for international \n     cooperation, and the ability to integrate and deploy these \n     systems overseas. These provisions represent the best \n     approach to addressing this issue and will help to answer \n     important operational and economic questions that will be \n     critical to understanding how to effectively implement \n     improved container scanning.\n       We also urge the Senate to remember that current security \n     procedures do a great deal to ensure that U.S. bound cargo is \n     safe. The Customs and Border Protection Agency conducts \n     sophisticated analyses of shipment data for all U.S. bound \n     cargo before it is loaded on vessels. This is known as the \n     ``24-Hour Rule,'' and with this information, CBP conducts a \n     risk assessment through its Automated Targeting System to \n     determine which containers pose the highest risk. One hundred \n     percent of containers that are deemed to be ``high-risk'' are \n     then inspected. In addition, CBP is in the process of \n     deploying Radiation Portal Monitors (RPMs) at all U.S. ports \n     and plans to have close to 100 percent implementation by the \n     end of 2007.\n       We urge the Senate to pass legislation that builds on this \n     and the other effective procedures that make up the well-\n     established multi-layered risk assessment model used by the \n     Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Coast Guard, CBP \n     and other government agencies. Congress should outline \n     policies and goals and let DHS find the best and most \n     effective way to meet those goals. Before any technology is \n     mandated, the government should ensure the technology's \n     functionality and application. In addition, government must \n     continue to work with the private sector users of the system \n     to determine the best methods to deploy new technologies in \n     order to achieve maximum results.\n       We look forward to working with you on improving the \n     public-private partnership to enhance supply chain security. \n     And again, we urge you to oppose any amendment mandating 100% \n     container scanning.\n           Sincerely,\n       Agriculture Ocean Transportation Coalition.\n       Airforwarders Association.\n       American Apparel & Footwear Association (AAFA).\n       American Association of Exporters and Importers.\n       Coalition of New England Companies for Trade.\n       Food Marketing Institute.\n       Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America.\n       Free Trade Alliance.\n       Joint Industry Group.\n       National Association of Manufacturers.\n       National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors.\n       National Customs Brokers and Forwarders Association of \n     America.\n       National Fisheries Institute.\n       National Retail Federation.\n       Pacific Coast Council of Customs Brokers and Freight \n     Forwarders.\n       Panasonic Corporation of North America.\n       Retail Industry Leaders Association.\n       The National Industrial Transportation League.\n       Transportation Intermediaries Association.\n       Travel Goods Association.\n       Travel Industry Association.\n       United States Association of Importers of Textiles and \n     Apparel.\n       U.S. Business Alliance for Customs Modernization.\n       United States Chamber of Commerce.\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Port Security \nImprovement Act of 2006.\n  Imagine this scenario: Shortly after 9 a.m. on a beautiful autumn \nday, an improvised nuclear device explodes on the National Mall in \nWashington, DC. Within seconds, the U.S. Capitol and the White House \nare flattened and a plume of radiation spreads to the surrounding \nsuburbs. Intelligence sources quickly determine that this weapon was \nsmuggled through a United States port in a maritime container. \nUnfortunately, this horrific scenario is not just a plot for the \ntelevision show ``24''--it is the paramount security challenge facing \nour Nation and should be our foremost concern.\n  Many experts believe that a maritime container is the ideal platform \nto transport nuclear or radiological material or a nuclear device into \nthe United States. As the 9/11 Commission put it so succinctly, \n``opportunities to do harm are as great, or greater, in maritime or \nsurface transportation.'' Since 90 percent of global trade moves in \nmaritime containers, we can not allow these containers to be utilized \nto transport weapons of mass destruction. The consequences of such an \nevent would be devastating to our way of life and our economy.\n  For instance, the Congressional Budget Office at my request studied \nthe economic consequences of an attack upon the Ports of Los Angeles \nand Long Beach. CBO found our Nation's gross domestic product would \ndecline by about $150 million per day for each day these two ports are \nclosed, and that the annual cost of closing these ports would escalate \nto nearly $70 billion. While CBO did not analyze the cost to human life \nand property of such a terrorist attack, the economic impact of closing \nthe ports could be comparable to both the attacks of 9/11 and Hurricane \nKatrina. We cannot afford that type of devastation.\n  Instead, we must secure our supply chain before we pay the high price \nof an attack and seek the appropriate balance between two often \ncompeting priorities: security and speed. Former Customs and Border \nProtection Commissioner Bonner had the vision to address this grave \nthreat and balance those two priorities after the September 11 attacks. \nThis balancing act resulted in the creation of two prominent homeland \nsecurity programs--the Container Security Initiative, or CSI, and the \nCustoms-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism, or C-TPAT. CSI effectively \npushed our borders out by placing CBP offices in foreign ports to \ninspect containers before they reach our shores. C-TPAT exemplified a \ntrue public-private partnership, in which the private sector took a \nleading role in securing its supply chain. These programs alone are \nlaudable--but due to the sheer magnitude of the challenge of securing \nthe global supply chain--we must continue to improve upon these \npromising initiatives.\n  With that in mind, as chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, I have directed the subcommittee's 3-year effort to \nbolster America's port security and supply chain security. We have \nidentified numerous weaknesses in our programs that secure the global \nsupply chain. A brief overview of these problems illustrates the \nchallenges confronting these efforts:\n  In CSI, the subcommittee found that only a de minimus number of such \nhigh-risk containers are actually inspected. In fact, the vast majority \nof high-risk containers are simply not inspected overseas. To make \nmatters worse, the U.S. Government has not established minimum \nstandards for these inspections.\n  The subcommittee initially found that an overwhelming proportion of \nC-TPAT companies enjoy the benefits before DHS conducts a thorough on-\nsite inspection, called a validation. As of July 2006 this proportion \nhas improved considerably to where 49 percent of the participating \ncompanies have been subjected to a validation. But this still leaves 51 \npercent of companies that have not been subjected to any legitimate, \non-site review to ensure that their security practices pass muster.\n  The subcommittee found that DHS uses a flawed system to identify \nhigh-risk shipping containers entering U.S. ports. According to CBP \nofficials, this system is largely dependent on ``one of the least \nreliable or useful types of information for targeting purposes,'' \nincluding cargo manifest data and bills of lading. Moreover, the \nsubcommittee found that this targeting system has never been tested or \nvalidated, and may not discern actual, realistic risks.\n  Currently, only 70 percent of cargo containers entering U.S. ports \nare screened for nuclear or radiological\n\n[[Page S9614]]\n\nmaterials. One part of the problem is that the deployment of radiation \ndetection equipment is woefully behind schedule. As of August 29, 2006, \nthe Department of Homeland Security has deployed only 43 percent of the \nnecessary radiation monitors at priority seaports.\n  These are just a handful of the significant problems the Subcommittee \ndiscovered. In short, America's supply chain security remains \nvulnerable to proverbial Trojan Horse--America's enemies could \ncompromise the global supply chain to smuggle a weapon of mass \ndestruction, WMD, or even terrorists, into this country.\n  This legislation tackles these concerns--and many other weaknesses--\nhead-on.\n  Here are some highlights of this important legislation:\n  This bill addresses the problem of inadequate nuclear and \nradiological screening, by requiring the Secretary of DHS to develop a \nstrategy for deployment of radiation detection capabilities and \nmandating that, by December 2007, all containers entering the U.S. \nthrough the busiest 22 seaports shall be examined for radiation.\n  The bill will require DHS to develop, implement, and update a \nstrategic plan improve the security of the international cargo supply \nchain. In particular the plan will identify and address gaps, provide \nimprovements and goals, and establish protocols for the resumption of \ntrade after a critical incident.\n  Instead of the unreliable data that CBP currently demands to target \nhigh-risk containers, DHS would be required to identify and request \nessential information about containers moving through the international \nsupply chain.\n\n  Under this bill, DHS would be required promulgate a rule to establish \nminimum standards and to procedures for securing containers in transit \nto the U.S.\n  The bill provides ongressional authorization for the CSI program, \nempowering CBP to identify, examine or search maritime containers \nbefore U.S.-bound cargo is loaded in a foreign port. DHS would \nestablish standards for the use of screening and radiation detection \nequipment at CSI ports.\n  Congress also authorizes C-TPAT, the voluntary program that \nstrengthens international supply chain and border security and \nfacilitates the movement of secure cargo. The bill establishes certain \nminimum security and other requirements that applicants must meet to be \neligible for C-TPAT.\n  As you can see from this brief recap, this bill is wide-ranging and \naddresses many of the critical problems facing the security of our \nports. It is therefore crucial that we pass this important legislation.\n  Even if we pass this bill, however, our job is not yet done. We still \nneed to look to the future and develop even more effective and advanced \nprograms and technology. Last December, I traveled to Hong Kong to \nexamine the world's largest port. In addition to meeting the impressive \nCSI team and observing the close relationship between Hong Kong Customs \nand CBP, I examined a promising screening concept piloted by the \nassociation that operates Hong Kong's container terminal. There, \ncontainers are screened with both x-ray and radiation detection \nequipment.\n  Effectively screening containers with both an x-ray a radiation scan \nis the only definitive answer to the perplexing and most important \nquestion of ``what's in the box?'' However, in Fiscal Year 2005, only \n0.38 percent of containers were screened with a nonintrusive imaging \ndevice and only 2.8 percent of containers were screened for radiation \nprior to entering the United States. DHS' efforts have improved \nsomewhat from last year's paltry numbers, but we have more work to do. \nTo date, DHS still uses a risk-based approach that targets only high-\nrisk containers. While this approach is fundamentally sound, the system \nused to target high-risk containers has yet to be validated or proven \nto accurately identify high-risk containers. Moreover, the validity of \nthe intelligence used to enhance this system's targeting ability is \nincreasingly in question. Thus, we need to both enhance our targeting \ncapability and use technology to enhance our ability to increase \ninspections--without impeding the flow of commerce. I believe the Hong \nKong concept holds great promise to achieve this goal of enhancing \ninspections without impeding commerce.\n  While the United States currently inspects approximately 5 percent of \nall maritime containers, the pilot project in the Port of Hong Kong \ndemonstrates the potential to scan 100 percent of all shipping \ncontainers. Each container in the Hong Kong port flows through an \nintegrated system featuring an imaging machine, a radiation scan, and a \nsystem to identify the container. Coupling these technologies together \nallows for the most complete scan of a container currently available. \nThe Hong Kong concept or similar technology, which is described in \ndetail in this report, holds great promise and could lead to a dramatic \nimprovement in the efficacy of our supply chain security. These \nimprovements would help ensure that the threat of Trojan horse \ninfiltration by terrorists never becomes a reality.\n  I am pleased to say that this legislation develops a pilot program in \nthree foreign seaports, each with unique features and varying levels of \ntrade volume to test integrated scanning systems using non-intrusive \ninspection and radiation detection equipment. It requires full-scale \npilot implementation within 1 year after enactment and an evaluation \nreport would be required to be submitted to Congress 120 days after \nfull implementation of the pilot. If the pilot programs prove \nsuccessful, then full scale implementation would expeditiously follow.\n  The bottom line is this: we are safer now than we were yesterday, but \nwe are not safe enough. The question then becomes: how do we get there? \nIn the words of the hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, ``A good hockey player \nplays where the puck is. A great hockey player plays where the puck is \ngoing to be.'' In other words, we cannot safeguard a post-9/11 America \nby using pre-9/11 methods. If we think that the terrorists are not \nplotting their next move, we are mistaken. We must find where the gaps \nare in our Nation's homeland security and close them before an attack \nhappens. That is the only way to guarantee our security.\n  The Port Security Improvement Act of 2006 closes gaps in our homeland \nsecurity and makes us safer. In closing, I want to say that it has been \nan honor to work with such a distinguished and bipartisan group of \nSenators such as Senators Stevens, Collins, Grassley, Inouye, Baucus \nand Lieberman. This legislation is cogent and will be effective because \nof the knowledge and experience of this group of Senators. I am proud \nto be an original sponsor of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a Washington Post \neditorial dated June 1, 2006, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, June 1, 2006]\n\n                       The Right Kind of Security\n\n       It was the Dubai port uproar that didn't roar: When a House \n     committee voted this spring against an amendment that would \n     have required all cargo containers bound for this country to \n     be individually inspected in their ports of origin, Congress \n     temporarily put to rest what could have been yet another \n     hyped-up wave of politically motivated anxiety about American \n     port security. Although the House later passed a bill that \n     provides extra funding for nuclear screening and other \n     measures, Democrats vowed to bring up the inspection issue \n     again--and ran advertisements around the country attacking \n     Republicans who oppose it. Before the ``inspect every \n     container'' mantra becomes a national war cry, it's important \n     to point out that this is a terrible idea.\n       Someday, perhaps, advanced X-ray technology may be \n     developed to the point where it's possible to beam a scanner \n     at each one of the 11 million U.S.-bound containers at every \n     port in the world and obtain an instant assessment of what's \n     inside. But while some promising technologies are available, \n     none is perfect, and all of them require a human being to \n     analyze the scans. This not only takes time but also presumes \n     the existence of thousands of trained scan readers around the \n     world. In the absence of such workers, U.S. port and customs \n     authorities examine information about each container--where \n     it's coming from, which shipping company is carrying it--and \n     determine whether it is risky enough to merit inspection, \n     either here or abroad. In practice, this results in \n     inspections of about 5 percent of all containers. Even now, \n     U.S. customs officers must rely on the cooperation of foreign \n     authorities to carry out this many inspections.\n       Homeland security officials could do more. Only about half \n     of incoming containers are\n\n[[Page S9615]]\n\n     subjected to a radiation scan, a number that should rapidly \n     be brought up to 100 percent, as the new House bill requires. \n     Ports are also vulnerable because drivers and dockworkers are \n     not thoroughly screened. Raising the number of U.S. \n     inspectors in foreign ports could also make the inspection \n     system safer. But ``inspect 100 percent of containers'' is a \n     slogan, not a solution, and we hope lawmakers resist the \n     temptation to use it in the election season to come.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the port \nsecurity bill being considered before the Senate. This legislation is \nof particular importance to my home State of California, and I am \ndeeply grateful to Senators Collins and Murray and all the others who \nhave worked so diligently to craft this comprehensive and bipartisan \neffort to better protect our Nation's ports.\n  It is no secret that I have long considered security at our Nation's \nports to be a significant hole in homeland security. The global \nmaritime supply chain system is a vast network consisting of hundreds \nof ports worldwide moving millions of containers each year, and frankly \nI don't believe this Nation has done nearly enough since 9/11 to \nimprove the security of our ports.\n  As has been repeated many times on this floor, only 5 percent of \ncontainers entering the country are inspected, meaning that millions of \ntons of cargo move through our ports without serious scrutiny.\n  With its long coastline, California is vulnerable. My home State \nreceives containers from more than 750 different ports worldwide and is \nhome to the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, which is the busiest \ncontainer port complex in the entire United States, processing 7.2 \nmillion containers in 2005.\n  To highlight the risk we face, I cite a Rand Corporation report \nreleased last month. If a 10-kiloton nuclear bomb, hidden in a shipping \ncontainer, were to explode at the Port of Long Beach, it could kill \n60,000 people instantly, expose another 150,000 to hazardous levels of \nradiation, and cause $1 trillion in economic losses.\n  Needless to say, this is an issue of great importance to my \nconstituents and the economic welfare of the State. I believe strongly \nthat the need for action to better protect our ports is essential and \nit must happen now.\n  I am glad to say that this port security measure takes a number of \ncritical steps toward filling the gaps in security at our Nation's \nports.\n  This legislation directs the Department of Homeland Security to work \nwith State and local governments to create a strategic plan to secure \nour ports and prepare for a swift resumption of trade in the event of \nan attack. We learned by devastating experience during Hurricane \nKatrina what happens when Federal, State, and local governments do \nnot have an integrated plan for responding to and recovering from a \ncatastrophic event.\n\n  The bill authorizes $400 million in competitive grants to help ports \naddress security vulnerabilities, $1.2 billion for rail security \nimprovements, and $3.4 billion for mass transit security.\n  In addition, 1,000 more Customs and Border Protection agents will be \npatrolling our Nation's ports of entry thanks to this legislation.\n  But despite the advances of this legislation, there still remains \nmuch work to do.\n  We cannot stop until all containers are fully scanned for radiation \nand by other means including full x-rays of all containers. It was a \ndisappointment that amendments to initiate a plan for 100 percent \nscanning were rejected this week.\n  In fact, this bill does nothing substantive to increase the number of \ncontainers inspected before reaching our shores. It is clear to me that \nonly inspecting 5 percent of containers is unacceptable.\n  Moving forward, a clear test of this Congress will come when the time \narrives to appropriate funds for many of the programs authorized in \nthis bill, including grants for port security. To tell the truth, much \nof what is accomplished will be for naught if we don't provide the \nfunds necessary to get the job done.\n  As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I plan to do whatever I \ncan to make these funds available. They are simply too important to my \nState and too important to this Nation.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for their efforts on this bill and \nexpress my hope that we can continue to work towards filling the gaps \nin security at our ports.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, passage of this vital port security \nlegislation is a tremendous achievement, and I wish to extend thanks to \nmy hardworking staff members, Jason Yanussi and Josh Levy--as well as \nthe staff of all the involved committees--for all their effort to bring \nthis legislation to fruition.\n\n\n       Visit to the Senate by a Member of the Lebanese Parliament\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I want to announce to the Senate that we \nhave a visiting Member of Lebanon's Parliament, Mr. Misbah Ahdab, if \nany Senators would like to come by and say hello.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, we are on the verge of passing major port \nsecurity legislation that will provide the structures and resources \nneeded to better protect the American people from attack through \nseaports that are both vulnerable points of entry and vital centers of \neconomic activity.\n  I wish to thank all those who have been involved in this effort: the \nranking member of the Homeland Security Committee, Senator Lieberman; \nthe Commerce Committee chairman and ranking member; Senator Grassley \nand Senator Baucus on the Finance Committee. Most of all, I thank \nSenator Patty Murray, who has been my partner in the port security \nlegislation from conception to this day. It has been a great honor and \npleasure to work with her.\n  I have a list of the hard-working staff, my staff on the Homeland \nSecurity Committee, who have worked on this issue. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a list of their names be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Port Security Team\n\n       Rob Strayer, Mark Winter, Jon Nass, Allison Boyd, Amy Hall, \n     Melvin Albritton, Mark LeDuc, Jane Alonso, Ann Fisher, John \n     Grant, Asha Mathews, Kurt Schmautz, Jay Maroney, Amanda Wood, \n     Jennifer Hemingway, Sarah Taylor, Brooke Hayes, Kate Alford, \n     Amanda Hill, Priscilla Hanley, Monica Wickey, and Tom Bishop.\n       Detailees: Steve Midas, Coast Guard; Jennifer Boone, FBI; \n     and Mike Moncibaiz, CBP.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. I see our colleagues are eager to vote, so I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time? The Senator from Hawaii?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this is a bipartisan measure. I am proud \nto support this bill. I believe all that has to be said has been said. \nBut I would like to thank those on our side who have been helpful: \nDabney Hegg and her baby, Sam Whitehorn, Lila Helms, Gael Sullivan, \nStephen Gardner, James Assey, and Margaret Cummisky. Without their \nhelp, we would still be here.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I add my voice to all Senators who in a \nbipartisan way have helped move this bill forward.\n  They say that ``success has a thousand authors''--and that is \ncertainly true in the 5 years I have been working on port security.\n  First, I thank my partner, Senator Collins. Last May, I sought out \nSenator Collins because I knew she cared about port security. She had \nworked on it at the Homeland Security Committee and she had the \nknowledge and leadership to help us reach this milestone. She has been \na steadfast partner every day of the past 16 months that we have worked \ntogether, and I commend her and thank her.\n  Senators Lieberman and Coleman were right there with us shaping this \nbill in the early days and helping us move it forward.\n  I thank Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye at the Commerce Committee \nfor their hard work, leadership, and passion.\n  I thank Senators Grassley and Baucus for working with us on this \nbill.\n  I thank both of our leaders--for setting aside time so we could \ndebate the bill.\n  I thank all the leaders from the maritime community who have shared \ntheir ideas and expertise with me--Mic Dinsmore, Henry Yates, and Rod \nHilden at the Port of Seattle; Tim Farrell, Mike Zachary, and Julie \nCollins at the Port of Tacoma; and also leaders at the ports of New \nYork/New\n\n[[Page S9616]]\n\nJersey, Los Angeles, Long Beach, Charleston, Miami, and MassPort in \nBoston.\n  I want to thank security experts, especially Admiral James Loy and \nDr. Stephen Flynn, for their thoughtful input on our bill.\n  Finally, there are a number of staff members who helped shape this \nbill.\n  Brian White--who now runs Cargo Security Policy at DHS, and Michel \nBobb--who is at OMB--provided critical help.\n  I thank the outstanding floor staff on each side and staff from \nvarious committees who spent long hours all week working to make this \nbill better.\n  Thank you especially to: Dabney Hegg, Sam Whitehorn, Ray Shepherd, \nJason Yanussi, and Ken Nahigian.\n  Finally, from my own staff, Jason Park and Lesley Turner have been at \nmy side here on the floor along with Mike Spahn.\n  And I additionally thank Rick Desimone, Alex Glass, Pete Weissman and \nMatt McAlvanah from my staff.\n  I say to my colleagues, we are making a significant step forward in a \nbipartisan way this evening to finally make a difference on security in \nthis country. I want to tell the country we still have a ways to go in \ngetting it to conference, which I know will occur shortly, and to the \nPresident's desk, hopefully in a short amount of time as well. But I \nwill tell you this: America can sleep better because this Congress \nworked together, and I thank all my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I wish to express my appreciation to all the managers and \nparticularly Senator Murray, who has worked so hard, working with these \namendments through the last few days. We always say nice things about \nSenator Inouye, so that is nothing new. Senator Murray is a wonderful \nlegislator who does such a great job.\n  We look forward to going to conference. We are going to do our very \nbest to get a conference as soon as we can. It is not easy. We have \nmultiple committees of jurisdiction. I talked with Senator Sarbanes \nearlier today. Even Banking is now interested in being on the \nconference. We are going to do our best to work something out in the \nnear future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, securing our ports is vital to our \neconomy. More than 11 million cargo containers enter our country every \nday, and waterborne cargo contributes more than $742 billion to the \nU.S. gross domestic product. But our ports are not isolated commercial \noperations. Our waterways and ports are linked to 152,000 miles of \nrailway, 460,000 miles of underground pipelines, and 40,000 miles of \ninterstate highways. The bill the Senate will pass today not only \nstrengthens security at our land and seaports, it addresses trucking, \nrailroad, and pipeline security. I believe this is the most \ncomprehensive approach to border security we have taken to date. The \nprovisions of this bill will help ensure the safety of our Nation, our \ncities, and our system of commerce.\n  Mr. President, the passage of this port security legislation by the \nSenate today will mark the end of a long Senate bipartisan, 3-committee \nprocess of which we all may be proud. The Commerce, Homeland, and \nFinance Committees have tremendous knowledge about our ports and the \nprograms which protect and secure the international supply chain. It is \na credit to this Senate that each committee agreed to pool their \nresources, put aside jurisdictional issues, and develop a strong and \ncomprehensive piece of legislation.\n  I thank Senator Collins for her steadfast dedication to this bill, as \nwell as Senators Murray, Lieberman, Grassley, Baucus, and Coleman. And \nI particularly thank my great friend and Commerce Committee cochairman, \nSenator Inouye, for his lasting commitment to securing our Nation's \nports.\n  As I said, securing our ports is vital to our economy. More than 11 \nmillion cargo containers enter our country every day, and waterborne \ncargo contributes more than $742 billion to the U.S. gross domestic \nproduct.\n  But our ports are not isolated commercial operations. Our waterways \nand ports link to 152,000 miles of railways, 460,000 miles of \nunderground pipelines, and 45,000 miles of interstate highways. The \nbill the Senate will pass today not only strengthens security at our \nland and seaports; it addresses trucking, railroad, and pipeline \nsecurity. I believe this is the most comprehensive approach to border \nsecurity we have taken to date. The provisions in this bill will help \nensure the safety of our Nation, our citizens, and our system of \ncommerce.\n  This bill enhances current programs designed to gather and analyze \ninformation about cargo destined for U.S. ports, and significantly \nexpands on the current program for randomly scanning containers. This \nbill moves us toward 100 percent scanning of all cargo containers \nentering our country once the process becomes feasible.\n  This bill is essential to the security of our Nation. It is my hope \nthat the House and Senate will make this a priority and get it to the \nPresident soon.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a list of the \ndedicated staff who worked so hard with all of us, and I yield the \nremainder of our time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Committee Staff Involved With Port Security\n\n\n          HOMELAND SECURITY AND GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS COMMITTEE\n\n       Senator Collins's Staff: Rob Strayer, Mark Winter, Jane \n     Alonzo, Ann Fisher, Michael Bopp (former staff), Kathy \n     Kraninger (former staff), Melvin Albritton.\n       Senator Lieberman's Staff: Jason Yanussi.\n       Senator Coleman's Staff: Ray Shepherd.\n\n\n                           finance committee\n\n       Senator Grassley's Staff: Stephen Schaefer, Tiffany \n     McCullen.\n       Senator Baucus's Staff: Anya Landau, Brian Pomper, Mary \n     Lisa Madell.\n\n\n                           commerce committee\n\n       Senator Inouye's Staff: Dabney Hegg, Sam Whitehorn, Stephen \n     Gardner, Channon Hanna, Gael Sullivan.\n       Senator Stevens's Staff: Dave Wonnenberg, Ken Nahigian, \n     Pamela Friedmann (on detail from TSA), Mark Delich, Becky \n     Hooks.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on the \nengrossment of the amendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill (H.R. 4954) was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I will not take my colleagues' time for \nlong, but I draw attention to a situation that has further developed--\nor devolved and deteriorated--and that is the situation in Darfur. It \nis a situation this Senate has spoken to often. We have spoken on \nresolutions, on amendments; we have added funds.\n  What we have feared is now upon us. We are now seeing in the IDP \ncamps, the individuals that are displaced internally, diseases such as \nasthma, malaria, cholera and dysentery. We have had 12 humanitarian \nworkers killed in the last 2 months. That is driving a number of the \nhumanitarian groups out of the region. The NGO, the nongovernment \norganizations, currently now serve only 60 percent of the people they \nwere serving. The Government of Sudan has reportedly resumed aerial \nbombings taking place in the northern and southern parts of Darfur.\n  The situation is growing worse. We don't know how many people have \ndied already, but it is set to escalate rapidly. NGOs are fleeing \nbecause people are getting killed. The people are concentrated in the \ncamps. They are now not getting food and clean water.\n  Now we have cholera, more misery, malaria and the numbers of people \ngetting killed escalating dramatically. It is going to escalate further \nand more dramatically if we do not act.\n  We have the government in Khartoum saying they want the African Union \ntroops out.\n  We do not have a big enough force there now. They are scheduled to \nleave the end of September. We have a United Nations group that is \nforming to go in, and the government in Khartoum, Sudan, is saying, We \nare not going to let them in.\n  We have African Union troops preparing to leave. We have the U.N. \ntroops not yet prepared to come in or being allowed in. And we have \nchaos. There are a lot of people dying in this region. It is \nescalating. It is time we step up and push again.\n  This Senate has been excellent on this issue. The administration has \nbeen very good. I cite particularly Assistant Secretary Zoellick who \nspent a lot of time working on this issue, trying to bring people \ntogether, getting a peace agreement signed a couple of months ago. It \nwas an important peace agreement.\n  The problem that has taken place now, after the peace agreement was \nsigned, the African Union troops were starting to organize to pull out, \nthe government of President al-Bashir in the Sudan decided: This is our \ntime to take over because the rest of the world is looking at Lebanon, \nthey are dealing with Hezbollah, the United States is focused on its \nelection cycle. This is the time for us to move.\n  This is a very difficult, dire situation for people on the ground. I \nmet with a number of the aid organizations today. Their people are \ngetting killed, so they are pulling back, as I cited.\n  When this situation first started developing about 3 years ago, the \nvery situation we are most concerned about is a lot of people getting \ninto the displaced camps, not having access to clean water, disease \nspreading in the camps, spreading because of the concentration of \nindividuals and the lack of sanitation and clean water, and we really \nget a mess. That is now where we are.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank Senator Brownback for raising this issue. We are \nin a do-or-die moment. We have been there before. I am reading that \ncertain experts are saying in 2 weeks there could be another Rwanda.\n  I am very glad the Senator is speaking out. I was very glad this \nSenate did act, as we know, on a measure last week, actually voting to \nsend $20 million to the African nations to carry on, as my friend \npoints out. If they do not do it, there is a void. What will fill the \nvoid will be disease, rapes, killings and, I hate to say it, continued \ngenocide.\n  I am glad the Senator raised this. The hours are running short. We \ndid vote. It is important we use our bully pulpit in whatever way we \ncan. I personally will be going to the United Nations on Monday \nliterally to knock on doors. I am setting up some appointments. We have \nto do everything we can to prevent this worsening situation from \ngetting to the point where it is unsalvageable.\n  I thank the Senator for his efforts.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank my colleague for her interest. I wish her \nGodspeed in New York with the U.N.\n  My colleague in Connecticut will address this same topic. It is very \nimportant to speak. We need to pass the Darfur Accountability Act. It \nhas passed here and in the House. We need to resolve the issues.\n  It is important that the President, in his meetings at the U.N. for \nGeneral Assembly meetings, raise this issue. It is important to press \nthe Sudanese Government to stop the aerial bombings--they can do that \nfirst and foremost--and that the African Union forces stay until a U.N. \nforce is put in place, we pressure the Sudanese Government to accept a \nU.N. force, or, if not, put in targeted sanctions toward Sudanese \nofficials preventing traveling, dealing with their own personal \naccounts.\n  There are a series of recommendations of a number of Senators \naddressed in a letter to the President. It is a bipartisan effort. It \nis a genocide already. It is one that is set to become a far worse \nsituation.\n  We really need to act.\n  I yield to the floor to the set of speakers listed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I join my colleague from California in \nthanking Senator Brownback for bringing this issue forward. He has been \na tremendous supporter of taking action. He brings to light, tonight, \nthe fact we have to act and we have to act expeditiously.\n  As the situation deteriorates, unfortunately, it moves closer toward \na situation that we can do nothing about. I appreciate all of the \nSenator's efforts in what he is doing for the people of Darfur.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/14/senate-section/article/S9617-4", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9617-S9618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RURAL AMERICA MONTH\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I was so pleased this week as the \ndaughter of a seventh generation Arkansas farm family from rural \neastern Arkansas, and it is with a tremendous amount of pride I come to \nthe Senate today to applaud the passage of Senate Resolution 561 which \ndesignates September of 2006 as Rural America Month. I was pleased to \nintroduce this resolution last week with Senator Reid, Senator Frist, \nand many of my colleagues.\n  Rural America means a tremendous amount to this Nation. It is the \nplace where our values oftentimes begin and grow. We send people from \nrural America not just to the big cities of America, but all across the \nglobe to exhibit those American values that grow and begin in rural \nAmerica.\n  My values and my world view are directly tied to how I was raised in \na\n\n[[Page S9618]]\n\nsmall town in Helena, AR, on the Mississippi River. My upbringing gave \nme a deep and abiding love for the rural way of life. In rural America, \nyou learn that in order to have good neighbors, you have to be a good \nneighbor. Importantly, you learn by the example set for members of the \ncommunity.\n  Growing up, I lived within walking distance from both sets of my \ngrandparents. I learned what it meant to be a caregiver. At the age of \n14 I learned from my grandparents. I learned values, I learned stories \nof World War I and the experiences they had during the Depression and \nso many other things that I captured from a real perspective--not from \na textbook.\n  My mother would prepare dinner for our family every night, but very \noften she and my aunt would go back and forth and prepare a little bit \nextra every other night. It was my duty and my cousin's duty to take \nthat dinner up to my grandparents and spend time with them, valuable \ntime, where we would make them feel better, to share part of our day \nand they could share a story with us. I didn't realize at that age what \ncaregiving was all about. I do now.\n  Being a good neighbor is something that comes easily for rural \nAmericans. It is taught early in life. I am proud to have had the \nopportunity to learn that lesson by example. I see it as a model that \ncan be applied outside the family, outside the neighborhood and to so \nmany relationships that we, as people of a global community, have \naround the world, when we listen to the comments of Senator Brownback \nand Senator Boxer talking about our neighbors across the globe and what \nthat means to us, what our responsibility is as a global neighbor to \nthose people in such need of protection, of sustenance of life, of \neducation, and the ability to build for themselves a life of \nindependence.\n  My love for the rural way of life I grew up in, the values it taught \nme, is what drives me to want to strengthen and support rural \ncommunities all over our country. With the passage of this resolution \nthis week, the Senate has formally acknowledged the invaluable \ncontribution that rural America makes to our country.\n  The experiences in my life have shown me firsthand that the more than \n55 million people residing in rural America are the embodiment of the \nvalues that make our country great: community, service, hard work, \nfamily, responsibility.\n  Rural America provides significant contributions to our Nation, such \nas the safest, most abundant and affordable food supply in the world, \nas well as the renewable sources of energy with the potential to \nsignificantly reduce our country's dangerous dependency on foreign oil, \nnot to mention what we could do for our environment.\n  Americans residing in rural areas have also made a considerable \ncontribution to our country's freedom. Rural Americans comprise a \nsizable percentage of our reserve, military force abroad and the \nhighest concentration of military veterans live in rural communities.\n  Additionally, police officers, volunteer firefighters, EMTs or \nNational Guardsmen, and members of our rural communities come together \nin times of national emergencies to keep our country safe. I am \ncertainly reminded of the proud, strong, courageous firefighters, \nGuardsmen, ambulance drivers, and so many more that responded from \nArkansas to New York during September 11 and to Louisiana during \nKatrina and the entire gulf coast.\n  I am proud of my heritage in rural America. I am pleased the Senate \nhas acknowledged we owe rural America a considerable debt of gratitude. \nRural America is critical to this Nation.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to address the \nchallenges and the obstacles that rural America faces so all in rural \nAmerica can enjoy every blessing and opportunity that our Nation has to \noffer.\n  I commend my colleagues for joining me in this special effort. I want \nto especially commend our leader, minority leader Harry Reid, who grew \nup in Searchlight, NV, who knows and understands the mentality, the \nvalues, and really has a tremendous passion for those people in rural \nAmerica. I am proud to have joined he and Senator Frist and others in \nbringing this resolution forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/14/senate-section/article/S9618-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9618-S9620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ANN RICHARDS\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I also come to the floor today to pay \ntribute to one of the most important and unique individuals in the \nhistory of American politics, Governor Ann Richards.\n  As a female politician from the South, Ann Richards was a person who \nI considered to be a role model. She was a great American patriot who \nhad overcome tremendous obstacles to become a valued public servant \nwhile blazing a trail for aspiring female politicians, with wit, style, \nand grace like no one else could produce.\n  I consider it my good fortune to have come to know her over the years \nas a friend. While I am deeply saddened by her passing, it is so \ndifficult not to smile whenever I think of Ann. She was remarkably \ngifted at using her keen sense of humor to say exactly what was on her \nmind and to get her point across in an effective and quotable way, \nproving she was truly one of a kind.\n  Ann Richards became the first woman elected to statewide office in \nTexas in more than 50 years--winning a seat as treasurer in 1982. In \n1990, she became the first female to be elected Governor of the State \nof Texas.\n  As Governor, she took pride in the fact that she appointed more women \nand minorities to State positions than any of her predecessors. During \nher tenure, the Texas economy enjoyed growth, despite the trend of the \nslumping U.S. economy.\n  Additionally, her audits of the State bureaucracy saved Texans $6 \nbillion, and her reform of the State prison system resulted in fewer \nviolent offenders being released.\n  Perhaps her most remarkable achievement was maintaining the respect \nand admiration of Texans in the midst of not being reelected to office. \nThe poll numbers of her popularity remained above 60 percent at that \ntime.\n  Ann has been noted as saying that she did not want her tombstone to \nread, ``She kept a really clean house,'' but, instead, preferred to be \nremembered by it reading, ``She opened government to everyone.''\n  Ann Richards will certainly be remembered as doing much more than \nkeeping a clean house. She opened a door for me as a female politician \nin the South, and I know I speak for so many when I say that she \ncontinues to have my respect and my admiration.\n  She will certainly be dearly missed by this Senator and so many, many \nmore across this Nation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my colleague from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first of all, let me thank our colleague \nfrom Arkansas for her eloquent comments both about rural America as \nwell as on our wonderful friend, Ann Richards. I want to add my voice \nof condolence to her family and friends, not only in Texas but across \nthis great country of ours, because she had friends that reached all \nacross this land of ours--in fact, beyond the shores of the United \nStates in her work after she left public life, working in the private \nsector as a great representative of a number of interests, including \nsome that were offshore.\n  She was a remarkable person, and Senator Blanche Lincoln has captured \nher very, very well. There are so many things I remember about her. She \nwas a strong-willed woman. She had definite and clear views, and she \nwas not shy about expressing them to you. But she probably had one of \nthe best senses of humor of anyone I ever met in American politics. She \ncould make you laugh. She could take a situation and bring up an \nanecdote or a story to make her point that would bring the house down.\n  Regardless of your point of view, Ann Richards had a gift to \ncommunicate with the American public like few other people I have ever \nmet in public life. And it was a gift because she did so many good \nthings with her talents.\n  Both as the State Treasurer of Texas and as Governor of that State, I \ngot to know her very well, when I was the general chairman of the \nDemocratic National Committee. She was a tremendous source of help to \nme in those years of 1995 and 1996 when I was campaigning and \nsupporting Democrats across the country.\n\n[[Page S9619]]\n\n  But her politics transcended partisan politics. She was beloved and \nadmired and cared for by people of all political stripes and colors in \nthis country. She will be sorely missed. But as Senator Lincoln said, \nthe memories of her are going to linger on for an awful long time. \nEvery time you mention her name, a smile comes to your face because she \nbrought many smiles many times on the countless occasions I heard her \naddress audiences across the country.\n  I thank Senator Lincoln and others who have spoken about her. I do \nnot have prepared remarks, but I just wanted to express my feelings \nabout this wonderful person.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today we mourn the loss of a great \nTexan and certainly a trailblazer in our State. Former Governor Ann \nRichards passed away last night after a long battle with cancer. Today, \nI want to pay tribute to her because she really made a mark on our \nState and our Nation.\n  Ann Richards was the second woman to hold office in Texas as Governor \nand the first to be elected in her own right. When she was Governor of \nTexas, I was State treasurer, and we certainly had a very strong and \npositive working relationship. She embodied the Texas spirit as well as \nanyone I have ever known, and her enthusiasm for life was evident in \neverything she did.\n  I didn't agree with her on issues--sometimes I did and sometimes I \ndidn't--but you could always respect her because she spoke straight. \nShe told you what she could do and she told you what she couldn't do. \nShe gave some pretty good advice along the way.\n  She could have chosen another career--that of entertainer--and been \nquite successful. She was one of the best. But instead, she chose \npolitics--and she chose to try to make a difference in government, in \nour State and Nation. She was successful at that as well.\n  Ann Richards was born on September 1, 1933 in Lakeview, TX, very near \nWaco. She did grow up in Waco.\n  She graduated from Baylor University in 1954. She attended on a \ndebate scholarship.\n  She was the mother to four children and the grandmother to eight.\n  One of the things she will always be remembered for is how she tried \nto bring women into public office--and certainly to the table--to make \nsure that women were represented well.\n  I was so struck with her after she lost the Governor's race. She, of \ncourse, lost the Governor's race the second time she ran against \nGovernor George Bush, who became President George Bush. But I think it \nwas the way she handled the loss that showed the real spirit that she \nhad. She just turned the page and kept right on going.\n  She had a career in New York and never gave up her home in Texas. But \nshe took New York by storm too. She was a commentator on television, \nalways with the witty saying that people would remember.\n  I remember after she left the Governor's office, I was in Istanbul, \nTurkey. I walked into one of the markets there, and who did I see \nlooking at rugs but Ann Richards. She was having the best time. \nWhatever she was doing at the time was her total absorption. She was \nfinding out everything about those rugs.\n  I saw her sometimes up here in Washington when we would be working on \nsomething that would be for Texas where we would agree. She would take \nher side and I would take my side, working for the same cause but \ntrying to make sure that we covered all of our respective bases.\n  I knew, of course, that she had cancer. I wrote her a note after the \ndiagnosis became public.\n  She wrote me a note back. It was vintage Ann Richards. It was: This \nis just one thing you get through in life, and I'm going to get through \nit. She was very upbeat, very positive, just the way she would always \nbe, tackling the task of the moment and doing it with gusto.\n  I did not know she was so near the end. I was sorry that it came so \nquickly. She will be someone whom no Texan who has ever known her or \nwho has lived in Texas during her service will ever forget. I want to \nmake sure the tributes to her are worthy of the contribution she made.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I join with my distinguished colleague from \nTexas in expressing condolences to the bereaved family, the State of \nNevada, the Democrats in the Senate and America, for the loss of Ann \nRichards.\n  She was my friend. She came to Nevada whenever I asked her to. Why \ndid I ask her to come? Because she was entertainment plus. She was \nalways good for a stunning speech, a stirring speech.\n  For those who had the good fortune this morning to listen to Public \nRadio, what a wonderful piece they had on Ann Richards, the many funny \nthings she did in Texas to change the ways of Texas. She modernized \nTexas.\n  We will all miss her. It is a loss for all Americans. We are \ncomforted to know that Ann departed this world in high spirits and \nhumor, just as she would expect us to continue our lives.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the life \nand legacy of a truly remarkable woman--Governor Ann Richards. She will \nlong be remembered and loved for her tireless activism, her charisma \nand compassion, and her excellence in governance. I will also remember \nher as a friend and a trailblazer. Ann Richards showed women that \nanything and everything was possible.\n  Ann Richards was an original. Yet her life was the American dream. \nShe was born in Lacy-Lakeview, TX, to her loving parents Robert Cecil \nWillis and Mildred Iona Warren. As a young woman, she took an early \ninterest in politics and participated in Girls State, a youth \nleadership and citizenship program for high school students. She later \nstudied at Baylor University on a debate scholarship. After earning her \nteaching certificate at the University of Texas, she began her \nremarkable career of public service as a junior high school teacher.\n  Governor Richards became known as an effective advocate and an \naccomplished political leader. In 1976, Governor Richards successfully \nran for commissioner of Travis County, the same year I won my seat in \nthe House of Representatives. She held this post until 1982, when she \nwas elected State Treasurer--the first woman elected to a statewide \noffice in Texas in over 50 years. In 1991, when I was the only female \nDemocratic Senator, Ann Richards became one of the few female Governors \nin the country. We showed that--together--women can make change.\n  As Governor of Texas, Ann Richards spearheaded an economic \nrevitalization program that expanded Texas' economy during a nationwide \nrecession, and also led an effort to expand State funding of public \nschools. In 1988, she charmed the Nation with her witty, passionate \nremarks as the keynote speaker at the Democratic National Convention.\n  People have called Ann quick-witted and feisty. Well, I happen to \nlike feisty people. She stood up for what she believed in. She fought \nfor what she felt was right. And she made a difference. She served her \nNation and she served her State.\n  Governor Richards' death is a tragedy but her life was a triumph. I \noffer my heartfelt condolences to Governor Richards' children, who were \nat her bedside when she passed, to her friends, and to all those whose \nlives she touched. She and her family are in my thoughts and prayers at \nthis very sad time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I was saddened to learn that my friend \nAnn Richards passed away last night after a courageous battle with \ncancer. She was a wonderful person and an outstanding public servant, \nand she will be missed.\n  Ann brought delight, excitement, ability, and compassion to public \nlife, and she was an American original. To her public service was a \ncalling, and she dedicated herself wholeheartedly to the goal of \nbuilding a better future for all Americans, regardless of income, race, \nor gender.\n  She was a trailblazer in many ways, and she was also one of the last \ngreat American characters in politics, someone who projected joy and \noptimism even in the face of adversity. None of us who were there will \never forget her brilliant keynote address to the Democratic National \nConvention in 1988. She was truly one of a kind.\n  As Governor of Texas, she fought hard for equal opportunity, \nappointing\n\n[[Page S9620]]\n\nmore African Americans, Hispanics, and women to State office than the \nprevious two Governors combined.\n  She used her skill and wit to help pass vital legislation in Congress \ntoo. I will never forget her hard work on the Civil Rights Act of 1991, \nthe Family and Medical Leave Act, the Violence Against Women Act, and \nthe Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act.\n  There will never be another Ann Richards, and we will never forget \nher.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President yesterday, we lost a great politicial \ngreat woman with an incredibly energy who helped to change the attitude \nof Texas politics.\n  Ann Richards was born in Lakeview, TX, in 1933. She died yesterday, \nSeptember 13, in Austin, TX, at the age of 73.\n  She battled cancer in the last months of her life, being diagnosed \nwith esophageal cancer in March and undergoing chemotherapy treatments.\n  I would like to extend my deepest sympathy to her four children--\nCecile, Daniel, Clark and Ellen--who were with her when she passed \naway.\n  Ann Richards was a homemaker and teacher before beginning her \npolitical career as a county commissioner in Travis county, TX, in \n1976. Six years later, in 1982, she ran for State treasurer and won. \nShe was reelected in 1986. Winning the office of Texas State treasurer \nmade her the first woman elected statewide in nearly 50 years.\n  Like so many female politicians of our time, running for office in a \nmale-dominated political environment took courage and determination. \nBut Ann didn't take on these challenges only to prove that she was a \nworthy candidate. She wanted to show Texas, and the Nation, that all \nwomen could succeed in the same way that men had for many years. She \nblazed a trail for women, in politics and in life.\n  Two years later, in 1990, Ann Richards narrowly won the election to \nGovernor, winning by a margin of 49 to 47 percent. Again, she fought a \ntough campaign battle against a male opponent. But with her fierce \ndetermination, she came out on top.\n  During her 4 years in the Governor's office, Ann Richards made a \nstrong effect, championing what she referred to as the ``New Texas.''\n  As Governor, Ann Richards promoted women and minorities who \nhistorically were ignored in Texas politics; reformed the Texas prison \nsystem; backed proposals to reduce the sale of semiautomatic firearms \nand ``cop-killer'' bullets in the State; instituted the Texas State \nlottery to provide funding for education; revitalized the State's \neconomy; and worked to protect the environment, particularly with a \nveto of legislation that would have allowed for the destruction of the \nEdwards Aquifer in south central Texas.\n  She was defeated in her 1994 reelection campaign by George W. Bush.\n  Near the end of her term as Governor, Ann Richards said: ``I think \nI'd like them to remember me by saying, `She opened government to \neveryone.' ''\n  She was a popular figure in Texas politics, known for her white head \nof hair and her great sense of humor.\n  And she was daring, on the political stage and off. At the age of 60, \nshe learned to ride a motorcycle.\n  Ann Richards will be missed. For her charisma, for her integrity, and \nfor her honesty.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart, to pay \ntribute to a remarkable woman and patriot, Ann Richards.\n  There are so many words that I could use to describe Ann. She was \nvibrant, fiery, quick-witted, fearless, but for me the word that I \nthink captures her best is genuine.\n  With Ann, what you saw was what you got. She had an authenticity that \nis rare in life, and even rarer in politics.\n  Even with all of her charisma and charm bubbling over, Ann would be \nthe first to tell you that her life was not perfect and that she had \nmade many mistakes over the years. But it was her embrace of those \nimperfections, and the wisdom to see that she could learn from her \nmistakes, that made her such a successful leader. People could relate \nto her.\n  When she won the Governor's office in 1990, Ann decided she really \nwanted to shake things up in Texas. So she made it her mission to \nappoint more minorities to State boards and commissions than any \nGovernor before her.\n  According to the Houston Chronicle, about 44 percent of her \nappointees were female; 20 percent Hispanic; and 14 percent Black. That \nis in comparison to her two predecessors, who had given more than 77 \npercent of their appointments to White men.\n  So not only did Ann blaze a trail by being the first woman elected \nGovernor of Texas in her own right, but she opened the doors of the \nState house to those who otherwise would have been in the back of the \nline.\n  Why? Because she understood that you can't just talk the talk, you've \ngot to walk the walk. She knew that change was a good thing, even if it \nmade people squirm in their boots.\n  There are a lot of people talking today about what a tremendous loss \nthis is for Texas. I heard our President, George W. Bush say that, \n``Ann loved Texas. And Texans loved her.'' But I have to take that one \nstep further and say, Ann loved America, and Americans loved Ann. She \nbarreled her way into our hearts, and for that we have been made all \nthe richer.\n  I would like to offer my sincere condolences to Ann's children: \nCecile, Daniel, Clark and Ellen, her eight grandchildren, and all those \nwho knew and loved her. She will be sorely missed, but I am sure, \nalways remembered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/14/senate-section/article/S9620-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9620-S9622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 DARFUR\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to spend a couple minutes talking \nabout Darfur as well. I know my colleague from Kansas addressed this \nissue. I know my colleague, Senator Durbin, as well, has been working \non this issue for a long time. Many of us have been watching this \nsituation. Senator Barack Obama, I know, cares about this issue. And \nmany members of the Foreign Relations Committee have talked about it. \nWe heard Senator Boxer, a moment ago, talk about her deep concern.\n  There is a tremendous amount of interest about what is happening and \ngreat concern. It is the moral responsibility of nations around the \nglobe to help end the genocide in Darfur.\n  Even as we speak here this afternoon, in the closing days of this \nweek's work, we are moving backwards in Sudan. Earlier this week, U.N. \nSecretary General Kofi Annan sounded the warning that Darfur is about \nto enter a new phase of needless bloodshed and suffering on a \ncatastrophic scale. I do not think we ought to let this happen. It is \nnot just our responsibility but certainly the United States should and \ncan take a leadership role here in marshaling the forces to stop the \nevents as they unfold to these poor, poor people who are caught in this \ndreadful situation.\n  The blame lies squarely, of course, first and foremost, with the \nSudanese Government's intransigence and murderous Darfur policy. Since \nFebruary of 2003, when rebel groups attacked government outposts, the \nSudanese Government has used the janjaweed militia to systematically \ndecimate tribal groups of African descent in Darfur.\n  The warfare has exacted a tragic toll. Men, women, and children have \nbeen slaughtered in front of their families. Women and girls are \nregularly raped. Entire villages are routinely destroyed and property \nlooted by marauding militias.\n  Estimates suggest that the conflict in Darfur has killed as many as \n300,000 people and driven 2.5 million people out of their homes. The \nUnited States has rightly labeled the Sudanese Government's actions \n``genocide.''\n  I remember, with great clarity, former Secretary of State Colin \nPowell appearing before a Senate committee on which I served calling \nthe actions in Darfur genocide, loudly and clearly. And I commend him \nfor it. He was one of the earliest voices to do so. We know what the \nword ``genocide'' means and its full ramifications.\n  Yet there was a glimmer of hope for the violence to end in May of \nthis year with the conclusion of a peace agreement brokered in large \npart by the United States. The agreement called for a cessation of \nhostilities between the Sudanese Government and one of three major \nrebel groups in Darfur.\n  But it is time to face the facts in Darfur. The peace is over. In \nfact, it never really had a chance. Hostilities between the government \nand the other two rebel groups never ended and are\n\n[[Page S9621]]\n\nheating up again fast in that part of the world. Thousands of Sudanese \ntroops are massing for a fresh offensive against rebel groups. The \nInternational Rescue Committee has noted an upswing in sexual violence \naround refugee camps.\n  Meanwhile, from the very beginning, the Sudanese Government has \nthrown up obstacle after obstacle after obstacle in the path of the \nAfrican Union peacekeeping mission in Darfur.\n  A New York Times report earlier this week describes these obstacles \nand the mission's lack of funding and authority in Darfur. A telling \nexample is that every evening, the African Union soldiers have to turn \nover control of the main military airstrip in Darfur to government \ntroops. These troops steal jet fuel from the mission and use the strip \nto launch attack helicopters while the African Union troops stand by \nhelplessly. Sudanese officials have also managed to reduce the \nmission's already limited patrols and humanitarian efforts in Darfur.\n  The mission's courageous yet failing efforts to maintain the peace \nled the United Nations to issue Security Council Resolution 1706 on \nAugust 31 of this year. This resolution calls for the deployment of a \nmore robust, 20,000-strong U.N. peacekeeping force.\n  Yet precisely because such a U.N. force would have teeth, Sudan's \nPresident has rejected it on the grounds of sovereignty. This is a \nflimsy excuse. There are nearly 10,000 U.N. troops stationed in \nsouthern Sudan to maintain a separate peace agreement. And now the \nSudanese Government has asked African Union troops to leave by \nSeptember 30--a few short days from today--when the mission's mandate \nexpires, unless they are able to raise additional funds.\n  It is all too clear that the Sudanese Government is not interested in \npeace in Darfur. And why should it be? Sudan has friends like Russia \nand China who place a far greater premium in their commercial interests \nin the Sudan rather than on their responsibility to stop this genocide. \nIn 2005, China purchased more than half of Sudan's oil exports, and is \none of its largest suppliers of arms. Both countries, Russia and China, \nabstained in the most recent vote on deploying U.N. troops. They \ncontinued to give political cover to the Sudanese Government.\n  Yet it is also clear that the United States and the international \ncommunity have a responsibility to protect and prevent genocide in \nDarfur. The world's heads of state affirmed this precise commitment \nlast September as part of the Outcome Document of the High-level \nPlenary Meeting of the United Nations General Assembly. The document \ncalls on the international community to protect people from ``genocide, \nwar crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity'' on a case-\nby-case basis should their own governments fail to do so.\n  What could be more clear? What could be more precise? What could be \nmore important for us to respond to?\n  The case for Darfur is painfully clear. And yet a year after making \nthis commitment, we and the rest of the international community are \nalready on the verge of reneging on it. Our ability to act remains \nhostage to a government that continues to perpetrate terrible crimes on \nits own people.\n  Yet instead of tightening the screws on this government, our \nadministration, the administration here in the United States, \nunfortunately, is not doing what it ought to be doing. We are dangling \nthe incentives of talks with President Bush before the Sudanese \nPresident in exchange for his accepting a U.N. force. It is almost \nunbelievable.\n  The administration refuses to talk directly to Iran and North Korea \nabout their nuclear programs. And yet here it is bandying Presidential \ntalks with the head of a regime that our own Government has declared \nguilty of genocide.\n  This is typical, unfortunately, of the administration's bumbling \napproach to diplomacy. It simply does not know when to talk and when to \nbrandish the stick. Clearly, the stick is necessary here. Days and \nhours stand between us and an incredible mass of genocide.\n  The fact is, we need to take a harder approach on Sudan. So what can \nwe do from here on? How do we ratchet up the pressure on the Sudanese \nGovernment and get it to stop?\n  First, I think the United States needs to expedite the appointment of \na special envoy to Darfur.\n  Let me add, by the way, Senator Brownback mentioned Bob Zoellick. He \ndid a fantastic job, by the way, but he is out of government now. He is \nin the private sector. Unfortunately, we do not have a Bob Zoellick \nwithin the administration right now who understands it and cared about \nthis issue to the extent he did. But I believe there are people who \ncould be asked to perform this appointment of a special envoy from the \nUnited States. That might be enough in the short term, to begin to put \nthe brakes on.\n  I recently joined colleagues in sending a letter to President Bush \ncalling for his immediate attention. With the departure of Deputy \nSecretary of State Bob Zoellick, who played a very important role in \nnegotiating the May peace agreement, a vacuum has emerged that needs to \nbe immediately filled to ensure a coordinated, focused, and effective \npolicy.\n  Our Assistant Secretary of State for African affairs was made to wait \n3 days--3 days--before meeting with Sudan's President, only to hear him \nreject the U.N. force. This special envoy must be someone of greater \nstature and seniority who can command an audience and forcefully convey \na message. Moreover, the envoy and President Bush himself must, in \nconcert with our allies, publicly reject Sudan's demand that African \nUnion troops leave and insist on the deployment of U.N. forces.\n  Secondly, the United States needs to convince states like China and \nRussia and the Arab League to apply pressure on the Sudanese Government \nto accept a U.N. peacekeeping force. Unless Sudan feels the heat from \nits business partners and friends, my fear is they will not budge.\n  Thirdly, the United States needs to ensure that the United Nations \nmoves forward with deploying a peacekeeping force. Should Sudan \ncontinue to put up a wall, then I think we must implement a tight \nsanctions regime against the Sudanese Government, rebel forces, and \nothers responsible for the atrocities that are being committed there.\n  We must also consider deploying troops regardless of Sudanese \nconsent. For many this may raise a red flag, but, again, it is an \ninternational commitment and a moral obligation agreed to under U.N. \nauspices.\n  Should the U.N. fail to rapidly muster the requisite troops, I \nbelieve we ought to deploy an interim NATO force with U.S. \nparticipation to Darfur. At a minimum, NATO forces, which already \nprovide logistical support to the African Union mission, should enforce \na no-fly zone in Darfur pursuant to U.N. Security Council Resolution \n1591 to prevent military flights over Darfur.\n  U.S. participation, even in a limited capacity, is critical to \nshowing the world that the U.S. is not just about fighting terrorism \nwhen it serves our interests but also about fighting injustice, \nterrorism and mass murder when it affects others far away from us; that \nthe U.S. will fight for the principles of respect for human dignity and \nlife, and not just lecture others about them.\n  Fourth, despite this administration's absurd rejection of \nInternational Criminal Court, the ICC can and must play a critical role \nin bringing to justice those responsible for committing genocide in \nSudan. Last March, Darfur became the first-ever case to be referred by \nthe U.N. Security Council to the International Criminal Court for \ninvestigation.\n  The U.S. unconscionably abstained on this vote. My country abstained. \nWhen it comes to conducting an investigation of the Sudanese Government \nfor what our own Secretary of State has called genocide, we abstained.\n  And we wonder why public opinion of the United States around the \nworld is dipping. One reason is because the administration talks the \ntalk but does not walk the walk when it comes to upholding our Nation's \nprinciples. From military tribunals that don't allow due process of law \nto warrantless surveillance, the administration simply thinks it is \nabove domestic and international law. Its doublespeak continues to \nsquander our country's political and moral authority. The U.S. needs to \nlend its full support to the ICC's efforts to bring to justice those \nfound guilty of genocide in Sudan.\n  Mr. President, 12 years after Rwanda--and I am glad my colleague from \nCalifornia raised Rwanda, and Senator\n\n[[Page S9622]]\n\nBrownback has as well, along with others in this body--we remain \nhaunted by the massacre which occurred. Former President Bill Clinton \npublicly expressed his deepest regret at the U.S. and the international \ncommunity's collective inaction to stop the killings in Rwanda. Twelve \nyears from now, none of us in this body or the administration want to \nbe forcing the same regrets about Darfur.\n  Yet, if we fail that--and it is not a matter of weeks or months, it \nis a matter of hours--then the very kinds of genocidal mass murder that \noccurred in Rwanda will continue to occur in Darfur and grow worse.\n  Sudan has been wracked by four decades of violence and instability. \nThe scars of that war cut deep throughout their country. Currently, it \nis experiencing what the U.N. has described as the world's greatest \nhumanitarian crisis. We stood by during Rwanda. We cannot stand by this \ntime. We must not let history repeat itself. We must act. The \ninternational community has a responsibility to protect and the U.S. \nmust lead by example. Let us not fail this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Connecticut \nfor that extremely eloquent, passionate, and urgent message to the \nadministration about what needs to be done in Darfur. I could not agree \nmore. I have come to the floor on other occasions to speak on the same \nissue. We know that thousands--in fact, 2 million people--find \nthemselves in camps with no place to call home, in a situation that is \nabsolutely outrageous.\n  So I thank my colleague for coming to the floor and speaking on this \nimportant subject. I am very hopeful that my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle who have spoken to this will find that their words are \nheeded by the administration and they will act urgently to save lives \nand stop the genocide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/14/senate-section/article/S9622-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9622-S9623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING ANN RICHARDS\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to remember a very good \nfriend and a wonderful woman whom Senator Lincoln spoke about--and I \nknow others today have--very eloquently on the floor, and that is our \ngood, good friend Ann Richards, the former Texas Governor and \ntreasurer, a woman who had extraordinary abilities. Her intelligence, \nher tenacity, and her hard work, are well known. But we all know of her \nsense of humor, her wit, her ability to make us smile. Even when we \nwere trying to struggle through a difficult issue or were upset, she \nwas able to put this in a particular frame that would allow people to \nin fact smile and laugh while they were trying to work through things \ntogether.\n  I was very pleased to have Ann Richards come to Michigan on more than \none occasion to be able to help me in my effort at running for office. \nIt was always a wonderful time. People were so excited when I would say \nthat Governor Ann Richards was coming to Michigan. There would be \nexcitement from women young and old, as well as from men. We always \ndrew a great crowd. She always lived up to every expectation, in terms \nof the way she spoke about life, about what people are concerned about, \nand a combination of both outrage at those unfair things and things \nthat ought to be changed, coupled with that sense of humor about what \nwe go through in our daily lives, speaking about things that we could \nall relate to so well, with that wonderful sense of humor.\n\n  She once told me when I was working hard and had too many things to \ndo in a day: Debbie, you should stop right now and just focus on what \nis next and the rest of it will take care of itself. Do your best and \nfocus on the next hour, the next challenge, and that is how you get \nthrough effectively in life.\n  Those words of encouragement and advice have stuck with me to this \nday. Whenever I get overwhelmed, I think of Ann Richards' voice in my \near saying: Stop and take a breath and focus on what is right in front \nof you and do your best, and everything else will work out just fine.\n  We all know she was a trailblazer in Texas politics and an \ninspiration to all of us who have run for office and been elected to \noffice around the country. I will never forget when she was elected. I \nhad the opportunity to attend her inaugural ball--I should say series \nof balls, where everybody was all dressed up and wearing cowboy boots, \nand how I watched Ann, with such relish, go from ball to ball, event to \nevent, and watched her go down the streets in the parades in Austin \nthat day. There was such excitement, and you could tell she was \nthrilled. She loved Texas and she relished the opportunity to serve \nTexas as its Governor. It was such a wonderful weekend of events. I \nwill always remember that.\n  There are so many different quotes from her that we all remember and \nquote ourselves. One of my favorites is the often-repeated line about \nFred Astaire. She said:\n\n       Sure, he was great; but don't forget that Ginger Rogers did \n     everything he did backwards and in high heels.\n\n  That was Ann Richards, speaking in a way that made a point, but made \neveryone smile at the same time.\n  In many ways, we kind of came up through politics together. We were \nboth in county commissions in the mid-1970s. We both ended up in \nStatewide elected office, and we both loved and love our States with a \ngreat, great passion.\n  Despite all of the fame--and she was famous, a well-known person, \nrevered around the country--she was somebody who could walk into any \ncity in the country and have people recognize her and have great \nrespect for her. But what I admired most was how down to earth she was. \nEven though this is a person who was very well known, she was somebody \nwho was always there with a smile and would say ``How are you doing?'' \nShe would talk to the wait staff in a restaurant, as well as the people \nin her party, or would speak to whomever was around her.\n  She began her career as a teacher. She once said that teaching was \nthe hardest work she had ever done and, according to her, it remained \nthe hardest work she had done to date. She was a great teacher, but not \nonly in the classroom. Ann Richards was a teacher to me--a teacher as \nit relates to women having courage, stepping out, being willing to take \nthe slings and arrows that come with the rough and tumble world of \npolitics, standing up for what she believed in, always being accessible \nand available to reach out and help those of us who asked for her help, \nand always relishing life to the fullest.\n  Ann Richards will be remembered. We are so grateful for her life, for \nher service, and for who she was. My thoughts and prayers go out to her \nchildren and her grandchildren.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I join my colleagues and many others \nacross America to express our sadness over the loss of one great \nperson: former Texas Governor Ann Richards. There she was, with her \nDairy Queen hairdo, her thick Texas twang, and her lightning fast wit. \nShe was beloved and recognized by everybody. When she would show up on \nCapitol Hill, people couldn't wait to come up and shake hands and see \nthat beautiful smile. Several times she came by my office, and our \nvisit always started with a laugh and ended with a laugh. She was just \na great person to be around.\n  She was born Dorothy Ann Willis in 1933, in Lakeview, a farming \ncommunity near Waco. She was the only child of Iona and Cecil Willis. \nThey came from the tiny towns of Bugtussle and Hogjaw.\n  At Waco High School, she dropped her first name and became just Ann. \nShe also became the Texas state debate champion.\n  During her senior year, she visited Washington as a delegate to Girls \nNation and, on a trip to the White House, shook hands with President \nTruman, one of her all time heroes.\n  Despite her natural political talents, it never occurred to Ann \nRichards to run for political office herself until later in life.\n  In her 20s, she taught social studies in an Austin middle school for \nless\n\n[[Page S9623]]\n\nthan 2 years before she was required to resign because she was pregnant \nwith her first child. She later described teaching as ``the hardest \nwork I had ever done.''\n  In 1975, her husband, civil rights attorney David Richards, was \napproached about running for Travis County commissioner. He turned it \ndown and said he wasn't interested, but Ann Richards was.\n  She won that race and went on to serve two terms as a Travis County \ncommissioner, 8 years as Texas state treasurer, and 4 years as her \nState's governor.\n  Her 1990 election as Governor--a come-from-behind victory--made her \nthe first woman elected governor in Texas in nearly 60 years, and the \nfirst woman to win that office without following her husband in.\n  As Governor, Ann Richards pursued a progressive agenda and appointed \nan unprecedented number of women and minorities to posts they never \nwould have dreamed of in Texas Government.\n  Her family said that, as Governor, she was most proud of two actions \nthat probably cost her re-election. She vetoed legislation that would \nhave allowed people to carry concealed handguns. She also vetoed a bill \nthat would have destroyed an aquifer that supplies water for much of \nsouth central Texas. She paid the political price.\n  Years later, when a reporter asked her what she might have done \ndifferently had she known she was going to serve only one term as \nGovernor, Ann Richards grinned and replied: ``Oh, I would probably have \nraised more hell.''\n  She was not just a political hero. In speaking openly about her \nstruggle with alcoholism, her decision, in 1980, to get sober, and the \njoy she discovered in sobriety, Ann Richards was also a source of \ninspiration as well to countless others who struggle with addiction.\n  Ann Richards rose to national prominence when she gave the keynote \naddress at the 1988 Democratic National Convention. People remember a \nlot of things she said in that address.\n  That address includes some immortal lines, including her famous \ndescription of gender inequality: ``Ginger Rogers did everything that \nFred Astaire did. She just did it backwards and in high heels.''\n  In other lines from that speech that are not as well remembered, Ann \nRichards talked about why she believed in government.\n  She said:\n\n       I was born during the Depression in a little community just \n     outside Waco, and I grew up listening to Franklin Roosevelt \n     on the radio. It was back then that I came to understand the \n     small truths and the hardships that bind neighbors together. \n     Those were real people with real problems, and they had real \n     dreams about getting out of the Depression.\n\n  She said she could still hear the voices of those ``people who were \nliving their lives as best they could.''\n  She said: ``They talked about war and Washington and what this \ncountry needed. They talked straight talk.''\n  In politics and in her life after politics, Ann Richards used her \npower to try to solve the real problems of real people and enable them \nto live and raise their families with dignity and hope.\n  I'll close with one more story from Wayne Slater. He recalls that, \nduring a public appearance several years after leaving office, Ann \nRichards was asked about her legacy.\n  She replied:\n\n       In looking back on my life, I could of course say the \n     predictable thing: that the greatest thing I've ever done is \n     bear my children and have grandchildren, and all that kind of \n     stuff. But the reality is that the greatest part of my life \n     was the opportunity to be in public service--to make a \n     difference for the community I live in, for the State that I \n     love, to be able to try to make things better, whether they \n     turned out in the fashion I expected them to or not.\n\n  Then she added:\n\n       Sometimes it's serendipitous. Good things happen \n     accidentally. But they're not going to happen unless well-\n     meaning people give of their time and their lives to do that.\n\n  Ann Richards earned that legacy and more. She made a difference not \nonly for her community and her beloved State, but to our entire Nation. \nShe touched so many lives and changed so many lives in her life. She \nwill be greatly missed.\n  Our thoughts and prayers go out to her children: Cecile, Daniel, \nClark and Ellen; their spouses; and Governor Richards' eight \ngrandchildren.\n  There is good news in the Richards family. Cecile received an award \nlast night from USA Action. Of course, she couldn't be there, she was \nat her mother's deathbed--and that is certainly understood. But a \ntribute was paid to her for her active work on behalf of women across \nAmerica as a leader in Planned Parenthood. She is carrying on her \nmother's legacy, her commitment, her family's commitment to public \nservice. I can't think of anything that would have made Ann Richards \nmore proud.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/14/senate-section/article/S9623-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9623-S9625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RURAL AMERICA MONTH\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise this evening to speak about an \nimportant resolution that passed the Senate last week. I introduced S. \nRes. 561, which designates September as Rural America Month.\n  I first thank the majority leader and my colleague, Senator Blanche \nLincoln from Arkansas, for their help in passing this resolution. For \nme, home means Nevada. Growing up as the son of a hard rock miner in a \nrural community called Searchlight, far from the bright lights of Las \nVegas, has shaped my love for rural America. So when I became leader, I \ndecided I wanted to do something to show how serious Democrats are \nabout standing up for rural America. I couldn't think of a better \nperson to lead this effort than Blanche Lincoln from Arkansas.\n  I appointed her the chairman of my Rural Outreach Program, and she \nhas done a wonderful job. She is so articulate, has that wonderful \nsmile, and she has done things we never realized would be so effective. \nI publicly extend my appreciation to her for her leadership in this \narea. The people of Arkansas are so fortunate to have this good woman \nserving in the Senate.\n  It is our love for rural America that brings us to the Chamber today. \nSenator Lincoln has been here. I appreciate her remarks very much. But \nit is what motivates us to support 55 million people who, like us, call \nrural America home. These small towns and rural communities are rich in \nheritage and tradition, and we need to do everything we can to protect \nand sustain the rural way of life.\n  Today, as we honor rural America, I would like to talk about some \nsteps I believe the Senate should take to enrich rural economies, bring \nnew and better services to small towns, enhance these pieces of fabric \nof America we call rural America.\n  During the last century, our rural communities have undergone an \namazing transformation. With more than 2,000 rural counties accounting \nfor almost 85 percent of the American landscape, the definition of what \nis rural often depends upon arbitrary lines of distinction. As rural \neconomies become increasingly diversified, communities strive to adapt \nto the demands of a constantly evolving global community and economy. \nTake, for example, Elko, NV. Once, Elko was a small Basque enclave. It \nhas grown dramatically during the past decade, and for so many years it \nhas been growing in a way we never envisioned.\n  Today, Elko and the immediate vicinity produces 63 percent of the \nworld's gold. It has recognized the challenge of relying upon the \nhighly volatile industry, but it still carries on and does so well. The \npeople of Elko worked together to identify local resources to foster \nnot only growth but smart growth. As it turns out, one of Elko's most \nvaluable assets is an unused railroad spur. Today, this is being \ndeveloped and will become one of the busiest transportation hubs in the \nWest because of the mining industry and ranching industry.\n  That is not all. Elko is also doing something else to capitalize on \nthe uniqueness of their setting in the American West.\n  One of the reasons I am so proud of this legislation is because it \nhonors America's farmers, ranchers, and, yes,\n\n[[Page S9624]]\n\ncowboys. Farming and ranching are the foundation of rural culture in \nAmerica and continue to drive the rural economy. Today, with 95 million \nhead of cattle, beef production in the United States is an $80 billion-\na-year industry. This year, Americans will consume 25 billion pounds of \nbeef. With the livestock they raise and the responsible stewardship of \npublic lands, American farmers and ranchers help feed families across \nthe country and around the world. Although less than 10 percent of the \nworld's cattle are raised in America, we produce nearly 25 percent of \nthe world's beef supply.\n  For 23 years, the Western Folklife Center has hosted the National \nCowboy Poetry Festival in Elko. Each year, poets, storytellers, \nmusicians, filmmakers, dancers, and other performers descend upon the \ntown to celebrate these American icons. The theme for this year's \ngathering is ``The Ranch.''\n  If you talk to ranchers and farmers this year, one of the first \ntopics you hear is the rising cost of energy. The high cost of gasoline \nand diesel affects all Americans, but it hits rural America very hard. \nThese are men and women who make a living driving tractors and other \nlarge pieces of equipment, hauling their grain and moving their \nlivestock from place to place. This is one area in particular where we \ncan help rural America, and I believe we should.\n  Instead of making farmers pay for dependence on foreign oil, it is \ntime they were paid to make America energy independent. It is within \nour grasp. We are at a real turning point for alternative energy. \nAlternative energy technologies are finally becoming cost competitive \nwith conventional energy sources such as oil and gas. In 2005, the \nthree largest technology IPOs were, believe it or not, solar companies. \nBy 2009, it is likely alternative energy technology will capture 10 \npercent of all capital venture investments. All of this is possible if \nwe work together to take us in a new direction.\n  Another hardship faced by rural Americans is the loss of jobs. In the \nwake of outsourcing, rural communities have been left with the daunting \ntask of retraining workers whose only training had been for jobs that \nno longer exist. For example, the manufacturing industry, which is so \nvital to so many small towns, has been hit the hardest, with as much as \n30 percent of that sent abroad. It is not unusual for someone to work \ntheir ranch or farm but also have another job, and that has been very \nhurtful, with these jobs being shipped overseas. It has been \nparticularly devastating for low-skill workers who make up more than 40 \npercent of all rural workers.\n  The problem is made worse when young unskilled workers leave the \nworkforce in search of opportunities only available beyond the county \nline. While it is clear rural communities need to be more aggressive in \nattracting new industries, the task is easier said than done.\n  Prospective employers need to be assured they have a pool of talented \nworkers. With the exodus of skilled workers and an untrained workforce, \nfew companies are willing to roll the dice. That is too bad.\n  Living in rural America is something that you do not see on a balance \nsheet. It is only a live experience. More people should experience the \njoy of living in rural America.\n  Just as good jobs are hard to find, so is good health care and good \nemergency response. In many parts of the country, such as Ely, NV, when \nthere is an emergency--whether it is a small brush fire or national \ncatastrophe--we look to our neighbors to keep our families safe. We \nrely on volunteer firefighters and police officers. This fact was made \npainfully clear after Hurricane Katrina.\n  That is why I feel so strongly that the Senate must do everything it \ncan to make sure our first responders have the tools they need to get \nthe job done right. Volunteer fire departments depend on programs such \nas Fire and Citizen Corps grants. Every day, rural law enforcement \nofficials rely on the funding that the Byrne and COPS Programs provide.\n  Often, when we talk about veterans issues, we are talking about rural \nissues. Rural America is home to many U.S. veterans. In fact, according \nto the Census Bureau, rural and nonmetropolitan counties account for \nthe largest concentration of veterans.\n  This is true for my home State of Nevada. With more than 250,000 \nveterans, Nevada has the third largest population of veterans, and it \ncontinues to grow. During the last decade, Nevada saw its veterans \npopulation increase by more than 30 percent--the highest increase in \nthe country.\n  That is why for so many years now, I have been pushing Congress to \nrevisit the injustice in compensation for our nation's veterans--the \nban on concurrent receipt.\n  As too many are well aware, disabled veterans face the obstacle of \nforfeiting retirement pay dollar-for-dollar if they receive disability \ncompensation. This policy is unacceptable, and I am committed to \nsecuring fair policy to provide our veterans with the entirety of their \nearned compensation.\n  I have been fighting for five years to allow for full concurrent \nreceipt, and despite veto threats from the administration, we have made \nmany great strides towards fair compensation for our veterans. In 2003, \nCongress passed my legislation allowing disabled retired veterans with \nat least a fifty percent disability rating to become eligible for full \nconcurrent receipt over a ten-year period. This measure passed despite \nveto threats from the Bush administration.\n  Most recently, I have introduced legislation--S. 558--which would \nprovide concurrent receipt to military retirees, with 20 or more years \nof service, who are rated less than 50 percent. It would also eliminate \nthe 10-year phase-in period for veterans who draw their disability and \nretirement pay; it will also change my 2003 bill to give full \nconcurrent receipt to all veterans with service connected disabilities. \nThere are currently 29 cosponsors to this legislation.\n  Additionally, the CARES commission on veterans' health care \nrecognized the need for a Community Based Outpatient Clinic--CBOC--in \nFallon and an expansion of services at the Reno VA Medical Center. I am \ncommitted to providing Nevada's veterans with more access to quality \nhealth care options, including a new CBOC in Elko.\n  And finally, no discussion of helping rural America would be complete \nwithout a discussion of Broadband.\n  For rural America, competition and active participation in the local \nand global marketplaces not only means having a computer, but also \naccess to high-speed internet services.\n  Rural areas are consistently left behind urban areas when it comes to \nfederal investment in the infrastructure systems that are essential for \nany economy to thrive--including telecommunications systems.\n  Although the Internet has touched the lives of billions of people \naround the globe, most of rural America has been left behind even the \nleast developed countries.\n  Less than a decade ago, the Internet meant email and chat rooms. \nToday, access to broadband Internet is so much more. With high speed \ninternet, incredible amounts of information can change fingers at the \nspeed of light.\n  However, even in rural areas where broadband access has been \nintroduced, problems such as affordability and adoption rates remain \nhuge obstacles to progress/leaving dial-up the only realistic option. \nAffordability and adoption rates are the biggest obstacles we have.\n  Broadband Internet has proven itself to be a potent catalyst in job \ncreation, economic development, and a critical component of education \nand public safety. In fact, the deployment of broadband service to our \nrural areas may be as important to economic development as rural \nelectrification was during the Great Depression.\n  And so, my colleagues and I are committed to investing in innovative \nbroadband technologies so that rural communities can begin to form new \nkinds of partnerships, and reach new levels of connectivity.\n  For example, Senator Clinton has worked to link local businesses in \nSt. Lawrence County to global markets using eBay. Many parts of St. \nLawrence County are remote, and businesses have a hard time finding \ncustomers. But not on eBay. eBay also offered training to small \nbusiness owners and their employees.\n  Senator Clinton has also previously secured Senate passage of tax \nincentives for telecommunications companies to deploy broadband to \nrural\n\n[[Page S9625]]\n\nareas. This technology will allow small businesses around New York to \ncompete for customers around the globe.\n  We have seen how one small business has worked with several \ncommunities to bring free wireless internet service to nine cities in \nEastern Oregon. The service is now being used to track cargo shipments \non the Columbia River, monitor a munitions depot, and has improved the \nefficiency of the police department.\n  I have spent the last few moments talking about the joys and \nchallenges felt by rural America.\n  As I've cited in examples today from Elko and Ely, Nevada, rural \ncommunities are coming together to create new opportunity themselves. \nBut we here in Washington need to do everything we can to help them \nsucceed.\n  We need solutions that make sense for the whole country--not just for \nWashington, D.C., but for places like Winnemucca, and Aurora, NE.\n  We can do it. And we'll be a better, stronger nation as a result.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/14/senate-section/article/S9625-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 BOXING\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a momentous occasion \nin the history of Nevada and one of my favorite pastimes: boxing.\n  This September 16, 2006, marks the 100th anniversary of the longest \nboxing match in history fought under Queensbury rules. For more than 3 \nhours, 2 of the greatest boxers in the country squared off for 42 \nrounds in the booming mining community of Goldfield, NV. This fight's \ntremendous length might be important to the ``Guinness Book of World \nRecord,'' but for Nevada, it was also an important moment in race \nrelations during a tumultuous period in our country's history.\n  Boxing promoters throughout the country billed the fight as one of \nepic proportions. Oscar Battling Nelson was one of the toughest \nfighters in the land. He was nicknamed ``The Durable Dane'' for his \nresilient and hard-hitting style. Rather than defeat his opponents with \nskill, Nelson preferred to absorb the blows of his opponents and \noutlast them in the ring. One biographer even went so far as to say \nthat Nelson ``gave new meaning to the word tough.''\n  With such fabled abilities, Nelson was the early favorite to defeat \nhis opponent, a 32-year-old African American named Joe Gans. The \nBaltimore native was the reigning lightweight champion and the first \nAmerican-born Black man to win a boxing title. His style was a sharp \ncontrast to The Durable Dane: Gans was quick and fast on his feet and \nknown as ``The Old Master.'' Rather than relying on brute strength, \nGans tried to beat his opponents with skill.\n  Such a marquee match-up was a boxing promoter's dream and was \nexpected to promote gold stock in the area. With a record $30,000 purse \nprize, the fight brought national attention to Goldfield, the largest \ncity in Nevada at the time. But a sharp issue hung over the bout like \nan ominous cloud. That was the issue of race.\n  Before the fight began, rumors floated that Gans had thrown fights as \na youth in Baltimore. So persistent were the rumors that Gans' \npromoter, a local saloon owner named Larry Sullivan, feared for his \nsafety should his fighter lose. Others worried that a win by Gans could \nstart a riot in the town.\n  The hostility of the town quickly evaporated once the citizens of \nGoldfield had an opportunity to meet Joe Gans. It was his unassuming \nmanner--and some say a love of the craps tables--that endeared Gans to \nthe town. Prefight negotiations only served to steer more public \nsupport to Gans' corner. Gans gave into every one of Nelson's demands, \nincluding lowering his own share of the $30,000 purse to $11,000 win or \nlose. He also agreed to drop his weight to 133 pounds--well below his \nnormal fighting weight of 142 pounds.\n  The change in support was clearly evident to referee George Siler. He \nwrote: ``The men who wield the pick think that Gans has been imposed \nupon by Nelson's manager, and they want to see him win.'' The Goldfield \nNews reported the shift in support saying ``. . . the camp finds itself \nin the unique position of wishing to see a Negro defeat a white man.'' \nBy the start of the fight, the odds were 2-1 in favor of Gans.\n\n  The fight started in the afternoon under the hot Nevada sun. Some \nestimates place the ringside temperatures at more than 100 degrees. \nNevertheless, more than 6,000 people--and an unprecedented 1,500 \nwomen--paid the pricey sum of $5 to watch the fight.\n  Surely, none of the spectators knew that they would witness one of \nthe greatest fights in history. As usual, Nelson tried to outlast his \nopponents' barrage of uppercuts, hooks, and jabs. By the end of the \nseventh round, Nelson was bleeding from both ears and Gans knocked him \nto the mat. But the Durable Dane would not give up. He tried to pin \nGans against the ropes, and again Gans knocked him to the mat in the \n15th round. Nelson bounced back, winning the next three rounds. After \nalmost 20 rounds, the sun began to set over the Columbia Mountain and \nit was clear that the fighters were tired.\n  But neither man would yield. Gans broke his hand in the 27th round \nbut refused to go down. He continued to fight back against Nelson, \nshowing little sign of the injury. At the end of the 30th round, Nelson \nhit Gans after the bell, causing uproar in the crowd. The referee, who \nhad warned Nelson about fouls throughout the fight, gave him yet \nanother warning. Finally, the Durable Dane began to lose his famed \nendurance, while Gans continued to pummel him. In the 42nd round, \nNelson landed an intentional low blow on Gans. The referee called the \nfight in Gans' favor.\n  The telegraph wires carried the result of the fight across the \ncountry. And the town's support for Gans held strong. That night, the \nresidents of Goldfield did not see Black or White: They saw a winner. \nJoe Gans, with his modest manner and stylish boxing, had won the town \nover. Siler wrote: ``Goldfield is a vast camp of hero worshippers \ntonight, and its hero is Joe Gans . . .''\n  This Saturday, the boxing clubs from the University of Nevada, Reno, \nand the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, will fight 42 rounds in honor \nof the Nelson-Gans match. The sounds of the closing bell for each of \nthose 42 rounds will be from the original 1906 bell from the fight. And \nlater that evening in nearby Tonopah, the audience will be able to \nwatch video footage of the historic bout.\n  Mr. President, the accomplishments of Joe Gans and the citizens of \nGoldfield are worthy for recognition before the Senate. I am pleased \nhave the opportunity to honor this important anniversary today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/14/senate-section/article/S9625-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9625-S9626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CHANGING THE TIDE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as Detroit residents cope with a rise in \nhomicides and shootings this year, city police are joining with other \nlaw enforcement agencies in an effort to stem gun-related violence \nthrough a new program. Operation Tactical Intelligence Driven \nEnforcement, or TIDE, was established to help determine crime patterns, \nidentify the city's most violent offenders and ultimately prevent crime \nin the city of Detroit.\n  Operation TIDE, which began on May 5, 2006, in the Detroit \nNorthwestern police district, involves the coordination of 10 Federal, \nState and local agencies. It is designed to use the expertise of each \nagency to better track and share intelligence on dangerous criminals. \nThe U.S. Attorney's Office, Wayne County Prosecutor's Office, Wayne \nCounty Sheriffs Office, U.S. Marshals Service, Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, Michigan State Police and U.S. Drug Enforcement \nAdministration are all involved in the project. To date, 115 people \ntied to gun crimes and gang violence have been arrested. The program is \nfunded by a $600,000 grant through the Federal Project Safe \nNeighborhoods campaign against guns and gang violence and is currently \nbeing expanded into the other three police districts.\n  Operation TIDE expands upon the current Project Safe Neighborhoods \ninitiative strategy of suppression, deterrence, prevention/\nintervention, investigation, prosecution and public awareness. Project \nSafe Neighborhoods is a long-term campaign that has assisted in taking \nmany violent offenders off the streets of Detroit. Since its inception \nin 2001, Project Safe Neighborhoods has played an important role in a \n34 percent reduction in violent crime and a 73 percent increase in \nfirearm prosecutions nationally. In the Detroit area, it has resulted \nin more than 800 Federal gun prosecutions. Project Safe\n\n[[Page S9626]]\n\nNeighborhoods public awareness campaign has resulted in hundreds of \ntips leading to prosecution.\n  Ella Bully-Cummings, chief of the Detroit Police Department, \ndescribed Operation TIDE by saying:\n\n       Our strategy is to supercharge our crime prevention and \n     enforcement efforts to reduce violent crimes using the \n     intelligence and resources of all law enforcement agencies. \n     Our police officers work every day at addressing active and \n     potential crime in our city limits. By collecting and \n     disseminating the acquired intelligence among partnering \n     agencies, crime patterns will be swiftly identified.\n\n  I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the Federal, \nState, and local law enforcement officials for their outstanding \nservice and their vital contributions to the safety of our communities. \nTheir commonsense approach plays a significant role in decreasing gun \nviolence. I am hopeful that the 109th Congress will do more to support \ntheir efforts by taking up and passing sensible gun safety legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/14/senate-section/article/S9626-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9626-S9627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NSA-RELATED BILLS AND PROPOSED CHANGES TO WAR CRIMES ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier today the President visited Capitol \nHill for a closed-door meeting with House Republicans. It is not often \nthe President takes time out of his busy schedule to come to Congress. \nBut to meet only with Republicans is wrong and divisive.\n  After his closed door meeting, the President talked about working \ntogether, in a bipartisan way. His walk does not match his talk. I wish \nhe would act as a uniter and work with all of us on behalf of all \nAmericans. Regrettably, it appears that, once again, this President has \nchosen to act in a partisan way in his role as Republican-in-Chief. \nThat is wrong.\n  I hope that all Senators will recognize their responsibility to all \nAmericans and exercise their best independent judgment, rather than \ntaking orders from the head of their political party.\n  In the Judiciary Committee yesterday, Senators did exercise that kind \nof independent judgment when we joined together in a bipartisan way to \nreport a bipartisan bill that would amend the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act and reign in the Administration's warrantless domestic \nwiretapping program. That bill, S. 3001, the bill cosponsored by \nSenator Specter and Senator Feinstein, was the only proposal that drew \nbipartisan support. I urge the Majority Leader to recognize the merits \nof that bill and our bipartisan efforts by moving to proceed to that \nbill when the Senate turns its attention to these matters.\n  This bipartisan bill was authored by Senator Feinstein, one of the \nfew Senators being briefed on the Presidents program of domestic \nsurveillance without warrants. It is intended to ensure our \nintelligence community can protect our nation with the necessary court \noversight. It will bring the President's program within the law.\n  It stands in stark contrast to the White House-endorsed bill that \ngrants sweeping authority to the Executive Branch for a program about \nwhich we know very little. The Bush-Cheney Administration has refused \nCongress's requests for information. Since when did Congress become an \narm of the Executive Branch? Since when was the Senate reduced to a \nrubberstamp? Oversight means accountability. Oversight makes Government \nwork better. It prevents abuses and corruption. We need Government to \nbe as competent and accountable as it can be in fighting terrorism.\n  I have been attempting to clarify the facts and the law relating to \nthe Administration's warrantless wiretapping program since it was first \ndisclosed in December 2005. During the ensuing eight months, we have \nmade numerous efforts to get straight answers from the Administration \nregarding the nature, scope and purported legal basis of this program. \nOur efforts were rebuffed by the most flagrant and disrespectful \nstonewalling of any Administration that I have seen in my 32 years in \nCongress.\n  While refusing to answer even our most basic questions about its \nsecret spying program, the Administration claimed that Congress \napproved the program when it authorized the use of military force in \nAfghanistan--although Attorney General Gonzales had to admit that this \nwas an ``evolving'' rationale not present at the time Congress \nconsidered its action. The Administration claimed that even if they \nviolated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the President's \npowers and their view of the ``unitary executive'' must trump the law \nand the authority of Congress. Not since the rationalization of Richard \nNixon for actions during the White House horrors and Watergate scandal \nhave we heard such a claim. And, of course, the Administration claimed \nit had all the authority it needed and no new legislation was needed.\n  The bill the Chairman negotiated with the White House, in my view, \ncontains several fundamental flaws:\n  The bill makes compliance with FISA entirely optional, and explicitly \nvalidates the President's claim that he has unfettered authority to \nwiretap Americans in the name of national security. In other words, it \nsuggests that FISA is unconstitutional--a claim for which there is no \njudicial precedent and very little academic support--and invites the \nPresident to ignore it.\n  The bill abandons the traditional, case-by-case review contemplated \nby FISA and introduces the concept of ``program warrants.'' If that \nnovel concept is constitutional--which I doubt--a single FISA court \njudge could approve whole programs of electronic surveillance that go \nfar beyond the President's program.\n  The bill immunizes from prosecution anyone who breaks into a home or \noffice in the United States to search for foreign intelligence \ninformation, if he is acting at the behest of the President. I would \nhave thought that electronic surveillance is a large enough area to \naddress in one bill. But apparently, the Administration was unwilling \nto address electronic surveillance without also reaching for new powers \nto break into Americans' homes.\n  We should not grant that kind of blank check to the Executive for a \nsecret program we know little about. Instead, we should consider the \nbipartisan alternative the Judiciary Committee has endorsed. The \nSpecter-Feinstein bill is an approach that seeks accountability while \nensuring tools to mount a strong fight against terrorism.\n  The Majority Leader has an opportunity to unite the Senate and \nAmericans around this smarter, stronger proposal that will help protect \nAmericans as well as the values that we hold dear as a Nation. I hope \nthat he seizes that opportunity.\n  On a related note, I was a little surprised to hear the Chairman say \nearlier today that the Judiciary Committee was forwarding proposed \nlanguage changes to the War Crimes Act to the Armed Services Committee. \nI agree with the Chairman that amending the War Crimes Act is a matter \nin the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee, but I am very concerned \nabout the way in which this important issue has come up.\n  The Chairman announced yesterday in the middle of a special business \nmeeting that the Committee would be discussing a proposal. That was \nnews to me and the other Democratic members of the Committee, who had \nnot seen nor heard of the proposal. The Chairman said that a bill had \nbeen distributed Tuesday afternoon, but Democrats were not included in \nany such distribution.\n  This is a very serious issue. It certainly requires meaningful review \nand input from Senators of both parties. It is a subject about which I \ncare a great deal about.\n  This issue is being considered by the Armed Services Committee. \nSenator Warner is working with Senator Levin, and all members of that \nCommittee. I understand that they are also consulting with the top \nmilitary lawyer, who have been ignored by this Administration. I have \nseen the letters from GEN Powell and GEN Vessey on the importance of \nupholding our treaty obligation and acting in the best interests of \nprotecting Americans throughout the world.\n  GEN Powell wrote: The world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of \nour fight against terrorism. To refine Common Article 3 would add to \nthose doubts. Furthermore, it would put our own troops at risk. He \nspeaks from the perspective of a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff and a former Secretary of State.\n\n[[Page S9627]]\n\n  GEN Vessey signaled what relaxing our adherence to Common Article 3 \nof the Geneva Convention would do: ``First, it would undermine the \nmoral basis which has generally guided or conduct in war throughout our \nhistory. Second, it could give opponents a legal argument for the \nmistreatment of Americans being held prisoners in time of war.''\n  I worked hard, along with many others of both parties, to pass the \ncurrent version of the War Crimes Act. I think the current law is a \ngood law, and the concerns that have been raised about it could best be \naddressed with minor adjustments, rather than with the sweeping changes \nsuggested here.\n  In 1996, working with the Department of Defense, Congress passed the \nWar Crimes Act to provide criminal penalties for certain war crimes \ncommitted by and against Americans. The next year, again with the \nPentagon's support, Congress extended the War Crimes Act to violations \nof the baseline humanitarian protections afforded by Common Article 3 \nof the Geneva Conventions. Both measures were supported by a broad \nbipartisan consensus, and I was proud to sponsor the 1997 amendments.\n\n  The legislation was uncontroversial for a good reason. The purpose \nand effect of the War Crimes Act as amended was to provide for the \nimplementation of America's commitment to the basic international \nstandards we subscribed to when we ratified the Geneva Conventions in \n1955. Those standards are truly universal: They condemn war criminals \nwhoever and wherever they are.\n  That is a critically important aspect of the Geneva Conventions and \nour own War Crimes Act. When we are dealing with fundamental norms that \ndefine the commitments of the civilized world, we cannot have one rule \nfor us and one for them, however we define ``us'' and ``them.''\n  I am disturbed by the draft legislation, which seems to narrow the \nscope of the War Crimes Act to exclude certain violations of the Geneva \nConventions and which could have the effect of retroactively immunizing \npast violations that may have been committed by U.S. personnel.\n  The narrowing of these definitions have the potential effect of \nimmunizing past war crimes. It also could well prevent us from \nprosecuting rogues who we all agree were out of line like the soldiers \nwho mistreated prisoners at Abu Ghraib.\n  Many of the despicable tactics used in Abu Ghraib--the use of dogs, \nforced nudity, humiliation of various kinds--do not appear to be \ncovered by the narrow definitions this draft would incorporate into the \nWar Crimes Act. If this were the law, and the Abu Ghraib abuses had \ncome to light after the perpetrators left the military, they might not \nhave been brought to justice. The President and the Republican leader \nhave conceded that the conduct at Abu Ghraib was abhorrent, and the \nperpetrators did need to be brought to justice. I hope the President \nand Congressional Republicans will not now pass legislation that \nprevents us from bringing people who commit these same despicable acts \nto justice.\n  I recognize the concerns about American servicemen and women or \ngovernment employees being subjected to prosecutions for conduct that \ncould be seen as ambiguous. I believe the War Crimes Act, as is, would \nnot support prosecutions for conduct that was less than abhorrent. \nIndeed, to date, the Bush Administration has not brought a single \ncharge pursuant to the War Crimes Act.\n  I would support amending the War Crimes Act so that only ``serious'' \nviolations of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions were \nprosecutable under the War Crimes Act. This fix would address any \nlegitimate fears without creating a list of covered conduct that \nexcludes much of the conduct that is most troubling.\n  Let me be clear. There is no problem facing us about overzealous use \nof the War Crimes Act by prosecutors. In fact, as far as I can tell, \nthe Ashcroft Justice Department and the Gonzales Justice Department \nhave yet to file a single charge against anyone for violation of the \nWar Crimes Act. Not only have they never charged American personnel \nunder the Act, they have never used it to charge terrorists either.\n  The President and the Congress should not be in the business of \nimmunizing people who have broken the law, made us less safe, turning \nworld opinion against us, and undercutting our treaty obligations in \nways that encourage others to ignore the protections those treaties \nprovide to Americans. We should be very careful about any changes we \nmake.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/14/senate-section/article/S9627-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9627-S9628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CRANIOFACIAL ACCEPTANCE MONTH\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to the fact \nthat September has been designated as Craniofacial Acceptance Month. \nCraniofacial abnormalities are abnormalities that affect the skull and \nface. According to the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial \nResearch, ``craniofacial defects are among the most common of all birth \ndefects. These disorders are often devastating to parents and children \nalike. Surgery, dental care, psychological counseling, and \nrehabilitation may help ameliorate the problems, but often at a great \ncost and over many years.'' Victims of craniofacial anomalies usually \nhave to endure many expensive procedures throughout their lifetimes, \nthe costs of which can add up to cost millions of dollars.\n  Facial deformities give their victims a variety of aesthetic and \ndevelopmental problems that differ in severity and occurrence. The \ncommon condition, cleft lip, an abnormality where the lip does not \ncompletely connect, can vary from a simple disconnect to a gaping \nopening that goes from the lip to the nose. It is easy to understand \nthe developmental and respiratory problems this could present. \nFortunately, this condition can usually be corrected through one or two \nsimple reconstructive surgeries. But what about other anomalies that \nare not as easily corrected like craniosynostosis, a condition where \nthe soft spots of an infant's skull close too early, hindering normal \nbrain and skull growth? Or Goldenhar syndrome, where one side of the \nface is underdeveloped affecting the mouth, ear and jaw? Unfortunately \nthese do not represent the most severe or rarest craniofacial defects.\n  At only 10 months old, Wendelyn Osborne, who grew up in the small \ntown of Ashdown, AR, was diagnosed with Craniometaphyseal Dysplasia, or \nsimply CMD. CMD is a rare affliction which affects only 200 people \nworldwide and was depicted in the 1985 movie ``Mask'' starring Cher. \nCMD involves an overgrowth of bone which never deteriorates. This \ncaused, in her case, an abnormal appearance, bilateral facial paralysis \nand deafness. Other cases can include those characteristics as well as \nblindness and joint pain. Yet despite the challenges she has faced, \nWendelyn's life has truly been blessed. Her life expectancy was only 14 \nyears at birth, but after 17 reconstructive surgeries and two hearing \naids, Wendelyn is still alive today at the age of 40. It was not until \n2003 that Wendelyn was able to meet and interact with other people with \ncraniofacial conditions. She attended the Annual Cher's Family retreat \nand was introduced to CCA, the Children's Craniofacial Association. \nWendelyn saw the impact of support and encouragement through the \nprograms and the families associated with CCA, and has been active with \nthe organization ever since.\n  CCA has designated September as National Craniofacial Acceptance \nMonth in hopes of raising awareness of individuals with facial \ndifferences. It is not a secret that appearance plays a key part in how \nindividuals are accepted in our society. People with facial \ndifferences, in addition to medical problems, have a much harder time \nadjusting in society and developing successful relationships. Such \nindividuals have to deal with a series of consequences that arise from \nuncontrollable circumstances of their birth. Marking September as \nNational Craniofacial Acceptance Month brings attention to an issue \nthat can no longer be ignored.\n  Hopefully, by raising awareness of craniofacial defects, our larger \nsociety will begin to show understanding and acceptance of those who \nlive with these physical, medical, and emotional challenges. \nUnderstanding and increased\n\n[[Page S9628]]\n\npublic awareness of craniofacial disorders and abnormalities would let \npeople like Wendelyn Osborne and hundreds of thousands of innocent \nindividuals know that they are not unwanted and not alone in their \nbattle with craniofacial conditions. I would like to commend CCA on \ntaking an important step to raise awareness about this issue. I join \nthe Children's Craniofacial Association in looking forward to the day \nwhen our Nation will ``look beyond the face, to the heart within.'' I \nsalute the Children's Craniofacial Association, Wendelyn Osborne, and \nall of the children and adults who live with these challenges and the \nfamilies and persons who support them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/14/senate-section/article/S9628-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 F_____\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO ARTHUR A.

Scotchman \nIndustries has enjoyed a long and rich history in my home State.\n  In October of 1956, Art Kroetch, with the help of his wife Eleanor, \nstarted a small scrap metal business in Philip. Since its start, Art's \nbusiness has steadily progressed from a scrap metal business into an \nagricultural tool manufacturer, to a national machine tool \nmanufacturer, and finally into what it is today, an industry leading, \nmultinational machine tool manufacturer. Small businesses are the \nbackbone of the great State of South Dakota and I commend Art not only \nfor his success with Scotchman Industries, but also for his \ncontributions to his community and State.\n  It gives me great pleasure to rise with the town of Philip in \ncongratulating Scotchman Industries and Art Kroetch on 50 years of \nsuccessful operation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/14/senate-section/article/S9628-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE IN HONOR OF JUNE COLLIER FLETCHER\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I honor June Collier \nFletcher, one of Alabama's most influential women, who died on \nSeptember 9, 2006. She rose from a meager upbringing to become the \npresident and CEO of National Industries, Inc. Once the largest private \nemployer in Montgomery, June built National Industries from the ground \nup to become a major automotive supplier employing 5,000 Alabamians.\n  June's drive and ambition allowed her to become a leader in an \nindustry dominated by men. Under her guidance and leadership, National \nIndustries became a flourishing $130 million-a-year electrical \nconnection business.\n  Over the years, June was recognized for her hard work, dedication, \nand expertise and received numerous awards and accolades. She served as \na member of the Commerce Department's prestigious Industrial Policy \nAdvisory Committee, testified before Congress on automotive issues, and \nwas a sought-after speaker on the subject of international trade. June \nreceived the Industry Week Excellence in Management Award and was \nselected to the Committee of 200, an organization of the top 200 women \nbusiness leaders in America.\n  In addition to her work in the automotive industry, she was also \nactive in petroleum exploration and production, farming, and garment \nmanufacturing. In the 1980s, June's company was awarded a government \ncontract to produce chemical warfare protective clothing which was used \nduring the first gulf war.\n  June was an inspiration to many and I am truly grateful for the \nendless contributions she made to Alabama and our Nation. She will be \nmissed by her husband Tim Fletcher; her five children, Kara Davis, Ondi \nCain, Roessler Collier, Arin Burroughs, Kohler Collier; her \nstepchildren, Tom Fletcher, Jr., Carrie Fletcher; her 12 grandchildren \nand 2 great-grandchildren. She will also be missed by her many friends \nand the numerous people she worked with whose lives she touched \nthroughout her magnificent journey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/14/senate-section/article/S9628-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO TAMMY MAHAN\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, one of the great joys of my job as \nSenator is working closely with talented, dedicated Iowans from all \nwalks of life. I would like to take a moment to salute one of those \nexceptional people, Tammy Mahan, an outstanding social worker, and a \npassionate advocate for adoption and foster care.\n  Tammy has dedicated her life to children, and has made a profound \ndifference in the lives of countless foster and adopted youngsters in \nIowa and across the United States. In her ``day job,'' Tammy works at \nChildren and Families of Iowa, where she is responsible for assisting \nfoster parents through the licensing process.\n  A year ago, Tammy went beyond the call of duty by starting up a new \norganization in Des Moines called Elevate. Elevate is a growing team of \nyoung people who are active in a variety of important ways. They \nrecruit families to foster or adopt teenagers. They educate legislators \nand the public about foster care and adoption. And they work to empower \nand increase the self-esteem of other teenagers who join the team as \nadvocates. Elevate is doing wonderful things nationwide to encourage \nfoster care and adoption. And the young people who are active in \nElevate are just fantastic; they are passionate about their work, and \nthey are setting a wonderful example for their peers.\n  I am deeply grateful to Tammy Mahan for all that she is doing in the \ncommunity. By the way, Tammy and her husband Mitchell, are adoptive \nparents of two children. While it is easy for some professionals to \ntalk the talk of youth empowerment and improving the system, Tammy and \nher family are walking the walk. Ghandi said that ``You must be the \nchange you want to see in the world.'' And that is exactly what Tammy \nand the young people of Elevate are doing.\n  This week, Tammy Mahan is in Washington to be honored for her \noutstanding public service. She is receiving a 2006 ``Angel in \nAdoption'' award from the Congressional Coalition on Adoption. This is \nan honor richly deserved. I congratulate Tammy, and I salute not only \nher work but also the good work being done by all the young activists \nin Elevate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/14/senate-section/article/S9628-4", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9628-S9629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING DR. EDGAR WAYBURN\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I join with friends and \nassociates across the country to honor the 100th birthday on September \n17 of Dr. Edgar Wayburn of San Francisco. From the time that his \nappreciation of the American landscape began in Macon, GA, to his role \ntoday as honorary president of the Sierra Club, Dr. Wayburn has built a \nlifetime of conservation activism that has immeasurably benefited our \ncountry and the world.\n  Across our Nation, 100,000,000 acres of some of the most beautiful \nlandscape in the world are protected for future generations thanks in \nlarge part to the dedicated efforts of Dr. Wayburn. Never a full-time \nconservationist, Dr. Wayburn has dedicated weekends and hours away from \nhis medical practice to protecting our wild lands and wildlife.\n  From the Mount Tamalpais State Park in California to Admiralty Island \nin southeastern Alaska, Dr. Wayburn's accomplishments read as an honor \nroll of conservation achievements. He has been a true visionary in \npromotion of conservation and has inspired countless other Americans.\n  One example in particular uniquely epitomizes Dr. Wayburn's legacy. \nDriving out of San Francisco International Airport, you face west \ntoward the hills of San Mateo County. Beyond those hills, along the \ncoast for more than 10 miles to the south and for 75 miles to the north \nstands one or our country's most majestic national parks--the Golden \nGate National Recreation Area. The park encompasses 80,000 acres in 3 \ncounties and lies adjacent to Point Reyes National Seashore; thus more \nthan 150,000 acres are preserved for habitat and wildlife and are \nenjoyed by more than 20 million people every year. Dr. Wayburn played \nan instrumental part in the founding of both of these national parks.\n  For over 100 years, the U.S. military fortified the region now home \nto the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. But in the 1960s the \nmilitary became aware that its bunkers and missiles had little value \nfor our Nation's defense and made plans to sell parts of the area's \ninstallations and fortifications.\n  Bay Area residents were determined that this magnificent landscape \nnot be\n\n[[Page S9629]]\n\nlost to ordinary development. Here was the chance for people to see the \nnatural world in an urban context, to look upon the wilderness from the \ncity, and Dr. Wayburn helped lead the way. When he learned of a \nfarsighted Interior Department proposal to preserve underused military \nland across the Nation for public use and enjoyment, he became the \nleader of the citizens' group organized to save the land at his \ndoorstep. He also insisted upon enlargement of the original 8,000-acre \nproposal.\n  Thanks to widespread support and the indefatigable efforts of Dr. \nWayburn, the campaign to protect this invaluable natural treasure was a \nresounding success. Congress authorized the Golden Gate National \nRecreation Area in 1972, which now stands as a monument to the \ncommitted efforts of so many like Dr. Wayburn.\n  The story of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area stands as just \none of many achievements that mark Dr. Wayburn's inimitable career.\n  In 1999, President Bill Clinton recognized Dr. Wayburn's lifetime of \nservice by awarding him our Nation's highest civilian honor--the \nPresidential Medal of Freedom. In honoring his achievements, President \nClinton counted Dr. Wayburn as the person who had saved ``more of our \nwilderness than any other person alive.'' I can think of no more \nfitting praise to offer Dr. Wayburn.\n  Dr. Wayburn has created a legacy that will live on for generations to \ncome, and he has made our Nation and our world a better place. I \ncommend him on his efforts and offer my heartfelt gratitude for his \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/14/senate-section/article/S9629-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:58 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 2590.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. McCain, and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 3892. A bill to reduce the number of deaths along the border \nbetween the United States and Mexico by improving the placement of \nrescue beacons, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, one cold May morning earlier this year, a \nBorder Patrol agent found the body of a 3-year-old boy in a blue \nwindbreaker, his arms crossed. He had died trying to cross our southern \nborder, the youngest victim our borders have claimed this year.\n  The boy's mother's name is Edith Rodriguez. She is 25 years old. She \nattempted to cross the border illegally, in hopes that she might escape \nthe desperate poverty of her home state of Veracruz, Mexico. Edith \nhired a human smuggler--a coyote.\n  The coyote gave his charges an illegal drug, ephedrine, to help them \nkeep awake and moving. But Edith and her son still could not keep up \nwith the group. So the coyote, in a cruel and heartless act, abandoned \nthem in the desert. Alone. With no food and little water, with a \ndangerous drug coursing through his system, exposed to the elements--\nEdith Rodriguez's little boy died.\n  Edith Rodriguez violated the laws of the United States when she \ncrossed the border illegally. She was wrong to violate our border. But \nall should agree that her son did not deserve to die.\n  Here are the facts: Every 18\\1/2\\ hours, someone dies trying to cross \nthe border between the United States and Mexico. About a year ago, I \nasked the Government Accountability Office to study the deaths that \ntake place along America's borders.\n  Today, my office released that study. The results are sobering, \nshocking, and, I strongly believe, a cause for action. Since 1995, \ndeaths along our borders have doubled. Despite the heroic rescue \nefforts of the men and women of Customs and Border Protection, things \nhave gotten worse. In 1995, 266 people\n\n[[Page S9632]]\n\ndied trying to cross our borders. Last year, 427 perished.\n  The increases, it appears, stem largely from an increase in deaths \nfrom exposure to the elements in the Sonoran Desert in Arizona. Illegal \nentries, however, have not increased. Quite frankly, it is getting more \ndangerous to cross our border.\n  Until recently, CBP did not even keep a systematic count of those who \ndied crossing our borders. We still do not have a unified national \nstrategy for reducing the deaths. We still do not know how well our \nsafety efforts work--if they are saving lives or not. We need to do \nmore.\n  The founding document of our Nation, the Declaration of Independence, \nlists ``life'' first on the list of Government's responsibilities. The \noverwhelming majority of the people who cross our border do so in \nsearch of a better life. They take enormous risks and make enormous \ninvestments in hopes of helping their families.\n  Illegal immigration needs to stop. We must defend our borders. We \nmust construct physical barriers, add detention beds, hire personnel, \nand equip them with better technology. But we have a higher moral \nobligation to protect the life of every person--every man, woman, and \nchild--who sets foot on American soil. We must do everything in our \npower to preserve life.\n  That is why I propose the Border Death Reduction Act. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  The law will implement the GAO's recommendations. It will require CBP \nto create a strategy for reducing border deaths. It will mandate a full \ncount of deaths along the border. It will impose tough, new penalties \non coyotes who abandon their charges, and it will expand the network of \nrescue beacons that people in trouble can use to call for help.\n  These beacons, I believe, are an absolutely vital link in our border \nsecurity system. Let me explain. Rescue beacons are devices at \nprominent locations that individuals can activate when they need help. \nThey are tall polls with lights at the top and radio transmitters \ninside. People in trouble can activate a beacon to let CBP know that \nthey need help. We know that beacons work: CBP has already saved dozens \nof people based entirely on beacon alerts.\n  But individuals who activate beacons do not get a free pass. They \nwill, of course, receive necessary medical treatment. But rescued \nindividuals will still be detained and deported like anyone else who \nviolates our borders.\n  Deploying more beacons in the desert will save lives in the desert \nand simultaneously improve the security of our frontiers.\n  We cannot delay. We should not rest. We must protect the lives of all \nthose who set foot upon our soil. I urge my colleagues to support the \nBorder Death Reduction Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3892\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the return of the Fresnel Lens to the \nlantern room atop Presque Isle Light Station Lighthouse, Michigan, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to offer the Lester Nichols \nPresque Isle Light Station Act with my colleague, Senator Levin. \nCongressman Stupak is introducing the companion legislation in the \nHouse of Representatives today. Our bill will restore the historic \nFresnel lens to the Presque Isle lighthouse in Presque Isle Township, \nMI.\n  Michigan has the most lighthouses of any State in the Nation with a \ntotal of over 120. At one time we had over 100 manned lighthouses, more \nthan any other State. This is not surprising considering that Michigan \nhas 3,288 miles of shoreline along the Great Lakes. We are proud of our \nlighthouses and we are proud of the history and the maritime heritage \nthat they represent. Our lighthouses are part of our identity as a \nState. In addition to performing as navigation aids, they remain a \nsymbol of the importance that the Great Lakes played and continue to \nplay in Michigan's history.\n  Most importantly, they are an important part of the economies of our \ncoastal towns. Our lakeshore towns host visitors from across the \ncountry who travel to view the magnificence of our coastal areas and \nthe lighthouses that illuminate them. These small communities are more \ndependent than ever on tourism dollars, and we must help them by \ncoordinating our efforts to protect Michigan's lighthouses and promote \nGreat Lakes' maritime culture.\n  In 2002 the U.S. Coast Guard, the Michigan State Historic \nPreservation\n\n[[Page S9633]]\n\nOfficer, and the township signed a memorandum of agreement stating that \nupon removal from the tower, the Fresnel lens would be restored by the \ntownship in a museum type setting with assistance from the Coast Guard. \nIn 2005, the township completed their restoration work on the lens. \nUnfortunately, we soon learned that the Coast Guard has another policy \nthat prevents a Fresnel lens from being replaced once it is removed \nfrom the tower.\n  The result is that this lighthouse has been historically compromised. \nReplacing the lens in its original home for the enjoyment of all who \nvisit our historic lighthouse will not only ensure the integrity of the \nlighthouse, but it will enhance the function the lighthouse provides as \nan active navigational aid.\n  Very simply, our bill requires the Coast Guard to replace the \nrestored Fresnel lens in the Presque Isle Lighthouse.\n  Our bill is named after Les Nichols, who through years of hard work \nand perseverance has led the successful effort in the restoration of \nthe historic 3rd Order Fresnel Lens. The Fresnel lens is an integral \npart of the historic value of the New Presque Isle Lighthouse and will \ncontinue to attract tourists to this region of the State.

A bill to amend titles XI and XVIII of the Social Security \nAct to provide for the sharing of certain data collected by the Centers \nfor Medicare & Medicaid Services with certain agencies, research \ncenters and organizations, and congressional support agencies; from the \nCommittee on Finance; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nMontana, Senator Baucus, in introducing the Medicare Data Access and \nResearch Act. Senator Baucus and I have long enjoyed a good working \nrelationship in our roles as chairman and ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee. Our work on this bill once again demonstrates our commitment \nto working in a bipartisan manner.\n  The Medicare Data Access and Research Act establishes a process \nthrough which Federal agencies and other researchers can access \nMedicare data for the purpose of health services research. This might \nseem like a pretty mundane issue to some people, but I can assure you \nthat it is far from it. Medicare processes 500 million claims for \nbenefits each year; millions of prescriptions have been filled under \nthe new Medicare prescription drug benefit.\n  Linking data on hospital and physician services provided to Medicare \nbeneficiaries to prescription drug data will offer a tremendous \nresource for researchers in our Federal agencies, as well as those \nbased at universities and other research centers. What of research can \nthese data support? They can support studies and analyses related to \npostmarketing surveillance of prescription drugs and research on drug \nsafety. More concretely, analyzing the Medicare claims data can help \nagencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration FDA, identify \nsituations like the one involving Vioxx more quickly, and provide a new \nvaluable tool to enable the FDA to take swifter action to protect the \npublic's health and well-being.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Agency for \nHealthcare Research and Quality, and the National Institutes of Health \nall have missions that require the conduct of meticulous health \nservices research. The Medicare database and access to it established \nunder the bill we are introducing today will help these agencies \nfulfill their missions to study immunization rates; to develop and \nmonitor the use of preventive screenings; conduct research on the \nclinical comparative effectiveness of prescription drugs; and to help \nprevent, diagnose, and treat disease.\n  To ensure access to the data, the bill requires the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to enter data release agreements on an annual \nbasis with these agencies. In entering the data release agreements, the \nSecretary must take appropriate steps to protect the confidentiality of \nthe information, while maintaining the ability of researchers at \nFederal agencies to conduct meaningful analyses.\n  The bill also permits the Secretary to enter into data use agreements \nto permit researchers at universities and other organizations to have \naccess to the data. As will be the case for the Federal agencies, these \nresearchers may only use the data for purposes of advancing the \npublic's health. They can conduct studies on the safety, effectiveness, \nand quality of health services.\n  Some people might be concerned that these data will be given to just \nanyone. That is not the case. In applying for data access, researchers \nat universities and other organizations will have to meet strict \ncriteria. They must have well-documented experience in analyzing the \ntype and volume of data to be provided under the agreement. They must \nagree to publish and publicly disseminate their research methodology \nand results. They must obtain approval for their study from a review \nboard. They must comply with all safeguards established by the \nSecretary to ensure the confidentiality of information. These \nsafeguards cannot permit the disclosure of information to an extent \ngreater than permitted by the Health Insurance Portability and \nAccountability Act of 1996 and the Privacy Act of 1974.\n  The final section of the bill ensures that congressional support \nagencies, including the Congressional Budget Office, the Congressional \nResearch Service, the Government Accountability Office, and the \nMedicare Payment Advisory Commission, also have access to data they \nneed to carry out their functions and responsibilities. This body \ndepends on the research and analyses conducted by those agencies to \ninform our deliberations and decisions on the Medicare Program.\n  Last year, Senator Baucus and I introduced the Medicare Value-Based \nPurchasing Act to establish a pay for performance system under \nMedicare. That bill was aimed at promoting quality and ensuring value \nunder the Medicare Program. The bill that we are introducing today \ncomplements that objective. How can we promote quality and ensure value \nin Medicare? By having a better understanding of what services are \neffective, by knowing how we can help beneficiaries avoid illness and \ndisease, by having insight about potential over-use and under-use of \nhealth care services, and by identifying troubling trends and patterns. \nHow can we learn about those topics? By supporting rigorous health \nservices research.\n\n[[Page S9634]]\n\n  Mr. President, the Medicare Data Access and Research Act creates a \nsound framework for accomplishing that objective.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3897\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Data Access and \n     Research Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The new Medicare drug benefit under part D of title \n     XVIII of the Social Security Act is delivered through private \n     prescription drug plans. Private plans submit administrative \n     and beneficiary level data to the Centers for Medicare & \n     Medicaid Services as a condition of participation and payment \n     in the new Medicare drug program.\n       (2) Data from the new Medicare drug benefit can be linked \n     with hospital, ambulatory care, and other data to create a \n     new comprehensive resource for the study of drug safety and \n     effectiveness of medical care in older adults and low-income, \n     disabled, and vulnerable populations. With appropriate \n     protections for privacy, this data should be available to the \n     Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention, the Agency for Healthcare Research and \n     Quality, and the National Institutes of Health, and \n     university-based research centers and other research \n     organizations interested in furthering the public health \n     through research on the safety, effectiveness, and quality of \n     health care services provided under the Medicare program \n     under title XVIII of the Social Security Act.\n       (3) Timely and ready access to certain data from the new \n     Medicare drug benefit will allow congressional support \n     agencies to inform and advise Congress on the cost, scope, \n     and impact of the new benefit and assess its quality.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join Chairman \nGrassley in introducing the Medicare Data Access and Research Act. This \nbill will take an important step to advance the safety, efficacy, and \nquality of health care services delivered to people under the Medicare \nProgram and it will help improve the care delivered to all Americans.\n  This bill requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services, HHS, \nto make Medicare data accessible to Federal health agencies and the \nhealth services research community for the purpose of conducting \nstudies that will serve the public health. As the largest single payer \nof health care services in the United States--covering over 40 million \nlives, 70 million hospital days, and processing nearly a billion \nphysician claims per year--Medicare collects and maintains a wealth of \ninformation on the health services delivered to a significant portion \nof the population. This information has been a national resource for \nresearch and analysis of health care. And with the addition of the \nMedicare prescription drug benefit, it will be the most comprehensive \nresource our Nation has to study the effects of diseases and the \ntreatments we have for them.\n  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service, CMS, currently \nreleases certain Medicare data to the public and more comprehensive \ndata to the research community. This bill would build on current \nactivities by requiring CMS to link hospital claims, physician claims, \nand other relevant information to data collected under the new Medicare \ndrug benefit.\n  In addition, the Secretary will provide yearly access to the linked \nMedicare dataset to all Federal health agencies within the department, \nsuch as the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease \nControl, the National Institutes of Health, and the Agency for \nHealthcare Quality and Research. These agencies will enter into data \nuse agreements with CMS to ensure that the type and level of Medicare \ndata shared is appropriate, that the agencies conduct research in \naccordance with their missions and the purpose of furthering the public \nhealth, and that the privacy of the data is protected. The goal is to \ngive Federal health agencies another tool to evaluate the safety, \nefficacy, and quality of care delivered to Medicare beneficiaries--a \nlarge segment of the health system.\n  This bill also provides public health researchers access to the \nlinked Medicare dataset. Expanding access to Medicare data will open up \na new era in our health system. It will enable scientists to more \nquickly identify both short- and long-term safety concerns with drug \nregimens and health treatments. It will enable more treatments to be \ncompared. And it will promote more development of guidelines, so \nproviders and patients know more about what works best.\n  Some may argue that access to linked Medicare data should not be \nlimited to researchers and should be available for commercial purposes. \nBut the full Medicare database should be used exclusively for the \npublic good and not for private or commercial gain. This is the crux of \nthis bill. Hence, the bill limits the use of data to the purpose of \nproviding ``generalizable knowledge to inform the public health through \nscientific publication and other forms of public dissemination.'' \nStrict penalties will be imposed on any unauthorized use of the data \nincluding civil money penalties and disqualification from receiving \nMedicare data for at least 2 years.\n  CMS will publish criteria used to approve research applications to \nensure that those selected are qualified and experienced to conduct \nanalyses and maintain the confidentiality of Medicare information. \nResearchers will also make public their detailed results and methods \nwithin 1 year from completing their studies. They will make available \nto the public at no charge any tool developed through this program. \nThey must agree not to sell data or create commercial data products \nusing such data and abide by safeguards protecting the confidentiality \nof the data established by the Secretary.\n  The final section of the bill ensures that congressional support \nagencies, including the Congressional Budget Office, the Congressional \nResearch Service, the Government Accountability Office, and the \nMedicare Payment Advisory Commission, also have access to the full \nrange of data they need to carry out their functions and \nresponsibilities. Congress depends on the research and analyses \nconducted by these agencies to inform our deliberations and decisions \non the Medicare Program.\n  Last year, I worked with Senator Grassley to introduce the Medicare \nValue-Based Purchasing Act, which establishes a pay for performance \nsystem under Medicare. An important element of that system is the \ncollection and reporting of quality measures to CMS and to the public. \nThe bill we are introducing today complements those activities. We can \nimprove health care by allowing Medicare to become a value-based \npurchaser of services and by reporting quality measures through the \nMedicare Program. And we can improve health care for all by allowing \nrigorous health services research to be conducted using the resource of \nMedicare data.\n  Mr. President, the Medicare Data Access and Research Act will allow \nus to expand our knowledge of health care and improve the quality of \ncare for all Americans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GREGG (for himself, Mr. Frist, Mr. Burr, Mr. Cornyn, and \n        Mr. Bennett):\n  S. 3900. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove the quality and efficiency of health care, to provide the \npublic with information on provider and supplier performance, and to \nenhance the education and awareness of consumers for evaluating health \ncare services through the development and release of reports based on \nMedicare enrollment, claims, survey, and assessment data; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medicare \nQuality Enhancement Act of 2006 to improve quality and reduce the cost \nof health care.\n  The Medicare Quality Enhancement Act addresses three important \nproblems in our Nation's health care delivery system: rising costs, \nbroad variations in the quality of care, and a lack of information on \nhealth care quality and cost.\n  Among the most pressing issues that need to be addressed in the area \nof health care is the issue of rapidly rising health care costs. The \nUnited States spends more on health care as a percentage of GDP than \nany other industrialized country. According to the Centers for Medicare \nand Medicaid Services (CMS), total health expenditures are estimated to \nbe $2.16 trillion\n\n[[Page S9637]]\n\nin 2006 and are projected to rise to over $4 trillion in 2015.\n  The pressures of rising health care costs are being felt by \nconsumers, providers, employers, State and local governments, and the \nFederal budget alike--with no end in sight. Premiums for employer-based \nhealth insurance rose by 9.2 percent in 2005--the fifth consecutive \nyear of increases over 9 percent. Health insurance expenses are the \nfastest growing expense to employers, consuming more and more of each \ncompany's bottom line.\n  From a Federal budget perspective, over the next 10 years, Medicare \nwill grow on average 8.5 percent to $885 billion and Medicaid will grow \nsimilarly at 8 percent to $413 billion. These programs along with \nSocial Security will take up 56 percent of the total budget in 2016. \nSuch rate of growth is unsustainable.\n  Despite this enormous level of spending, there is wide variation in \nthe quality of the care Americans receive. In addition to the existing \ncrisis of ever increasing costs, we are now learning that there are \nvast variations in the ratio of spending to outcomes, meaning that more \ncare is not necessarily better care. A recent report by the Dartmouth \nAtlas Project demonstrated this point and showed no correlation between \nhigh utilization of services and high quality of care. This information \nprovides an opportunity to improve care and reduce costs. We simply \ncannot afford business as usual in health care, especially when we have \nno way of determining the value of what we are purchasing.\n  The Agency on Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) also reports \nwide variation in health care practice. AHRQ claims that millions of \nAmericans fail to receive necessary care resulting in complications and \nincreased costs. Others, they say, receive health care services that \nare completely unnecessary, which also increases costs.\n  These problems are compounded by a third issue the lack of \ninformation available to consumers and purchasers on quality and cost. \nCurrently, health care consumers do not have the tools necessary to \nmake sound quality and cost decisions about their care. The few tools \nthat are available to them are based on limited amounts of privately \nheld data and their analysis is often not broad enough to provide the \nmost accurate results.\n  The Medicare Quality Enhancement Act gives consumers, employers, \nproviders and others the tools they need to begin controlling \nunnecessary spending; improves quality of care in our nation's health \ncare delivery system; and provides the public with reports to make \ninformed health care decisions.\n  The bill works by sharing taxpayer funded Medicare data with private \nsector Medicare Quality Reporting Organizations (MQROs), allowing them \nto develop reports to measure health care quality for the public. \nConsumer groups, employers, insurance companies, labor unions and \nothers have repeatedly requested access to Medicare claims data to \nimprove the quality of the health care provided to their members, \nemployees, and beneficiaries and to help control the ever-rising costs \nof health care. The Medicare Quality Enhancement Act ensures that the \ndata collected by Medicare and paid for by the taxpayer can be utilized \nby qualified organizations to measure quality and control costs while \nprotecting beneficiary privacy.\n  The measure also empowers consumer groups, providers, employers, \ninsurance plans, labor unions and others by allowing them to request \nhealth care quality and efficiency reports from the newly-formed \nMQROs--information that will assist in better-informed purchasing \ndecisions. Further, the bill provides for the public release of all \nreports, including detailed information on the methodology, standards \nand measures of quality used in developing the reports ensuring the \ninformation is available for the general public. In addition, MQROs \nthat contract with the Department of Health and Human Services will be \nauthorized to aggregate both private and public data, providing a \nsignificantly more robust assessment of both quality and efficiency.\n  In the development of this bill, my first goal was to protect \nbeneficiary privacy. Specifically, the bill limits the number of MQRO \nparticipants and explicitly holds them to the strict standards of both \nthe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the \nPrivacy Act. It also requires MQROs to have operational standards and \nprocedures in place to provide for the security of the database. \nLastly, the bill requires a privacy review by the Department of Health \nand Human Services of each analytical report prior to release.\n  The Medicare Quality Enhancement Act promotes the development of \nmodel quality standards through a newly established Quality Advisory \nBoard within the Department of Health and Human Services and encourages \nthe Administration to continue its extraordinary work with providers, \nconsumers, insurers and others in the health care community toward \nsound quality measurement for all patients. Collaborative groups such \nas the Ambulatory Care Quality Alliance (AQA) and the Hospital Quality \nAlliance (HQA) are working hard to establish standards and the Medicare \nQuality Enhancement Act encourages their work to continue.\n  Under the bill, researchers are granted additional access to Medicare \ndata and are allowed to report in a provider- and supplier-identifiable \nformat as long as they meet existing strict criteria for the use of \nMedicare data within CMS. Some of our best information on quality and \nefficiency has been borne of fine academic institutions and private \nstudy and they, too, should have the opportunities to use this data to \nimprove our health care system.\n  In closing, the Medicare Quality Enhancement Act is needed in order \nfor America's health care system to improve. The public needs to \nunderstand the quality of the care they are purchasing and the time has \ncome for the health care community to compete on quality, value, and \ncost payment should not simply be for the volume of care provided, but \ninstead for the quality of the care provided.\n  The Medicare Quality Enhancement Act takes important steps to provide \nhealth care consumers with the information they need to make educated \ndecisions about health care; information they already have to make \ndecisions on nearly every other product they purchase in the \nmarketplace. It requires that information paid for by the taxpayer and \nheld by Medicare is fully available to improve our health care system. \nThe public will then finally have the tools necessary to make informed \nhealth care decisions for themselves and their families.\n  This bill has the support of groups that represent consumers, \nproviders, employers and insurers. I hope my colleagues will see the \nmerit of this legislation and that it will be considered before we \nadjourn this year.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, for decades, healthcare analysts and \nindustry experts have wondered whether healthcare should consume 16 \npercent of our Nation's economic output, as it currently does.\n  By virtually any measure, we spend more on healthcare than any other \ncountry in the world.\n  Consider the facts. According to the World Health Organization; we \nspend twice as much per person on healthcare as Britain and Japan; and \nwe spend nearly 30 percent more than second-ranking Monaco.\n  In the past 5 years alone, the cost of health insurance to companies \nhas nearly doubled--from $4,200 to $8,100 per family.\n  But experts also concur that rising healthcare costs does not mean \nthe quality of healthcare is improving. Just this summer, the Institute \nof Medicine released the most extensive report ever on medication \nerrors.\n  The results? At least 1.5 million Americans are sickened, injured, or \nkilled each year by errors in prescribing, dispensing, and taking \nmedications.\n  Errors are widespread--on average, a hospital patient is subjected to \n1 error each day he or she occupies a hospital bed--and they are \ncostly, at an estimated expense of $3.5 billion per year.\n  We have good reason to question the cost and quality of our \nhealthcare services. That is why, in August, President Bush issued an \nexecutive order requiring all Federal agencies with a health insurance \nprogram to increase price transparency and provide options promoting \nquality and efficiency of care.\n\n[[Page S9638]]\n\n  The Executive Order builds on the Federal Govermment's efforts to \nrelease Medicare payment information for individual healthcare \nproviders.\n  While this is an important step toward transparency, more can be \ndone. We need a way to analyze that data and make the results of the \nanalysis consumer friendly, so that patients have real information they \ncan use to make better informed healthcare decisions.\n  The bill before us today--of which I am a proud cosponsor--picks up \nwhere current Federal efforts leave off. The Medicare Quality \nEnhancement Act establishes quality transparency in the Medicare \nProgram.\n  It doesn't require anything extra of providers. In fact, CMS is \nalready collecting the data we need--because any provider that accepts \nMedicare patients must report quality data to CMS.\n  Instead, the bill requires CMS to establish public-private \npartnerships with Medicare quality reporting organizations, or MQROs. \nCMS will provide MQROs with data CMS already collects--Medicare \nenrollment, claims, and survey and assessment data. The MQROs will then \nperform the analysis.\n  Any entity or provider will be able to make report requests of MQROs, \nthe results of which will be made public. The methodology an MQRO uses \nto analyze the data will also be made public. And providers can \nadditionally instruct MQROs to use a certain methodology when making a \nreport request.\n  I know many providers are concerned about CMS's capacity and \ncapability to analyze healthcare quality data.\n  In part, that is why this bill requires CMS to contract with MQROs. \nThe Secretary must determine that each MQRO has the research capability \nto conduct and complete reports as a condition for entering into the \ncontract. MQROs must also demonstrate that they have the experience and \nexpertise to analyze quality data.\n  As an additional contract requirement, each MQRO must comply with \nFederal privacy regulations to ensure beneficiary confidentiality. \nAdditionally, MQROs must disclose financial interests as a condition to \ncontract.\n  As a transplant surgeon, I understand the concerns and fears \nproviders have. Many providers are worried that we aren't far enough \nalong in terms of quality data collection to be able to analyze it.\n  But we must push the envelope in this area. It is my hope that \nprovider groups will take the lead and request reports using a \nmethodology and standards of quality that represent the best care in \neach of their fields.\n  Quality transparency is absolutely essential to improving healthcare. \nWithout it, beneficiaries cannot make informed decisions about their \nhealthcare.\n  Consumers already enjoy transparency in other industries. When we buy \na new car, we can open an Internet browser and in a matter of moments \ncan make objective side-by-side comparisons of different models--and \nthen we can take them for a test drive.\n  When we need groceries, we pull out the Sunday supermarket ads to see \nwhat is on sale and where.\n  And when we furnish our homes, we shop around--comparing style, \nprice, color, quality, warranty, and service.\n  But right now, we can't do that in healthcare. Whether it is a \nroutine checkup or a heart transplant, we have no way of assessing how \nmuch bang we are getting for a buck.\n  Only when we institute quality transparency do we empower \nbeneficiaries to make informed decisions about their healthcare.\n  This bill is a great step toward the goal of complete quality \ntransparency. It is a formidable goal; that is why we are starting with \nsomething we know--Medicare.\n  Senator Gregg has worked long hours to bring this bill to fruition, \nand I thank him for his efforts. I hope our colleagues will join us in \nsupporting this important measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS:\n  S. 3902. A bill to provide for education competitiveness; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in August of 1802, from his desk in \nMonticello, President Thomas Jefferson glimpsed the future of the young \nAmerican economy. He was shaken by what he saw.\n  Jefferson had just finished reading a book published a year earlier \nin London. The slim volume was the travel account of Alexander \nMacKenzie, a young Scotsman working in Great Britain's Canadian \ncolonies.\n  In June of 1793, MacKenzie had crossed the Continental Divide at a \nplace where it was just 3,000 feet high and easily portaged. Two weeks \nlater, he reached the Pacific Ocean. Using a makeshift paint of \nvermilion and grease, Mackenzie inscribed his name on a rock to \nmemorialize his discovery, and to claim it for Great Britain.\n  The economic implications of MacKenzie's discovery were enormous. In \nhis book, MacKenzie urged the British to build on his discovery and \ndevelop a passage to the Pacific. Such a passage would give Great \nBritain control over much of North America's lucrative fur trade and \naccess to the world's markets. Worse, MacKenzie's discovery threatened \nto stunt America's economic growth in its infancy.\n  MacKenzie's book lit a fire under Jefferson. That summer, he talked \nof little else. He enlisted the most qualified man he knew. And with \nhim, Jefferson devised a plan for action. It was a plan to counter the \neconomic threat from the north. It was a plan to safeguard America's \neconomic future.\n  That December, President Jefferson presented his plan to Congress. It \nwas America's first economic competitiveness plan. It called for one \nofficer, a dozen soldiers, and $2,500.\n  Thomas Jefferson's economic competitiveness plan of 1802 has become \nbetter known as the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Today, we see that \nexpedition as one of our Nation's great displays of ambition and \ncourage. And today, we see that it laid the foundation of the United \nStates as we know it.\n  Today, America faces a new competitive challenge. Our challenge is \nnot over control of the fur trade. It comes not from an imperial power \nor its colony. It is not a race for territory in unexplored lands. Our \nchallenge is far more complex. And the need to act is even more urgent.\n  America today faces a world more integrated, more interdependent, and \nmore intensely competitive than ever in our history. In this world, it \nis our challenge to succeed. It is our challenge to leave our children \nand grandchildren an economy that is better than the one that we \ninherited.\n  We seek an economy that is not laden with debt, but bursting with \nopportunity. We seek an economy that plants the seeds of innovation and \neducation today, knowing that generations far in the future will \nharvest their bounty. We seek an economy whose workers are increasingly \nproductive, and whose skills are continuously sharpened.\n  Our challenge is to create an economy in which investment in our \nworkers is our greatest asset, not our heaviest burden. Our challenge \nis to create an economy known for what it will be, rather than for what \nit was.\n  To realize this competitive economy, we must--like Jefferson--rise to \nthe challenge. We must--like Jefferson--look to unknown horizons and \nmarch out to meet them. We must call upon our greatest minds and set \nthem to creating a plan. And we must dedicate the resources necessary \nto implement that plan.\n  I have spent much of the past year planning a comprehensive \ncompetitiveness agenda. In February, I introduced the Trade \nCompetitiveness Act, a bill to open markets and keep a level playing \nfield for America's ranchers, farmers, and businesses.\n  In March, I introduced the Energy Competitiveness Act, to fund \ncutting edge research in energy while making alternative energies more \naffordable.\n  In April, I introduced the Savings Competitiveness Act, to create \nsavings today, so that we may invest and innovate tomorrow.\n  In May, I introduced the Research Competitiveness Act, to give start-\nups and universities better access to capital for research and \ndevelopment, and to improve and make permanent the R tax credit.\n  Today, I am introducing the fifth in this series of bills: the \nEducation Competitiveness Act of 2006. Just as education is the \nfoundation of a competitive economy, this legislation is the foundation \nof my competitiveness agenda.\n\n[[Page S9639]]\n\n  Thomas Jefferson knew that it was not enough to send Lewis and Clark \nto the Pacific Ocean without the means to return. Lewis and Clark knew \nthat the discoveries and contacts that they made had to be lasting to \nmake a difference for our economy.\n  The Education Competitiveness Act is also designed to have a lasting \neffect. This legislation embraces education in its earliest stages, \nfollowing through to continuing education and worker training. Each \nprovision is designed with maximum flexibility to meet our States' \nunique needs. It is a bill that recognizes excellence, welcomes \ninnovation, and rewards ambition.\n  The Education Competitiveness Act has seven important components.\n  First, it recognizes that our Nation needs to continue to bring \nquality teachers into the classroom. The bill funds 100,000 \nscholarships for future teachers of languages, early education, and \nscience. It creates incentives for teachers to serve in rural and \nunderserved areas. And it rapidly expands funding to advanced placement \nand international baccalaureate programs.\n  Second, the bill recognizes that early education is widely considered \nto be one of the best education investments that money can buy. The \nbill creates a flexible program of matching grants to build a national \nsystem of universal, voluntary prekindergarten. The bill sets out \nbenchmarks for quality and provides help for States to make sure that \ntheir teachers are the best that they can be.\n  Third, the bill helps students to go the extra mile in their studies, \nby offering States the means to expand afterschool programs in \neverything from college test preparation to drug prevention. Summer \nprograms get students out of the classroom for hands-on experience in \nscience, technology, mathematics, and engineering.\n  Fourth, the bill looks to the needs of tomorrow's workforce. That \nworkforce will increasingly demand technical skills based in math, \nscience, and engineering. The bill provides a free college education to \nany student wishing to study science, technology, math, or engineering. \nIn return, the student must work 4 years in that field of study. The \nbill offers States matching grants to establish and expand specialty \nmath, science, and technology schools. And the bill makes young \npromising scientists eligible for cash grants to continue their \nresearch.\n  Fifth, the bill addresses the chronic neglect of our Nation's Indian \neducation. The bill fully funds Indian colleges and makes a real \ncommitment to the Johnson O'Malley program. The bill also increases the \nPell grant to $6,000. Eighty percent of Montana's students rely on \nfinancial aid, including Pell grants.\n  Sixth, the Education Competitiveness Act allows American workers to \ncontinue learning. The bill funds programs to link businesses and \nschools, to give workers the skills that they need. Where universities \nand community colleges are too far away, distance learning grants will \nhelp bridge that gap.\n  Finally, the bill's tax provisions grant greater access to education. \nThe bill starts by simplifying confusing tax credits and combining them \ninto a single refundable higher education credit of up to $2,000 per \nstudent. The bill eases the burden of loan repayment by permitting \ngraduates to deduct more of the interest paid on their student loans. \nAnd the bill increases the deductions for charitable contributions to \nschools as well as teachers' expenses in classrooms.\n  Taken together, these seven components form a bill that is both \ncomprehensive and responsible. It is a bill that would help to secure a \nmore competitive American economy.\n  I look forward to returning to the floor to describe each title in \ngreater detail. I also look forward to discussing these proposals with \nmy colleagues.\n  The Education Competitiveness Act sets out a bold agenda, to be sure. \nSome of its rewards may only be reaped decades from now. Some of its \nbenefits may only be realized by our grandchildren. But I firmly \nbelieve that this is an agenda that we must begin to implement today.\n  Like the journey of Lewis and Clark 200 years ago, this is an agenda \nthat portends discovery and rewards for America. It is an agenda that \npromises a passage to a new nation. I urge my colleagues to join me as \nwe advance to this future, and join me in sponsoring the Education \nCompetitiveness Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/14/senate-section/article/S9639-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 570--DESIGNATING THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER AS ``NATIONAL \n                 AMERICAN HISTORY AND HERITAGE MONTH''\n\n  Mr. DeWINE (for himself and Mr. Voinovich) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 570\n\n       Whereas the United States has a remarkable history and a \n     cherished legacy abounding with stories and biographies of \n     heroes and patriots;\n       Whereas time has proven that, by teaching the principles of \n     the foundation of the United States, the children of the \n     Nation grow up to become good citizens;\n       Whereas George Washington stated, ``A primary object . . . \n     should be the education of our youth in the science of \n     government'';\n       Whereas the children of the United States have the right \n     and the responsibility to know the history and heritage of \n     the Nation;\n       Whereas, in 1952, Olga Weber, a mother and homemaker from \n     the State of Ohio, out of concern that citizens of the United \n     States were taking their freedoms for granted, petitioned the \n     municipal officers of her town to establish a Constitution \n     day in honor of the ratification of the Constitution of the \n     United States, and further requested that the State of Ohio \n     designate September 17, 1952, as ``Constitution Day'';\n       Whereas, in 1953, Governor Frank J. Lausche of the State of \n     Ohio signed a law designating September 17, 1953, as \n     ``Constitution Day'';\n       Whereas, in August 1953, Mrs. Weber urged the Senate to \n     pass a resolution designating the period beginning September \n     17, 1953, and ending September 23, 1953, as ``Constitution \n     Week'';\n       Whereas, in 1955, President Dwight D.

Res. 571\n\n       Whereas from September 15, 2006, through October 15, 2006, \n     the United States celebrates Hispanic Heritage Month;\n       Whereas the presence of Hispanics in North America predates \n     the founding of the United States, and, as among the first to \n     settle in the New World, Hispanics and their descendants have \n     had a profound and lasting influence on the history, values, \n     and culture of the United States;\n       Whereas, since the arrival of the earliest Spanish settlers \n     more than 400 years ago, millions of Hispanic men and women \n     have come to the United States from Mexico, Puerto Rico, \n     Cuba, and other Caribbean regions, Central America, South \n     America, and Spain, in search of freedom, peace, and \n

``conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life \n     above and beyond the call of duty'';\n       Whereas 41 men of Hispanic origin have earned this \n     distinction, including 21 such

Mr. BURNS (for himself and Ms. Cantwell) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation:\n\n       Whereas over 205,000,000 Americans use the Internet in the \n     United States, including over 84,000,000 home-users through \n     broadband connections, to communicate with family and \n     friends, manage their finances, pay their bills, improve \n     their education, shop at home, and read about current events;\n       Whereas the approximately 26,000,000 small businesses in \n     the United States, who represent 99.7 percent of all United \n     States employers and employ 50 percent of the private work \n     force, increasingly rely on the Internet to manage their \n     businesses, expand

States have \n     Internet access, with approximately 93 percent of \n     instructional classrooms connected to the Internet;\n       Whereas having access to the Internet in the classroom \n     enhances the education of our children by providing access to \n     educational online content and encouraging responsible self-\n     initiative to discover research resources;\n       Whereas, according to the Pew Institute, almost 9 in 10 \n     teenagers between the ages of 12 and 17, or 87 percent of all \n     youth (approximately 21,000,000 people) use the Internet, and \n     78 percent (or about 16,000,000 students) say they use the \n     Internet at school;\n       Whereas teen use of the Internet at school has grown 45 \n     percent since 2000, and educating children of

terrorism and \n     other attacks;\n       Whereas Internet users and our information infrastructure \n     face an increasing threat of malicious attacks through \n     viruses, worms, Trojans, and unwanted programs such as \n     spyware, adware, hacking tools, and password stealers, that \n     are frequent and fast in propagation, are costly to repair, \n     and disable entire computer systems;\n       Whereas, according to Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, since \n     February 2005, over 90,000,000 records containing personally-\n     identifiable information have been breached, and the overall \n     increase in serious data breaches in both the private and \n     public sectors are threatening the security and well-being of \n     the citizens of the United States;\n       Whereas consumers face significant financial and personal \n     privacy losses due to identity theft and fraud, as reported \n     in over 686,000 consumer complaints in 2005 received by the \n     Consumer Sentinel database operated by the Federal Trade \n     Commission;\n       Whereas Internet-related complaints in 2005 accounted for \n     46 percent of all reported fraud complaints received by the \n     Federal Trade Commission;\n       Whereas the total amount of monetary losses for such \n     Internet-related complaints exceeded $680,000,000, with a \n     median loss of

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 571, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 571) recognizing Hispanic Heritage \n     Month and celebrating the vast contributions of Hispanic \n     Americans to the strength and culture of the United States.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the month-long \ncelebration beginning today honoring the heritage of Hispanic \nAmericans.\n  Every year, we set aside a month to pay special regard to the \ncontributions of Hispanic Americans.\n  The tradition began nearly 40 years ago, when Congress authorized \nPresident Lyndon Johnson to proclaim National Hispanic Heritage Week. \nTwo decades later, President Ronald Reagan expanded the celebration to \n4 weeks--today's National Hispanic Heritage Month.\n  While the celebration has begun only recently, Hispanics have always \ndefined America.\n  The history of Europeans in what is now the United States, in fact, \nbegins with the voyage of a Spanish explorer named Ponce de Leon who \nlanded on Florida's west coast in 1521.\n  Since then, Hispanic Americans have infuenced every aspect of our \nhistory and culture. Let me discuss just a few:\n  David Glasgow Farragut, a proud Tennessean of Spanish descent, proved \nthe North's most able naval commander during the Civil War. He becamd \nthe first admiral of the U.S. Navy.\n\n  Severo Ochoa, a Nobel Prize recipient, revolutionized modern medical \nscience when he discovered RNA, ribonucleic acid, one of the chemical \nbuilding blocks of life.\n  Celia Cruz, a singer, introduced salsa music to the United States \nthrough her recordings and performances.\n  Louis and Walter Alverez, both research scientists, originated the \nonce-controversial theory that asteroid impacts can explain the \nperiodic mass extinctions that have shaped the history of life on \nEarth.\n  Roberto Goizueta, Oscar Hijuelos, Benjamin Cardozo, Alberto Gonzalez, \nRita Hayworth, Roberto Clemente--entrepreneurs, artists, public \nservants, athletes, scientists, scholars--these names stand out, but \nmany others move America forward every day. We cannot name all of the \ncountless heroes who have fought in wars, treated the sick, taught our \nchildren, and devoted themselves to public service.\n  Through continuing migration to our shores, Hispanic Americans \ncontinue to strengthen American culture. Foods, music, and artistic \nforms considered unalterably ``foreign'' just a few short years ago \nhave now become firm parts of the American identity.\n  Today, as we begin a month-long celebration of Hispanic hereitage, I \njoin with all Americans in recognizing the invaluable role of Hispanic \nAmericans in shaping and enriching these United States.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today I wish to voice my support for \nthe Senate resolution designating September 16, 2006, through October \n16, 2006, as Hispanic Heritage Month. Hispanic Americans are our \nlargest ethnic minority, and I am a cosponsor of this resolution \nbecause I believe it is an appropriate way to recognize the \ncontributions made by our Hispanic American community.\n  Hispanics have migrated to the United States from all over the world. \nThey have added to our national security by serving valiantly in the \nU.S. Armed Forces; many have paid the ultimate price and sacrificed \ntheir lives for freedom.\n  In my home State of Texas, Hispanic women and men shaped our Republic \nin its early years, and to this day, subsequent generation of Texans \ncontinue to enjoy the liberty for which our Texan and American \nancestors fought so courageously.\n  Americans of Hispanic origin have contributed to the econmy with \ntheir notable work ethic and have served honorably at all levels of \ngovernment. Three of my Senate colleagues find their roots in Hispanic \norigins.\n  It is because of these contributions and their love of equality, \njustice, and independence that I am proud to support the distinguished \nmajority leader, Senator Frist, and my other Senate colleagues in \ndesignating September 16, 2006, through October 16, 2006, as Hispanic \nHeritage Month.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 571) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 571\n\n       Whereas from September 15, 2006, through October 15, 2006, \n     the United States celebrates Hispanic Heritage Month;\n       Whereas the presence of Hispanics in North America predates \n     the founding of the United States, and, as among the first to \n     settle in the New World, Hispanics and their descendants have \n     had a profound and lasting influence on the history, values, \n     and culture of the United States;\n       Whereas, since the arrival of the earliest Spanish settlers \n     more than 400 years ago, millions of Hispanic men and women \n     have come to the United States from Mexico, Puerto Rico, \n     Cuba, and other Caribbean regions, Central America, South \n     America, and Spain, in search of freedom, peace, and \n     opportunity;\n       Whereas Hispanic Americans have contributed throughout the \n     ages to the prosperity and culture of the United States;\n       Whereas the Bureau of the Census now lists Hispanic \n     Americans as the largest ethnic minority within the United \n     States;\n       Whereas Hispanic Americans serve in all branches of the \n     Armed Forces and have fought valiantly in every war in the \n     history of the United States;\n       Whereas the Medal of Honor is the highest United States \n     military distinction, awarded since the Civil War for \n     ``conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life \n     above and beyond the call of duty'';\n       Whereas 41 men of Hispanic origin have earned this \n     distinction, including 21 such men who sacrificed their \n     lives;\n       Whereas many Hispanic Americans who served in the Armed \n     Forces have continued their service to the United States;\n       Whereas many Hispanic Americans are dedicated public \n     servants, holding posts at the highest levels of government, \n     including 3 current seats in the United States Senate; and\n       Whereas Hispanic Americans have a deep commitment to faith, \n     family, and community, an enduring work ethic, and a \n     perseverance to succeed: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes September 15, 2006, through October 15, \n     2006, as Hispanic Heritage Month;\n       (2) celebrates the vast contributions of Hispanic Americans \n     to the strength and culture of the United States; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     Hispanic Heritage Month with appropriate programs and \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/14/senate-section/article/S9646-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9646-S9647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS CONSENT--H.R. 5684\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
