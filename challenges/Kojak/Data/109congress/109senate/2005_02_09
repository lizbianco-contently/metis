Mr. President, on the afternoon of February 1, 1960, in \nGreensboro, NC, four college freshmen from North Carolina A \nUniversity changed the course of history. In an act of remarkable \nbravery, the four teens strode into the downtown Woolworth and sat at \nthe ``whites only'' lunch counter. They ordered coffee, soda, and \ndonuts, and as they expected, the store refused to serve them.\n  The young men waited in their seats until closing time. They didn't \nknow at the time whether they would be beaten, whether they would be \ndragged out, whether they would be arrested. But they did know right \nfrom wrong and that segregation was an intolerable injustice.\n  The next day the four returned with two classmates. Again, the same \norder. They attempted to place an order for lunch. Again, the store \nrefused.\n  Each day more and more students joined the Greensboro Four, including \nwhite students from nearby colleges. By the end of the week nearly all \nof those more than 60, 65 seats at the lunch counter were filled. \nEventually hundreds of sympathizers filled Greensboro's downtown \nstreets.\n  Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. was already leading protests in other \nparts of the South against segregation in schools and on buses, but \nchallenging the segregationist practices of privately owned business \nwas something that was brand new. These four young men had opened a new \nfront on the battle for civil rights.\n  In the next weeks and months the sit-ins spread to department stores, \nto clothing shops, to restaurants. In my own hometown of Nashville, and \nRaleigh and Charlotte and Atlanta and dozens of other cities throughout \nthe South, thousands and thousands of students and civil rights \nadvocates staged sit-ins at businesses that had discriminated. Many of \nthe participants suffered arrest and heckling and violence, but these \nbrave citizens were determined to end the scourge of segregation.\n  By April of that year, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee,\n\n[[Page S1150]]\n\nor SNCC, was formed. The legendary organization led sit-ins around the \ncountry. Then, on July 25, 1960, Woolworth desegregated its lunch \ncounters. By August of 1961, over 70,000 Americans had taken part in \nthe sit-ins. Three thousand were arrested in the act.\n  Finally, in 1964, President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act which \noutlawed forever segregation in public accommodations. A section of the \nWoolworth lunch counter can be seen not too far from here, at the \nSmithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. The counter and four stools \nand a sign advertising 29-cent banana splits sits in a place of honor \non the first floor of the National Museum of American History.\n  As we celebrate African-American history this month, we reflect on \nthese events and so many other events, large and small, that have \nshaped our country. From slavery to segregation, we remember that \nAmerica did not always live up to its ideals. In fact, we often fell \nfar short of them. But we also learned that fundamental to our national \ncharacter is the drive to live out the true meaning of our creed.\n  In the 108th Congress we passed the African American Museum of \nHistory and Culture Act to establish a national repository for this \ngreat history. The new museum will house priceless artifacts, \ndocuments, and recordings. It will bring to life the vibrant cultural \ncontributions African Americans have made to every facet of American \nlife. Visitors from around the world will learn about 400 years of \nstruggle and of progress. They will learn that the Capital itself owes \nits completion to America's first black man of science, Benjamin \nBannaker, who reconstructed the city's layout from memory after Pierre \nL'Enfant quit the project.\n\n  The new museum's council, which includes many of America's most \nprominent men and women in business, entertainment, and academia, will \nmeet early this year to begin the hard work of selecting a site for the \nmuseum, hiring a director, building a collection, and raising funds. \nFrom blood banking to the modern subway, from jazz to social justice, \nthe contributions of African Americans have shaped and molded and \ninfluenced our national culture and our national character.\n  The African-American experience is one of the most important threads \nin the American tapestry. The National Museum of African American \nHistory and Culture promises to become one of our Nation's most \nprominent cultural landmarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/09/senate-section/article/S1150-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, for the past 2 days the Senate has been \ndebating the so-called Class Action Fairness Act of 2005. I want to \nspend a few minutes today talking about this bill.\n  Despite its title, the bill is not about fairness at all, in my \nopinion. It is about depriving consumers of access to the courts and \nletting corporate wrongdoers off the hook.\n  People ask, what are these cases all about? These cases are about \nthings dealing with fairness. Class actions fall in a number of \ndifferent categories: environmental pollution, insurance practices, \nwage-and-hour employment disputes, consumer fraud, dangerous drugs, \nproducts that kill, and consumer protection. In those categories we \nhave had, in recent years, some very successful pieces of litigation \nthat have made our society a better place. However if this bill had \nbeen law, those cases would have been removed to federal court where \nthey would have likely been dismissed. It is important for states to \ncontinue to have the opportunity to protect their own citizens in their \nown courts.\n  For example, there was a case in New Hampshire dealing with \nenvironmental pollution brought by the State of New Hampshire against \n22 oil and chemical companies responsible for polluting the State's \nwaterways with methyl tertiary butyl ether. We refer to that as MTBE. \nThese companies were accused of violating state consumer protection and \nstate environmental laws. They were negligent. They produced a \ndefective product and created a public nuisance. In this case, New \nHampshire is seeking compensation for the cost of the cleanup as well \nas penalties, both monetary and punitive in nature. Under this bill, \nbecause the named defendant is a citizen of another state, the State of \nNew Hampshire would have to have their case heard in federal court \ninstead of their own state court.\n  In Louisiana there was a pesticide there that had decimated the \ncrawfish population. At one time, they were bringing in about 41 \nmillion pounds of crawfish. After this chemical was put into the \nwaterways, that dropped to about 16 million pounds. Crawfish farmers \nwere going broke. The plaintiffs were all from Louisiana and the harm \noccurred there. They filed a class action in state court, and a \nLouisiana state court judge recently granted final approval on a \nsettlement agreement. This case is a clear example of a state court \nhaving the opportunity to interpret its own state law, yet if S. 5 were \nalready enacted, it would have had to be removed to federal court.\n  There was a chemical plant leak that occurred in Richmond, California \nthat caused a dangerous cloud to form over the town. Over 24,000 people \nsought medical treatment in the days immediately following the leak. \nThe residents sued as a class, and the chemical company had to settle. \nWhile only California residents were harmed in California, under S. 5 \nthis case would have been removed to federal court because the \ndefendant is based in New Jersey.\n  Insurance practices: In one case, a Missouri state judge gave \npreliminary approval to a settlement agreement in a class action \nbrought by Missouri plaintiffs, where a pharmacist diluted \nprescriptions for thousands of patients, including chemotherapy \npatients. Because the defendant is based in Iowa, although they sell \npolicies in Missouri, the case could be removable to federal court \nunder this bill.\n  Equitable Life Insurance was accused of misleading and cheating \ncustomers. This was a situation of the so-called vanishing premium \ncases in the 1980s. They sold policies when interest rates were high. \nThey told customers as soon as the interest rates went down their \npremiums would be lower. That was not true. Class action lawsuits were \nfiled in Pennsylvania and Arizona state courts, and Equitable settled \nthe suits for $20 million helping over 130,000 people. However, because \nthe insurance company was based in another state, under this \nlegislation, the case would have been removed to federal court and \nthese people harmed between 1984-1996 would still be waiting for \njustice.\n\n  Wage-and-hour employment disputes: In California, Wal-Mart employees \nhave been denied pay for actual time worked. A California state judge \ncertified a class action brought by California plaintiffs. The harm \noccurred in California, nonetheless, under the proposed legislation the \ncase would be removed to federal court.\n  Consumer fraud: Roto-Rooter overcharged approximately two million \ncustomers $10 each by adding charges to invoices violating state \nconsumer protection laws. A class action was brought in Ohio where many \nof the class members live and where Roto-Rooter is based. Under S. 5, \nthe case could be removed to federal court.\n  AOL, a Virginia based company, charged the credit card of their \ncustomers for services even after those customers had canceled their \nAOL subscriptions. The lead plaintiff in a class action case was a \nCalifornia citizen. AOL wanted to litigate the case in federal court \nunder Virginia law. The California Court of Appeals held that the \nproper venue was in state court because Virginia law did not allow \nconsumer class actions and the available remedies were more limited \nthan under California law. This would undermine\n\n[[Page S1151]]\n\nCalifornia's strong consumer protection laws. Under this bill we are \nconsidering, California would be powerless to protect their own public \npolicy. What's fair about that?\n  In Florida a person sold funeral plots that didn't exist and \ndesecrated some of the graves that were there. The issues raised in \nthis case are state issues and the coffins desecrated were only those \nin Florida, yet under S. 5 the case would be removed to federal court \nbecause the parent company of the funeral home is based in another \nstate.\n  Products that kill: Lead paint has poisoned thousands of children \nsince 1993. Ford sold police cruisers that are prone to fire. This bill \nwould seek to remove these cases to our already overburdened federal \ncourts where they would experience extreme delays and possible \ndismissal.\n  Consumer protection: Cases against Monsanto, Jack-in-the-Box, and \nNestle would all be removed to federal court possibly denying the \nmembers in the class the protection of their own state laws.\n  I believe it has been good for our country to have these lawsuits \nbecause if you didn't have these lawsuits and you had the law that is \nnow sought in this legislation, these cases, most of them, wouldn't \nhave been brought.\n  I am not saying there is no room to improve the rules governing class \naction lawsuits. There is. There are abuses. Coupon settlement cases, I \nbelieve, are not good. Consumers get no meaningful relief, and the \nlawyers get everything. That isn't fair. If this bill simply addressed \nthe coupon problem, all 100 Senators would vote for it. But this \npending proposal goes much further. It effectively closes the \ncourthouse doors to a wide range of injured plaintiffs. I have \nmentioned some of them. At the same time, the bill turns federalism on \nits head. It denies State courts the opportunity to hear State law \nclaims brought by residents of that State.\n  My friends on the majority side, the Republicans, say they favor \nStates rights. They should be embarrassed to support this bill, which \nis one of the most profound assaults on States rights to come before \nCongress in many years. Most disturbingly, this bill limits corporate \naccountability at a time when corporate scandals have proliferated.\n  As we began debate on this bill, the majority leader and I received a \nletter signed by attorneys general of New York, Oklahoma, California, \nIllinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland, Minnesota, \nNew Mexico, Oregon, Vermont, and West Virginia. These attorneys general \nwhose sworn duty is to protect the public and enforce State laws oppose \nthe bill now before the Senate. They say that despite improvements \nsince the bill was first introduced a number of years ago, that:\n\n       S. 5 still unduly limits the rights of individuals to seek \n     redress for corporate wrongdoing in their State courts. We \n     therefore strongly recommend that this legislation not be \n     enacted in its present form.\n\n  They warn us further:\n\n       S. 5 would effect a sweeping reordering of our Nation's \n     system of justice that will disenfranchise individual \n     citizens from obtaining redress for harm, and thereby impede \n     efforts against egregious corporate wrongdoing.\n\n  This bill would ``reorder'' our justice system, as the attorneys \ngeneral have warned us.\n  Several amendments we are going to offer are important.\n  First, S. 5 will allow corporate defendants to remove many multi-\nstate class actions from State court to Federal court. But under \ncurrent law and practice, the Federal courts can refuse to certify \nthese cases as class actions on the ground that there are too many \nState laws involved. Prior to the passage of S. 5, the Federal courts' \nfailure to certify would allow consumers to re-file their cases in \nState court, but this bill would preclude plaintiffs turned away in \nFederal court from going back to State court. If this problem isn't \ncorrected, consumers will have lost their only means of redress when \nthey have been cheated by a corporation in a matter too small to file \nan individual case. Plaintiffs in cases like the Roto-Rooter example \nwould have no remedy, and the corporation could continue to take \nadvantage of them.\n  Senator Bingaman will offer an amendment. It is my understanding that \nhe and Senator Feinstein are working on a compromise. Senator Feinstein \nhas been an early supporter of S. 5. She understands that this is a \nproblem. I am confident she will work with Senator Bingaman to come up \nwith some way to resolve this important issue.\n  Second, the bill will literally make a Federal case out of what has \nalways been State personal injury cases. Sometimes such cases are \nconsolidated by State courts for efficiency. They are not ``class \nactions'' at all. But the pending bill would include them under a newly \ninvented term, ``mass actions,'' and allow them to be removed to \nFederal court.\n  For example, when a large number of people are injured by the same \ndangerous pharmaceutical drug, their claims may be consolidated by \nState court rules. Now those consolidated individual claims would be \nremoved to Federal court where they will be subject to extensive delays \nor even dismissal if the laws of more than one State are involved. \nThese mass torts often involve hundreds of plaintiffs who have been \nphysically injured by drugs, medical devices, tobacco, lead paint, or \nground water contamination.\n\n  S. 5 should be required to have a big label on it: ``Warning: This \nlegislation may be dangerous to the health of all Americans''--\nespecially healthy American consumers.\n  Senator Durbin has already offered an amendment to deal with this \n``mass torts'' issue. I hope that the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Specter, will work with him to see if this matter can be \nresolved.\n  These two things I have mentioned--the Bingaman amendment and the \nDurbin amendment--are issues of basic fairness.\n  Third, the bill would apply to civil rights and wage-and-hour cases \nthat have nothing to do with the coupon settlements the bill sponsors \nsay they want to address. These cases would now be subject to the same \ndelay and potential dismissal as the personal injury cases I just \ndiscussed.\n  Class actions are particularly important for low wage workers. There \nare now dozens of class action suits in State courts representing tens \nof thousands of low wage workers who have been forced to work extra \nhours without pay or who have been denied their wages for other \nreasons. Also, many States provide greater civil rights protections \nthan are available under Federal law. Senator Kennedy will offer an \namendment to carve out these cases from this bill. That is fair.\n  Fourth, as drafted, this bill even applies to cases brought by State \nattorneys general enforcing State laws on behalf of State consumers. \nFederalism has certainly taken a tumble around here when State courts \nare not permitted to hear cases brought by their own attorneys general \nto enforce State consumer fraud laws, environmental protection laws, \nand other vital State interests.\n  Separate from the letter I described earlier from Attorney General \nSpitzer and others, we have received a letter from the National \nAssociation of State Attorneys, the organization representing all 50 \nstatewide prosecutors, Republicans and Democrats. Forty-six of them \nhave signed it. They uniformly urge that the bill be clarified to \ninclude consumer class actions brought by State attorneys general. That \nis fair. Senator Pryor, one of several former attorneys general we have \nserving in this body, will offer an amendment to achieve this goal.\n  This bill is imbalanced in that it establishes a 60-day deadline for \nFederal appellate courts to decide appeals of a district court's \ndecision to remand a class action lawsuit, but it lacks a parallel \nmechanism to ensure speedy consideration of the motion to remand in the \ndistrict court. Senator Feingold will offer an amendment to correct \nthis imbalance. If 60 days is not a good deadline, they can come up \nwith another one. But unless the Feingold amendment is agreed to, these \npeople can bring a case to court which will lay there forever.\n  None of these amendments we offer are killer amendments. All are \nmodest improvements that would strengthen corporate accountability and \nensure that vulnerable citizens get their day in court. I urge my \ncolleagues to accept these amendments.\n  These amendments I have talked about to the underlying bill will be\n\n[[Page S1152]]\n\nhelpful. However, even with these amendments, the underlying bill will \nstill be a bad bill, but it would be better. They would certainly \nimprove the bill.\n  There was a tremendously powerful article in Business Week last week \nentitled, ``A Phony Cure: Shifting class actions to federal courts is \nno reform.'' No one can say it is some liberal rag of the Democratic \nParty. In this article, even Chief Justice Rehnquist criticizes this \nlegislation. The article emphasizes that Federal judges hate this \nlegislation and it is more of a step towards chaos than reform. \nJustice Rehnquist says: Don't do this to us. Federal judges are too \nbusy. Federal courts are already overburdened and it will make the case \nbacklogs even longer. In addition to that, instead of helping Federal \ncourts, the article states that it will cut back on those resources to \nour Federal court system, and it is going to leave these Federal judges \nin a real bind.\n\n  This month is Black History month, and this legislation brings to \nmind for many of us Brown vs. Board of Education. The distinguished \nmajority leader, Senator Frist, talked today about the first sit-ins by \nthese courageous young men and women in the South which brought about a \nnumber of things. But one reason that the Brown vs. Board of Education \ncase was able to move forward was because it was a class action. It was \na culmination of appeals from four class action cases--three from the \nFederal court decisions in Kansas, South Carolina, and Virginia, and \none by the decision of the Supreme Court of Delaware. Only the state \ncourt, the Supreme Court of Delaware, made the correct decision by \nruling in favor of the African-American plaintiffs. The State court \nheld that the segregated schools in Delaware violated the 14th \namendment, Delaware rejected separate and unequal schools.\n  Another example is a case brought last June. The U.S. Supreme Court \ndecided to allow a state class action lawsuit against Daimler Chrysler \nto continue in Oklahoma. That was an important case because it affects \nup to 1 million owners of minivans that have front passenger seat air \nbags that deploy in low speed accidents, very low speeds, with \ntremendous force, potentially killing children and hurting small adult \npassengers. Oklahoma's Supreme Court ruled that the case could go \nforward in state court for this defect. A federal court, relying on the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, would probably find the case \nunmanageable.\n  These cases I have mentioned should be allowed to proceed. This \nlegislation would not allow that. That is too bad.\n  This legislation, especially if we don't get these amendments passed, \nis disrespectful to States rights and will result in many instances of \ninjustice. I am going to vote against this bill. I hope my colleagues \nwill do the same. But I certainly hope my colleagues will do something \nto improve this bad bill. We need to be alarmed at what it is doing to \nStates rights. I am going to vote against this bill, but I hope people \nwill work with us.\n  I apologize to my colleague for taking away from his morning business \ntime.

Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate got the eye-popping \nnews that prescription drug benefits will cost far more than anyone had \never anticipated. In fact, the early appraisal was that it would cost \n$400 billion, and then it shot up to over $500 billion. Yesterday, we \nlearned that it would cost $720 billion over the next decade, and \nperhaps would even go to $1 trillion. A lot of us in the Senate, \nfrankly, were not too surprised because the legislation doesn't allow \nfor the use of cost containment strategies that are utilized in the \nprivate sector.\n  To me, it is incomprehensible, for example, that Medicare, with all \nof its bargaining power, wouldn't use the same kind of clout that a \ntimber company does in Alaska or Oregon or an auto company in the \nMidwest or any other big purchaser. Under this law as it is constituted \ntoday, what Medicare does is the equivalent of standing in the price \nclub and buying toilet paper one roll at a time. There is absolutely \nnobody in the United States who goes out and purchases that way. What \nMedicare is going to be doing just defies common sense because we all \nknow that if you buy more of something, whether in Oregon or in Alaska \nor anywhere else, you say, Let us try to negotiate a better deal. But \nMedicare is not allowed to do that under current circumstances.\n  I have come today to say that in addition to the debate about how the \nnumbers are crunched, what we ought to be doing is working on a \nbipartisan basis to ensure that we have real cost containment in this \nprogram that seems to grow in costs almost by the day. I have worked \nwith Senator Snowe for more than 3 years on legislation to do that. We \nhave introduced it. It has bipartisan support.\n  On our side of the aisle, Senator Feinstein and Senator Feingold were \noriginal sponsors. Senator McCain joined Senator Snowe and me in this \nbipartisan effort. We simply believe that at a time when we are seeing \nso many Government programs cut and reduced and tremendous financial \npressures for belt tightening, we shouldn't leave seniors without even \nthe kind of private sector bargaining, the kind of private sector cost \ncontainment power that we see in communities all across the country.\n  I will tell you, I can't for the life of me figure out why Medicare \nshouldn't have the power to be a smart shopper. As it stands today, \neverybody in the United States tries to be a smart shopper instead of \nMedicare.\n  What I would like to do for a couple of moments is try to lay out the \nlegislation that Senator Snowe and I have spent so much time working on \nand why I think it is particularly critical right now.\n  For a senior who lives in rural America where there may be only one \nprivate plan serving that area--and maybe there is no private plan at \nall--that senior is likely to be part of what is called the fallback \nplan. As of now, all of those seniors in those small communities, many \nof them in Arkansas--I see our distinguished colleague has joined us; \nlike me, she vetted for the law. We would like to see people in \nArkansas and Oregon, in areas with large, rural populations, have some \nbargaining power the way smart shoppers would. Under the Snowe-Wyden \nlegislation, we say that the seniors in those fallback plans could in \neffect be part of a group that could use private sector bargaining \npower in order to hold costs down.\n  Many of us also represent the larger cities. I have Portland, but we \nwant to hold down costs in Miami, New York, and Chicago. These people \nmight have a choice of larger health programs to try to deal with their \nbenefits. Maybe they are in a managed care organization or what is \ncalled a PPO, preferred provider organization. However, these private \nentities ought to have some bargaining power to hold down the cost for \nall of their members. Our bipartisan legislation that I have with \nSenator Snowe and Senator McCain stipulates we can have bargaining \npower for seniors in those metropolitan areas as well.\n\n  This legislation is going to save taxpayers money as well, not just \nseniors but taxpayers because, as the Senate knows, we put out a \nsubstantial amount of money to offer assistance to employers to not \ndrop their coverage. When the Medicare plans save seniors money on \nmedicine, that means less cost for the retiree plan to make up. \nContaining costs on the Medicare side, in our view, will help keep \ncosts down for employers insuring retirees as well.\n  We have an opportunity to get beyond the debate about the numbers \nthat came out in the last day or so, these shocking numbers that \nMedicare prescription drug care will cost $720 billion. We can get \nbeyond those numbers and go to a comprehensive, bipartisan, market-\nbased cost-containment strategy, a bipartisan plan that will contain \ncosts for rural and urban seniors in plans across the country, in plans \nin rural and urban areas, and a plan that will also provide cost \ncontainment for employers insuring retirees as well.\n  It is our view we desperately need some common sense as it relates to \ncost containment for prescription drugs in our country. It is my view \nthat giving bargaining power to millions of seniors through the private\n\n[[Page S1153]]\n\nsector is essentially Economics 101. There is no sense waiting when the \ncosts of this program go up almost daily. It started at $400 billion, \nthen $500 billion, now we are at $720 billion, and we are still \ncounting. With these costs continuing to go through the stratosphere, \nthe choice for the Senate, in my view, is to either sit around and say \nwe will just wait and see what happens--and maybe the next report will \nput this at $1 trillion--or we can take the opportunity in a \nthoughtful, bipartisan way to do what is being done in communities all \nacross the country.\n  Virtually everyone who buys in quantity says: Excuse me, wouldn't you \nbe willing to give me a break given the fact I am making additional \npurchases? Medicare is not doing it. It defies common sense. We have a \nbipartisan opportunity to reign in these costs that continue to soar.

Mr. President, today I rise to express my extreme \ndisappointment in President Bush's agriculture budget proposal as well \nas his budget proposal for all of rural America. We worked very hard in \nthis body, and in conjunction with the other body, to come up with a \ngood farm bill.\n  Three years ago, President Bush signed that farm bill. It took us a \nwhile to get him there, but he finally signed it. As a member of the \nAgriculture Committee and a farmer's daughter, I was proud of the job \nwe had done on behalf of the many hard-working farming interests in \nthis great country.\n  I can remember growing up on our farm in Arkansas and how my father \nhad great trepidation over whether he would be able to be successful \nwith the kind of crop he had worked so hard to produce, because he knew \nso many variables were completely out of his control, whether it was \ndrought, whether it was flooding, whether it was world market prices. \nEverything out of his control had such a great bearing on whether he \ncould be successful.\n  I was especially proud of the agreement we made with the Arkansas \nfarmers to support them because of those things they are faced with \nthat are out of their control. It was an agreement we made with the \nfarmers, their families, and their communities.\n  The 2002 farm bill was a great deal for farmers and consumers, for \nall of America. However, not everyone agrees. This past weekend, the \nNew York Times ran an op-ed outlining proposals to undercut the 2002 \nfarm bill by cutting aid to our farmers in this Nation. It seems that \nthe President has been taking his agricultural advice from the New York \nTimes because, lo and behold, on Monday morning he sent a budget over \nto Congress that mirrors the piece in the New York Times.\n  I would like to suggest first and foremost that he turn to a more \nreliable source to get his advice on agricultural policy. Because, for \nthe life of me, I still cannot figure out what it is that they grow or \noversee growing, looking down out of those skyscrapers in New York \nCity, that would merit them providing that kind of advice to the \nPresident of the United States over the hard-working men and women who \nproduce the food and fiber not just for this country but for the people \nof this globe.\n  If the President would like, I will be happy to offer him some advice \non agricultural policy. I certainly hear from his administration \nofficials and friends here in Congress who are not shy about sharing \nwith me their opinions on issues such as tax reform and trade policy \nand Social Security. Well, agricultural policy is important to this \nNation as well. If the President does not want my opinion, then I \nsuggest he sit down with some real farmers from my home State of \nArkansas or other farming States across the Nation and get their \nopinions.\n  When we were debating the 2002 farm bill, there was a lot of \nmisinformation about farmers and farming that was floating around us \nall. I, for one, am determined to ensure that those perceptions are \nchallenged. Most importantly, I want to ensure that the uninformed \njudgments about farmers are never used in setting our agricultural \npolicy in this country.\n\n  Let's look at a few of the things that critics of farming said would \nhappen if we were to enact the 2002 farm bill.\n  First, they said it would bust the budget. I heard my colleagues on \nthe other side down here earlier this week describing how in the first \n2 years the farm bill has come in more than $15 billion cheaper than \nwas expected or projected.\n  Second, folks said it would lead to overproduction. They were wrong \nagain. According to USDA, production remains steady.\n  Third, those naysayers said it would interfere with trade. Last year, \nour exports were at an all-time record high. In fact, the only people I \nknow who believe our farm policy interferes with trade is our trade \ncompetition from other countries, the same people who sit across from \nus and from our negotiators during trade talks and ask us to take away \nour support for our farmers while they hang on to the very support they \nprovide their agricultural producers. Does it sound like a good deal? \nYou bet it does--to our competitors. We fight long and hard to make \nsure there is a fair playing field for our agricultural producers in \nthis country, and they deserve it.\n  Finally, the critics made clear what they thought about farmers. They \nsaid that farming is no longer a matter of importance to the American \neconomy. I say to the Presiding Officer, farming is important to the \neconomy of your great State of Louisiana and many others. I want this \nbody to think about that for a few minutes. I want those critics to \ntake a trip to the South and to the Midwest. I want them to take a trip \nto my home State of Arkansas where one in every five jobs is tied to \nagriculture. Better yet, I want them to think about agriculture's \ncontribution to our Nation's security and well-being.\n  So the critics are all wrong about farm policy, and they are \ncertainly wrong about farmers, the hard-working families that produce \nfood and fiber so each of us can lead that healthy life. They are also \nwrong to think that farm policy does not affect Main Street USA.\n  To doubters, I point out the 1980s and the farm financial crisis that \nexisted then. During that time, we saw entire communities and towns dry \nup and blow away.\n  Now I would like to mention how our farm support compares to the rest \nof the world, how critical it is that we maintain those producers we \nhave. We give our farmers $40 per acre in aid, while Europeans enjoy a \n$400 per-acre subsidy. Apparently, the President wants French farmers \nto have a competitive edge over our American producers. It seems to me \nwe should be asking them to bring their support down before we \nunilaterally reduce ours.\n  At the end of the day, we need to take the recommendations of \nexperts. We spend money, time and time again, to come up with these \ncommissions, to come up with these reports. We need to take a look at \nthem, the recommendations of experts we commission to look at the farm \nbill. This panel of experts made a clear recommendation that we should \nnot change the 2002 farm bill until it is time to deal with that in \n2007.\n  Time and again, we see the critics misuse facts and figures to make \ntheir case in an attempt to villainize farmers and drive public opinion \nagainst them. For the sake of time this morning, I will spare my \ncolleagues from refuting point by point the numerous inaccuracies in \nthe stories President Bush is reading about huge farms getting massive \npayments.\n\n  I tend to get a little passionate about this issue. Maybe it is \nbecause I am a farmer's daughter. Maybe it is because I believe in the \nfarm families of this country. Maybe it is because I still go home and \nremember what it is like in those rural communities.\n  But if you listened to the critics, you would believe that Long \nFarms--which is a great example--in Blytheville, AR, was about to be \npublicly traded on the\n\n[[Page S1154]]\n\nNew York Stock Exchange. Clark Long and his two sons are probably \nwondering how they missed out on all the benefits of these huge \nagribusinesses that are talked about in these stories.\n  The fact is, we have payment limitations in our farm policy already. \nWe accepted them as a part of the compromise we struck in the 2002 farm \nbill, a bill that was debated for 2 years and should be viewed as a \ncontract between the Federal Government and the hard-working farm \nfamilies of this country, their lenders, and others they do business \nwith all the way up and down Main Street, the entire communities that \ndepend on these hard-working farm families that produce the food and \nfiber for this world.\n  The bottom line is, changing payment limitations midway through the \ndeal has the real potential to put Arkansas farm families and other \nfarm families across the South and in other places in a terrible spot.\n  In closing, despite the President's willingness to listen to the \ncritics on the New York Times editorial board and break his contract \nwith America's farmers, I still believe in farmers and farming \ncommunities. I still believe in those people who get up at 4:30 every \nmorning to go out and work that farm, to make sure I and the rest of \nAmerica can enjoy the safest, most abundant and affordable food supply \nin the world.\n  Per capita, we pay less for our food than anybody else out there. Is \nthat not worth something to us in this Nation, to recognize the \ndiversity across our great land, and understand that those who farm in \ndifferent regions of the country and farm different crops have to use \ndifferent economies of scale in order to compete in a global \nmarketplace?\n  I want the farming communities in Arkansas to know exactly where my \nloyalty lies. It lies with them. I will stick with the rock-solid \nvalues and hard work of those farm families across Arkansas and other \nareas of our Nation. And I will never forget it, even after I am \nreelected. I encourage the President to relook at what he has done to \nthe viability of many of these farm families across the Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to take a moment to talk about \nSocial Security and the challenges that face this Congress in order to \nsave Social Security for future generations.\n  When Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into \nlaw, the United States of America was a very different place than it is \nnow. By looking at this chart, which shows an example of a family in \n1935 and an example of a family in the year 2005, you can see that a \nlot has changed.\n  Now, I ask my colleagues to keep this picture in mind, taken 70 years \nago, as we go through the debate on how to save Social Security.\n  A lot has changed since 1935. Social Security was a great deal for \nthe Government in 1935. Workers would pay the Government a portion of \nevery paycheck. The Government would keep these funds and could use \nthem to pay other Government liabilities. It was unlikely that many of \nthe beneficiaries would reach retirement age.\n  From the employees' standpoint, in 1935, Social Security was a big \ngamble. Employees would be required to participate in the program, \ncontributing a percentage of their income for their entire adult \nworking life. This program would be a retirement safety net, but would \nonly yield a small percentage rate of return.\n  The employee could not access it or use it for any other reason. If \nthey happened to die prior to receiving the benefits, their family \ncould not inherit the account. And even if they were diagnosed with an \nexpensive terminal illness, they could not draw on the Social Security \naccount to cover the costs.\n  Times have changed in ways far beyond the hair style, the fashion, \nand the entertainment that is reflected on this chart. Demographics \nhave radically shifted, necessitating that we update and modernize the \nsystem to save Social Security for the 21st century.\n  Life expectancy has changed dramatically over the past 70 years. In \n1935 the average person lived to be 63 versus 77 years of age in 2004. \nThis difference becomes even more dramatic when we look at the \ndifferences between men as compared to women. Looking through the \nSocial Security lens in 1935, this was excellent for the system's \nfinancial stability. Men paid into the system but because of life \nexpectancy generally did not live long enough to receive benefits. \nWhile women generally lived longer than men, in 1935 the few women who \ndid participate in the workforce still did not generally receive many \nbenefits based on life expectancy.\n  As this next chart shows, an American who turns 65 can expect to live \nlonger now than they did in the past.\n  Instead of living an additional decade, seniors can now expect to \nlive about 17 more years. In 2040, when Social Security is nearly \nbankrupt, senior citizens can expect to live even more additional \nyears. For example, a woman who turns 65 in that year is expected to \nlive another 21 years. Without permanent reform, this woman will not be \nable to depend on Social Security for her retirement. We need to update \nand modernize the system to save Social Security so she can have that \nsecurity for the remaining years of her life.\n  This chart further shows how elderly Americans are rapidly becoming a \nlarger percentage of the country. As Americans are living longer, they \nare increasing in number and rapidly becoming a larger percentage of \nthe population. For example, in 1950, less than 10 percent of Americans \nwere age 65 and older. Within a decade, seniors will make up 15 percent \nof the population, and in 25 years, seniors will comprise more than 20 \npercent of the population. We can expect that percentage to continue to \ngrow.\n  In 1935, when the Social Security system was created, the Government \ndid not need to prepare for the possibility of a depleted system. \nSeniors made up a very small percentage of the population because most \npeople who were owed benefits simply never reached retirement age. As \nseniors become a larger portion of our population, we need to update \nand modernize the system to save Social Security for the 21st century.\n  Workforce distribution, as you can imagine, has also changed \ndramatically over the past 70 years. One of the more remarkable \ncharacteristics in the past century was the increase of women in the \nworkplace. In 1935, approximately 24 percent of women worked outside \nthe home and generally in a very limited number of professions, such as \nnursing and teaching or domestic service. Today, slightly less than 60 \npercent of women work outside the home in a variety of professions. \nWomen make up 46.5 percent of the workforce today versus approximately \n23 percent in 1935.\n  In 1935, when women did not usually work outside the home, they also \ndid not pay into the Social Security system as men did. Even though \nthere are now more people paying into the system as they retire, there \nwill be a greater number of people drawing on the system a longer \nperiod of time.\n  As it was structured in 1935, the Social Security system was not \ndesigned to support elderly people for a long retirement such as we \nenjoy today. As female workforce participants continue to retire and \ndraw benefits, we need to update and modernize the system in order to \nsave Social Security for the 21st century.\n  As we all know, Social Security is a pay-as-you-go system, meaning \ncurrent retiree benefits are paid with existing employee payroll taxes. \nAs times change, the payroll tax rate has been increased a number of \ntimes in an effort to keep up with the demographic changes. Referring \nto this next chart, you can see that payroll taxes have increased \ndramatically over the past 70 years. They were a lot less when the \nSocial Security system was enacted. Workers were taxed only 2 percent, \nand that was only on the first $3,000 of their income; whereas today \nworkers are taxed 12.4 percent, and on the first $90,000 of income for \nSocial Security. Americans pay a significant amount of their money \ntoward Social Security. This amount is still not enough to compensate \nfor an aging population\n\n[[Page S1155]]\n\nthat may spend more than 15 or 20 years in retirement drawing benefits \nfrom a system that was never designed to support them for that length \nof time.\n  Unless we plan to continue the payroll tax hikes of the past, which \nis not a prospect I would support, we need to update and modernize the \nsystem to save Social Security for the 21st century.\n  As I mentioned, Social Security is a pay-as-you-go system, with \ncurrent workers paying taxes to support current benefits for retirees. \nThis means there must be enough workers paying taxes to provide for \nretirees. The ratio of workers to retirees has been steadily declining, \nand this is possibly the most telling comparison showing the need for \nreform.\n  As this next chart shows, in 1945, there were 42 workers paying taxes \nfor every single person receiving benefits. In 2005, 3.3 workers pay \nfor each beneficiary, and soon there will be two workers paying for \nevery single person receiving benefits.\n  As the baby boomers retire, the workforce cannot support the aging \npopulation. Since we have such a large number of retired citizens, the \nSocial Security system will be depleted in the not so distant future. \nWe need to update and modernize the system to save Social Security for \nthe 21st century.\n  Realities have changed in many different ways since Social Security \nwas created in 1935. People live longer. Seniors make up a larger \npercentage of the population. Women make up more of the workforce, and \nthe worker-to-beneficiary ratio is falling. Unless Congress faces up to \nthese realities, the long-term outlook for Social Security is very \nbleak.\n  In conclusion, let me point to my last chart, which shows that in \n2018, Social Security costs will permanently exceed revenues, as the \nlines cross at this point. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwould like us to believe that doing nothing is the best course of \naction. I happen to believe differently. I stress to my colleagues that \nthe cost of doing nothing is a serious detriment to the Social Security \nsystem for future generations. Time is running out. This problem will \nnot go away. This Congress, this year, we must update and modernize the \nsystem to save Social Security for the 21st century.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss Social Security and to \nsay how honored I am to serve along with the President, who has shown \nhis willingness to confront very difficult issues to help build a \nbetter future for America.\n  President Bush has clearly laid out that we have a challenge with our \nSocial Security system, but he has also made it clear that he believes \nSocial Security is a promise we must keep. Social Security was started \nto make sure that no American retiree, no senior citizen lived in \npoverty. It has been successful in accomplishing that. This is a \npromise we need to make sure is part of any changes in Social Security.\n  We know that change is frightening for all of us, particularly senior \ncitizens. I know in my own family, as my relatives have gotten older, \nthe less change the better for them. And we need to make sure of any \nchanges in their financial security, that we reassure them that we are \nnot taking anything away that will put them at risk. Unfortunately, as \nwe discuss needed changes in Social Security, some have taken advantage \nof this to frighten our seniors. What I would like to discuss briefly \nthis morning is what retirees and workers in this country need to know \nabout the changes that President Bush is discussing.\n  One thing is important to make clear: The changes in Social Security \nthat we are discussing today and that the President is discussing as he \ntravels around the country will not affect anyone over 55. Anyone born \nbefore 1950 does not have to give these changes a second thought. \nNothing about their retirement income will be affected. It is secure. \nIn fact, the legislation we are discussing will, for the first time, \nguarantee that we won't change their benefits. It is important for \neveryone to know, particularly those over 55, that as the program is \nstructured today, this Senate, this Congress, this President could \nchange it at any time. In fact, many people who say there is no problem \nwith the system and that these things could be corrected with small \nadjustments, unfortunately, when you ask them what these adjustments \nare, they are always small benefit cuts and tax increases, as we have \ndone over 30 times in the past.\n\n  The President is talking about making sure that this doesn't happen \nagain for anyone over 55. But what folks below 55 need to know--my \nchildren and, hopefully, someday my grandchildren--is that we are \nactually going to give them a better deal than they have now with \nSocial Security because by the time my children retire, the current \nprogram will begin to cut their benefits dramatically.\n  It is important for American workers today to know that the average \nAmerican family contributes over $5,000 a year in Social Security \ntaxes. That is a lot of money for families who have very little money \nto save. Unfortunately, we are not saving one penny of what today's \nworkers are putting into Social Security.\n  When I say that to folks back home, they generally smile at me like I \nam not telling them the truth: You mean we are putting over $5,000 a \nyear in Social Security and you are not saving one penny of that?\n  I say: That is exactly true, unfortunately.\n  This is a very risky situation for people who are working today and \ncontributing a lot of money. And folks who are talking about making \nsmall adjustments to fix Social Security for their future are actually \nasking them to pay more into Social Security in return for a smaller \nbenefit in the future.\n  Fortunately, our President does not think this is a good deal. The \nplan that the President is discussing--and actually some variations \nthat a lot of us have been working on--needs to make sure that any \nchanges in the Social Security system are actually a better deal for \npoor and middle-income workers. I know one plan we have worked on is \nactually constructed in a way that the less people make, the bigger \npercentage of their Social Security taxes goes into their account. This \ngives younger and lower income workers the chance to accumulate as much \nmoney as they need to have a more secure retirement, with a better \nretirement income.\n  These plans also give people real ownership. I have heard folks say \nthat the President's ideas take money out of Social Security and put it \nin the stock market. That is not true. I don't know if folks are \nconfused or just don't have the facts straight, but what we are talking \nabout with the President's changes is for the first time actually \nsaving the money that people are putting in Social Security. And we are \ntalking about, as a government, putting more money into Social Security \nthan is now coming in through payroll taxes. So actually we are adding \ndollars to the Social Security system, making it stronger and more \nsecure in the future. Younger workers will have the chance, as they \nwork and grow toward retirement, to accumulate a savings account. And \nthe exciting thing for us in the Congress is recognizing that many \nAmericans now have no savings. They own very little. They can't benefit \nfrom the growth in our economy. And while a part of America owns things \nand it grows and earns interest, so many Americans don't have that \nopportunity.\n  What the President has put before the American people is the \nopportunity for every American worker to become a saver and an investor \nand to do it in a way that secures their retirement much more than it \nis secure today and protects their income. I believe that any changes \nin Social Security using personal accounts should guarantee low and \nmiddle-income workers a level of income so that there is no risk to \nthem as they look at changes in the future.\n  We know, as we have looked at the program, that the opportunity for \nlow-income workers is actually to get a larger income in retirement \nthan they have been promised today. But we need to make sure, answering \nthe critics of these changes, that we assure workers that there will be \nno benefit cuts, particularly for low and middle-income workers. And \nthat assurance can be built into a plan.\n\n[[Page S1156]]\n\n  It is important that all of us in the Senate and the Congress and, of \ncourse, the President, continue to let the American people know that \nthe Social Security system, as it is designed today, needs some changes \nif it is going to be there for tomorrow's workers. But we also need to \nreassure them that these changes actually create a more secure and a \nstronger Social Security system than we have today.\n  As we have already said, the seniors of today, those near retirement, \nwill not be affected, but younger workers for the first time will have \nthe opportunity to actually save what they are putting into Social \nSecurity. This is an opportunity for a generation, for us in Congress \nto save Social Security, strengthen it, and make every American worker \na saver/investor. This is an opportunity of which I want to be a part.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, before the Senator from South Carolina \nleaves the floor, I know this is his first major policy address. I \nthink he has addressed the Senate before on another subject, but this \nis his first address.\n  I would just like to say to the junior Senator from South Carolina \nthat I have already learned that there is no one in this body, whether \nthey have been here a while or just gotten here, who knows any more \nabout the Social Security subject than the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. President, we need that expertise. This is an extraordinarily \nimportant debate. I thank him for his support and contribution.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I am happy to be in the Chamber. I recall \n4 years ago when I gave my first speech in the Senate, and I realize my \ncolleague from South Carolina has given a lot of speeches over in the \nHouse of Representatives at the other end of this building, but it was \na good day for me 4 years ago, and I suspect it is a special day for \neveryone involved.\n  It is a great pleasure to know the Senator, and I look forward to \nworking with him. I welcome the Senator to the Senate and congratulate \nhim on his maiden speech.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/09/senate-section/article/S1156-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1156-S1157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       WORKING FOR THE PEOPLE OF LOUISIANA AND THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, what a difference a day makes. At this \ntime yesterday I was riding in a Mardi Gras parade with my wife Wendy \nand four young children throwing beads and toys to throngs of young \nrevelers. Today I stand on the floor of the Senate to participate in \none of its many great traditions by delivering my maiden speech--a \ncontrast to be sure but perhaps a fitting segue since both exercises \nare about a wonderfully unique place called Louisiana and particularly \nthe great faces and high hopes of its children.\n  As I begin, I wish to express to my new Senate colleagues what an \nenormous privilege and honor it is to serve with them. From our most \nsenior Member, the senior Senator from West Virginia, to our youngest, \nthe junior Senator from New Hampshire--I missed that mark by 3 years, \nby the way--this body is filled with bright, talented, and passionate \nmen and women who care deeply about our country. And, of course, this \nincludes the senior Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, who honors me \nwith her presence in the Chamber today. I look forward to working with \neach and every one of you, always putting country above party, people \nabove politics. That doesn't mean we will always agree, of course. In \nfact, it may mean my words and actions will be particularly spirited \nand passionate, but that is only because of the sincerity and urgency I \nbring to an important job in important times.\n  There is also one even greater honor than serving with you which I \nwant to acknowledge, and that is being chosen to serve by the wonderful \npeople of Louisiana.\n  The media and pundits put great emphasis on my being the first \nRepublican Senator from Louisiana since Reconstruction--or in 121 \nyears. Put another way, I am the first Louisiana Republican popularly \nelected to the Senate in history. I think the people of Louisiana were \nvery focused on making history in my election but in a very different \nway that had nothing to do with narrow partisan politics. They \nresponded to my call to make history by lowering prescription drug \nprices dramatically; by expanding choice and access to affordable \nhealth care through empowering patients and their doctors, not \nGovernment or insurance company bureaucrats; by doing the difficult but \nnecessary work to create great jobs in Louisiana, such as fighting \ncorruption and cronyism and demanding standards and accountability in \neducation; by forging a Federal commitment to save a unique national \ntreasure, the quickly disappearing Louisiana coast; by truly honoring \nour seniors with true Social Security that the politicians can't touch.\n  This is the history Louisiana citizens voted to make, and this is the \nhistory I am committed to help forge. This is why my first legislative \naction as a Senator was to introduce the Pharmaceutical Market Access \nAct of 2005, to put affordable prescription drugs within reach of all \nAmericans.\n  Now, I have to say this was not an easy first action. Clearly, this \nbill is opposed by some very powerful interests in Washington such as \nthe big drug companies. It is opposed by the administration and was not \nparticularly welcomed by any leadership in Congress, Senate or House, \nRepublican or Democrat. But I could not ignore the wishes of a vast \nmajority of Louisiana citizens.\n  As I travelled throughout Louisiana over the past year, I heard \ncountless seniors in particular tell similar stories about the \noutrageous costs of their prescription drugs and how it burdens their \nlives. The United States is the world's largest market for \npharmaceuticals. Yet we pay the world's highest prices. American \nseniors alone will spend $1.8 trillion on prescription drugs over the \nnext decade. Meanwhile, citizens of virtually every other \nindustrialized country pay significantly lower prices, lower by 30 \npercent or more. And this includes many countries which are not \ndominated by old-fashioned statist price control regimes.\n  My bill would make prescription drugs more affordable by expanding \nfree trade and world commerce, by legalizing the importation of \nprescription drugs from 25 industrialized countries with pharmaceutical \nstructures equivalent or superior to our own. For the first time, \nindividual consumers would be allowed to legally import prescription \ndrugs for their personal use.\n  Critics of drug importation cite safety as their primary concern. I \nshare a belief that the safety of prescription drugs is paramount. My \nbill takes steps to address real safety concerns and strengthen \nexisting laws by adding new requirements to promote the safety of \nprescription drugs here at home and those brought in from abroad. It \nincludes new requirements that imported prescription drugs be packaged \nand shipped using state-of-the-art counterfeit-resistant technologies \nor be carefully tested for authenticity before entering commerce in our \ncountry.\n  Drug importation is not a conservative or liberal issue. It is not a \nDemocrat or Republican issue. It is a universal issue and challenge to \nprovide our Nation's consumers access to safe and affordable drugs. \nThat is why I worked to assemble a coalition of Senators and \nRepresentatives from across the political spectrum in support of this \nlegislation. This coalition makes the bill unique as the first \nbipartisan and bicameral drug importation proposal. It is the companion \nbill to that offered by Representative Gutknecht in the House. An \nearlier version of the Gutknecht bill, of course, passed the House last \nCongress with my strong support and vote and stands as the only bill \never to pass either body on this subject. I look forward to working \nwith all of my new Senate colleagues to advance this crucial fight. \nAnd, of course, my door is always open to those who want to join our \neffort or who have other ideas on how to bring the high cost of \nprescription drugs down to an affordable level. This issue is too \nimportant for us not to act.\n  In addition to lowering the price of prescription drugs, I look \nforward to\n\n[[Page S1157]]\n\nworking with my Senate colleagues to take on other crucial challenges. \nI will be an active participant in the Social Security debate because \nwe have a duty to the American people to ensure that their Social \nSecurity money is protected, not just for the current generation of \nretirees but for future generations as well. That is why I introduced \nmy version of the Social Security lockbox last week and why I support \nthe innovative idea of secure personal retirement accounts.\n  This week I will participate in the debate on class action reform in \nsupport of the Senator from Iowa, and I am hopeful we will not stop \nhere. In the near future the Senate needs to address the problem of \nfrivolous lawsuits that are driving more and more doctors out of \nbusiness and robbing so many rural communities of access to the most \nbasic health care.\n\n  I will also keep up the fight against Louisiana corruption and \ncronyism that still costs us jobs back home. As the folks back home \nknow, I have gotten a few scars from this battle in the past but that \nis OK; I am ready to continue this fight in the Senate because it is a \nfight about doing right by Louisiana.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Landrieu on key Louisiana \nprojects that will protect and strengthen our Louisiana economy. By \nworking together we will be able to secure the funding needed to \npreserve our coast, finish the construction of I-49, and protect our \nState's vital military installations.\n  Every morning that I wake up at home in Louisiana, I help my wife \nWendy get our four children up and ready for school and for life. Then \nI view what flows naturally from that. I look for new ideas and \ninnovative avenues to improve the lives of every child in Louisiana. \nAnd now in doing so I look for new ways to work with every Member of \nthis great body to build that brighter future.\n  Mr. President, I thank you and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say briefly to the junior Senator \nfrom Louisiana, thank you for a marvelous opportunity to hear your \nfirst policy speech in the Senate. On behalf of all of our colleagues \non both sides of the aisle, we welcome you here, and it is a pleasure \nto listen to your priorities not only for Louisiana but for the Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair. I rise to say a few words to \ncongratulate my colleague, a gentleman I have known for many years and \nso many in Louisiana and around the Nation have come to admire and \nrespect for his energy and commitment. I can only say the only \ndisappointment in his maiden speech is that he did not call for the \nMardi Gras to be a national holiday. The two of us are going to join \nforces and continue to work on that. I think most of our colleagues \nwould readily sign that resolution, so we will see.\n  But let me in seriousness thank him for joining the effort and \nputting his shoulder to the wheel to lower prescription drug costs for \nthe people of Louisiana and our Nation. There are many critically \nimportant and urgent issues before the Congress but that ranks among \nthe top. I believe his expertise in that area is going to be called on \noften in the next few months as this debate continues.\n  Also, I would need to mention that I thank him for his efforts in \nmentioning and fighting for, both in his time in the House and the \nLouisiana Legislature, the issue of coastal erosion. I see our good \nfriend, the Senator from Arkansas, in the Chamber, and I was joking \nwith his colleague, Senator Lincoln, last night, saying if we are not \nsuccessful in our efforts against coastal erosion, they, too, will have \nthe great benefit of representing a coastal State because Louisiana may \nnot be there if we do not address this issue.\n\n  On accountability in education, this Congress has made remarkable \nprogress, and our State, you may not realize but as Senator Vitter \nknows, is leading the Nation in both accountability and also \nrequirements in those new standards, and on transportation. I look \nforward to working with him.\n  He has two excellent committee assignments on Commerce and EPA. He \nwill follow in the great footsteps of Senator John Breaux who served so \nably on the Committee on Commerce in the area of fisheries as well as \ncoastal issues on that committee, and on Transportation.\n  So I say to Senator Vitter, welcome to the Senate. Your energy, your \nenthusiasm, and your vision are going to mean a great deal to \nstrengthen this already august body. Thank you and God bless you in \nyour term.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/09/senate-section/article/S1157-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham).

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To exempt class action lawsuits brought by the attorney \n  general of any State from the modified civil procedures required by \n                               this Act)\n\n       On page 5, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       ``(1) Attorney general.--The term `attorney general' means \n     the chief legal officer of a State.\n       On page 5, line 3, strike ``(1)'' and insert ``(2)''.\n       On page 5, line 5, strike ``(2)'' and insert ``(3)''.\n       On page 5, line 12, strike the period at the end and insert \n     the following: ``, but does not include any civil action \n     brought by, or on behalf of, any attorney general.''.\n       On page 5, line 13, strike ``(3)'' and insert ``(4)''.\n       On page 5, line 17, strike ``(4)'' and insert ``(5)''.\n       On page 5, line 21, strike ``(5)'' and insert ``(6)''.\n       On page 6, line 1, strike ``(6)'' and insert ``(7)''.\n       On page 6, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n       ``(8) State.--The term `State' means each of the several \n     States of the United States, the District of Columbia, the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern \n     Mariana Islands, and any territory or possession of the \n     United States.\n       On page 14, strike lines 20 and 21, and insert the \n     following:\n       (1) by striking subsection (d) and inserting the following:\n       ``(e) As used in this section--\n       ``(1) the term `attorney general' means the chief legal \n     officer of a State; and\n       ``(2) the term `State' means each of the several States of \n     the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth \n     of Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \n     Islands, and any territory or possession of the United \n     States.''; and\n       On page 15, line 7, insert ``, but does not include any \n     civil action brought by, or on behalf of, any attorney \n     general'' before the semicolon at the end.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to S. 5, the \nClass\n\n[[Page S1158]]\n\nAction Fairness Act of 2005, to ensure that State attorneys general \nelected by the people of their States as the chief law enforcement \nofficer will still be able to do their business and protect the people \nof their States.\n  My amendment simply clarifies that State attorneys general should be \nexempt from S. 5 and be allowed to pursue their individual State's \ninterests as determined by themselves and not by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I know that S. 5 is intended to fix problems around class action law \nin America, and I think most agree that the attorneys general are not \npart of the problem. In the simplest terms, this amendment allows them \nto seek State remedies to State problems. I hope we can all agree \ninfringement on State rights should not be a result of this bill.\n  I believe class actions remain an important tool for enforcing \nshareholder and employee rights, for cracking down on telemarketing \nfraud in attempts to prey on the elderly, and in forcing companies to \nimprove product safety both in the manufacture of unreasonably \ndangerous products and in drugs. We need to make sure class action \nreform does not unnecessarily restrict the ability of citizens to seek \nredress for legitimate claims.\n  While we all may not agree with those in Congress that we need to \nimprove the class action process, we should all agree that it should \nnot be done by shutting State attorneys general out of the system. I \nbelieve to do so would circumvent the intent of our Founding Fathers in \nrecognizing that State sovereignty should not be dismissed by Federal \naction so easily. To that end, I offer this amendment in an attempt to \nquash ambiguity about the authority of State attorneys general that may \nexist in this bill.\n  It should be known that this commonsense amendment in no way impairs \nthe class action reforms as intended in this bill, nor does it in any \nway expand the authority of State attorneys general. What this \namendment does is clarify the existing authority of State attorneys \ngeneral.\n  I have heard in the hallways, and as I have gone through the \ncorridors in the Senate in the last few days, that there are some who \ndo not want any amendments to this bill. This amendment, if accepted, I \nbelieve is very consistent with the intent of the bill. I believe the \nauthors of the bill did not intend to shut out State attorneys general. \nSo even though some do not want amendments--I think we ought to \nconsider all amendments; some of the amendments are very worthy of \nconsideration. Although some do not want amendments, I think they can \nvote for this with a clear conscience that this will not change the \nintent of the bill.\n  I am a former State attorney general. I understand the important work \nthey do for consumers and the most vulnerable in our society. It is not \njust my opinion that this amendment is needed. I offer this amendment \non behalf of a bipartisan group of 46 State attorneys general who have \nexpressed that it is critically important to all their constituents, \nespecially the poor, elderly, and disabled, that provisions in this \nlegislation be clarified so as not to compromise the traditional law \nenforcement authority.\n  I have a letter. Interestingly enough, in the first paragraph of the \nletter, it says--and these are 46 State attorneys general:\n\n       We take no position on the act as a general matter and, \n     indeed, there are differing views among us on the policy \n     judgments reflected in the act.\n\n  This is very clear. The attorneys general are split on the underlying \nact, but they are not split on their authority being called into \nquestion with this act.\n  They say:\n\n       Clarifying the act does not apply to and would have no \n     effect on actions brought by State attorneys general on \n     behalf of their respective States and citizens.\n\n  I want to talk in just a minute about how State attorneys general are \ndifferent from private sector lawyers. I will get to that in a minute.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record this letter signed by \n46 State attorneys general, Democrats and Republicans, collectively \nrepresenting more than 90 percent of the country, who are very \nconcerned that this legislation as it is written will stop them from \ndoing an important part of their jobs.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                         of Attorneys General,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 7, 2005.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Dirksen Building, \n         Washington DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Hart Building \n         Washington, DC.\n     Dear Senate Majority Leader Frist and Senate Minority Leader \n     Reid: We, the undersigned State Attorneys General, write to \n     express our concern regarding one limited aspect of pending \n     Senate Bill 5, the ``Class Action Fairness Act,'' or any \n     similar legislation. We take no position on the Act as a \n     general matter and, indeed, there are differing views among \n     us on the policy judgments reflected in the Act. We join \n     together, however, in a bipartisan request for support of \n     Senator Mark Pryor's potential amendment to S. 5, or any \n     similar legislation, clarifying that the Act does not apply \n     to, and would have no effect on, actions brought by any State \n     Attorney General on behalf of his or her respective state or \n     its citizens.\n       As Attorneys General, we frequently investigate and bring \n     actions against defendants who have caused harm to our \n     citizens. These cases are usually brought pursuant to the \n     Attorney General's parens patriae authority under our \n     respective consumer protection and antitrust statutes. In \n     some instances, such actions have been brought with the \n     Attorney General acting as the class representative for the \n     consumers of the state. It is our concern that certain \n     provisions of S. 5 might be misinterpreted to hamper the \n     ability of the Attorneys General to bring such actions, \n     thereby impeding one means of protecting our citizens from \n     unlawful activity and its resulting harm.\n       The Attorneys General have been very successful in \n     litigation initiated to protect the rights of our consumers. \n     For example, in the pharmaceutical industry, the States \n     have recently brought enforcement actions on behalf of \n     consumers against large, often foreign-owned, drug \n     companies for overcharges and market manipulations that \n     illegally raised the costs of certain prescription drugs. \n     Such cases have resulted in recoveries of approximately \n     235 million dollars, the majority of which is earmarked \n     for consumer restitution. In several instances, the \n     States' recoveries provided one hundred percent \n     reimbursement directly to individual consumers of the \n     overcharges they suffered as a result of the illegal \n     activities of the defendants. This often meant several \n     hundred dollars going back into the pockets of those \n     consumers who can least afford to be victimized by illegal \n     trade practices, senior citizens living on fixed incomes \n     and the working poor who cannot afford insurance.\n       We encourage you to support the aforementioned amendment \n     exempting all actions brought by State Attorneys General from \n     the provisions of S. 5, or any similar legislation. It is \n     important to all of our constituents, but especially to the \n     poor, elderly and disabled, that the provisions of the Act \n     not be misconstrued and that we maintain the enforcement \n     authority needed to protect them from illegal practices. We \n     respectfully submit that the overall purposes of the \n     legislation would not be impaired by such an amendment that \n     merely clarifies the existing authority of our respective \n     States.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this very important \n     matter.

Mr. President, I have served with some of these attorneys \ngeneral, and I can say they come from different ideological points of \nview and different ways of practicing law. As a whole, they are not \ntaking a position on the bill, but as you can see by this letter, the \nvast majority of State AGs agree on one point: As the chief legal \nofficers for their respective States, there must be clarification in \nthe bill to make sure they can continue to represent the citizens of \ntheir States and carry out their duties as elected officials.\n  As we all know, attorneys general frequently investigate and bring \nactions against defendants who have caused harm to their citizens. \nThese cases are usually brought pursuant to the attorneys general \nparens patriae authority under their respective consumer protection and \nantitrust statutes. This is an important point. Not all States have \nparens patriae authority. In fact, the State of Arkansas, when I was \nattorney general, had very limited parens patriae. In fact, one could \nargue none at all. We always had to pursue our actions under the \nDeceptive Trade Practices Act, which is a State statute, and we had \nspecific authority in that statute.\n  I heard some people say, again, in the hallways here, that all States \nhave parens patriae and therefore we do not need this amendment. But \nthat is not the case. In some instances, such actions have been brought \nwith the attorney general acting as the class representative for \nconsumers in the State. It is my concern, as well as those of 46 \nattorneys general, that certain provisions in S. 5 might be interpreted \nto hamper their ability to bring such actions, thereby impeding one \nmeans of protecting their citizens from unlawful activity and resulting \nharm.\n  It is important to all consumers, but especially to the poor, \nelderly, and disabled, that the provisions of the act not be \nmisconstrued and that attorneys general maintain the enforcement \nauthority needed to protect them from illegal practices.\n  I know there are many people who want this body to pass class action \nreform this year and do not want to ruin its chances by adding too many \namendments to the underlying bill. But, as I said a few moments ago, in \nthis case, with this particular amendment, we are not changing the \nintent of the bill.\n  I would like to address a falsehood about the amendment that I have \nheard, and that is that some people have said this amendment would \ncreate a major loophole because suits could be brought on behalf of \nState attorneys general, that some attorneys general may allow their \nfriends to use their names to avoid moving the case to Federal court.\n  The notion is incorrect and, quite frankly, it is offensive. Let me \nbe clear.\n  No one can add a State attorney general without his or her express \nconsent or permission. Moreover, attorneys general are statewide \nelected officials accountable to the same citizens who vote for us. \nThey work hard and take their responsibility as chief legal officers \nvery seriously. State attorneys general would not expend the resources \nor their reputations to take up a class action they did not believe was \nworthy of protecting their citizens.\n  In addition, it should be noted that in many cases, attorneys general \nare not after the check or the payment in litigation. They are not \neyeing the big settlement, although in some cases there are large \nsettlements at the end of the horizon. The primary objective of State \nattorneys general is not chasing the money but bringing about reform.\n\n  Let me be clear on this point. I alluded to this a few moments ago. \nState attorneys general are fundamentally different from private \nattorneys. Private attorneys have clients, and they are out there doing \nwhat their clients want: trying to get a recovery and trying to make \ntheir clients whole. I understand that. That is a good thing. I do not \nhave any problem with that.\n  State attorneys general are different. Generally speaking--maybe not \nin every single case but generally speaking, when the State attorney \ngeneral becomes involved, there is a matter of public policy in the \nlitigation. In fact, I said a few moments ago that the State attorneys \ngeneral are elected officials. That is not true in every single case. I \nthink there are about 35 elected attorneys general. There are a couple \nselected by the supreme court or by the State legislature, and some are \nappointed by the Governor.\n  Nonetheless, attorneys general have a level of accountability that \nyou do not find in private practice because they are accountable to the \npeople, either the people who elected them or appointed them or \nselected them for the office. And attorneys general, more than private \nlawyers, are sensitive to criticism.\n  I can assure you, the last thing an attorney general wants to read is \nan opinion by a judge who is criticizing the attorney general for \nbringing a frivolous lawsuit, criticizing the attorney general for \ngoing too far. That is the last thing the attorney general wants to \nread in the paper.\n  Also, there is the court of public opinion. The attorney general does \nnot like bad editorials to be written about him or her. They do not \nlike to be out on the street and people questioning their integrity or \ntheir sense. So attorneys general have a level of accountability that \njust does not exist in other areas of practice.\n  That is an important distinction. As I mentioned a few moments ago, \nnormally cases brought by States involve a matter of public policy, and \nwe can go through a long list of cases and show where the public policy \nis in the cases and also show how a lot of these cases would not be \nprofitable for the private sector to bring.\n  Oftentimes there is a matter of fairness and not a matter of money \ninvolved in these cases. There are several major examples where State \nattorneys general have filed a cause of action in State court to \nprotect their citizens or bring reform. However, if we do not act to \nclarify S. 5, I am concerned this legislation would make it much harder \nfor the attorneys general to do their jobs.\n  Back in the 1990s, the attorneys general around the country pooled \ntogether and sued the tobacco industry for reimbursement of State \nmoneys as a result of disease brought about by smoking. I know in some \nquarters that is still a very controversial decision. Let me very \nrespectfully remind the Congress that the Congress a year, two or three \nbefore this settlement occurred had the chance to enter into a \nfederally mandated global settlement of all claims. That did not \nhappen. The States pursued their case after the Congress failed to act.\n  This tobacco case resulted in a historic global settlement that \ndrastically altered the way our Nation views and approaches smoking. \nMoney from these settlements was used by the States for youth smoking \nprevention, to improve health care, educate citizens on the dangers of \nsmoking, and an increased level of treatment for smoking-related \nillnesses. My State of Arkansas has spent every penny of the tobacco \nmoney it has received on health-related issues--every single penny.\n  Back to the point about the difference in the private sector attorney \nrepresenting the individual or representing a class versus the attorney \ngeneral representing the State's interest and the citizens of the \nState, when you look at the settlement agreement between the tobacco \ncompanies and the State, if I recall right, it was about 147 pages \nlong. It was very detailed, very negotiated, a very hard-to-reach \nsettlement.\n  I believe it was 147 pages long without the attachments, and 91 of \nthose pages, that is two-thirds of the pages approximately, were about \nthe public policy and changing the tobacco industry's practices. Here \nagain, in private litigation it is about getting recovery for one's \nclient, and we understand that, but when the attorney general is \ninvolved it is a materially different type of litigation.\n  I have never seen a private settlement in which two-thirds of the \nsettlement document requires the industry\n\n[[Page S1160]]\n\nor the company to change its practices, but that is the type of \nlitigation the attorneys general enter into.\n  Each State in the tobacco case filed individual suits in their \nrespective State's court alleging fraud. In our particular State, we \nalleged the Deceptive Trade Practices Act violations and also a number \nof common law claims. Due to the nature of the claims, if this \nlegislation as it is written would have existed at the time of this \ncase, it may have presented hurdles to the attorneys general that could \nhave prevented a resolution.\n  In 2001, several State attorneys general took on Ford and Firestone \nfor failure to disclose defects in Firestone tires used on Ford SUVs, \nof which they should have been aware. These cases were brought again in \nArkansas, and other States have similar laws, under our State's \nDeceptive Trade Practices Act, fraud and consumer protection laws.\n  Let us make this point in another case. In private causes of action, \nand there were many relating to the Ford and the Firestone litigation, \nthe parties' and the lawyers' primary concern was trying to make the \nplaintiffs whole. That is the nature of that type of litigation.\n  In the attorney general actions, we established a restitution fund \nand a long series of injunctions against the companies in the way they \nmarketed their products. In fact, some people may have noticed they \nhave seen some new Ford Explorer ads on television in recent weeks. \nThese Ford Explorer ads are due to the attorney general lawsuit, and \nthey deal with the safety of Ford Explorers. All this goes back to the \nway Ford Explorers were marketed originally. The buyers bought them \nthinking they were safe under pretty much all conditions, but practice \nhas taught us differently. So I make that point one more time to show \nhow different State litigation is versus private litigation.\n  Ultimately, the Ford case was settled. However, had these States been \nrequired to file separate State cases under their own consumer \nprotection laws, as could be required under this class action bill, \nthose States would have been removed to Federal court. The Federal \ncourt would then have been required to become an expert in each State's \ndiverse consumer laws and remedies.\n  State litigation is different from private litigation, and I think to \nsome degree this amendment is a matter of States rights. In 2000, 26 \nattorneys general from 26 States brought suit against Publishers \nClearinghouse claiming that the company was intentionally preying on \nthe elderly by misrepresenting their sweepstakes award. My colleagues \nmay remember that for years people used to get mail with pictures of \ncelebrities, and in big bold letters it would have your name and say: \nYou have won X number of millions of dollars. Or it would say: \nCongratulations, millionaire.\n  Think about it. We do not get those letters anymore. Why? Because the \nStates intervened. The States came in under consumer protection laws \nand looked at how deceptive those ads were. In fact, in Arkansas when I \nwas in the attorney general's office I would talk to an adult child of \na deceased person or an adult child who had put their parents in a \nnursing home and they would clean out the closets and the living room \nor whatever and they would find stacks and stacks of magazines that had \nbeen ordered through these sweepstakes companies.\n\n  Even if one reads everything in great detail, they would find in the \nfine print that ordering does not increase their chances of winning. \nMost people do not read all the fine print. Most people thought that \nordering did increase their chance of winning, and what happened was \npeople would order the same magazine. People would tell me they would \nfind 10 copies of the same Sports Illustrated or 10 copies of the same \nNewsweek or Good Housekeeping because these senior citizens ordered to \ntry to win the sweepstakes.\n  It is sad and unfortunate, but they saw this as a chance they were \nwilling to take to leave a lot of money to their children and \ngrandchildren. So we came in as States and put a stop to that. I think \nit was 26 States that banded together and put a stop to that.\n  It was alleged that Publishers Clearinghouse was profiting from this \nfraud at the expense of the vulnerable elderly. I can recall that these \nindividuals had spent their life savings on these fraudulent \nsweepstakes. When we got inside of the cases, we found many seniors in \nArkansas who had spent hundreds, maybe thousands of dollars trying to \nwin sweepstakes.\n  Is there someone here who thinks the actions of the attorneys general \nare out of step with common sense and fairness? In this bill we should \nmake sure we do not take away any existing authority of the attorneys \ngeneral.\n  These are just a few examples of the very hard and worthy work by the \nState attorneys general where they are trying to protect the citizens \nof their States. I challenge my colleagues to deem the work they do as \nfrivolous or as junk lawsuits because attorneys general around the \ncountry have a layer of accountability that does not exist elsewhere. \nThey are accountable to the people. They are accountable to the \nlegislature that makes their budgets. They are accountable to the \nGovernor. They are accountable in the court of public opinion.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment to this bill for \nseveral reasons. One is that the overwhelming majority of State \nattorneys general, our States' chief legal officers, are concerned \nabout the language of this bill, and we should be concerned about it. \nRemember, these attorneys general represent the citizens in all of our \nStates. They try to get out there and do the right thing for their \ncitizens.\n  Secondly, by making this change, we are not obstructing the intent of \nthe bill, but I believe very strongly we are clarifying the authority \nthat already exists.\n  Third, we should allow our attorneys general to seek State remedies \nto State problems. I think this is an important piece of this. It goes \nback to States rights. It goes back to local control and people trying \nto do things the way they want to handle them in their own States.\n  So I implore all of my colleagues who are champions of States rights \nor who want to protect the integrity of the bill and want to leave the \ntools that currently exist with the State attorneys general, to vote \nfor this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, a time agreement has been worked out. I \nask unanimous consent that the vote in relation to the Pryor amendment \noccur at 12:15 today, with the time equally divided in the usual form \nprior to the vote, with no amendment in order to the amendment prior to \nthe vote. Further, the time to be divided begins from when the \namendment was sent to the desk. So to amplify that, the time for the \nDemocrats would begin when Senator Pryor started to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I know the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Carper, has \nanother engagement, so I will speak very briefly as the lead opponent \nof this amendment.\n  I do oppose the amendment. I appreciate the experience of Senator \nPryor having been attorney general of the State of Arkansas. I did not \nhold such a lofty position. I was just a district attorney, but I \nappreciate the reasons he has put forward for the amendment.\n  It is my suggestion that it is not necessary. When the Senator from \nArkansas has enumerated a number of situations where attorneys general \nprotect the interests of the citizens of their State, that can be \naccomplished even if this bill is adopted. In the first place, the bill \nprovides that if two-thirds of the parties involved are citizens of the \nState, it stays in the State; if one-third, it goes to the Federal \ncourt; and between one-third and two-thirds, it is up to the discretion \nof the judge.\n  So even within the confines of the language of the bill, the \ninterests that the Senator from Arkansas has articulated will be \nprotected.\n  Next, the attorneys general have authority under parens patriae \nstatutes enacted by the many state legislatures to represent the \ncitizens of their State. They are the lawyer for everybody in the \nState. The Latin phrase of parens patriae has been adopted and that \ngives them sufficient standing to undertake whatever is necessary.\n\n[[Page S1161]]\n\n  There is a provision in the Pryor amendment which broadens it \nsubstantially by providing that any civil action brought by or on \nbehalf of the attorney general in a State would be excluded so that \nthere would be latitude for the attorney general to deputize private \nattorneys to bring their class actions and to find an exclusion, which \nis a pretty broad exclusion, not to use pejorative terms, but a pretty \nbroad loophole.\n  Those are the essential arguments. I could expand on them, but we \nhave limited time. The Senator from Texas has been in the Chamber since \nwe started the debate, but as I understand it, he has agreed to yield \nto the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CORNYN. It is my understanding Senator Carper would like to speak \nfor about 5 minutes. I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized \nimmediately after Senator Carper, and then Senator Salazar be \nrecognized in that sequence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from Texas, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Specter for yielding to \nme. I say to my friend and colleague from Arkansas, he knows how fond I \nam of him and how highly I regard him, both in his previous role as \nattorney general and as a colleague in the Senate.\n  When I heard of the amendment he was preparing to offer, I stopped \nand I said to my staff, let's find out if this is something I can \nsupport. As many of my colleagues know, we have endeavored to improve \nthis bill over time, and the legislation before us today is a far \ndifferent bill than was first proposed 7 years ago or even was debated \n2 years ago and reported out of committee.\n  Senator Specter has spoken of the option that is available to most \nattorneys general, an approach called parens patriae, which I \nunderstand means ``government stands in the place of the citizen.'' For \nmost attorneys general who wish to file a case on behalf of their \ncitizens against some defendant, they have the opportunity to use \nparens patriae. For those who do not, in my judgment, they still have \nthe opportunity to use the class action lawsuit.\n  What we have sought to do over the last couple of years in modifying \nthis bill is to make sure that the class action lawsuits brought by an \nindividual in a State, if they are of a national scope, they would be \nin a Federal court. If they are not, if they are more of a local issue \ninvolving residents of that State, a defendant in that State, or even \nwhere there are multiple defendants, but a defendant in that State who \nhas a principal role as a defendant, not just somebody who was sort of \npulled out of the air, to make sure there is a real defendant with a \nreal stake in it that has a real financial ability to pay damages, then \nthe legislation that is before us actually permits an attorney general \nor, frankly, any attorney, plaintiff's attorney, to bring that kind of \nclass action.\n  The legislation that is before us says if two-thirds of the \nplaintiffs in a class action lawsuit are from the same State as the \ndefendant, it will stay in the State court, no question. The \nlegislation before us says that if anywhere from one-third to two-\nthirds of the plaintiffs on whose behalf the class action is brought \nmeet certain standards that are set out in the bill, that can stay in \nState court as well.\n\n  The legislation that is before us today provides exemptions as well \nfor incidents involving a sudden single accident. The legislation \nbefore us today also provides exemptions under the Dodd-Schumer-\nLandrieu language that provide even further opportunities to proceed \nwith a class action lawsuit if the matter that is being discussed is \ntruly a local matter, if most of the people involved both as plaintiffs \nand defendants are within that State.\n  The last thing I would say is there are plenty of people on both \nsides of the aisle who would like to offer amendments. My fear is if \nany of those amendments were adopted, we invite the House of \nRepresentatives to come back and to offer quite a different bill than \nthe compromise that is before us today. To those of us who seek \nreasonable, modest reforms--and this is a court reform bill, not a tort \nreform bill--but to those who seek moderate reforms incorporated in \nthis legislation, I did not support this amendment because I think it \nwould simply invite the adoption of other amendments and, frankly, put \nus in the situation which will end in a conference with the House of \nRepresentatives with a bill that is frankly far different than this one \nand will provide an end product not to my liking and I suspect even \nless to the liking of those who are opposed to this compromise.\n  I reluctantly oppose this amendment with that in mind, but it is not \nsomething I do easily or lightly.\n  I thank my friend Senator Cornyn for making it possible for me to \nhave this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I first want to say how much I respect and \nadmire the author of this amendment, Senator Pryor. He and I served \ntogether as State attorneys general, he in Arkansas and I in Texas, for \n4 years. Our careers overlapped. I agree with him about the important \nrole that attorneys general play when it comes to protecting a State's \ncitizens and a State's consumers. But I think where I part company with \nmy friend Senator Pryor is, No. 1, this amendment is not necessary to \npreserve the authority of the State attorney general to protect the \nState's consumers, and, second, this amendment as worded--and I know \nthis is not his intention--would create a potential loophole big enough \nto drive a truck through, that could cause substantial mischief that is \nintended to be prevented by this very bill.\n  Finally, as Senator Carper has said, this is a negotiated bill. There \nare amendments I would like to offer that I think would make it a \nbetter bill. But I think we all realize that after many Senators have \nlabored long and hard to try to get us to the point today where we \nliterally have bipartisan support for this compromise, to offer any \namendments, and particularly one like this and others that have been \nfiled but not yet called up, would threaten our chance of success. I \nthink that would be a shame because we all agree that the class action \nabuses we see are very real and are something that do not benefit the \nAmerican people or consumers in general.\n  We have seen that some of these egregious abuses of the class action \nprocedure have been used to make certain entrepreneurial lawyers very \nwealthy when the consumers literally get a coupon worth pennies on the \ndollar.\n  I am not opposed to lawyers. Let me say up front I happen to be a \nlawyer. But I do think that all lawyers, all people, anybody with \ncommon sense--some may say that excludes lawyers--but I like to think \nanybody with common sense recognizes the very real abuses that have \noccurred in the class action system. We have heard a lot about that. I \nwill not repeat all of that now. I think we all take that as a given.\n\n  First, let me allude to the letter signed by--the Senator from \nArkansas said 46 State attorneys general from the National Association \nof Attorneys General, an organization of which I used to be a member \nand for which I have a lot of respect, both for the people who help run \nthat organization as well as the attorneys general who make up its \nmembership.\n  I point my colleagues to paragraph 2 in this letter, which I believe \nmakes my initial point which is that this amendment is not necessary to \npreserve the authority of State attorneys general. Indeed, in the last \nsentence in the second paragraph these 46 attorneys general say:\n\n       It is our concern that certain provisions of S. 5 might be \n     misinterpreted to hamper the ability of attorneys general to \n     bring such actions, thereby impeding one means of protecting \n     our citizens from unlawful activity and its resulting harm.\n\n  In other words, these 46 lawyers, the chief law enforcement officers \nof these States, make no claim that in fact this bill would impede \ntheir authority but, rather, that it might be misinterpreted.\n  I think it is fair to say that any law that has ever been written is \ncapable of being misinterpreted. That is why we have the court system. \nBut we certainly do not need an amendment like\n\n[[Page S1162]]\n\nthis to protect the States or the attorneys general against a potential \nmisinterpretation of S. 5, the Class Action Reform bill. That is the \nfunction, that is the role of the courts. I think it is very plain that \nno power of the State attorney general is impeded by virtue of S. 5, or \nwill be once it is signed into law.\n  Indeed, the Senator from Arkansas alluded to statutes that are \ntypical of every State--deceptive trade practice acts and consumer \nprotection statutes--which in my State and I believe in virtually every \nother State specifically authorize the attorney general to seek \nremedies on behalf of aggrieved consumers. This bill certainly would \nnot encroach on that authority. Indeed, he also alluded to common law \nclaims that are asserted by the attorneys general in pursuit of justice \nfor their State's citizens.\n  We heard the Senator from Delaware talk about the parens patriae \ndoctrine, which is generally recognized as providing the authority to \nthe attorney general to sue on behalf of his State's citizens. I \nacknowledge, as he said, there are some variations in terms of the \ncourt's interpretation in each State about the scope of that doctrine \nand how much or what kinds of actions might be authorized. But clearly, \nwhen State law and the State Constitution specifically provide for the \nright of an attorney general, a State attorney general, to sue on \nbehalf of his State's citizens, then this bill, when made a law, will \nnot in any way impede that endeavor.\n  Finally, in terms of the lack of necessity of this bill, the Senator \nfrom Delaware pointed out that where a substantial number of a State's \ncitizens are party to a class action and are located in one State, they \nare carved out by the very terms of this bill so that the case will \nremain in State court if that is where it was originally filed.\n  But the real danger in this amendment--and here again I am not \nsuggesting that anyone intended this, but I think it does show the \npotential for mischief with amendments that have not been the subject \nof long debate and negotiation--is the language that says:\n\n     . . . does not include any civil action brought by or on \n     behalf of the Attorney General of any State.\n\n  I am very sensitive to that particular phrase in the amendment \nbecause of a, frankly, very tragic experience I had as attorney general \nof my State. It is a fact that my predecessor as attorney general in \nthe State of Texas is currently in the Federal penitentiary. He is in \nthe Federal penitentiary because he was convicted, based on his own \nconfession, of mail fraud and other violations of law primarily related \nto his attempt, almost successful, to backdate outside counsel \ncontracts with an old buddy of his, that would potentially entitle his \nfriend to $520 million out of the taxpayers' recovery in the Texas \ntobacco litigation.\n  I take no pleasure in bringing this up but merely make mention of it \nto point out the potential for mischief--not when cases are brought by \nan attorney general, somebody who is elected by the people, whose \nfuture, frankly, is dependent on their dutiful discharge of their \nobligations and faithful discharge of their duties--but when you carve \nout suits brought on behalf of the attorney general, which could \ninclude any lawyer who any attorney general might choose to hire as \noutside counsel and, of course, who is unelected and unaccountable to \nthe people. Here, we see the potential for grave abuses.\n  As I have pointed out, this example was part of the Texas tobacco \nlitigation that was part of a nationwide set of litigation, one which \nultimately involved settlements on behalf of several individual States. \nI want to say, if my memory serves me, that Florida, Mississippi, and \nTexas filed their individual lawsuits and had individual judgments \nrendered. But the remainder of the States, including, I believe, the \nStates of the Senator from Arkansas and the Senator from Colorado--they \nwill correct me if I am wrong--they had a collective judgment rendered \nagainst the tobacco industry of almost $250 billion, a sum we would \nrecognize, even here in Washington, as being significant.\n  The problems presented by outside counsel performing the duties of an \nattorney general under an exception like this just go on and on. My own \nexperience is, again, where outside counsel of the State of Texas \nclaimed the right to $3.3 billion out of the Texas tobacco lawsuit \nrecovery, which by any reasonable measure was an extraordinary fee, one \nthat, when calculated by the hours of work actually put into the \nlawsuit, has been described as scandalous and unconscionable. The \nultimate concern must be the public interest. By accepting an amendment \nthat would place outside the scope of this bill someone bringing a \nlawsuit on behalf of the attorney general, somebody unelected by the \npeople, not accountable at the polls, we would be creating an \nenvironment ripe for fraud.\n  Let me tell you this: I recall that many of the States' attorneys \ngeneral believed in good faith that the tobacco industry was \nresponsible for contributing to the death and the illness of hundreds \nof thousands of Americans each year. Indeed, that is a fact. We lose \n400,000 people each year in this country as a result of consuming \ntobacco products. But the lawsuits brought, which were ultimately \nsettled by the tobacco industry, were brought under the guise of \nprotecting children and protecting the American consumer. We now see \nthat almost $300 billion was paid out but not a single tobacco company \nis out of business today. Indeed, they continue to make their product, \nnot only in this country but worldwide. There has been no decrease in \nthe number of people who get sick or die as a result of consuming \ntobacco products in this country each year.\n  I just have to ask whether it is wise--I suggest it is not--to create \nan exception, to place outside the protections of the bill not the \nattorneys general per se but those who seek to bring suits on the \nattorney general's behalf. I suggest to you the evidence in my State--\nand perhaps nationwide--indicates that the lack of accountability to \nthe voters, the lack of concern for ultimate welfare of the consumer, \nand the potential presence of an immediate personal self-serving motive \nto maximize a huge attorney fee, creates enough opportunity for \nmischief under this well-intended amendment that it should be voted \ndown on that basis, if no other.\n  Finally, let me say in conclusion that I know the Senator from \nArkansas has filed this amendment in good faith and certainly does not \nintend any of the results I have suggested here today. But I reiterate \nwhat the Senator from Delaware has said, and what I have been told both \nprivately and publicly. If I were to offer amendments which I believe \nwould make this bill better, it would be a poison pill for this \nlitigation. Indeed, I believe that no matter how well intended the \namendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas is, it would have that \nsame effect. I don't believe that is in anyone's interest.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment which \nhas been offered by the Senator from Arkansas. I have a great deal of \nrespect for the National Association of Attorneys General. I also \nserved in that position in the past, as well as the Senator from Texas \nand the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Let me very quickly make three points.\n  First, as has already been alluded to by both the Senator from Texas \nand the Senator from Delaware, the intent of this bill is to have no \neffect whatsoever on the powers and duties of the attorneys general to \nenforce their consumer protection responsibilities. I believe that \npoint should be very much a part of the legislative history of this \nlegislation as it moves forward.\n  Second, the powers and duties of the attorneys general in our States \nare very important powers and duties. Those are in those cases powers \nand duties that result from elections of the people of their States who \nelected individuals to serve in the capacity of attorney general.\n  In the context where we are limiting the ability for class actions to \nbe brought under S. 5, that ability of the attorneys general to protect \nvulnerable consumers is all the more important. It is important for us \nto make sure as this legislation is being considered that we all \nunderstand it is going to have no impact on the powers and duties of \nthe attorneys general.\n\n[[Page S1163]]\n\n  The letter that came in from our 46 of our former colleagues, \ninterestingly, is an accumulation of almost all of the attorneys \ngeneral from around the country. It includes Democrats and Republicans \nalike. It includes Republicans such as my successor, John Suthers, from \nthe State of Colorado, and Democrats such as Tom Miller from the State \nof Iowa. I think their letter and Senator Pryor's amendment with \nrespect to some of those are indeed just an effort to make sure the \nlegislative intent that has been talked about here would impact the \nlegislation; that is, that this legislation, S. 5, is not going to have \nany diminishing effect whatsoever on the powers and duties of the \nattorneys general to proceed forward under the laws of their States, \nboth constitutionally and also consumer protection laws.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have been working on this legislation \nfor five Congresses, and I would like to get this legislation to the \nPresident without any amendments. We have heard from the highest levels \nof the House of Representatives that if we can pass this bill without \namendments, we will be able to get it to the President without going to \nconference; in other words, the House will adopt it the way we do.\n  I don't know how many times I would like to have heard that in the \nHouse of Representatives. I don't know when I have ever heard that in \nmy entire career. I hope everybody in the Senate has a strong heart. If \nI didn't have a strong heart, I wouldn't say that. And if I heard it, I \nwouldn't believe it. I would pass out if the House was going to take \nsomething the Senate did without question. We ought to grab the ball \nand run with it.\n  Regardless of the merits of the amendment by the Senator from \nArkansas, I hope we can defeat that amendment. This amendment would \nexclude this language from the bill: ``Any action brought by or on \nbehalf of the Attorney General of any State.''\n\n  I ask my colleagues not to be fooled. Although this amendment sounds \ngood, and there was a good presentation made by the authors of the \namendment, it is potentially harmful and could lead to gaming by class \naction lawyers. I will explain what I mean by gaming.\n  First, before I do that, in my judgment, the amendment is not \nnecessary. I will explain. State attorneys general have authority under \nthe laws of every State to bring enforcement action to protect their \ncitizens. Sometimes these laws are parens patriae cases, similar to \nclass actions in the sense that the State attorney general represents \nthe people of that State. In other instances, their actions are brought \ndirectly on behalf of that particular State. But they are not class \nactions; rather, they are very unique attorney general lawsuits \nauthorized under State constitutions or under statutes.\n  One reason this amendment is not necessary is because our bill will \nnot affect those lawsuits. Our bill provides class actions under that \nterm ``class action'' as defined to mean any civil action filed in a \ndistrict court of the United States under rule 23 of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure or any civil action removed to a district court that \nwas originally filed under State statute or rule authorizing an action \nto be brought by one or more representatives as a class action.\n  The key phrase there is ``class action.'' Hence, because almost all \ncivil suits brought by State attorneys general are parens patriae \nsuits, similar representative suits or direct enforcement actions, it \nis clear they do not fall within this definition. That means that cases \nbrought by State attorneys general will not be affected by this bill.\n  The supporters of this amendment say it is necessary because State \nattorneys general can bring class actions and those cases might become \nremovable to Federal court. That possibility does not make this \namendment necessary. That is because State attorneys general are not \nrequired to use class actions to enforce their State laws. If State \nattorneys general want to recover on behalf of their citizens, they can \nalways bring actions as parens patriae suits under statutes that \nauthorize representative actions or even as direct enforcement actions. \nAgain, such lawsuits will not be subject to this bill.\n  In addition, our bill has been drafted so as to distinguish between \nsolely truly local class action lawsuits and those that involve \nnational issues. That compromise, which was not part of my original \nbill, was reached with Senator Feinstein on the home State exception \nprovision as well as further compromises made with Senators Dodd, \nSchumer, and Landrieu, dealing with the local controversy exception. As \na result of these compromises, they will keep then truly local cases \nwhere they ought to be--in State court.\n  Another concern with this amendment is that it is worded in such a \nway to exclude class actions, not just by State attorneys general but \nalso, in their words, on behalf of State attorneys general. The way \nthis provision is drafted would allow plaintiffs' lawyers to bring \nclass actions and simply include in their complaint a State attorney \ngeneral's name as a purported class member, arguably to make their \nclass action completely immune to the provisions of this bill. \nPlaintiffs' lawyers could simply ask State attorneys general to lend \ntheir name to a class action lawsuit so as to keep them in the State \ncourt.\n  That creates a very serious loophole in this bill. We should not risk \ncreating a situation where State attorneys general can be used as pawns \nso that crafty class action lawyers can avoid the jurisdictional \nprovisions of this bill. Our bill would put an end to class action \nabuses without diminishing the ability of State attorneys general to \nprotect their citizens in State court. This is another way for lawyers \nto keep cases in State courts.\n  This is what this bill is all about, to make sure that cases that \nhave national significance are not determined by some county judge in \none of our 50 States that end up having national implications. Those \ncases should be in Federal court and, for the most part, under our \nlegislation will be.\n  This amendment would seriously create a loophole in the reforms we \nare trying to accomplish with this bill. I urge my colleagues to join \nme in opposing this amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by my colleague from Arkansas. At best, this amendment is \nunnecessary. At worst, it will create a loophole that some enterprising \nplaintiffs' lawyers will surely manipulate in order to keep their \nlucrative class action lawsuits in State court.\n  Before I go into more details about the problems with the amendment, \nI would like to point out that the National Association of Attorneys \nGeneral does not endorse this measure, nor has it pushed for its \ninclusion in the class action bill. One would expect that if the \ncurrent bill somehow impairs the ability of State attorneys general to \nbring lawsuits on behalf of their citizens, we would have a position \nfrom them by now. But we do not, and the association's silence speaks \nvolumes about the merits of this amendment.\n  Let me first note that this amendment, which excludes from the scope \nof this legislation any ``civil action brought by or on behalf of, the \nAttorney General of any State,'' is unnecessary. Let me explain why.\n  State attorneys general have authority under the laws of every State \nin this country to bring enforcement actions to protect their citizens. \nThese suits, known commonly as parens patriae cases, are similar to \nclass actions to the extent that the attorney general represents a \nlarge group of people.\n  But let me be perfectly clear that they are not class actions.\n  There is no certification process, there are no representative class \nmembers named in the complaint, and plaintiffs' attorneys who stand to \ngain millions of dollars in fees. Rather, they are unique lawsuits \nauthorized under State constitutions or State statutes that are brought \non behalf of the citizenry of a particular State. These actions are \nbrought typically in consumer protection matters under State law and \nusually involve local disputes. As such, S. 5 in no way affects these \nlawsuits.\n  To underscore, I direct my colleagues to section 1711(2) of the bill \nwhich explicitly defines a ``class action'' to mean any civil action \nfiled in a district court of the United States under rule\n\n[[Page S1164]]\n\n23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or any civil action that is \nremoved to a district court of the United States that was originally \nfiled under a State or rule of judicial procedure authorizing an action \nto be brought by one or more representatives as a class action.\n  This statutory definition makes it perfectly clear that the bill \napplies only to class actions, and not parens patriae actions. Class \nactions being those lawsuits filed in Federal district court under rule \n23 of the Federal rules of civil procedure or lawsuits brought in State \ncourt as a class action. Neither of these conditions are met when \ncompared to the nature of a parens patriae action, and consequently, \nare excluded from the reach of this bill.\n  What I think the proponents of this amendment are really concerned \nabout is the impact of this bill on State attorneys general if they \nchoose to pursue an action other than a parens patriae action. But this \npossibility does not make this amendment necessary.\n  First, attorneys general are not required to use class actions to \nenforce their State laws and protect their citizens. To the contrary, \ntheir main weapon has been, and continues to be, the parens patriae \naction authorized under State statute.\n  Second, this legislation has been carefully crafted to distinguish \nbetween truly local suits and those that involve national issues. Thus, \nif an attorney general brings a class action, and that class action \ninvolves matters of truly local concern, it will certainly fall under \none of the bill's exceptions. On the other hand, if the lawsuit is \naimed at an out-of-State corporation for conduct that affects citizens \nin multiple States, or if the lawsuit is interstate in nature, then \nthat suit should be removed to Federal court. Removal of such a case is \nparticularly appropriate because there would likely be similar suits \nbrought in a number of courts, and one of the central purposes of this \nlegislation is to promote judicial efficiency and fairness by allowing \ncopy-cat class actions to be coordinated in one Federal proceeding.\n  As I noted earlier, this amendment is not only unnecessary, it \nactually creates opportunities for gaming. If this legislation enables \nState attorneys general to keep all class actions in State court, it \nwill not take long for plaintiffs' lawyers to figure out that all they \nneed to do to avoid the impact of S. 5 is to persuade a State attorney \ngeneral to simply lend the name of his or her office to a private class \naction. In other words, plaintiffs' lawyers will try to keep interstate \nclass actions in State court by simply naming that State's attorney \ngeneral at the end of complaint as a cocounsel or of-counsel. \nUndoubtedly, we will see arguments that if an attorney general merely \nsends in a letter saying that he/she is sympathetic 10 the action, the \nlawsuit will be exempt from the bill's provisions. I think this is the \nvery type of forum shopping that S. 5 is supposed to eliminate and we \nshould not be encouraging it now.\n  Indeed, to give the potential gaming some real life perspective, I \ndirect your attention, Mr. President, to an article from the Boston \nGlobe which reports that the Massachusetts attorney general had made \narrangements with private plaintiffs' attorneys to prosecute a \nconsumer-oriented class action against the drug store chain Walgreens. \nUnder the arrangement, the plaintiffs lawyers pocketed hefty fees while \nthe state AG's office received a portion of the settlement money.\n  But the article reports that this privatization arrangement has drawn \ncriticism because the settlement did very little to benefit consumers. \nThe article reports that too little of the settlement money actually \nwent to consumers, but rather to groups such as Public Citizen, the \nAmerican Lung Association, and Massachusetts Bar Association. Perhaps \nmore troubling about the article is the alleged campaign contribution \nties between the private attorneys who prosecuted these cases and the \nState attorney general office.\n  Given the close ties between this State AG and private attorneys, I \nfind that this amendment will only encourage these types of \narrangements in the future that do not benefit consumers.\n  We do not want to risk creating a situation in which State attorneys \ngeneral can be used as pawns so that class action lawyers can remain in \none of their magic jurisdictions and avoid the import of this bill. S. \n5 would put an end to class action reform without diminishing in any \nway the ability of State attorneys general to discharge their duty to \nprotect their citizens--and to do so in State court. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I thank my colleagues for their attention to this \namendment. I am encouraged in one way because I know they have spent \ntime with the amendment and studied it, analyzed it. What encourages me \nis all four who spoke against this--in fact, every Senator who spoke \nagainst the amendment--have said that this bill as currently drafted \nwill not alter or limit the existing rights of any State attorney \ngeneral. That is very good news.\n  I don't agree with that interpretation. In fact, there are 46 \nattorneys general, Democrats and Republicans from all over the country, \nwho have written a letter saying they do not agree, or at least they \nhave concern with that interpretation.\n  I hope when this law, if it passes, S. 5, is challenged, and it will \nbe at some point or be litigated at some point, and a State attorney \ngeneral tries to pursue some sort of action and there is a challenge \nsaying the State cannot do it, I hope the courts will recognize the \nlegislative history we developed today. The intention of this Senate \nand the conference is not to limit any existing rights or any existing \nabilities of the State attorneys general in pursuing cases they may \ndeem appropriate to pursue.\n  In addition, a number of the opponents, maybe all, have focused on \nsome language in the bill. We need to clarify that language so when we \nvote on this we will be able to vote from an informed position. The \nlanguage is ``but does not include any civil action brought by or on \nbehalf of any Attorney General.''\n  Chairman Grassley and others have pointed to that language and \nindicated they have some concern with that. I respect that concern.\n  Let me flesh that out, if I may. In virtually every State, and \nprobably every State, the work of the attorney general's office is too \nlarge for one person to do. In other words, the AG himself or herself \ncannot sign every pleading, cannot attend every hearing, cannot \nparticipate in everything. They cannot do it. There are not enough \nhours in the day and the workload is too heavy. Again, I think every \nState law does this routinely. I don't know of any exception. What that \nmeans is every attorney general in America has an assistant attorney \ngeneral or deputy attorney general or some other titled person in their \noffice who every single day routinely does things on behalf of the \nattorney general. It has to be that way.\n\n  Under the laws of the States, the attorney general is the one who is \nultimately responsible. When a pleading is signed, that signatory--\nwhichever deputy or assistant or attorney general it may be--that \nperson is binding the State's attorney general to certain things in the \npleadings.\n  The attorney general is the officer of the court. The attorney \ngeneral has ethical responsibilities and ethical duties. I would argue \nthat these ethical duties are above and beyond what is in the private \npractice of law because that lawyer, as the attorney general, is \nrepresenting the State he or she was elected or selected to represent. \nAlso, some are concerned that the phrase ``or on behalf of'' may mean \nthat a private sector law firm could be retained by the State to pursue \na matter. That is true. That is existing law today. And everybody has \nsaid the intention of S. 5 is not to limit or alter or change any \nauthority of the States' attorneys general.\n  So all that is true. However, in every State I am aware of--I cannot \npromise this is true in every State, but in every State I am familiar \nwith, there is a process which States' attorneys general have to go \nthrough in order to hire outside counsel. I think if we spent 30 \nminutes looking at various States and the needs of various States, \nprobably 100 percent of the people in the Senate would understand that \nthere may be cases where it might be appropriate to hire outside \ncounsel under certain circumstances.\n\n[[Page S1165]]\n\n  But there is a process. For example, in Arkansas, we had to go to the \nState legislature. We had to go to the State legislative committee and \nget approval to hire outside counsel. We also had to have the Governor \nsign off on the approval. So we had both the legislative and the \nexecutive branch signing off on that decision. Again, I cannot promise \nevery State has that same process, but every one I am familiar with has \nsome sort of process they go through and do that.\n  The United States is a union of States. We should not think of these \nattorneys general as attorneys. I tried to make this point several \ntimes. They are different than private practice attorneys. These \nattorneys represent the State. They are the mouthpiece for the State. \nThey do the will of the legislature of the State in all of its various \ncapacities.\n  Mr. President, may I ask how much time I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). Fifteen seconds.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, after the 15 seconds, what will happen? Can \nI ask unanimous consent to extend it for another, say, 10 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  But the only point I was going to make on that is, we are a union of \nStates. We should always see the States' attorneys general as being a \nlittle different than private sector lawyers. There is nothing wrong \nwith private sector lawyers. Like I said many times during the course \nof this debate on this amendment, they are doing their job. They are \nrepresenting their clients, and that is great and fantastic. That is \nthe way the system works. But the State's attorney general does more. \nThe State's attorney general has more responsibility. When they speak, \nthey speak on behalf of the State. It is kind of like us being here in \nWashington. Certainly we are everyday citizens like everybody else, but \nwe are elected to come here and represent our States in this great \nbody.\n\n  So I will ask my colleagues to try to see States' attorneys general \nin a different light, in a materially different light, not a slightly \ndifferent light but in a materially, substantially different light than \nyou see your ordinary attorneys in private practice.\n  Like I said, some say this amendment is unnecessary because it honors \nthe integrity of the bill. I like that in terms of legislative history. \nBut I also say the counterargument there is: If it is unnecessary and \nif it does not change the impact of the bill, why not vote on it and \nallow the amendment to make sure we are all protecting the ability of \nour States to pursue litigation in the way they have always been able \nto do that.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the time of 12:15 having arrived, we are \nset for the vote. I move to table the Pryor amendment No. 5, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To clarify the application of State law in certain class \n                    actions, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 24, before line 22, insert the following:\n       (c) Choice of State Law in Interstate Class Actions.--\n     Notwithstanding any other choice of law rule, in any class \n     action, over which the district courts have jurisdiction, \n     asserting claims arising under State law concerning products \n     or services marketed, sold, or provided in more than 1 State \n     on behalf of a proposed class, which includes citizens of \n     more than 1 such State, as to each such claim and any defense \n     to such claim--\n       (1) the district court shall not deny class certification, \n     in whole or in part, on the ground that the law of more than \n     1 State will be applied;\n       (2) the district court shall require each party to submit \n     their recommendations for subclassifications among the \n     plaintiff class based on substantially similar State law; and\n       (3) the district court shall--\n       (A) issue subclassifications, as determined necessary, to \n     permit the action to proceed; or\n       (B) if the district court determines such \n     subclassifications are an impracticable method of managing \n     the action, the district court shall attempt to ensure that \n     plaintiffs' State laws are applied to the extent practical.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, what I would like to do is say a few \nwords on behalf of this amendment which is submitted on behalf of both \nSenator Bingaman, who will be on the floor shortly to speak on it, and \nmyself.\n  As the legislation has been debated, Senator Bingaman has raised, I \nthink, a reasonable, valid, and a real concern about whether certain \nnational class action cases may be caught in a catch-22 when they were \nprohibited from having their cases heard either in State or Federal \ncourt, leaving the case to reside in oblivion.\n  This problem was best described by the Bruce Bromley Harvard Law \nProfessor Arthur Miller in a letter he sent to Senator Bingaman. It is \na lengthy letter, but I will read one part:\n\n       Under current doctrines, federal courts hearing state law-\n     based claims, must use the ``choice-of-law'' rule of the \n     State in which the federal district court sits. These \n     procedural rules vary among states, but many provide that the \n     federal court should apply the substantive law of a home \n     state of a plaintiff, or the law of the state where the harm \n     occurred. In a nationwide consumer class action, such a rule \n     would lead the court to apply to each class member's claim \n     the law of the state in which the class member lives or lived \n     at the time the harm occurred. As noted, most federal courts \n     will not grant class certification in these situations \n     because they find the cases would be ``unmanageable.''\n\n  That is the catch-22. You send a consumer class action to Federal \ncourt, the judge says it is unmanageable, will not certify it, the case \ncannot go back to State court and it sits in oblivion. Senator Bingaman \nand I have worked to address this problem. I believe we have.\n  The original solution proposed by Senator Bingaman was a bit too \nbroad because it could impact consumers in States with strong consumer \nprotection laws such as my State of California. What we tried to do, \nand did, was develop a compromise amendment that provides Federal \njudges with guidance on how to proceed in these cases, while leaving \nthe judges with the discretion they need to manage their court dockets.\n  This ensures that national class actions will be heard. They will be \ncertified and claimants in those cases will be more likely to receive \nthe benefit of his or her own State's law.\n\n  Let me quickly go over the amendment. The amendment basically \nprovides that:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other so-called choice of law rule \n     [which is what is involved here] in any class action over \n     which the district courts have jurisdiction, asserting claims \n     arising under State law concerning products or services \n     marketed, sold, or provided in more than 1 State on behalf of \n     a proposed class, which includes citizens of more than 1 such \n     State, as to each such claim and any defense to such claim--\n\n  Here is the amendment:\n\n       (1) the district court shall not deny class certification, \n     in whole or in part, on the ground that the law of more than \n     one State will be applied.\n\n  That solves the problem of the kind of unanswered question in this \nbill, Can a class action remain uncertified? The answer is, clearly, \nno.\n\n       (2) the district court shall require each party to submit \n     their recommendations for subclassifications among the \n     plaintiff class based on substantially similar State law; and\n       (3) the district court shall--\n       (A) issue subclassifications, as determined necessary, to \n     permit the action to proceed; or\n       (B) if the district court determines such \n     subclassifications are an impracticable method of managing \n     the action, the district court shall attempt to ensure that \n     plaintiffs' State laws are applied to the extent practical.\n\n  This provides guidance to the judge. Secondly, it requires these \ncases receive certification in the district court.\n  We believe this is a good solution. It is a significant solution. I \nhope this Senate will accept that.\n  Let me say something about this bill as a supporter of a class action \nbill. This bill is not perfect. It represents the best that can be done \nto solve what is a real problem in our legal system. I have tried to \nspend a good deal of time on this issue through Judiciary Committee \nhearings, personal hearings with both sides, and research and analysis.\n  As I said in the Judiciary Committee when we marked up the bill, I \nhad a kind of epiphany in one of the hearings a few years ago when a \nwoman named Hilda Bankston testified before our committee. She was the \nowner of a small pharmacy, with her late husband, in Mississippi. The \nBankstons were sued more than 100 times for doing nothing other than \nfilling legal prescriptions. The pharmacy had done nothing wrong, but \nthey were the only drugstore in the county, a county that was so \nplaintiff friendly that there are actually more plaintiffs than \nresidents. So she, in effect, became a person to sue in that county to \nenable the forum shopping process to take place.\n  I will read a letter from her because it is indicative. Let me say \nthis: This bill is not anti-class action as some would have Members \nbelieve. This bill tries to fix a broken part of class action which is \nthe ability to venue or forum shop and to make that much more \ndifficult. The Bankston case is a reason for doing that. So many people \nsuch as Hilda Bankston, innocent people who have done nothing wrong, \nget caught up in how these class actions are put together.\n  Let me quickly read what she told us in committee:\n\n\n[[Page S1167]]\n\n\n       For 30 years, my husband, Navy Seaman Fourth Class Mitchell \n     Bankston, and I lived our dream, owning and operating \n     Bankston Drugstore in Fayette, MS. We worked hard and my \n     husband built a solid reputation as a caring, honest \n     pharmacist . . .\n       Three weeks after being named in the [first] lawsuit, \n     Mitch, who was 58 years old and in good health, died suddenly \n     of a massive heart attack . . .\n       I sold the pharmacy in 2000, but have spent many years \n     since retrieving records for plaintiffs and getting dragged \n     into court again and again to testify in hundreds of national \n     lawsuits brought in Jefferson County against the pharmacy and \n     out-of-state manufacturers of other drugs . . . I had to hire \n     personnel to watch the store while I was dragged into court \n     on numerous occasions to testify.\n       I endured the whispers and questions of my customers and \n     neighbors wondering what we did to end up in court so often. \n     And, I spent many sleepless nights wondering if my business \n     would survive the tidal wave of lawsuits cresting over it . . \n     .\n       This lawsuit frenzy has hurt my family and my community. \n     Businesses will no longer locate in Jefferson County because \n     of fear of litigation. The county's reputation has driven \n     liability insurance rates through the roof.\n       No small business should have to endure the nightmares I \n     have experienced.\n\n  This amended Class Action Fairness Act goes a long way toward \nstopping forum shopping by allowing Federal courts to hear truly \nnational class action lawsuits. The Constitution itself states that the \nFederal judicial power ``shall extend . . . to controversies between \ncitizens of different States.''\n  Yet an anomaly in our current law has resulted in a disparity wherein \nclass actions are treated differently than regular cases and often stay \nin State court. The current rules of procedure have not kept up with \nthe times. The result is a broken system that has strayed far from the \nFramers' intent.\n  I believe this bill is a well-thought-out, reasoned and an easily \nread bill. I have actually read it three times--as solution to this \nproblem it does a number of things.\n  First, the bill contains a consumer class action bill of rights to \nprovide greater information and greater oversight of settlements that \nmight unfairly benefit attorneys at the expense of truly injured \nparties.\n  For instance, the bill ensures that judges review the fairness of \nproposed settlements if those settlements provide only coupons to the \nplaintiffs. It bans settlements that actually impose net costs on class \nmembers. It requires that all settlements be written in plain English \nso all class members can understand their rights. And it provides that \nState attorneys general can review settlements involving plaintiffs.\n  All these things are important guarantees for the plaintiff, for the \nindividual, for the aggrieved party. I believe it makes the class \naction procedure much sounder for the consumer.\n  Secondly, the legislation creates a new set of rules for when a class \naction may be so-called removed to Federal court. These diversity \nrequirements were modified in committee and again since then to make it \nclear that cases that are truly national in scope should be removed to \nFederal court. But equally important, the rules preserve truly State \nactions so that those confined to one State remain in State courts.\n  Now, the original bill that came to the Judiciary Committee said all \nclass actions where a substantial majority of the members of the class \nand the defendants are citizens of the State would be moved to Federal \ncourt. We changed this. I actually offered an amendment in committee \nthat changed this definition to split the jurisdiction into thirds. Now \nthere is less ambiguity about where a case will end up, and more cases \nwill actually remain in State court.\n  I think that is important to stress: more cases will actually remain \nin State court. This is an important compromise.\n  If more than two-thirds of the plaintiffs are from the same State as \nthe primary defendant, the case automatically stays in State court.\n  If fewer than one-third of the plaintiffs are from the same State as \nthe primary defendant, the case may automatically be removed to Federal \ncourt. Remember, this happens only if one of the parties asks for \nremoval. Otherwise, these cases, too, remain in State court.\n  In the middle third of the cases, where between one-third and two-\nthirds of the plaintiffs are from the same State as the primary \ndefendant, the amendment would give the Federal judge discretion to \naccept removal or remand the case back to the State based on a number \nof factors which are defined in the bill.\n  I would hope Members would take the time to read the bill. I think it \nis an important bill. I think to a great extent it has been maligned in \nthat people have chosen to interpret it as anti-class action. I think \nif those of us--and it is interesting that some of us on this bill are \nnot attorneys; Senator Grassley, Senator Kohl, certainly myself from \nthe Judiciary Committee--I think if you are not an attorney, you can \nlook at the forest and not really get caught up in some of the process \ntrees of that forest, and you can make an assessment whether the forest \nwell serves class action cases.\n  I think these changes, and particularly the diversity requirement \nchanges, make this a much sounder way to make a decision as to whether \na class action should remain in State court or is truly national in \nscope and, therefore, should be heard by the Federal court.\n  I commend to this body the consumer bill of rights. It is very clear \nin reading the bill that protections are given for coupons. There is \nreview for settlements. The consumer is taken very seriously. I think \nthe system is improved.\n\n  Now, let me speak just for a moment to this business: Well, you have \nto take the bill as is or forget it, there is not going to be a bill. \nThere is an arrangement with the House to take the bill if it is \nexactly as is.\n  Well, in many complicated issues, there are dilemmas or problems or \nissues or corrections that need to be made which appear as the \nlegislative process takes place. And that is what has happened with \nthis bill. In certain areas of concern, where the law may be silent, \nand case law may be conflicting, I think it is important to clarify the \nlaw. That is what the Feinstein-Bingaman amendment does. There is a \nhole there. The issue is governed by old case law. What we do is, in \nessence, codify that so we make clear the discretion that the judge \nhas.\n  Most importantly, we make clear that a bona fide class action going \nto Federal court is not going to fall into oblivion because a judge is \ngoing to say, Oh, my goodness, there are so many State laws at issue \nhere I can't possibly manage the case, and, therefore, that judge does \nnothing and the case goes nowhere.\n  So I think we have worked out a good solution. I know Senator \nBingaman was here on the Senate floor. I would say to the Senator from \nPennsylvania, I know he is desirous of saying a few words. So perhaps \nif his staff is listening, they will urge him to come to the floor. \nOtherwise, Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I thank the chairman.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for \nSenator Feinstein's amendment. The amendment will provide courts with \nguidance as to how to manage large multistate class actions in Federal \ncourt. This amendment addresses a flaw in the underlying legislation \nthat, if left uncorrected, could leave many properly filed multistate \nconsumer class actions without a forum in which those cases could be \nheard.\n  I had prepared an amendment that would have reaffirmed the \ndiscretionary authority of a judge to select the law of one State, as \nis currently permissible under the Constitution, and reaffirm the right \nof the judge to do that instead of denying certification for large \nmultistate consumer class actions. There were some concerns raised by \nmy colleagues, and I have agreed to withhold that amendment and lend my \nsupport to the Feinstein compromise approach. I believe the Feinstein \ncompromise will accomplish what I intended to address in my amendment; \nthat is, to make sure injured consumers have their day in court.\n\n[[Page S1168]]\n\n  By amending the diversity jurisdiction rules, the Class Action \nFairness Act of 2005 will give almost exclusive jurisdiction to the \nFederal courts to hear class action cases. The proponents of the \nlegislation argue that such changes are necessary due to abuses that \nare occurring in a handful of State courts. Although the bill makes \nchanges to other aspects of class action litigation, such as coupon \nsettlements, this procedural removal of cases from State court to \nFederal court should be the focus of our scrutiny. This goes to the \ncore of the 10th amendment of the Constitution that preserves the right \nof a State to protect its citizens. While this shift may be necessary \nin certain cases, it should not be taken lightly, as we will be taking \naway the ability of States to hear cases involving injuries to their \ncitizens that are in violation of the State law. This is clearly a \nfundamental change in jurisprudence.\n  Class action suits have long provided a means for individuals to band \ntogether to seek a remedy when they have collectively been damaged in a \nmanner that is significant but would not be economical to advance on \ntheir own. These actions empower those citizens who would be left \nwithout redress, absent the collective effort of others. This system \nhas provided a necessary balance to a system weighted toward those with \nthe means to defend their actions in court. The suits also take much of \nthe pressure off of a State attorney general. The State attorneys \ngeneral are not able to investigate and seek remedies for all the \ncitizens who have been damaged or hurt by business in and outside of a \nState. Class actions reduce the need for overly burdensome regulations \nand laws that would be necessary if it were to be forced to limit the \ndiscretion given to businesses to operate in a responsible manner.\n  Finally, class action litigation protects our citizens from future \ninjuries by putting an end to certain acts of corporate malfeasance and \nnegligence. Although there have been abuses on occasion, the benefits \nof class action litigation should be evident. Under current law, an \nindividual has the right to participate in a class when a number of \npeople have been injured in a similar fashion by the same defendant. \nOnce the class has been created, if the injury is based on a violation \nof State law--and many are, as there are really no general consumer \nprotection laws--the class representative generally has the option of \nfiling either in State court or Federal court. In this respect, a class \naction is similar to any action that is filed in court; that is, the \nplaintiff is the master of his or her claims.\n\n  The proponents of this legislation have argued that the basic goal of \nthe legislation is to move these large class actions to Federal court. \nFor instance, Stanton D. Anderson, executive vice president and chief \nlegal counsel for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, wrote in the \nPhiladelphia Inquirer, dated February 27, 2004, that:\n\n       [t]he Class Action Fairness Act would simply allow federal \n     courts to more easily hear large, national class action \n     lawsuits affecting consumers all over the country.\n\n  Similarly, in testimony before the Judiciary Committee on July 31, \n2002, Walter Dellinger stated:\n\n       [t]he principal purpose and effect of the [class action] \n     bill is undeniably modest: it merely adjusts the rules of \n     diversity jurisdiction so that certain large multi-party \n     cases--those with true nationwide compass, affecting many or \n     even all states at once--will be litigated in the federal \n     courts rather than in the courts of just one state (or \n     county) or another.\n\n  Suffice it to say, the new Federal diversity statute for purposes of \nclass action will accomplish this as very few, if any, cases will meet \nthe standards necessary to remain in State court. The operative \nquestion is, then, What will happen to these cases once they are in the \nFederal court system? If we look at the past decade or so, we note an \ninteresting pattern. Although some State courts have certified these \nlarge multistate class actions, the Federal courts have not. In fact, \nsix U.S. circuit courts of appeal--the Third Circuit, the Fifth \nCircuit, the Sixth Circuit, the Seventh Circuit, the Ninth Circuit, and \nthe Eleventh Circuit--and at least 26 Federal district courts have \ndenied class certification in multistate consumer class actions. Except \nfor a 1986 Third Circuit decision which has since been narrowed to only \nits facts, no U.S. circuit court of appeals has granted class \ncertification in such a case. At the same time, at least seven \ndifferent States have certified large multistate consumer class \nactions.\n  Under rule 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, an \naction ``may be maintained as a class action if the court finds that \nthe questions of law or fact common to the members of the class \npredominate over any questions affecting only individual members.''\n  Because class action lawsuits involving fraud and deceptive sales \npractices or sales of defective products allege violations of State \nconsumer protection statutes or common law, there is always a \npossibility that the laws to be applied will be different. If a court \ndetermines that they must apply the laws of different States to \ndifferent members of a class action, they often find that questions of \nlaw common to the members of a class do not predominate. That renders \nthe adjudication of the case as a class action unmanageable, and they \ndeny class certification. This denial is effectively the end of the \naction. It is not hard to understand why State courts are the forum of \nchoice for these large class actions.\n  The proponents of this legislation are aware that Federal courts do \nnot certify these large class actions. In fact, in most cases, they \nargue this very point in court.\n  For example, in re Simon, the second litigation, which was before the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the Chamber of Commerce \nopined:\n\n       . . . it is nearly a truism that nationwide class actions \n     in which the claims are subject to varying State laws cannot \n     be certified because they are simply unmanageable.\n\n  Obviously, these arguments have been persuasive before the Federal \ncourts. In re the Ford Motor Company ignition switch products liability \nlitigation that was in the U.S. District Court for New Jersey, that \ncourt stated:\n\n       [P]laintiffs' first cause of action contends that Ford \n     breached an implied warranty of merchantability under each of \n     the many States' laws that govern this action. Variations \n     among these States' laws, however, preclude classwide \n     adjudication of plaintiffs' claims.\n\n  This case involved a defective ignition switch that caused it to \nfail. It has been claimed that this failure may have resulted in as \nmany as 11 deaths and 31 injuries, not to mention almost a billion \ndollars spent by consumers to replace the defective product. The case \nwas ultimately settled, but it was only settled after a State court in \nCalifornia agreed to certify a class.\n  Senator Feinstein's amendment makes sure that by moving these cases \nto Federal court, we are not pushing them into a forum that will fail \nto hear those cases because too many State laws apply.\n  The amendment requires the parties to submit plans as to how the case \ncould be managed by dividing it into subclasses based on the similarity \nof the State laws that would need to be applied. The judge would then \nhave the discretion to divide the class into subclasses or use some \nother manner that ensures that the plaintiffs' State laws are applied.\n  Under the Feinstein amendment, the Federal court is not required to \ndivide the class into subclasses; it is simply discretionary. It can \nstill follow the State's choice of law rules, or use any other means \npermissible to ensure that the plaintiffs' State laws are applied to \nthe extent practicable.\n  If we are going to take away the right of State judges to hear a \nclass action, it is incumbent upon us to make sure the Federal judge is \nnot able to not certify the class because too many State laws would \napply. That would be an unfair result.\n  I have heard many Members argue that a deal is a deal; therefore, \nMembers who support the bill, including those who were able to get \nchanges made to the bill before it was brought to the floor, should be \nprecluded from supporting any amendment, including this amendment. I \nremind my colleagues that although this legislation has been around for \nyears, there has not been a single amendment to improve this \nlegislation that has been voted on on the floor of the Senate prior to \nthis week.\n  The stated intention of the proponents of this bill is to avoid \nconference with the House and to have that Chamber pass the bill \nexactly the way it passes the Senate. While they argue this is a reason \nto not support\n\n[[Page S1169]]\n\namendments, I would argue the opposite. Because we know this is the \nonly opportunity for any Member of Congress to amend this legislation, \nit is imperative that we remain openminded to the few amendments that \nare going to be offered and debated on the bill.\n  In the 22 years I have been in the Senate, I do not recall a single \npiece of legislation that could not have benefited from input from all \ninterested Members of the Senate. The Founding Fathers of our country \ncreated a legislative branch that is intentionally deliberative and \nsubject to the repetitive processes of debate and amendment.\n  I remind my colleagues of the language included in last year's \nnonamendable Omnibus appropriations bill that would have allowed staff \nfrom the appropriations committees to review taxpayers' tax return \ninformation. That one provision almost derailed the entire spending \nbill for our country. Clearly, if Members had been presented with an \nopportunity to review the bill on the floor, to amend that bill, we \ncould have avoided that problem.\n  As elected officials, we have a responsibility to the public to do \nour best to improve legislation before it becomes law, which I believe \nargues for Members to consider each amendment with an open mind. If my \ncolleagues disagree with this amendment, then I encourage them to vote \nagainst it. However, if they agree with me that this catch-22, which is \nin the current bill, should be corrected, then I hope they will vote \nfor this Feinstein amendment, regardless of whether you previously \nstated support for the overall bill.\n  I would like to acknowledge and thank the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Specter, for his support of my amendment and what I \nunderstand to be his support of the Feinstein amendment. No one could \ndebate the chairman's dedication to getting this bill passed. Yet he \nagrees that the legislation would be improved by correcting the problem \nwe have identified.\n  Substantively, one of the arguments that was raised by proponents of \nthe bill is that courts have been certifying classes in these large \nmultistate class actions, even though all of the circuits I mentioned \nbefore in numerous district courts have denied certification on the \nground that the case is unmanageable. The cases enlisted by proponents \nof the bill in defense of their claim that cases have been certified \nare cases involving a Federal question or certifications of a class for \npurposes of settlement. These types of certifications are entirely \ndifferent than the cases we are referring to; that is, cases involving \nviolations of State law for purposes of a trial. The only way these \ncases are going to get to the settlement phase is if there is the \npossibility that a case could be taken to trial, if necessary. It is an \nimportant distinction.\n  Again, I point to this in re Simon II litigation where the Chamber of \nCommerce argued against certification, stating that it is nearly a \ntruism that nationwide class actions in which the claims are subject to \nvarying State laws cannot be certified because they are simply \nunmanageable.\n  As I mentioned before, this is not just an abstract situation. There \nare over 300,000 homeowners in Mississippi, Louisiana, Florida, and \nTexas who have been compensated for defective siding they had purchased \nfor their houses. When this case was brought before the Federal court, \nit was not certified, in part because the court could not ``imagine \nmanaging a trial under the law of 51 jurisdictions on the defectiveness \nof masonite siding.'' Because an Alabama State court agreed to certify \nthe case for trial, the case was settled, and these homeowners \nwere compensated for their damages.\n\n  Proponents of the legislation also argue that a class denied \ncertification would be free to refile its cases in either State or \nFederal court. Based on the underlying legislation, the State court \ncases, almost without exception, would be removed again to the Federal \ncourt, and once in Federal court, the case would be sent to the same \nFederal court that failed to certify the class in the first place due \nto the procedure for consolidation and the operation of the \nmultidistrict litigation panel.\n  This MDL, multidistrict litigation panel, streamlines large, unwieldy \nmultidistrict litigation involving the same parties and the same facts \nwhen those cases are filed in Federal courts. This panel of seven \njudges appointed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court determines \nwhich cases pending in Federal court should be transferred to a single \ndistrict court for purposes of hearing and ruling on pretrial matters, \nincluding the matter of class certification.\n  The proceedings can be initiated by the MDL panel or by any party \ninvolved in one of the actions pending in a district court. All cases \nof a similar nature in Federal court, including those filed after the \nconsolidation, are affected and subject to being transferred. Once a \ntransferee court has been selected, it rules on all pretrial motions, \nincluding class certification, but will send the cases back to the \ntransferor courts for trial, assuming that the case has not settled or \nbeen dismissed. All future cases involving similar claims and similar \nparties are automatically sent back to the same transferee court for \nany future actions.\n\n  Class actions by their very nature are large cases and they are \naffected by the ability of the MDL panel to consolidate, as there are \ngenerally different cases pending in district courts throughout the \ncountry. Under current law, a class based on claims of State law \nviolations can avoid this consolidation by remaining in State court, \nbut this will no longer be the case after this bill becomes law. \nInstead, plaintiffs who go through the consolidation process and are \nnot certified will not refile these cases since they would ultimately \nbe back before the same judge who failed to certify the class in the \nfirst place.\n  Finally, the proponents of the bill have argued that taking away the \nright of a judge to deny certification based on too many States' laws \nis a violation of due process and is anticonsumer. It seems implausible \nto me that an amendment that would ameliorate the impact of denying \nStates the right to hear certain cases could be considered either a \nviolation of due process or anticonsumer. I believe the amendment of \nthe Senator from California is fair. It is a reasonable approach to \ndealing with a serious problem created in the underlying legislation.\n  As Chairman Specter stated earlier in the week, this legislation is \nintended to change the procedure for class actions and not the \nsubstantive law. Without Senator Feinstein's amendment this bill could \neffectively limit the substantive rights of citizens to obtain a remedy \nfor modest damages when a defendant has injured many in a similar \nfashion. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the Feinstein \namendment.\n  I have a letter I received from Professor Arthur Miller at the \nHarvard Law School. He has been very helpful to me and to other \nSenators in trying to help us understand the seriousness of the issue \nand the importance of remedying this through proposals such as the \nFeinstein amendment. I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed \nin the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                           Harvard Law School,\n\n                                     Cambridge, MA, June 17, 2005.\n     Hon. Jeff BIngaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: I am happy to respond to your letter \n     of June 14 asking for my views of your proposed ``choice of \n     law'' amendment to the proposed ``Class Action Fairness Act'' \n     (S. 2062). After decades of teaching, practicing, writing, \n     and serving the Judiciary in various public service \n     capacities in the fields of civil procedure, complex \n     litigation, and class actions, I very interested in any \n     federal legislation affecting class action lawsuits, and \n     particularly, in the possibility of making this particular \n     legislation fairer and more balanced.\n       In general, S. 2062 would place in federal court most class \n     actions that involve more than $5 million in losses and more \n     than 100 class members, and in which any defendant is a \n     citizen of a state that is different from that of any member \n     of the plaintiff class. In effect, the proposed legislation \n     would federalize all class actions of any significance. I \n     be1ieve that this radical departure from one of the most \n     basic, longstanding principles of federalism is a particular \n     affront to state judges when we consider the unquestioned \n     vitality and competence of state courts to which we have \n     historically and frequently entrusted the enforcement of \n     state-created rights and remedies. I recognize, however, that \n     apparently a majority of the Senate supports the idea of \n     moving most class action lawsuits from state to federal \n     court. If\n\n[[Page S1170]]\n\n     that is the case, your proposed amendment is essential to \n     ensure that, once class actions were moved into the federal \n     courts, these cases not be consigned to oblivion. That real \n     possibility goes beyond the just mentioned intrusion on \n     federalism principles and raises legitimate concerns about \n     the fairness and balance of S. 2062.\n       Proponents of S. 2062 argue that federal courts are the \n     more appropriate forum for lawsuits involving plaintiffs from \n     multiple states. They assert that the goal of the bill is to \n     ensure that nationwide cases will ``be litigated in the \n     federal courts rather than in the courts of just one state \n     (or county) or another.'' Of course, that statement ignores \n     the fact that state courts have been trusted to adjudicate \n     multi-state controversies since the foundation of the Nation. \n     Moreover, the truth is that these cases are not litigated in \n     federal court; most commonly they are denied class \n     certification. The proposed legislation would magnify that \n     reality.\n       Federal courts have consistently denied class certification \n     in multi-state lawsuits based on consumer laws as well as \n     other state laws. This fact is acknowledged by most class \n     action practitioners and experts, regardless of their \n     position on class action policy issues. Just last year, the \n     U.S. Chamber of Commerce--the leading proponent of S. 2062--\n     filed an amicus curiae brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for \n     the Second Circuit urging the court to overrule a \n     distinguished district court's class certification decision \n     because ``. . . federal courts have consistently refused to \n     certify nationwide class actions in product defect cases \n     because the need to apply the laws of many different states \n     would make such a sprawling class action unmanageable.'' The \n     Chamber went on to conclude, ``. . . it is nearly a truism \n     that nationwide class actions in which the claims are subject \n     to varying state laws cannot be certified because they are \n     simply unmanageable.'' On this point, the Chamber is \n     correct--not a single Federal Circuit Court has granted class \n     certification for such a lawsuit, and six Circuit Courts have \n     expressly denied certification.\n       It is not surprising that federal courts are reluctant to \n     grant certification to multi-state class actions based on \n     state consumer protection laws. After all, these are laws \n     with which the federal courts generally are not familiar or \n     comfortable. Imagine the discomfort of a federal judge, then, \n     when confronted with a case involving tens of thousands of \n     individuals from all fifty states and state laws that at \n     least superficia11y appear to be different. Moreover, our \n     federal courts have limited resources and are responsible for \n     adjudicating a tremendous array of substantive matters. State \n     courts, on the other hand, are far more comfortable handling \n     cases involving state contract or tort law and are, \n     therefore, more inclined to try to find a way to hear and \n     resolve those cases.\n       Your proposed amendment will provide guidance to federal \n     judges that will enable more multi-state consumer class \n     actions to be certified in federal court and, hopefully, \n     resolved on their actual merits. If S. 2062 is enacted \n     without the amendment, class action lawsuits brought on \n     behalf of consumers who have been defrauded or injured \n     because of corporate misconduct that affected people in \n     multiple states will continue to be non-viable.\n       The following is a brief description of how federal courts \n     currently treat class actions based on different state laws. \n     It will elucidate the need for an amendment like yours in the \n     event that Congress does indeed give federal courts exclusive \n     jurisdiction over class actions that involve solely state law \n     claims.\n       The rationale that many federal courts use for refusing to \n     certify consumer class actions that involve solely state law \n     claims on beha1f of citizens from different states rests on \n     the requirement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3), \n     which governs most consumer class actions brought in federal \n     court. Rule 23(b)(3) says, in pertinent part: ``An action \n     may be maintained as a class action if . . . the court \n     finds that the questions of law or fact common to the \n     members of the class predominate over any questions \n     affecting only individual members.'' When courts feel \n     compelled to apply the laws of different states to \n     different members of a class action, they often find that \n     questions of law common to the members of the class do not \n     predominate, leading them to conclude that proceeding on a \n     class action basis would prove to be unmanageable, and \n     they deny class certification.\n       Federal courts often conclude they must apply the laws of \n     different states to different members of a class action after \n     they engage in a complex ``choice of law'' analysis to \n     determine which state's law to apply to the claims of the \n     class members. Under current doctrines, federal courts \n     hearing state law based claims must use the ``choice-of-law'' \n     rule of the state in which the federal district court sits. \n     These procedural rules vary among states, but many provide \n     that the federal court should apply the substantive law of \n     the home state of the plaintiff, or the law of the state \n     where the harm occurred. In a nationwide consumer class \n     action, such a rule would lead the court to apply to each \n     class member's claim the law of the state in which the class \n     member lives, or lived at the time the harm occurred. As \n     noted, most federal courts will not grant class certification \n     in these situations because they find that the classes would \n     be ``unmanageable.''\n       Your amendment would allow a federal court to choose not to \n     follow the choice-of-law rule of the state in which the court \n     is located. The federal judge could instead make the case \n     more manageable by choosing the law of one state with \n     sufficient ties to the underlying claims to meet the choice \n     of law requirements that the Constitution demands be met. \n     That state often will be the state in which the defendant's \n     headquarters is located, or where the product was designed or \n     manufactured, or where the marketing materials were \n     conceived, or where the particular business practice being \n     challenged was developed or executed.\n       If the federal district judge chooses to reject the option \n     of applying one state's law to the case, your amendment \n     ensures that the judge does not deny class certification on \n     the sole ground that the laws of more than one state would \n     apply to the action. This protects consumers from being \n     caught in the ultimate Catch-22 situation--their lawsuit is \n     in federal court because the class includes people from many \n     states and Congress has said that is the only place the class \n     can go, but then, the federal court will not grant class \n     certification precisely because the class involves citizens \n     from multiple states. That simply violates the most basic \n     principles of citizen access to the courts. I believe that \n     your amendment strikes the appropriate balance among the \n     interests of the class members, defendants, and the courts. \n     Most important, it will ensure that S. 2062 does not lead to \n     the unintended consequence of robbing from consumers their \n     only avenue to seek redress from corporations that violate \n     the law.\n       If S. 2062 passes without your amendment, the only outlet \n     for injured consumers will be single-state class actions. But \n     that would fly in the face of what the proponents of the bill \n     are apparently trying to achieve, which is to consolidate \n     nationwide class actions in one forum, federal court, so that \n     businesses do not have to face multiple lawsuits throughout \n     the country. What is worse, the only plaintiffs who will he \n     represented and compensated through single state actions are \n     those from highly-populated states, where the damages \n     suffered by the class members will be large enough to finance \n     a costly and typically risky class action lawsuit. This may \n     be a practical and viable solution for those who live in a \n     state like California or Texas. But it will leave millions of \n     consumers who have been harmed in less-populated states, such \n     as your home state of New Mexico, without relief.\n       Your amendment effectively and efficiently allows multi-\n     state class actions in consumer cases to be certified in \n     federal court. It actually accomplishes what the bill \n     purports to achieve--giving harmed consumers from multiple \n     states one federal forum in which to seek relief. Under your \n     amendment, the federal judge will have the discretion to \n     apply one state's law, as long as that is constitutionally \n     permissible. Or the judge may choose to manage the case in a \n     different way, perhaps by grouping states together that have \n     similar laws into subclasses or by using exemplar or test \n     cases or by resorting to the increasingly sophisticated tool \n     chest of management procedures our courts have developed. In \n     any event, the judge may not dismiss a case on the ground \n     that the litigation is unmanageable simply because multiple \n     state laws apply. The judge does, of course, maintain the \n     discretion to refuse to certify the class on other grounds. \n     The amendment is quite modest, but it does restore some \n     balance and fairness to the bill by increasing the likelihood \n     that citizens will have access to the courts to present their \n     grievances.\n       Your letter to me notes that proponents of the bill are \n     portraying this amendment as anti-consumer. Such a \n     characterization could not be further from the truth and is \n     little more than rhetoric. Indeed, in my judgment, it is S. \n     2062 that is anti-consumer.\n       As noted above, under current practice, federal courts \n     rarely certify nationwide consumer class actions. In almost \n     every instance in which allegations of wrongdoing injuring \n     large numbers of consumers have been brought, the decision to \n     deny class certification will eviscerate any opportunity for \n     the victims to seek redress. The individual members of the \n     class simply will not suffer losses large enough to justify \n     bringing suit solely on one person's behalf. It is hardly \n     anti-consumer to provide a mechanism to enable federal courts \n     to certify cases and afford consumers an opportunity to have \n     their grievances heard.\n       Thus I believe your amendment provides a balanced solution. \n     It allows injured consumers a better chance of getting their \n     day in court. And it provides federal judges with a \n     reasonable way to manage multi-state class actions based on \n     consumer laws.\n       You also note that proponents of the legislation have \n     suggested that this amendment is unconstitutional. There is \n     no basis for such an assertion.\n       Your amendment expressly honors the Constitution by \n     stating, ``the district court may apply the rule of decision \n     of one state having a sufficient interest in the claim that \n     the application of that state's law is permissible under the \n     Constitution.'' Although the amendment allows a federal judge \n     to apply one state's law, it does so only when that is \n     constitutionally acceptable.\n       The constitutional limitation on applying a single state's \n     law to a multi-state action is derived from Phillips \n     Petroleum Co. v. Shutts et al., 472 U.S. 797 (185), a case \n     that I argued on behalf of Phillips Petroleum Co. before the \n     Supreme Court. The Court held that ``for a State's \n     substantive law to be selected in a constitutionally \n     permissible manner, that\n\n[[Page S1171]]\n\n     State must have a significant contact or significant \n     aggregation of contacts, creating state interests, such that \n     choice of its law is neither arbitrary nor fundamentally \n     unfair.'' Id. at 818 (internal cite and quotations omitted). \n     Thus, as long as there are ``significant contacts'' and the \n     choice of law is not ``arbitrary'' or ``fundamentally \n     unfair,'' then a single state's laws may apply to a multi-\n     state class action. Neither party can object to that.\n       Because your amendment effectively codifies Shutts, it is \n     constitutional. If there is a multi-state class action in \n     which no single state's law meets the constitutional standard \n     set forth in Shutts or if the judge does not choose to apply \n     a single state law that does meet the constitutional \n     criteria, then the judge may follow the choice of law rules \n     of the state in which the district court sits. Part (b) of \n     the amendment does not implicate the Constitution in any way. \n     It merely provides that if the judge does not apply a single \n     state law, then he or she may not deny certification under \n     Rule 23 on the narrow ground that multiple states' laws apply \n     to the case and make it unmanageable. It encourages federal \n     judges to try to go forward and reach the merits of the \n     dispute.\n       Thus, your amendment gives federal judges appropriate \n     guidance about how to address multi-state consumer class \n     action lawsuits. It does not mandate a result or tie their \n     hands. This ability to make a case more manageable will allow \n     at least some multi-state consumer class actions to be heard, \n     rather than to be denied certification. As the California \n     State Supreme Court aptly recognized, defendants should not \n     be able to keep ill-gotten gains ``simply because their \n     conduct harmed large numbers of people in small amounts \n     instead of smal1 numbers of people in large amounts.'' State \n     v. Levi Strauss & Co., 41 Cal.3d 460 (1986). Yet that is \n     where this bill as written will lead us, and that is \n     extremely bad policy.\n       Unless the Senate wants to enact legislation that, as a \n     practical matter, eliminates multi-state class actions, it \n     should not pass S. 2062 as it is written. Under S. 2062, \n     multi-state class actions in consumer law cases, a vital \n     mechanism for promoting social justice, giving people access \n     to the courts and dealing fairly with our citizenry, will \n     become an artifact, a thing of the past. At a minimum, the \n     Senate would be wise to adopt your amendment, which would \n     allow plaintiffs to have their day in federal court; after \n     all, the proponents of the legislation argue that is the goal \n     of the bill.\n       Thank you again for your willingness to address this \n     important issue. If you have any additional questions about \n     S. 2062 or the benefits of your amendment, I would be happy \n     to assist you further.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                 Arthur R. Miller,\n                                   Bruce Bromley Professor of Law.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, when I spoke prior to Senator Pryor's \namendment, I made a pitch that I want to repeat about the opportunity \nwe have now, after four Congresses--this is the fifth Congress--to get \nthis bill to the President. It has passed the House so many times, and \nwe have never been able to get it to finality in the Senate. We have \nthe House in position now, even after all of these compromises we have \nmade which have diluted the bill more than I would have liked to have \ndone, of passing a bill the leadership in the House of Representatives \ntells us they will take the way we pass it and send it to the President \nas long as there are no changes, and this assurance about no changes \ncomes from two standpoints.\n  One, in the previous Congress we made compromises to get Democratic \nvotes with the idea that once those changes were made and we got this \nbill through the Senate, they would not be changed in the House. We \nalso got the assurance from the House that they would not change it, \neven though the House has passed much stronger legislation a couple of \ntimes. So there is an assurance in this body for people who would \nrather not pass strong legislation but they know there needs to be some \nchanges in class action regime, to make some modest changes, and make \nsure that what they agree to will be what gets to the President, and \nthen the House saying now for a new Congress they will pass this \nlegislation without amendment.\n  So every Democrat who has made a compromise with us so we can get \nthis bill behind us can be satisfied that they will not be nickeled and \ndimed to death.\n  Obviously, not all Democrats are satisfied with this sort of \nagreement and that is their right as individual Senators to try to \nchange it more. But as I said before, any changes in this bill negate \nboth promises that have been made. It means the promise to go through \nthe House will not be kept because the bill has been changed in the \nSenate, and then for those Senators who got the assurance from me that \nthis bill would not be changed in the House so that they were not \nnickeled and dimed away with their compromises are going to lose the \nopportunity of getting what they want without the assurance that \nsomewhere else in the legislative process, probably conference, there \nmight be a much stronger bill than they want.\n  This bill was originally introduced in the 105th Congress, then the \n106th Congress, then the 107th Congress. We moved it in the 108th \nCongress. Now we are here in the 109th Congress. Almost everybody seems \nto believe there is some reform that needs to be done in the class \naction tort regime. This bill is it.\n  Now we have amendments. We defeated the amendment of Senator Pryor. \nWe had an amendment by Senator Bingaman that we were going to deal \nwith, that would have destroyed this compromise. There must have been a \nbelief on the part of the people behind the Bingaman amendment that it \nwould not go, so instead of the Bingaman amendment we have in front of \nus a Feinstein modification of the Bingaman amendment.\n  I am in the same position I was with the amendment of Senator Pryor, \nasking people to defeat the Feinstein-Bingaman amendment. I will be \nvery precise why that needs to be done. But the substance of the \namendment and my arguing against the substance of the amendment should \nnot carry as much weight with my colleagues as my pleading with them \nthat we defeat all amendments because this bill has been compromised to \nsatisfy a supermajority of Senators--not a bare majority, a \nsupermajority.\n  So I take this opportunity to speak out against the Feinstein-\nBingaman ``choice of law'' amendment, and I urge my colleagues to \noppose it. Pure and simple, this amendment blows a hole in the bill and \nguts the modest reforms we are finally going to be able to get to the \nPresident.\n  This amendment would require the Federal courts to certify a class \nthat does not meet basic class action requirements. In addition, what \nthe amendment does is a contravention of the requirements of rule 23 of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which rule says you have to have \nsimilar law in fact in order to certify a class. The net result of this \namendment is that it would require Federal judges to hear dissimilar \nclaims that do not belong together as a class action, and would not be \nallowed to proceed as a class action under current law. Requiring \ncourts to subclass does not make this amendment any better.\n  This amendment would require Federal judges to not follow the \nrequirements for certifying class under rule 23. Why do the proponents \nof this amendment want to do that? They have given reasons for their \namendment and I think, whether this is their intention or not--and I \nshould not question the motives of people--but the end result is \nperpetuating the abuses that were already seen in the magnet courts, \nthese infamous judicial hellholes which have been referred to. I \nremember only one out of dozens throughout the country, but one was in \nMadison County, IL.\n  The purpose of class actions is obvious: to enable courts to decide \nlarge numbers of similar claims and to do it fairly and to do it in an \nefficient manner. Different claims cannot be pulled together as a class \naction because that would be unfair and it would violate the due \nprocess rights of both plaintiffs and defendants. But the Feinstein-\nBingaman amendment would require judges to do just that. As you know, \nthat is exactly what the problem is all about, what our bill was trying \nto correct: judges certifying classes that should never have been \ncertified in the first place. Rules are in place as to what should or \nshould not be certified,\n\n[[Page S1172]]\n\nand the Feinstein-Bingaman amendment blows those rules off. The \nefficiency and the rationale of that rule should not be followed.\n\n  The Federal courts should undertake a review to determine whether \nmultistate class actions involving State law claims should be \ncertified. They need to determine that the legal claims are \nsufficiently similar to warrant class certification. Most State courts \nmake the same kind of determinations as well. The magnet State courts, \non the other hand, do not make this determination and that is why they \ncertify huge classes that involve claims that are completely \ndissimilar, to the detriment of both plaintiff and defendant. That ends \nup being a due process problem.\n  In addition, this amendment before us ignores how diversity \njurisdiction works, and it eviscerates the reforms that are contained \nin our bill.\n  Another argument for this amendment by Senator Feinstein and Senator \nBingaman is allegedly that Federal courts refuse to certify nationwide \nclass actions. That sort of presumption is plain wrong. That is not the \ncase. There are numerous examples of where Federal courts have \ncertified multistate class actions based on State law claims. There is \nnot a rule against nationwide class actions. Federal courts do certify \nnationwide class actions where the laws that govern the claims are \nsimilar.\n  Class actions are also certified when the plaintiffs' lawyers \norganize the claims in a manner so that they may be litigated fairly, \neven under differing State laws, where they appropriately organize the \nclaims into subclasses. But this amendment does not give the courts any \nchoice to determine whether it is appropriate to subclass.\n  So for a third time during this period that I am standing, I remind \nmy colleagues again about the extensive efforts on the part of Senator \nKohl of Wisconsin, Senator Hatch of Utah, and this Senator from Iowa, \ngetting to this version of the Class Action Fairness Act. No one can \nquestion that we negotiated in good faith with our colleague Senator \nFeinstein, as well as our colleagues Senators Dodd, Schumer, and \nLandrieu, to make changes to address concerns they had about the \noriginal bill introduced.\n  The bill we have now will keep many class actions in State court \nunder the Feinstein home State exception. That was accepted in \ncommittee, way back there in early 2003, in the 108th Congress. Also \nunder the local controversy exception we crafted with Senators Dodd, \nSchumer, and Landrieu, that will stay in State court.\n  So I hope I get us back in an understandable way, and what people \nthink is rational after all these compromises, so that there is no \nfurther need to change this bottom-line compromise. Again, the purpose \nof this amendment is to gut the modest, commonsense reforms contained \nin this bill. This is an attempt to legitimize the class action abuse \nwe have been seeing in the magnet State courts. It is an attempt to \nlegalize the problem by putting it into the rule.\n  All I can say is, that is not all right. It is not OK. If we are \nserious about putting a stop to class action abuse, I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter by Walter Dellinger.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        O'Melveny & Myers LLP,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 4, 2005.\n     Re Proposed Choice-of-Law Amendment to Class Action Fairness \n         Act (S. 5).\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write concerning the ``choice-of-law'' \n     amendment that Public Citizen has been suggesting should be \n     offered to the Class Action Fairness Act. As I understand it, \n     this amendment would encourage or require federal court \n     judges, faced with multi-state or nationwide class actions, \n     to either: (1) apply the laws of one state to all the claims \n     in the case; or (2) certify the class action despite the \n     manageability problems created by conflicting state laws.\n       I strongly recommend rejection of this seriously flawed \n     proposal for several reasons.\n       The Public Citizen amendment violates basic principles of \n     federalism and would extend ``magnet'' state court abuses to \n     federal court. Many consumer protection cases now proceed on \n     a nationwide basis in federal court in those instances in \n     which Congress has determined that a single national law \n     ought to govern. This has been the case with laws such as the \n     Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and the Real Estate Settlement \n     Practices Act (RESPA). Frequently, nationwide class actions \n     are brought and tried to successful conclusions under laws \n     such as these.\n       Where Congress has chosen not to enact uniform national \n     legislation under which citizens can bring suit, however, it \n     has left the legal issues to be resolved by each state \n     adopting its own law. Allowing each state to decide for \n     itself and for its citizens is the essence of federalism. \n     Instructing a federal judge to pick out one state's law and \n     impose it on other states is a profound violation of \n     federalism principles. Congress is elected by all the people \n     of the United States. When it is acting within its \n     constitutional power under Article I, Congress can decide to \n     impose a uniform rule on the states. It is a far more serious \n     intrusion into the autonomy of the States when a single \n     judge, not Congress, acts to set aside the laws of all of the \n     states (but one) by choosing whichever particular state law \n     the judge likes best and imposing that law on all of the \n     other states.\n       For example, in Avery v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 746 \n     N.E.2d 1242 (Ill. App. 2001), the sate court decided that \n     Illinois law could be applied to a nationwide class of \n     policyholders, and held that State Farm's use of ``non-\n     original equipment manufactured'' automobile service parts \n     violated Illinois law. Yet many other states' insurance laws \n     either expressly or implicitly permitted or even required \n     insurance companies to use non-OEM parts as a way to reduce \n     insurance costs. Avery has been uniformly recognized as an \n     example of judicial excess--the Illinois court exceeded its \n     authority by purporting to dictate the insurance laws of 49 \n     other states. Nonetheless, the proposed amendment would tell \n     federal courts to do precisely the same thing. It would, in \n     effect, recreate in federal court the very state-court \n     problem that precipitated the introduction of this \n     legislation.\n       The amendment would reverse the decisions of numerous state \n     supreme courts that have rejected application of their laws \n     extraterritorially. Opponents of S. 5 have argued that this \n     amendment is necessary because ``state courts . . . are far \n     more comfortable handling cases involving state contract or \n     tort law.'' Aside from certain magnet courts, however, many \n     state courts have strongly rejected what Public Citizen \n     proposes: i.e., nationwide application of individual states' \n     laws. In fact, the proposed amendment would eviscerate a \n     number of decisions by state supreme courts, refusing to \n     apply one state's consumer protection laws in nationwide \n     class actions. Among the state court decisions that could be \n     reversed by the proposed amendment are the following:\n       Goshen v. Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York, 774 \n     N.E.2d 1190 (N.Y. 2002), (explaining that to ``apply the [New \n     York consumer] statute to out-of-state transactions in the \n     case before us would . . . tread on the ability of other \n     states to regulate their own markets and enforce their own \n     consumer protection laws.'').\n       Compaq Computer Corp. v.

Engle, 853 So. 2d 434, 448, 449 (Fla. \n     Dist. Ct. App. 2003) (decertifying a statewide class of \n     smokers because, inter alia, the ``highly transient \n     population'' of Florida would ``require examination of \n     numerous significantly different state laws governing the \n     different plaintiffs' claims'') (matters under review by the \n     Florida Supreme Court, see 873 So. 2d 1222 (Fla. 2004)).\n       Although proponents of the amendment say that its purpose \n     is to protect state law, its real effect would be to overrule \n     an established body of state law.\n       I would also note that these state supreme court decisions \n     are no less binding on federal courts than on lower state \n     courts. The reason is because, in ``diversity'' cases, \n     federal courts look to the choice-of-law rules of the state \n     in which they sit to decide what substantive state law should \n     apply. Thus, a federal court confronting a nationwide class \n     action would currently defer to the decision of the highest \n     appellate court of that state declining to allow that state's \n     law (or any other single state's law) to govern the claims of \n     consumers residing throughout the nation. But the ``choice-\n     of-law''' amendment would change that. As its proponents \n     concede, the ``amendment would allow a federal court to \n     choose not to follow the choice-of-law rule of the state in \n     which the court is located.'' That is another serious \n     distortion of federalism principles.\n       The amendment could hurt consumers from states with strong \n     consumer protection laws. Another problem with the proposal \n     is that, in their effort to make sure that a single state's \n     law may be applied even in a nationwide class action, critics \n     of S. 5 have not thought through the consequences of what \n     would happen if federal courts actually did apply a single \n     state's law. To pose the question bluntly: which single \n     state's law? If the choice-of-law amendment were adopted, \n     that question--the ``which state'' question--likely would be \n     the source of considerable mischief, often to the detriment \n     of consumers.\n       For example, assume that someone brings a nationwide class \n     action alleging that the defendant company participated in \n     fraudulent sales behavior. State consumer protection statutes \n     vary widely, but the court may decide to apply Alabama law to \n     all claims. That would be bad news for the class members \n     living in California and other states with strong consumer \n     protection statutes, because the Alabama statute prohibits \n     the assertions of consumer protection claims on a class \n     basis. Thus, the claims of all class members presumably would \n     be subject to dismissal. In short, consumers with valid \n     claims under their home state laws, adopted by their own \n     state legislatures and courts to protect their interests, may \n     have their claims obliterated (or, at least, rendered much \n     less beneficial).\n       Even its proponents appear to acknowledge this problem. \n     Professor Arthur Miller, for example, has suggested that one \n     state whose law would ``often'' be applied in a nationwide \n     class action would be ``the state in which the defendant's \n     headquarters is located.'' See Letter of Prof. Arthur Miller \n     to Sen. Bingaman, June 17, 2004, at 3.\n       The amendment, in short, is a radical attempt to avoid the \n     fact that in some areas Congress has chosen to leave the \n     decision of what substantive law should govern conduct to the \n     legislative process of each state. By having judges dismiss \n     the laws of all states but one, the Public Citizen amendment \n     violates fundamental principles of federalism.\n       The amendment is based on the false premise that federal \n     courts never certify multi-state classes based on state law. \n     It is worth noting that neither federal nor state courts have \n     any hard-and-fast rule against the certification of \n     nationwide or multi-state classes asserting state law claims. \n     To the contrary, federal ``[c]ourts have expressed a \n     willingness to certify nationwide classes on the ground that \n     relatively minor differences in state law could be overcome \n     at trial by grouping similar state laws together and applying \n     them as a unit.'' In re Prudential Ins. Co. of America Sales \n     Practices Litig., 148 F.3d 283, 315 (3d Cir. 1998). Indeed, \n     the two leading proponents of the Public Citizen amendment--\n     Prof. Arthur Miller and Prof. Samuel Isaacharoff--have \n     themselves succeeded in persuading federal courts to certify \n     such nationwide class actions.\n       The main reason why courts, state and federal, often refuse \n     to certify nationwide classes is because attorneys too often \n     propose classes that overreach--classes that encompass too \n     many people with too many disparate facts asserted under too \n     many different laws. See, e.g., Chin v. Chrysler Corp., 182 \n     F.R.D. 448 (D.N.J. 1998) (``Plaintiffs could have reduced or \n     simplified the case . . . by the creation of a smaller and \n     more clearly defined proposed class. Instead, Plaintiffs have \n     asked this Court to certify the largest class possible . . . \n     on the basis of mere promises that a manageable litigation \n     plan can be designed . . . for five causes of action under \n     the laws of 52 jurisdictions''). That, I submit, is a \n     necessary consequence of respect for federalism. There is no \n     reason to exalt the need for nationwide class actions in \n     every case above the basic principles of federalism.\n       The amendment, which would ignore the manageability \n     problems engendered by varying state laws, would violate due \n     process rights. If a federal court decided that a single \n     state's law cannot be applied over all claims in a nationwide \n     class action without violating the Constitution, the choice-\n     of-law amendment would allow a federal court to apply several \n     states' laws to the claims at issue. But in that \n     circumstance, the proposed amendment would then forbid the \n     court from denying class certification (even ``in part'') on \n     the grounds that applying those several states' laws would \n     render the case one devoid of common legal issues that could \n     not be tried fairly on a class basis.\n       The amendment would distort traditional and prevailing \n     class action practice in a way that raises serious due \n     process concerns. The basic reason is that it would instruct \n     federal judges that, even if they truly believe that the fact \n     that several (or even all 50) states' laws must be applied in \n     a particular case means that the case cannot possibly be \n     fairly adjudicated as a class action, they must simply ignore \n     that true belief and grant class certification anyway.\n       In deciding whether to certify a class, for example, a \n     federal court must inquire into (a) whether ``common \n     questions of law'' will ``predominate'' and (b) whether the \n     class action is ``superior'' to other methods, both of which \n     require consideration of any ``difficulties likely to be \n     encountered in the management of the class action.'' Fed. R. \n     Civ. P. 23(b)(3). What that means is that a party objecting \n     to the proposed class action can argue that various state's \n     laws must be applied in the case; that those state laws \n     differ in important ways (indeed, they may even conflict); \n     and that those variations (or conflicts) will make it \n     impossible to adjudicate the class action fairly on a class \n     basis--and will make it impossible for one jury to decide \n     those different or conflicting laws in one trial. In the \n     parlance of Rule 23, the party objecting to the proposed \n     class may argue that the differing state laws are reasons why \n     common questions of law do not ``predominate'' and that the \n     multi-state or nationwide class action is not ``superior'' to \n     other methods of resolving the case (including a statewide \n     class action).\n       Again, the Avery case makes for a good example. If the \n     court had (correctly, in my view) concluded that many states' \n     laws would need to be applied to resolve that nationwide \n     class action, that determination would in all likelihood have \n     also led the court to conclude that it would not have been \n     fair to try before one jury the legality of the use of non-\n     OEM parts nationwide. After all, how could a single jury \n     hearing that the practice is illegal in Illinois, legally \n     required in other states, permitted in other states, and not \n     addressed at all by still other states, render a fair and \n     coherent verdict? Especially when one keeps in mind that some \n     class actions involve dozens of claims, nationwide class \n     actions would in some cases require literally hundreds of \n     different decisions for a single jury to make.\n       These Rule 23 requirements have due process underpinnings. \n     Class actions serve an important public function: they allow \n     numerous, similarly situated individuals whose relatively \n     small claims might otherwise be shut out of the legal system \n     to aggregate their claims and obtain collective relief. At \n     the same time, the purpose of the class action device is to \n     allow the aggregation of only some--not all--lawsuits. \n     Indeed, as the U.S. Supreme Court has noted, there is a \n     strong presumption in our legal system that claims will be \n     litigated individually; class actions are an exception to \n     that general rule. Thus, lawsuits seeking damages in which \n     common questions of questions do not ``predominate,'' and in \n     which the class action is not ``superior'' method of \n     resolving the dispute, are denied class treatment for the \n     very reason that the court concludes that it would not be \n     fair to resolve the whole case in one trial. In other words, \n     a class cannot be certified at the expense of ``procedural \n     fairness.'' Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 613 \n     (1997); see also Malcolm v. Nat'l Gypsum Co., 995 F.2d 346, \n     350 (2d Cir. 1993) (holding that the benefits of aggregated \n     litigation ``can never be purchased at the cost of \n     fairness''). This principle is as important for protecting \n     the plaintiffs (that is, the unnamed class members) as it is \n     for protecting defendants. See id.; see also Hansberry v. \n     Lee, 311 U.S. 32, 40-42 (1940).\n       The proposed amendment violates this principle by elevating \n     the class certification decision over ``procedural \n     fairness.'' Whereas the fact that different state laws would \n     need to be applied to a multi-state or nationwide class \n     action is unquestionably a valid factor to consider in \n     deciding whether a class should be certified, the proposed \n     amendment would dictate to federal judges that they cannot \n     consider that factor at all. For example, under the facts of \n     the Avery case, the\n\n[[Page S1174]]\n\n     choice-of-law amendments would require the federal court to \n     ignore the central fact that the 50 states have made \n     fundamentally conflicting policy choices over the legality of \n     the conduct at issue. The court would be required not to \n     consider the obvious fact that it might be procedurally \n     unfair for the same jury to decide whether the use of non-OEM \n     parts is legal in all of the different states.\n       I am not suggesting that, in every multi-state class \n     action, the laws of every state must be applied as a matter \n     of due process. That depends upon the particular case, and \n     upon the connection that any one state might have to a \n     proposed class action. Rather, what I am suggesting is that \n     in cases in which federal courts themselves decide that due \n     process requires the application of numerous states' laws, it \n     is a serious due process problem to tell those same federal \n     courts that they may not deny class certification on same \n     basis--to tell those federal courts that they must certify a \n     class despite their firmly held relief that the differing \n     state laws will make use of the class action device \n     fundamentally unfair.\n       For all of the foregoing reasons, I find the proposed \n     choice-of-law amendment to be constitutionally suspect (both \n     from a federalism and due process standpoint) and wrongheaded \n     as a public policy matter. It should be rejected.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Walter E. Dellinger.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, we \nare making good progress on the class action bill. I appreciate \neveryone's participation in coming to the floor and offering and \ntalking about their amendments. I want to keep the pace going.\n  The Democratic leader and I have been in discussions over the day. We \nwant to complete this bill at the earliest possible time this week.\n  I will shortly be asking unanimous consent that the vote on the \nKennedy amendment be this afternoon at a time which I will state. After \nthat we will be proceeding to the Feinstein amendment. We will at that \ntime divide the time accordingly.\n  At this point, I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur in \nrelation to the Kennedy amendment No. 2 at 4 p.m. today; provided \nfurther that following that vote the Senate proceed immediately to a \nvote in relation to the Feinstein amendment No. 4; provided further \nthat the debate until 4 be equally divided in the usual way, and that \nno amendments be in order to either amendment prior to the votes.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes for debate \nequally divided following the first vote.

Mr. President, I have no objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, while the Democratic leader is here, I \nmentioned as he was returning to the floor that we are all working very \nhard to complete the bill on class action.

It is my understanding that the distinguished Republican \nleader has indicated we will finish this bill this week. Is that right?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, that is right.\n  Mr. President, again I encourage our colleagues to focus on the bill \nbefore us today and tonight and tomorrow, and we will be staying on the \nbill until we complete the bill. I appreciate everybody's \nconsideration.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, Senator Feinstein has offered an \namendment to S. 5, the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, to address \nthe opponents' claim that Federal courts routinely deny certification \nof multistate or nationwide classes that involve different State laws. \nUnder this amendment, that would change the underlying bill we are \nconsidering here. Federal courts would be required to certify class \nactions, even if the claims were brought under State law.\n  The amendment further provides that courts faced with nationwide \nclasses involving different State laws should either create subclasses \nto account for variations in State law or, if such subclasses are \nimpractical, to attempt to apply the proper State law to the class \nmembers claims only to the extent doing so is practical.\n  The proposal would toss State laws and procedural fairness out of the \nwindow for the sake of allowing a nationwide class action. It would \nreverse nearly 70 years of established Supreme Court case law that \nrequires Federal courts to apply the proper State law when they hear \nclaims between citizens of different States.\n  It would reverse numerous decisions about State supreme courts \nrejecting the application of one State's law to class action claims \nthat arise in 50 States, and it would seriously undermine the ability \nof plaintiffs and defendants alike to have a fair trial.\n  Most importantly, it would have the perverse effect of perpetuating \nthe very magnet court abuses that the legislation seeks to end.\n  Here is why the latest choice-of-law amendment should be rejected. \nFirst, the premise of the amendment is false. Federal courts do not \nhave a hard and fast rule against certifying multistate class actions. \nRather, both Federal and State courts--except for certain magnet \njurisdictions--conduct a careful inquiry before certifying a class to \nensure that common legal issues predominate, as required by the Federal \nrules governing class actions.\n  The reason for this requirement is self-evident. The whole point of a \nclass action is to resolve a large number of similar claims at the same \ntime. If the differences among the class members' legal claims are too \ngreat, a class trial will not be fair or practical.\n  In some circumstances, Federal courts have found that the law of \ndifferent States was sufficiently similar that a class action could go \nforward. In other cases, they have found the differences were too great \nto have a fair class action trial.\n  If the laws under which the liability is founded are significantly \ndifferent, you can't try them in the same trial. If they are not that \nmuch different, you can make it work.\n  The proposed amendment would take away the discretion of Federal \njudges to make these important decisions as they always have.\n  Proponents of the amendment conveniently ignore the fact that Federal \nlaw on this issue is quite consistent with the approach taken by \nnumerous State supreme courts, which have refused to certify cases \nwhere the differences in State law would make it impossible to have a \nfair or manageable trial. In fact, the proposed amendment would reverse \ndecisions by the Supreme Court of California, Texas, New York, and \nnumerous other States that have rejected nationwide classes in such \ncircumstances as these.\n\n  Second, Federal courts already use subclassing where appropriate. \nSubclassing basically means dividing a class into a couple of smaller \nclasses where claims may be more similar to one another. In rule 23 of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the nearly 40-year rule governing \nclass actions explicitly gives courts the option of using subclasses to \naccount for variations in the class as long as the trial would still be \nmanageable and fair.\n  For example, if a case involved State laws that can be easily divided \ninto three or four groups, subclassing would be appropriate if the \ntrial would otherwise be manageable. At the same time, if subclassing \nwere used in every situation that involved different State laws, in \nsome cases there would be so many subclasses it would be impossible to \nhave a manageable or fair trial.\n  Under the current law, Federal judges have the discretion to decide \nwhen subclassing makes sense. That approach is working. Why change it? \nIf it ``ain't'' broke, don't fix it. We have not had serious problems, \nand it is better to allow the discretion with the judge than for us to \ntry to anticipate and put in hard law requirements involving \ncomplexities in the future we cannot anticipate fully today.\n  Third, the amendment would hurt consumers by subverting State laws.\n\n[[Page S1175]]\n\nThe proposed amendment suggests that if subclassing will not work, the \ncourt should simply respect State laws ``to the extent practicable.'' \nWhat does that mean? How does the court partially carry out State law? \nJudges are responsible for carrying out the law, not for carrying out \nthe law to the extent practicable. It would be a dangerous empowerment \nand an erosion of our classical commitment to following law.\n  By suggesting that Federal courts should ignore variations in State \nlaws when respecting State law is impractical, this provision would \nperpetuate the very problem the class action bill is trying to fix. For \nexample, in the notorious Avery v. State Farm case, a county judge in \nIllinois applied Illinois law to claims that arose throughout the \ncountry, ruling that insurers could not use aftermarket parts in making \nauto accident repairs even though several States had passed laws \nencouraging, even requiring the use of these more economic parts to \nkeep down the cost of insurance premiums. The approach taken by the \nAvery judge and condoned by the proposed amendment actually hurts \nconsumers by denying them the protection of their State's laws.\n  Some State legislatures have adopted particularly strong laws in \ncertain areas because their citizens have expressed strong feelings \nabout these issues; for example, privacy or consumer fraud. Under this \namendment, the citizens of such States would not be entitled to the \nprotection of their State's laws in nationwide class actions. Instead, \ntheir claims would be subject to some compromise law created by the \njudge in order to carry out a class action.\n  These are some thoughts I share about this legislation. We do have a \nneed for class action reform. The legislation before the Senate is \nsound. We know if we stay firm, if we do not willy-nilly amend this \nbill, if we keep it clean and send it forward to the House, they will \napprove it, we will make this law, and for once pass a serious tort \nreform legislation that will improve justice in America and reduce \ncosts.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I would like to take a couple of minutes \ntoday to speak to the amendment being offered by Senators Feinstein and \nBingaman. I don't think we will find on either side of the aisle a \nDemocrat or Republican more thoughtful than either of them, or more \nfair-minded. Senator Feinstein, in particular, has been heroic in her \nefforts to try to bring about consensus on class action so we end up \nwith legislation to make sure little people who are harmed by big \ncompanies are able to bind together and be made whole; to ensure that \nthe companies that are accused know if they step out of line there is a \nprice to pay for that; legislation that will also make sure that the \ndefendant companies, large or small, have the opportunity to have a \nfair trial for whatever they are accused of in the litigation; and our \nlast goal is to make sure the Federal judiciary is not overwhelmed with \nlitigation that could be in State courts, ought to be in State courts, \nand is needlessly moved to Federal courts.\n  Those are the objectives we all share, Democrats and Republicans, \nwhether we like or do not like the bill. I am in support of the \nlegislation.\n  Most consumer laws that end up in courts are laws that are adopted by \nour States. There are some areas where the Federal Government has laws \nin place to protect the consumers, but the lion's share of the consumer \nprotection laws are written by the various States.\n  The effort by Senators Feinstein and Bingaman is laudable; that is, \nto make sure that when State laws have been violated, particularly when \nState laws have been violated in a number of States, that whoever has \nviolated those laws is going to be held accountable. The question is, \nIf you have a class action case that is brought forward based on the \nlaws of 10, 20, or 30 States or more, under whose State law do we argue \nin court the class action litigation? Is it in a State that has fairly \nweak consumer protection laws or a State that has very strong consumer \nprotection laws?\n  I am not a lawyer by training, and I come at this as a lay person \nsimply trying to figure out what is the right and fair thing to do. As \nI understand class action litigation, I will use the example of where \nwe have maybe 21 States that have been bound together in a class action \nfiled in a particular State court, one of those 21 States, and in \nparticular, a State where the litigation is brought, the effort might \nbe to apply that State's laws to all the other States that are part of \nthis. Senator Sessions talked about a situation in a case involving \nclass action with State Farm, where the suit alleged that consumers \nwere being harmed because in the car repair business, when replacement \nparts were used, some of the States allowed the use of non-original \nequipment replacement crash parts, sometimes referred to as generic \nparts. In this case, Avery v. State Farm, an Illinois judge applied the \nIllinois Consumer Fraud Act to a 48-State class, even though there were \nsignificant differences in the States' consumer protection laws and \nvast differences in the laws of the different states on the use of \nthese types of parts. Most States explicitly authorize their use and a \nfew States even require their use to reduce costs for consumers.\n\n  As I have looked into this matter, I have learned when there is an \neffort to move a class action litigation on consumer issues from a \nState court to a Federal court, the Federal judge has a number of \ndecisions to make as to whether they want to receive it and hear it at \nthe Federal level.\n  One, they can say, yes, on the basis of the law that is in question \nhere, and the facts, this is one that makes sense to be heard at the \nFederal level and to go forward.\n  The Federal judge can say--again, using the example of 21 States \nbecause the math works easily--let's divide those 21 States into three \nsubgroups, and each of those 7 States have laws that are fairly similar \nbut distinct and apart from the other two subgroups. So a Federal judge \ncould say, we are going to go forward with this class action \nlitigation. We will do it as one case, but we will have three \nsubcategories of subgroups.\n  A third alternative that is available to a Federal judge would be to \nsay, we are not going to have one case; we will have maybe three cases. \nIn those instances where the laws of the States are pretty similar, we \nwill group those seven, and the same would be true for this seven and \nthat seven. And we will hear three separate cases, not one.\n  If none of that works, the Federal judge is always free to say this \nis a State matter. The laws and the facts are in such disarray that it \nis difficult to try them as one case.\n  Some States have very strong consumer laws, some not. There is a \nwhole big range in between where the laws and the facts are just too \ndisparate and different, and the judge can simply remand it back to the \nStates.\n  If the Federal judge declines to hear that consumer class action, \nthen it can be tried in State court. Whoever the plaintiffs are, in \nthose instances, will have their day in court. If you happen to be from \nCalifornia, the latter course is not a big deal because you have so \nmany people, 30 million people, and it is not as difficult to put \ntogether a meaningful class and to be able to attract an attorney to \nrepresent your case. If you happen to be from a smaller State, with \nfewer people, then it can be more of a challenge to put together a \nlarge enough plaintiff class in that State to pay for an attorney to \nrepresent the interests of consumers in that State. I acknowledge that.\n  Having said that, my overriding concern with this legislation is \nthis. I mentioned the four principles earlier, but my overriding \nconcern with this legislation is that we not begin to pick apart this \ncarefully balanced compromise on which we have worked. I have been here \n4 years. We have worked on it for almost those 4 years I have been in \nthis Senate. I know people worked on this 3 years before that. We have \ncome so far from where this legislation began in 1997.\n  This is not tort reform, as a lot of people like to think of it. This \nis, as\n\n[[Page S1176]]\n\nothers have said today, court reform. Our goal is to, again, make sure \nif people get harmed, they have an opportunity to be made whole, to \nband together into similar groups to make sure the accused and the \ndefendants in the case have a chance to be fairly defended in a \ncourtroom. It is a fair shot.\n  My fear is, to the extent this amendment would be adopted, it invites \namendments of others who may not like this bipartisan compromise \nbecause it does not go far enough.\n  Earlier this month, in the House of Representatives, their bill, \nwhich passed by a fairly wide margin in the last Congress, was \nreintroduced. There are some people in the other Chamber, as well as \nsome in this body, who would like nothing better than to be able to \nchange this bipartisan compromise and move it, frankly, a lot closer to \nwhere the House bill is.\n  Eventually, my friends, we are going to pass a class action bill this \nyear. My own view is it is not going to get any better or more balanced \nor fairer to plaintiffs and defendants than the compromise we have \nworked out here this year. As a result, I will oppose, albeit with some \nreluctance, the amendment offered by Senators Feinstein and Bingaman. I \nknow they have put a lot of time and energy into this amendment. \nFrankly, my staff and I have as well, trying to find a way to \naccommodate the concerns they have raised. In the end, I do not believe \nwe can, and I must reluctantly oppose the amendment.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                    Attacking The Democratic Leader\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am going to speak in favor of the \ncommonsense amendment brought to us by Senators Bingaman and Feinstein. \nBefore I do, though, if I could make a couple personal comments.\n  I have been in the Senate for 31 years. I came at a time when there \nwas a real effort for Republicans and Democrats to work together, and \nfor White Houses to do so. I have been here during the administrations \nof President Ford, President Carter, both terms of President Reagan, \nPresident George H.W. Bush, both terms of President Clinton, and now \ninto the second term of President George W. Bush.\n  I have seen terrific majority leaders in both parties, leaders in \nboth parties. Senator Mansfield, Senator Scott, Senator Byrd, Senator \nBaker, Senator Dole, Senator Mitchell, obviously Senator Daschle. I \nthink of all the times they would work so closely to bring people \ntogether. The President, whoever the President was, would do the same.\n  I can remember times Senator Dole, a partisan, tough-minded \nRepublican, would reach a point as majority leader when he would call \nSenators from both parties into his office and say: OK, boys, let's see \nwhere we go from here. How do we get this legislation done?\n  Senator Baker would do that. Senator Mansfield was famous for coming \nout on the floor during evening sessions and picking a few Senators \nfrom both sides of the aisle and saying: Come up to the office. We have \nto chat and work things out. Senator Baker had the ability to do that. \nHe would go down and speak to President Reagan and suggest to him which \nDemocrats, which Republicans, he might call to make things work out.\n  You also had, during that time, the practice where the two great \nparties, the Democratic Party and Republican Party, would keep from \nattacking the leaders of the other party's caucus in either body. They \ndid it because they knew that, while they might oppose each other on \none issue today, they were going to have to work together for the \nbetterment of the country the next day.\n  Now it has broken down. For some reason, something I never thought I \nwould see, nor, I suspect, did any of those leaders I mentioned from \neither party ever think they would see, it stopped last session when \nthe leader of one party went to the home of the leader of the other \nparty and attacked him in a political campaign, and attacks were then \nmounted by the national party. I think it was a mistake.\n  In the years I have talked about, the 31 years of both Republicans \nand Democrats running the Senate--we have seen it go back and forth a \nhalf a dozen times since I have been here--it has worked very well, \nwhere you fight for your party, you fight for your majority or \nminority, but you do not go after the leaders.\n  I was hoping the last election might be an aberration. Now I see a \ndifference when the Republican National Committee has come out with the \nmost scurrilous, outrageous attack on the Democratic leader, Senator \nReid.\n  It makes no sense whatsoever. Senator Reid spent his years as the \ndeputy Democratic leader helping to get legislation through this place. \nHe worked very closely with two different Republican deputy leaders, \nboth when he was in the majority and in the minority, to move \nlegislation through.\n  I can think of dozens of times, hundreds of times on this floor when \nlegislation looked like it might not get through, and both Republicans \nand Democrats were going to Harry Reid as the deputy leader to say: How \ncan we work this out?\n  He would say: Why don't you leave off these amendments, and I will \ntalk to the Republicans and they will leave off these amendments. We \nwill get it through.\n  It always worked. The legislation we have before us is not one that \nSenator Reid favors, but he worked in good faith with the Republican \nleadership to bring it up. Almost a day after he does that, he gets \nattacked by the Republican National Committee, a day or so after the \nPresident of the United States in his State of the Union message said \nhow we must all work together, and on the day when the President \ninvites Senator Reid down for a cordial family dinner, which is, of \ncourse, showing how bipartisan we can be, the Republican National \nCommittee--controlled, of course, by the White House--sends out this \nscurrilous attack on Senator Reid.\n  It is a mistake. I would say the same thing if the Democratic Party \nwas doing it to the Republican leadership. It is a mistake because \nultimately the Senate consists of only 100 men and women who have the \nprivilege to represent 290 million Americans at any given time. There \nare so many things we need to get done. We should be working together.\n  An example: During President Reagan's term, we were facing a real \ncrisis--not a manufactured crisis but a real crisis in Social Security, \nnot the manufactured one we see today, a real one--and we were stuck \nhere on the floor. Neither side seemed to budge, and efforts to do \nsomething that might save Social Security seemed lost when two giants \nof the Senate--I know this for a fact because I was standing right here \non the floor--Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and Senator \nRobert Dole, the leaders on the Finance Committee where Social Security \nreform now seemed founded, were talking, and Pat Moynihan walks over to \nBob Dole and says: We have to give this another try. It is far too \nimportant to let this fall apart in partisan bickering. Let us make \nthis work. You know the two of us can do it.\n  I and a couple others who were standing there said: We are all with \nyou.\n  When I say ``I and a couple others,'' Republicans and Democrats said: \nWe are all for you. You can do it.\n  They went down and saw President Reagan, talked with him and said: \nLook, we are going to take another try at it, if you will work with us.\n  He said: Fine.\n  And they did. As a result of that, in the 1980s, Social Security was \nput in solvent standing for 70 years. If we do nothing with Social \nSecurity now, it will still be solvent in the year 2045, 2050.\n  Wouldn't it be nice if we went back to the days of giants in the \nSenate and Presidents of both parties who wanted to work with the \nMembers of the House and Senate who actually want to get something \ndone, not for partisan gain but for American gain, not for one \npolitical party but for all Americans?\n\n  Those who came up with the bright idea of attacking Harry Reid, a man \nwho will get reelected his next term, I suspect by even a greater \nmargin than the last landslide he had, ought to step back. They might \nraise money this way. They might stir up some of the true believers \nthis way. They do nothing for the country. They do nothing for the \nNation. All they do is deepen the divides instead of healing them. It \nwould be nice if we could have leaders\n\n[[Page S1177]]\n\nwho would try to be uniters, not dividers. We haven't had that for a \nfew years. I wish we could.\n  I digress somewhat. I see the distinguished Chair, a man I knew \nbefore he came here, admired in his work as a member of the Cabinet. We \nare benefited by having him here. I hope that he might be one of those \nwho will come in not with preconceptions but his enormous talent of \nbringing people together and work with us. I say this somewhat unfairly \nbecause under the rules he cannot respond, of course. I hope I have not \ndamaged him irreparably with the Republican Party in Florida, but he \nhas known me long enough to know I mean what I am saying.\n  This Bingaman-Feinstein amendment is a commonsense amendment. It \nseeks to rectify one of most significant problems of the class action \nlegislation under consideration by the Senate. As we all know, this \nclass action bill is going to sweep most class actions into Federal \ncourt. But then many of the Federal courts refuse to certify multistate \nclass actions because the court would be required to apply the laws of \ndifferent jurisdictions to different plaintiffs, even if the laws of \nthose jurisdictions are quite similar.\n  Without this balanced amendment, members of important class actions \nthat involve multiple-State laws may have no place to receive justice. \nIn other words, they get removed from the State court to Federal court, \nbut then the Federal court says: Well, because the State laws may be \ndifferent, we can't do anything. But you can't go back to State court \nbecause you are removed here. It is probably as classical a legal \nCatch-22 as one could see.\n  According to 14 of our State attorneys general:\n\n       [I]n theory, injured plaintiffs in each state could bring a \n     separate class action lawsuit in federal court, but that \n     defeats one of the main purposes of class actions, which is \n     to conserve judicial sources. Moreover, while the population \n     of some states may be large enough to warrant a separate \n     class action involving only residents of those states, it is \n     very unlikely that similar lawsuits would be brought on \n     behalf of residents of many smaller states.\n\n  The Feinstein-Bingaman amendment would help citizens of States such \nas my own of Vermont. We have smaller populations. We are only the size \nof one congressional district, 610,000 people. But it would allow us to \njoin with other injured plaintiffs from other States to have their day \nin court. Federal courts should be allowed to certify nationwide class \nactions by applying one State's law with sufficient ties to the \nunderlying claims in the case. This amendment would give Federal judges \nthat power and make it clear that they should not deny certification on \nthe sole ground that the laws of more than one State would apply to the \naction.\n  If the Senate is truly interested in passing class action legislation \nthat gives injured citizens from every State a place to seek relief, \nthen all Senators should embrace this commonsense amendment. I hope my \ncolleagues will support this important amendment.\n  I thank Senators Bingaman and Feinstein for their hard work on the \namendment.\n\n\n                          Sad News for Vermont\n\n  On another issue, I spoke of my small State. I was born in Vermont, a \nprecious State. We have had Leahys there since the 1850s. It is in my \nheart and soul. I read with pride but with sadness an article on the \nfront page of the Washington Post today about Vermont and the number of \nour brave men and women who have been called up in the Guard and \nReserves. Two States have the highest per capita callup in the Nation--\nHawaii and Vermont, two of the smaller States. We also have the very \nsad distinction of having the most fatalities, the most soldiers killed \nper capita of any State in the Union.\n  I mention this because in our State, everybody knows everybody else. \nIf one person dies, everybody in the State feels it. I have been to \nthose funerals where I have seen people with whom I was in \nkindergarten, people I grew up with, neighbors of mine or my sister's, \npeople my parents knew. You go to the funeral, you walk into a church, \nnot as a member of the congressional delegation from Vermont--we have \nall done that--but you go as a friend and neighbor, and that is what \nyou see, friends and neighbors. I will later today put the full article \nin the Record.\n  It struck me as to what this means. We have one small town that is \nabout the size of a small town in which my wife and I live in Vermont. \nThey have one country store. It is a small store, but it is important \nto the town. Everybody goes there. A mother and a son run the store. \nThe son gets called up. He goes bravely, of course. The mother cannot \nhandle the store by herself, and the store closes. The community in \nmany ways has lost its center.\n  These are the realities of what is happening. Several of us met \nearlier today from both bodies, both parties, to introduce legislation \nto increase health benefits for those in the Guard and Reserves who are \ncalled up, to improve their retirement situation, make sure they stay \nhealthy, make sure if they have a solely owned business and they get \ncalled up, they can at least have health care for their family.\n  I mention this again not because it is apropos to the legislation--I \ndo not see anybody else seeking recognition; I am not taking away from \nothers' time--but I hope those who are watching or listening to this \nwill read this article about what happens in rural America with these \ncallups.\n  In my State, the largest community is only 38,000 people. The town I \nlive in has about 1,500 people. They know everybody. I live on a dirt \nroad on the side of a mountain with magnificent views. Again, everybody \nis on a first-name basis. When somebody gets called up, you know it, \nyou feel it.\n  This is not a question about whether somebody is for or against the \nwar. In my State, everybody has supported those who have gone. Even \nthough I would suspect the majority of the people in Vermont are \nopposed to the war, they are all supportive of our troops. But it \nhurts. It is real. I hope we can bring them home soon.\n  I was heartened by the elections in Iraq. I was heartened by the \nefforts of those who would brave in some cases death to go out and \nvote. I hope those of us in our country who say it is going to be a \nhard time to vote today because it is raining or it is snowing or it is \ncold or it is hot or it is inconvenient to go those extra five blocks, \nor whatever the reason, look at what they did.\n  I hope that country will soon be able to take care of itself. We are \ngoing to spend huge amounts of money in this budget to build schools, \nimprove police forces, build communications, roads, and hospitals all \nin Iraq. We have those same needs at home. I hope soon they can be on \ntheir own. I hope soon our men and women can come home, as many safely \nas possible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \ndemonstrate just how out of balance the class action has become and to \nunderscore why we need to get this bill passed.\n  Before I do, I want to make it clear that I do not object to class \nlawsuits. Legitimate class action lawsuits are helpful, when they are \nlegitimate, when there is a good cause of action, when people really \nhave been abused.\n  Legitimate cause of actions do not have to seek out these favorable \njurisdictions where the law is stacked against the defendants, which is \nwhat this bill helps to cure. When they are legitimate and brought in \nthe best interest of the class members, class action lawsuits are a \nvital part of our judicial system. They can serve as a means to ensure \nthat injured parties who might otherwise go unrepresented have the \nopportunity to have their injuries redressed.\n  However, in recent years we have witnessed a disturbing trend where \nsome lawyers are bringing and settling class action lawsuits in which \nthe chief interests actually being served appear to be those of the \nlawyers and not the people for whom they are bringing the actions. Too \noften the plaintiffs' attorneys recover millions of dollars in \nattorney's fees while the class action members get little more than a \ncoupon, if that.\n  While we must acknowledge that there have been a few isolated \ninstances of abusive settlements in the Federal courts, these are the \nrare exception. By contrast, numerous examples of abusive class action \nsettlements\n\n[[Page S1178]]\n\noriginate from the State courts. As we have noted in the Judiciary \nCommittee report in the 108th Congress, the Class Action Fairness Act \nis a ``modest, balanced bill to address some of the most egregious \nproblems in class action practice.'' It is not, however ``intended to \nbe a panacea that will correct all class action abuses.''\n  This bill is the result of intense bipartisan negotiations and is our \nbest effort to address a problem that is pervading our State court \nsystem. Abuse of the class action system has reached a critical point, \nand it is time that we as a legislative body address the problem. The \npublic is increasingly aware of the system's unfairness. News programs, \nsuch as ABC's ``20/20,'' have covered the rise in class action \njurisdictions in certain magnet jurisdictions, magnet meaning \njurisdictions where these extortionate suits are brought because they \ncan get a tremendous advantage regardless of whether they are right or \nwrong.\n  Scores of editorials have called for actions in newspapers all across \nthis country. Abuse of the class action system has even become the \ninspiration for popular literature. In 2003, the author, John Grisham, \nreleased a book entitled ``The King of Torts.'' Grisham's novel takes \nits reader into the world of the mass tort/class action lawyer where \nclients are treated like chattel and bargaining chips. The value of a \npotential action is not measured by the merit of the claim but on the \nnumber of class members that can be rounded up. The end game is not the \npursuit of justice for the class members and clients, but in the \npursuit of a hefty attorney's fee.\n  Although Grisham's book is intended as fiction, it is hard to \ndistinguish it from the facts of our broken class action system.\n  Let me read a few passages:\n\n       Nobody earns ten million dollars in six months. . . . You \n     might win it, steal it, or have it drop out of the sky, but \n     nobody earns money like that. It's ridiculous and obscene.\n\n  Now this quote may come from a fictional story, but it is too often \ntoo close to the truth. This short novel written by Grisham \ndemonstrates the problems with our class action system all too well. As \nhis book shows, with drug manufacturers the sad but inevitable fact is \nthat people are injured every day in this country by products they buy, \nand justice does require that they receive just compensation for their \ninjuries.\n  Frequently, class actions are the best way to compensate large groups \nof injured consumers. Yet, Grisham's novel, ``The King of Torts,'' also \nshows that the financial reward of a settlement is so great that the \nclass action system has attracted a small group of unscrupulous lawyers \nwho will do anything, say anything, and sue anything or anybody--not to \nhelp their clients but to line their own pockets.\n  We keep hearing this is not a crisis, that not everyone is gaming the \nsystem. Everyone in this body knows, however, that a few bad apples can \nspoil the bunch. In this case, these few lawyers are hurting our civil \njustice system. This reform is one small step toward restoring some \nbalance to that system. What I have read in this work of fiction is too \noften fact today. Everybody knows it. Without question, many of today's \nclass actions are nothing more than business opportunities for some \nlawyers to strike it rich and too often they have little, if anything, \nto do with fairly compensating the injured class members.\n  Some law firms make no secret of this. One law firm actually states \non its Web site that it has brought over 24 nationwide class actions in \nMadison County, IL, a court notorious for approving settlements that \nbenefit the lawyers, and that it specializes in class actions that seek \nless than $500 in damages for class members. Plaintiffs beware.\n  I am told, for example, of a law firm that explicitly acknowledges \nthat the more potential class members there are to a claim, the more \nthe case is worth their while. Specifically, the ``frequently asked \nquestions'' section of their firm's Web site states:\n\n       More claimants means greater potential liability for \n     defendants. Because there is greater potential liability, \n     these lawsuits become worthwhile for lawyers to prosecute on \n     a contingent-fee basis.\n\n  Worthwhile, indeed. Worthwhile for the lawyers.\n  A small handful of wealthy lawyers is profiting from the class action \nsystem. According to an article appearing in the 2001-2002 edition of \nthe Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy five firms accounted for \nnearly half of the class action lawsuits filed in Madison County, IL, \nand Jefferson County, TX.\n  Of the lawsuits filed in these districts, many allege the same causes \nof action, represent the same class of plaintiffs that are brought \nagainst many of the same parties within an industry.\n  While these lawyers might have something to gain, the same cannot \nclearly be said with respect to plaintiffs, consumers, and those \nemployed by defendant companies, who lose their jobs as a result of \nthese types of lawsuits.\n  It is evident that a few key courts have been singled out by a small \ngroup of legal players in the class action world. This point is \nreinforced by a 2003 study conducted by the Institute for Civil \nJustice/RAND and funded jointly by the plaintiffs and defense bar to \ndetermine who gets the money in class action settlements. The study \nfound that in State court consumer class settlements, it is the class \ncounsel and not their clients who often walk away with a \ndisproportionate share of the settlement.\n  What do their clients get? Well, quite simply, not enough. I believe \nthat the many hard-working and honest class action lawyers should be \ncompensated for their hard work and efforts. The overwhelming number of \nlawyers are honorable people. They are honest. They are hard working. \nOnly a few are causing the lion's share of trouble. The majority of the \nhonest ones are not searching for jackpot jurisdictions where the \njudges and the lawyers are in cahoots and somehow always find against \nthe defendants.\n\n  I also believe such compensation should be reconcilable with a fair \nrecovery for the client. I have supported large recovery for trial \nlawyers when I thought it was justified. Quite honestly, it is simply \nnot right when our judicial system allows lawyers to walk away with \nmillions of dollars while in some cases their clients walk away with \nnothing more than a coupon good toward a future purchase of the very \nproduct that was the subject matter of the class action to begin with.\n  I do not know about my colleagues, but when I have a problem with a \nproduct, sometimes the last thing I want to do is buy that product or \nhave anything to do with the company or firm that makes that particular \nproduct. Frankly, keep your coupon and show me the money. If the \ncoupons were so good, one would expect the lawyers would request that \nthey be paid in coupons, not money.\n  In real life, we are too often reminded of the legendary fictional \ncase Jarndyce v. Jarndyce of Charles Dickens' ``Bleak House'' in which \nlegal fees ate up the whole estate so that the intended beneficiaries \ncould not benefit.\n  Consider the case of Degradi v. KB Holdings, Inc., in Cook County, \nIL. The suit alleged that KB Toys, one of the Nation's largest toy \nretailers, engaged in deceptive pricing practices in some of their \nproducts. Specifically, the suit alleged that the prices of certain \nproducts were marked to appear reduced when in fact the apparently \nreduced price was the market price.\n  In the settlement with KB Toys over these allegedly deceptive pricing \npractices, the toy store paid attorney's fees and costs of $1 million \nand not one dime of cash to class members. As part of the settlement, \nthe store held an unadvertised 30-percent-off sale on selected \nproducts. That is laughable. Under the terms of the settlement \nagreement, the toy retailer agreed to offer a 30-percent discount on \nselected products between October 8 and October 14, 2003. In other \nwords, they held a week-long sale that was not even publicly \nadvertised. By the time most of the class members learned about the \nsale, their opportunity to recover under the terms of the settlement \nhad passed.\n  In fact, an independent analyst stated that KB Toys would likely \nbenefit from the settlement because they were driving traffic. What did \nthe class counsel get? They got $1 million. Good work if one can get \nit, but not necessarily a good outcome for their clients.\n  Then there was the 1998 class action filed in Fulton County, GA, \nalleging\n\n[[Page S1179]]\n\nthat Coca-Cola improperly added sweeteners to apple juice. In this \nCoca-Cola case, in the settlement of a class action lawsuit alleging \nthat Coca-Cola improperly added sweeteners to apple juice, it was the \nlawyers who got a sweet deal--$1.5 million in fees and costs. \nUnfortunately, class members came up empty again, receiving 50-cent \ncoupons but no cash. So each of them got 50-cent coupons while the \nlawyers walked away with $1.5 million in attorney's fees.\n  As my colleagues know, I am a lawyer. In my practice, I represented \nboth plaintiffs and defendants. I have watched some of the greatest \nlawyers appear in court when I started to practice law in Pittsburgh, \nPA, such as James McArdle. When Jimmy McArdle tried a case, the \ncourtroom was always filled with young and old lawyers who wanted to \nwatch a master at work. He brought one of the first cases against the \ntobacco industry.\n  He lost that one, but it was the case that paved the way to clean up \nthe tobacco industry in this country.\n  I supported many of the tobacco class action lawyers because I \nthought what they did was in the best interests of their clients and \nthe American public. But this current class action system is out of \nwhack and needs to be fixed. I understand many of these classes are \ncomprised of hundreds if not thousands of members, and I do not \nbegrudge class action attorneys a reasonable fee award. But when the \nclass member gets a 50-cent coupon and the lawyers get $1.5 million \nbecause the company has to settle rather than take a chance of going on \nand getting killed in a forum-shopped court, then you can see why I am \nupset about this.\n  There is also the case of Scott v. Blockbuster, Inc. Blockbuster \nVideo was named as a defendant in 23 class action lawsuits brought by \nconsumers, alleging that they were charged excessive late movie return \nfees. In 2001, Blockbuster agreed to enter into a settlement agreement. \nUnder the terms of the settlement, which was approved by a Jefferson \nCounty, TX, State court, the class attorneys received approximately \n$9.25 million in attorney's fees while the class members received--you \nguessed it--coupons. Each class member got a $1-off, or buy one get one \nfree coupon. Experts have predicted only 20 percent of the class \nmembers will even redeem these coupons.\n  I am pleased the bill before us at least ties legal fees to the \nactual amount of redeemed coupons. If only 1,000 people redeem those $1 \ncoupons, the attorneys would be entitled to a percentage of that $1,000 \nbut not $9.25 million.\n  I have described a few of the many class action settlements streaming \nout of our State court system. Many State courts appear at times to be \nnothing more than rubberstamps for the lawyers' proposed settlement \nagreements. This is not civil justice.\n  In that Jefferson County case, the company, Blockbuster, had to \nsettle. They could not risk going to trial in that particular \njurisdiction because of the outrageous verdicts that are granted by \njurors who appear to be compromised.\n  This is akin to legalized extortion. Too often it appears that the \nchief interests served by these settlements are those of the class \ncounsel and not the class members. This bill does not prevent class \naction suits, but it does stop some of these excesses.\n  The Class Action Fairness Act would alleviate many of the problems \npresent in the current class action system by allowing truly national \nclass actions to be filed in or removed to Federal court. Some of our \ncolleagues have indicated the consumer will be lost here because they \nwill not be able to bring these cases. Give me a break. Of course they \nwill be able to bring these cases. But they have to be brought in a \nlegitimate way, in Federal court where it is much less likely that they \nwill be hammered by political judges who are in cahoots with the \nplaintiffs' lawyers in that jurisdiction. Federal courts as a general \nrule will adequately dispense justice in these matters. So the suits \ncan be brought. This will level the playing field that has become \ntilted in many jurisdictions in the last few years.\n  It also reforms the way Federal courts would approve proposed \nsettlements with basic requirements such as a hearing and a finding by \nthe court that the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate.\n  This is the second time the Class Action Fairness Act has come to the \nSenate floor, but we have been working on it for 6 years. When we \nfailed to achieve cloture by one vote in the preceding Congress--by one \nvote we failed to achieve cloture--we sat down with several Democratic \nSenators to reach bipartisan agreement on a bill. We know it is \ndifficult for them to work on this bill because the largest hard money \ncontributor to Democrats in the Senate happens to be the American Trial \nLawyers Association. Some people believe Democrats are owned by them. I \ndo not believe that. I know there are many wonderful lawyers in the \nAmerican Trial Lawyers Association. Most are decent, honorable people, \nand I know many of them. But there are some who are unscrupulous, and \nthey are the ones who have been fighting this reform. And they have the \nmeans to do so since they have become billionaires as a result of these \ncoupon cases won in jackpot jurisdictions.\n\n  The bill we are considering today is the result of all of these \nnegotiations. S. 5, the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, presents \nthis Congress with an opportunity to correct some of the dubious \npractices currently found in the class action system, and to protect \nthe average consumer.\n  The first response I have is that this amendment is based on a faulty \npremise. Federal courts do not have a hard and fast rule against \ncertifying multistate class actions. Rather, both Federal and State \ncourts conduct a fair, full inquiry before certifying a class, to \nensure that common legal issues predominate, as required by the Federal \nrule governing class actions. Put simply, this Bingaman-Feinstein \namendment, as amended by Senator Feinstein, would toss State laws and \nprocedural fairness out the window for the sake of allowing nationwide \nclass actions. It would reverse nearly 70 years of established Supreme \nCourt case law that requires Federal courts to apply the proper State \nlaws when they hear claims between citizens of different States.\n  It would reverse numerous decisions by State supreme courts rejecting \nthe application of one State's laws to class action claims that arise \nin 50 States, and it would seriously undermine the ability of \nplaintiffs and defendants alike to have a fair trial.\n  Most importantly, it would have the perverse effect of perpetuating \nthe very magnet court abuses that this legislation seeks to end. The \nreason for this requirement is self-evident. The whole point of a class \naction is to resolve a large number of similar claims at the same time. \nIf the differences among class members' legal claims are too great, a \nclass trial will not be fair or practical. In some circumstances, \nFederal courts have found that the law of different States was \nsufficiently similar that a class could go forward. In other cases, \nthey have found that the differences were too great to have a fair \nclass trial.\n  The proposed amendment would take away the discretion of Federal \njudges to make these important decisions. It is as though we do not \ntrust our Federal judges. In this case, we can trust them.\n  Proponents of the amendment conveniently ignore the fact that Federal \nlaw in this issue is quite consistent with the approach taken by \nnumerous State supreme courts which have refused to certify cases where \nthe differences in State law would make it impossible to have a fair \nand manageable trial.\n  In fact, the proposed amendment would reverse decisions by the \nSupreme Courts of California, Texas, New York, and numerous other \nStates that have rejected nationwide class actions under such \ncircumstances.\n  Second of all, Federal courts already use subclassing where \nappropriate. Subclassing basically means dividing a class into a couple \nof smaller classes whose claims are similar. Rule 23 of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure, the nearly 40-year-old rule governing class \nactions, explicitly gives courts the option to use subclasses to \naccount for variations in a class as long as the class would still be \nmanageable and fair--for example, if a case involves State law that can \neasily be divided into three or four groups, subclassing would be \nappropriate if the trial would otherwise be manageable. At the same \ntime, if subclassing were used in every\n\n[[Page S1180]]\n\nsituation that involves different State laws, in some cases there would \nbe so many subclasses that it would be impossible to have a manageable \nor even a fair trial.\n  Under current law, Federal judges have discretion to decide when \nsubclassing makes sense.\n  This approach is working. Why would we change it?\n  The amendment not only changes it but makes it even worse.\n  Finally, the amendment would hurt consumers by subverting State law. \nThe proposed amendment suggests that if subclassing will not work, the \ncourts should simply respect State laws to the extent practical. What \ndoes that mean? How does a court partially carry out a State law? \nJudges are responsible for carrying out the law, period--not for \ncarrying out the law to the extent practical.\n  By suggesting the Federal courts should ignore variations in State \nlaws when respected State law is impractical, this provision would \nperpetuate the very problem that the class action bill is trying to \nfix. For example, in the notorious Avery vs. State Farm case, a county \njudge applied Illinois law to claims that arose throughout the country, \nruling that insurers could not use aftermarket parts in making auto \naccident repairs even though several States had passed laws encouraging \nand even requiring the use of these more economical parts to keep down \nthe costs of insurance premiums. The approach taken by the Avery \njudge--condoned by the proposed amendment--hurts consumers by denying \nthem the protection of their State laws.\n  Some State legislatures have adopted particularly strong laws in \ncertain areas because their citizens have expressed strong feelings \nabout those issues--for example, privacy or consumer fraud. Under this \namendment, citizens of such States will not be entitled to the \nprotection of their States laws in nationwide class actions. Instead, \ntheir claims will be subject to some compromise law created by a judge \nwho allowed for a class action trial. That is not justice. That is not \ngood law. That is not a good way to approach things. That is not good \nprocedure.\n  For all of these reasons I urge our colleagues to vote against the \nBingaman-Feinstein amendment and keep this bill intact. We also know \nthat should that amendment pass, this bill is dead. One more time, it \nwill be dead. I hope we have enough Senators who realize the importance \nof getting this bill through and getting these egregious harms \nstraightened out to pass this bill without amendment.\n  Let me refer one more time to Dickie Scruggs' comments which he made \nat a luncheon--``Asbestos for Lunch''--which was a panel discussion at \nthe Prudential Securities Financial Research and Regulatory Conference \non June 11, 2002, in New York.\n  I happen to admire Dickie Scruggs. He is very sharp. He is smart. He \nhas made a billion dollars from practicing law, and I think he has made \nit legitimately--mainly in the tobacco cases. I have worked very \nclosely with the attorneys in those cases. I have a lot of respect for \nhim. He is an honest man.\n  When this honest man, a top trial lawyer, one of the best in the \ncountry, who is a plaintiffs' lawyer, who has brought class actions, \nwho understands the whole system better than those lawyers, says this, \nI think we ought to pay attention to it. Here is what he said at that \nluncheon, and he is one of the leading plaintiffs' lawyers in the \ncountry. He said:\n\n     [w]hat I call the ``magic jurisdictions'' . . . [is] where \n     the judiciary is elected with verdict money.\n\n  What does he mean by that? He means the attorneys make so much money \nthat they in turn can give a small percentage of that money to these \njudges so they can get elected and reelected. So there is an interest \nin the courts in making sure the attorneys make a lot of money so they \ncan get their share to be reelected.\n  Let me start at the beginning again. It is best heard in full. Here \nis what Dickie Scruggs said:\n\n     [W]hat I call the ``magic jurisdictions, . . . [is] where the \n     judiciary is elected with verdict money. The trial lawyers \n     have established relationships with the judges that are \n     elected; they're State Court judges; they're popul[ists]. \n     They've got large populations of voters who are in on the \n     deal, they're getting their [piece] in many cases. And so, \n     it's a political force in their jurisdiction, and it's almost \n     impossible to get a fair trial if you're a defendant in some \n     of these places. The plaintiff lawyer walks in there and \n     writes the number on the blackboard, and the first juror \n     meets the last one coming out the door with that amount of \n     money . . . The cases are not won in the courtroom. They're \n     won on the back roads long before the case goes to trial. Any \n     lawyer fresh out of law school can walk in there and win the \n     case, so it doesn't matter what the evidence or the law is.\n\n  He said it better than anybody on this floor has said it. And he is a \ntrial lawyer. He said it is almost impossible to get a fair trial if \nyou are a defendant in some of these places. He is talking about \nMadison County, IL, Jefferson County, TX, jurisdictions in Mississippi, \nand other jurisdictions throughout the country. I do not want to name \nthem all. The fact is that is what he is talking about. It is \nimpossible to get a fair trial.\n  I wonder. I have heard my colleagues come on the Senate floor and say \nthere were only two cases a year in Madison County. Come on. That \nignores all the threatened cases, demand letters, and settled cases for \nwhat are basically defense costs--whatever it costs the company to hire \ntheir law firm to defend them because they cannot afford to go to a \nverdict in that particular jurisdiction because that verdict money is \nwhat supports the judges to begin with. They are as interested as \nanybody in making sure that those verdicts are big, even if they are \nunjust.\n  That is what this is all about--and the Bingaman amendment, as \namended by my dear friend, Senator Feinstein from California, continues \nto perpetuate this system.\n  This is not an overwhelming antilawyer bill. This is not an \noverwhelming bill that takes away consumers' rights. In fact, it is not \na bill that takes away consumers' rights at all. This is not a bill \nthat is unfair. This is a bill that will straighten out these \negregious, wrongful actions by some of these jurisdictions by putting \nthese important cases in courts where it is much more likely that \njustice will prevail. That is what this bill does. It will not prevent \nanybody from suing. It will not prevent anybody from recovering. It is \njust that these cases will be tried in Federal jurisdictions in these \nvery prestigious Federal courts, as they should be because of the \ndiversity problems that are presented by these cases, and it is much \nmore likely that we will have less fraud, less unfairness, less jackpot \njustice in the Federal courts than lawyers are allowed to forum shop \nthem in remote counties with little attachment to the parties.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            amendment no. 2\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to support \nthis amendment to exclude civil rights and wage and hour cases from the \nbill's provisions on removal of cases to Federal court. Working \nAmericans and victims of discrimination seeking justice under State \nlaws don't deserve to have the doors of justice slammed on such claims, \nbut that is exactly what this bill will do.\n  All of us know that families across the country are struggling to \nmake ends meet. We cannot ignore that they are too often hurt by the \ndenial of a fair wage, or by unfair discrimination. We cannot tell the \nvictims of these practices that Congress does not care about this \nenormous problem.\n  This amendment is needed, because the harm suffered by plaintiffs in \nState civil rights and labor cases is real, devastating, and personal--\nnot the sort of harm that results in a few dollars of damages or a \ncoupon settlement.\n  We have been told that this bill was designed to correct the problem \nof class actions in which plaintiffs get only a few dollars for minor \nclaims, while elite attorneys earn million-dollar fees. We have yet to \nhear one example of that happening in a civil rights case or a labor \ncase. We certainly haven't heard anything to suggest there is a major \nproblem in those areas.\n  Some have said it is too late to raise these concerns about civil \nrights and workers' rights. We have been told that\n\n[[Page S1181]]\n\ntoo much work has gone into this legislation to consider these issues \nnow. But it is always the right time to stand up for principle.\n  In its current form, this bill is just another example of the \nadministration's misguided priorities--putting the interests of big \ncompanies ahead of America's working families. Why should Congress \nprotect companies that violate State laws by engaging in discrimination \nor exploiting low wage workers, while making it harder for victims of \nthose practices to get relief in court? Those are the wrong priorities, \nand we cannot ignore that problem.\n  We can't turn our backs on victims of discrimination such as Kathleen \nRudolph. She and other working women in Florida brought a class action \nalleging sexual harassment. These women provided health care and other \nservices to inmates in State prisons. They told the court they had \nsuffered almost daily sexual harassment from male inmates, and prison \nofficials failed to stop it. What sense does it make to force a case \nlike that to go to a Federal district court?\n  The same principle applies to wage and hour laws. A fair day's work \ndeserves a fair day's wage. State wage-and-hour laws provide basic \nprotections to workers, particularly now, as companies continue to \nimprove their bottom lines by pressuring workers to work off the clock. \nA recent New York Times article described the growing phenomenon of \nlow-wage workers in many fields, including hairstylists, supermarket \ncashiers, and call center workers, being forced to work without \nrecording their full hours.\n  These workers are denied overtime pay, and in many cases, working \nextra hours means they don't even earn the minimum wage. Many of these \nworkers refuse to underreport their hours, and they are punished for \nnot doing so. One manager interviewed by the New York Times admitted:\n\n       Working off the clock was a condition of a call service \n     representative's employment. Hourly workers who complained \n     were weeded out and terminated.\n\n  Professor Eileen Applebaum of Rutgers University emphasized that \nworkers have little choice but to go along. She said, ``One big reason \nfor off-the-clock work is that people are really worried about their \njobs.''\n  Congress should not take away the right of these workers to recover \nthe wages they are owed. Locking the courthouse door against them will \nhurt people such as Nancy Braun and Debbie Simonson, who worked at a \nnational discount chain in Minnesota. They were constantly forced to \nwork through their meal breaks and work off the clock. They and workers \nlike them would not be able to recover their wages without a class \naction. We should not put more barriers in the way of their pursuit of \njustice.\n  The new Federal overtime rule that takes away overtime from so many \nFederal workers means that State-law overtime protections are more \nimportant than ever. This is particularly true in States such as \nIllinois, which have wage-and-hour laws similar to the Federal law, and \nhave explicitly rejected the new Federal regulations.\n  With 8 million Americans out of work, and so many other families \nstruggling to make ends meet, cutbacks in overtime are an unfair burden \nthat America's workers should not have to bear. Overtime pay accounts \nfor about 25 percent of the income for those who work overtime, and \nworkers denied that protection routinely end up working longer hours \nfor less pay.\n  Employers are all too ready to classify workers as not eligible for \novertime. Warren Dubrow and Sam O'Lear discovered that problem when \nthey worked in Orange County, CA, as service mangers at an automotive \nchain.\n  They often had to work more than 50 hours a week. Yet they were \ndenied overtime pay because their employer called them ``managers.'' \nNever mind that they spent most of their time on nonsupervisory tasks \nlike greeting customers, filling out order forms, and even changing \ntires. In State court, they and thousands of their fellow service \nmanagers won the right to overtime pay under State laws providing that \nworkers who spend more than half their time on non-managerial tasks are \nentitled to overtime. Why should a Federal court be required to hear a \ncase like that?\n  This isn't just a matter of moving civil rights cases and labor cases \nto a different forum. The real effect is much more harmful. Too often, \nmoving these cases to Federal courts will mean they are never heard at \nall because strict Federal rules for class certification will prevent \nthe plaintiffs from being approved as a class. If a Federal court \ndecides not to certify the class, that is probably the end of the case, \nbecause many members of class action lawsuits can't afford to pursue \ntheir cases individually. Extended litigation in Federal court is too \nexpensive for low wage workers and victims of discrimination, many of \nwhom live paycheck to paycheck. Defendant companies are eager to throw \nsand in the gears of the law, and Congress shouldn't be encouraging \nthem.\n  There has been some confusion during this debate about whether the \nclass action bill would really move cases involving local events into \nFederal courts. Yesterday, the distinguished Senator from Utah \nquestioned whether cases based on truly local events would really be \naffected by the class action bill. Let there be no doubt, it will \nhappen if the current bill isn't modified.\n  If 100 Alabama workers bring a class action case under Alabama law \nfor job discrimination that took place in Alabama, the employer can \nstill use this bill to drag the case into Federal court if the employer \ncompany is incorporated outside the State. The same is true if low-wage \nworkers are denied fair pay in their home State. As long as an employer \nis incorporated out of State, that employer can move the case into \nFederal court.\n  Section 4 of the bill allows a case to stay in State court only if a \nprimary defendant is a ``citizen'' of the same State as the plaintiffs \nwho brought the case. Companies are citizens of the State where they \nare incorporated, regardless of where they do business. As a result, \nplaintiffs who file a case in State court against a company with \noffices in their home State could quickly find their case in Federal \ncourt if the company is incorporated somewhere else.\n  That will affect a huge number of State law cases. To show the scale \nof this problem, let's look at the figures. More than 308,000 companies \nare incorporated in Delaware, including 60 percent of the Fortune 500 \nfirms and 50 percent of the corporations listed on the New York Stock \nExchange. Most of these companies also do business in many other \nStates. But plaintiffs in those other States will not be able to file \ncases against these companies without being dragged into Federal court. \nThat result violates basic fairness and common sense.\n  The Senator from Utah also suggested that this amendment isn't \nnecessary to protect victims of discrimination because Federal courts \nhave traditionally been defenders of civil rights.\n  Federal courts do perform the important job of protecting civil \nrights under Federal law and the U.S. Constitution. No one is \nquestioning that. This amendment wouldn't change the fact that Federal \ncivil rights claims can be decided by Federal courts. Nor would it \nexempt Federal civil rights or Federal wage and hour cases from the \nother requirements of this bill, such as the requirement that \nappropriate Government officials be notified of class action \nsettlements.\n  This amendment does only one thing. It leaves in place the current \nrules governing removal of civil rights and labor cases filed under \nState or local laws. When States are ahead of the Federal Government in \ngiving their citizens greater protection than Federal law--as several \nStates have done in the area of genetic discrimination and \ndiscrimination based on marital status--State courts, not Federal \ncourts, should interpret those laws.\n  The Senator from Utah suggested that this amendment isn't necessary \nbecause civil rights cases are filed under Federal laws. That is not \naccurate. There are many Federal class actions, but there are also many \nemerging areas in which victims of discrimination are seeking relief \nthrough State law class actions.\n  Sexual harassment cases are often brought in State courts under State \nlaw, like Kathleen Rudolph's case which I mentioned earlier.\n  Many civil rights class actions can only be brought under State law \nbecause there is no Federal law on the\n\n[[Page S1182]]\n\nparticular issue involved. That is true for genetic discrimination. It \nis true for discrimination based on marital status, parental status, \nand citizenship status. Those types of discrimination are prohibited \nunder many State laws, but not yet under Federal law.\n  If we don't let State courts develop these emerging protections under \nState laws, we are stacking the deck against workers and victims of \ndiscrimination. That is because Federal courts have said, time and time \nand time again, that they will interpret State laws narrowly.\n  The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, faced with opposing \ninterpretations of State law, has ruled that it will ``choose the \nnarrower interpretation that restricts liability.'' The First and Third \nCircuits have made similar rulings. There is no question that Federal \ncourts are more likely than State courts to rule against plaintiffs in \ninterpreting State law. Federal judges have said so themselves. Moving \nthese cases into Federal courts will put a Federal thumb on the scale \nin favor of companies that violate the law.\n  We can't let that happen. I urge all of my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle, and on both sides of the class action debate, to support \nthis amendment. This legislation is supposed to reduce class action \nabuses, not add new abuses.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Kennedy \namendment that would exclude labor class actions from the scope of S. \n5. At the outset, I have serious problems with any of the carve-out \namendments to S. 5. These amendments are part of an effort by opponents \nof the bill to mischaracterize S. 5 as anticonsumer and to make it \nappear that some of these carve-outs and exceptions are necessary to \nprevent injustice. But, Mr. President, S. 5 is a good deal across the \nboard. It is going to improve class actions for consumers, for workers, \nfor our economy, and for businesses. Why should American workers be \ndenied its benefits? Why would people who have a labor dispute not want \nto have that dispute settled in a Federal court under these superior \nprocedures?\n  S. 5 will keep most labor cases in State court, anyway. The act \nincludes two exceptions--the home State exception, and the local \ncontroversy exception--that are intended to keep most local class \nactions in State court. That means if local residents sue a local \nemployer, the case will probably stay in State court, anyway.\n  Second, any labor class actions that will be removable to Federal \ncourt under the bill would still be governed by State law. This is not \nunusual. It is done all the time in Federal court. Nothing in the act \nchanges substantive law in any way. It does not strip any worker of any \nright to seek redress for a labor violation. It creates no new defense \nfor corporate defendants in time-shaving cases or otherwise. In short, \nworkers who bring State labor claims after the Act passes--and I expect \nthat it will--will have the exact same rights they have now.\n  Third, Federal courts have frequently certified overtime class \nactions. Some critics have said they are worried about Federal courts \nrefusing to certify employee claims, but that is not true.\n  A recent study by the Federal Judicial Center found that class \nactions generally ``are almost equally likely to be certified'' in \nState and Federal court.\n\n  Certification, of course, is when a Federal court agrees that a class \naction should be tried as a class action. A lawyer can't go in and \ndeclare, I am representing a whole class of people, without some \nfinding that there is a class that has been similarly wronged, or there \nis a similar litigation issue at stake.\n  A review of these decisions in Federal court found numerous examples \nof Federal judges certifying wage-labor class actions. For example, a \nFederal court in New York recently certified a State labor law class \naction on behalf of employees of a chain of natural food stores, many \nof whom were immigrants, who claimed they were not properly compensated \nfor their overtime claims. The Federal judge accepted that case.\n  A Federal court in New York also certified a class of delivery \npersons and dispatchers at a drugstore chain who alleged they were not \npaid the minimum wage or overtime in violation of New York law. That \nwas already accepted under current law, and it certainly would not \nchange under this.\n  We made some efforts to improve the overtime laws in the Federal \nrules with regard to it. I have personally, as a private practitioner, \nrepresented two clients in wage cases involving overtime. The reason \nthose cases were litigated is because the laws are not clear about what \novertime is and what it is not. Nor is the law clear as to who is \nentitled to overtime and who is not. That needs to be clarified, and I \nsalute the President for his attempt to do so. That is a parenthetical \ncomment.\n  In a multidistrict litigation proceeding in the Federal court in \nOregon, a Federal court certified seven State law classes brought by \nclaims representatives against an insurance company, alleging they were \nimproperly classified as exempt. In a case in Federal court in \nIllinois, the judge certified a class of employees who said their \nemployer violated State law by failing to pay them for time spent \nloading trucks and driving to sites.\n  So the judge certified a class of employees who were making a claim \nin Federal court for violation of State labor laws. Judges will try \nthat case based on whether it violated State law.\n  In a case in Washington State, the district court certified a class \nof meat processing plant employees who accused their employer of \nfailing to pay them for work at the beginning and end of each day when \nthey were on meal breaks. This is a constant source of litigation in \nthese types of cases.\n  I would suggest that the argument that Federal courts will not \ncertify class actions in wage and hour cases is not correct.\n  Finally, Mr. President, contrary to what has been suggested today, \nFederal courts have a long record of protecting workers in employment \nclass actions. Congress has passed strong laws, such as title VII, that \nwere specifically crafted to give workers access to Federal courts so \nthey could bring employment discrimination cases in a fair forum.\n  We have always believed Federal court is a fair, objective forum for \npeople who have been discriminated against, whether they claim \nemployment rights or civil rights.\n  As a result, Federal courts already have jurisdiction over most \nemployment discrimination and pension claims, and their record is in \nsharp contrast to courts such as in Madison County, IL, and Jefferson \nCounty, TX.\n  Which courts system oversaw the Home Depot gender discrimination case \nsettlement that paid class members about $65 million? Which courts \noversaw the $192 million Coca-Cola race discrimination settlement in \nwhich each class member was guaranteed a recovery of at least $38,000?\n  The answer to both is these were Federal court cases, not magnet \nState courts that to often look out for lawyers instead of consumers.\n  In sum, the only class of workers that will be negatively affected by \nS. 5 is the trial lawyers who will no longer be able to bring major \nnationwide class actions in their favorite county court. For everyone \nelse, S. 5 is a win-win proposition that will put an end to class \naction abuse while protecting consumers who seek to bring legitimate \nclass actions.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment and those other carve-\nout amendments that are being introduced.\n  Senator Kennedy has also added to his amendment, the employer-worker \nrights cases, the civil rights carve-out. I would like to make a few \npoints about the civil rights cases.\n  The amendment, as I understand it, would exclude from the reach of \nthis bill all class actions involving civil rights--all of them. It \nshould be defeated for several reasons.\n  First, an amendment that would affirmatively exclude civil rights \ncases from Federal jurisdiction would be contrary to a long tradition \nof encouraging the availability of our Federal courts to address civil \nrights claims.\n\n[[Page S1183]]\n\n  Indeed, we have on the books several statutes that are intended to \nensure that Federal civil rights cases can be heard in Federal courts. \nIt has long been recognized that Federal courts, by virtue of their \nindependence from political pressure, provide a more objective, \nhospitable forum for civil rights cases than State courts.\n  One statute that permits removal to Federal court for a broad range \nof civil rights actions is 28 U.S.C. 1443. A second statute, 28 U.S.C. \n1343, provides broad Federal jurisdiction over a whole host of civil \nrights claims. For example, any action ``for injury to person or \nproperty or because of the deprivation of any right or privilege of a \ncitizen of the United States,'' any action ``to recover damages or to \nsecure equitable or other relief under any Act of Congress providing \nfor the protection of civil rights.''\n  Indeed, that section provides original Federal jurisdiction over any \naction ``to redress the deprivation, under color of any State law, \nstatute, ordinance, regulation, custom or usage, of any right, \nprivilege, or immunity secured by the Constitution of the United States \nor by any Act of Congress providing for equal rights of citizens.''\n  Would this amendment take those from State court? I do not think that \nis healthy, and I do not think that is what we should do.\n  Second, contrary to the sponsor's assertion, the bill will not \ndiscourage people from bringing class actions by prohibiting \nsettlements that provide named plaintiffs full relief for their claims. \nThe answer to this contention is simple: There is no such provision in \nthe bill. Indeed, the bill does not contain any provisions that will \nchange claimants' substantive rights to recovery in any respect. The \n``consumer bill of rights'' provisions of the bill used to include a \nsection that prohibited the payment of excessive ``bounties'' to class \nrepresentatives. The rationale for that provision was to protect the \nclass members. However, because of concern from the civil rights \ncommunity about that provision being potentially misused, we have \ndeleted that provision from the bill.\n  Finally, contrary to the position of the amendment's proponents, the \nbill will not impose new, burdensome and unnecessary requirements on \ncivil rights litigants and the federal courts.\n  The provision of the bill requiring that certain public officials be \nnotified about proposed settlements will not delay the approval of \nsettlements. The period allowed for commentary from public officials is \nconsistent with the time that it normally takes to get settlement \nnotices to class members and conduct the ``fairness hearing'' process \nto obtain judicial approval of a proposed settlement.\n  The whole purpose of this additional requirement is to ensure that \nproposed settlements are fully scrutinized to protect the interests of \nthe unnamed class members.\n  This bill protects the rights of civil rights plaintiffs.\n  It should not be amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired en bloc.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair. I urge the amendment be defeated. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes remain.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself such time.\n  Mr. President, a point has been raised by those who are opposed to \nthis amendment that there have been examples where issues affecting \nworking conditions have been considered in the Federal courts and, \ntherefore, we should not be so concerned. That misses the point.\n  The fact is, we know of a number of cases that have been referred to \nFederal courts and the Federal courts have been uncertain as to which \nway to rule. Therefore, they have made a judgment consistently to have \nthe narrowest possible interpretation. Narrowest possible \ninterpretation means workers are going to get shortchanged on wages and \nworking conditions. That is what it means.\n  Why take it away from the local jurisdiction? We know the same \nargument with regard to civil rights. We all understand and respect the \nfact that when it comes to constitutional rights or interpreting the \nlaws that have been passed here with Federal guarantees there is going \nto be Federal jurisdiction. But that ignores the basic fact that in a \nnumber of the States there have been enhancements of civil rights. The \nStates have made those judgments. Judges understand that. They \nunderstand what has been considered by the legislature. They know what \nthe temperament of the legislation is all about.\n  Why take away those protections? This legislation does so. Quite \nfrankly, those areas of workers' rights and civil rights were never \nreally thought about as being the major reason for this legislation. \nThey represent about 10 percent of the total class action, but they do \ninvolve protecting workers and workers' rights and they do involve \nprotecting the basic civil rights which the States have enhanced over \nthe Federal laws.\n  Why are we going to take away from the States the opportunity, the \npower, the authority, to go ahead and interpret that? That is going to \nbe unfair to those individuals who ought to have the protection. This \nis going to provide less protection for workers, less protection for \ntheir wages and their working conditions, and it is going to put at \nrisk the kinds of protections that States have decided should be there \nto protect their citizens in the area of civil rights. It makes no \nsense, and I would certainly hope that our amendment would be accepted.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I understand I have 1 minute to \ndiscuss\n\n[[Page S1184]]\n\nthe amendment before the Senate. This amendment is on behalf of Senator \nBingaman and myself. It essentially deals with an issue that emerged in \nthe consideration of the class action bill.\n  I am a supporter of the class action bill. However, there is a \nloophole. That loophole is with class action consumer-related cases. \nThey could go to a Federal judge, and the Federal judge could say the \nvarious laws of the 50 States are so complex he cannot decide on a \ngiven law. Then the class action remains in limbo. It cannot go back to \nState court.\n  This is a compromise between Senator Bingaman and myself. It \nessentially says the judge can either issue subclassifications as \ndetermined necessary to permit the action to proceed or, if that is \nimpractical, look at other courses, including the plaintiff's State \nlaws.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, there is no loophole in this bill. This \namendment would force the Federal courts to certify dissimilar and \nunmanageable claims, which is the problem occurring in certain magnet \nState courts right now. This is a fairness and a due process problem. \nThis is not really a compromise at all. It defeats the purpose of the \nbill.\n  The amendment tells courts to ignore State law and forget about \nfairness just so a class can be certified. It would require courts to \nsubclass even where it would be unwieldy and impractical.\n  If you want to stop the abuses and pass class action reform, you will \noppose this amendment. This underlying bill is the compromise.\n  Mr. CARPER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It is my understanding that shortly \nSenator Feingold will be offering his amendment, and then we will \ndebate that amendment tonight. We will have the vote on that amendment \ntomorrow at some time. We will have discussions with the Democratic \nleadership and Senator Feingold in terms of time. Thus, we will have no \nmore rollcall votes tonight. The next rollcall vote I expect will be on \nthe Feingold amendment sometime tomorrow.\n  With that, the prospects of finishing this bill tomorrow at a very \nreasonable time--hopefully, midafternoon or early afternoon--are very \ngood, very positive. There are lots of other discussions and issues \nthat have to be dealt with, and I encourage they be dealt with later \nthis afternoon and into the evening, tonight, and tomorrow morning so \nwe can bring this bill to closure.\n  We were just remarking, it has been a real pleasure, in terms of the \napproach of this bill--a bipartisan bill, amendments being debated in a \ntimely way, people being able to express themselves--but bringing the \nbill to closure at an appropriate point, to me, is very constructive \nand very positive. I thank my colleagues for that.\n  Thus, the next rollcall vote will be tomorrow at some point. No more \nrollcall votes tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To establish time limits for action by Federal district \n  courts on motions to remand cases that have been removed to Federal \n                                 court)\n\n       On page 22, strike line 22 and all that follows through \n     page 23, line 4, and insert the following:\n       ``(1) In general.--Section 1447 shall apply to any removal \n     of a case under this section, except that--\n       ``(A) not later than 60 days after the date on which a \n     motion to remand is made, the district court shall--\n       ``(i) complete all action on the motion; or\n       ``(ii) issue an order explaining the court's reasons for \n     not ruling on the motion within the 60 day period;\n       ``(B) not later than 180 days after the date on which a \n     motion to remand is made, the district court shall complete \n     all action on the motion unless all parties to the proceeding \n     agree to an extension; and\n       ``(C) notwithstanding section 1447(d), a court of appeals \n     may accept an appeal from an order of a district court \n     granting or denying a motion to remand a class action to the \n     State court from which it was removed if application is made \n     to the court of appeals not less than 7 days after entry of \n     the order.''\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, if we are going to pass this bill, I \nthink we should do all we can to ensure citizens get their day in court \npromptly, whether it is in a Federal court or a State court. We are all \nfamiliar with the adage that justice delayed is justice denied. So we \ncannot let this bill become a vehicle for delay.\n  The bill includes complicated requirements for determining which \ncases can be removed to Federal court. We need to make sure the cases \nthat belong in State court under this bill do not get caught up in some \nkind of procedural wrangling that would effectively deny justice to the \nplaintiffs through delay.\n  Current Federal court practice allows a case filed in a State court \nto be automatically removed to Federal court by the filing of a notice \nof removal. If a party believes the case does not belong in Federal \ncourt, it can then remove in Federal court to remand or return the case \nto the State court.\n  Under current law, when a Federal district court decides to grant a \nmotion to remand the case back to State court, right now that order is \nnot appealable. S. 5, the bill before us, makes such orders appealable \nfor the first time in over a century. Due to the efforts of Senator \nSchumer, Senator Dodd, and Senator Landrieu, the bill requires the \ncourt of appeals to decide appeals of remand orders within 60 days \nunless the parties agree otherwise. This 60-day time limit recognizes \nthat there is a potential for delay that these newly permitted appeals \ncould cause and that there is a need for courts to resolve quickly at \nthe appellate level the issue of where a case will be heard.\n  I strongly support this idea of a time limit for decisions on \nappeals. But it\n\n[[Page S1185]]\n\nalso highlights another great potential for delay that is caused by \nthis bill. Before that 60-day clock begins to run on an appeal, the \ndistrict court must first rule on the motion to remand the case to \nState court. Unfortunately, some courts take a great deal of time to \ndecide motions to remand. The result is simply putting a case in limbo.\n  Take, for example, the case of Lizana v. DuPont. In this case, cancer \nvictims in Mississippi allege they became sick because they lived next \ndoor to a DuPont manufacturing plant. DuPont then removed the case to \nFederal court on January 21, 2003, and the victims then moved to remand \nthe case to State court. The Federal district court finally granted the \nvictims' motion, a year after the motion to remand was filed.\n  In an Oklahoma case called Gibbons v. Sprint, a group of consumers \nfiled a case against Sprint for installing cable lines across their \nland without giving proper notice or paying compensation to the \nlandowners. Sprint then removed the case to Federal court. A remand \nmotion was filed on October 4, 1999, and was granted, but only after a \ndelay of nearly a year.\n  These are real-life examples of how an improper removal can end up \ndelaying a case for a significant period of time. By rewriting \ndiversity jurisdiction rules in this bill, we are handing defendants a \ntool for delay, even if they do not actually qualify to have their \ncases removed. So we need to make sure that in cases that are removed \nfrom State courts as a result of this bill, remand motions are decided \npromptly. At the very least, we should require that the courts review \nthese motions and decide them quickly, if they can.\n  The amendment that I offered in the Judiciary Committee would have \nplaced a 60-day time limit on district court consideration of motions \nto remand. This is the same limit that the new bill places on courts of \nappeals when decisions on motions to remand are appealed.\n  My committee also adopted the other components of the bill's \nprovision on appeals. It allowed all parties to agree to an extension \nof any length and allows the court to take an additional 10 days for \ngood cause shown. If courts of appeals are going to be required to rule \non appeals of decisions on motions to remand in short order, I thought \nwe should require district courts to make those decisions just as \nquickly. That way, we could be sure that removals will not be used as a \ntool for delay.\n\n  On Monday, the Judicial Conference sent a letter to the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee concerning my amendment. Not surprisingly, it \nopposes the amendment. The Judicial Conference historically has \nopposed, as it says in its letter, ``statutory imposition of litigation \npriority, expediting requirements, or time limitation rules in \nspecified types of civil cases.''\n  In other words, judges do not like being told by Congress how to \nprioritize their cases or how quickly they should do their work. And I \ndo not blame them. But we do it when we think it is important. And here \nwe are sending a potentially large new number of cases to Federal \ncourt. We are increasing the workload of the Federal courts, making it \nmore likely cases will be delayed because of crowded dockets.\n  What the committee amendment did was to require the courts to quickly \nassess whether a case belongs in Federal court, whether this bill \napplies to it. I do not think that amendment of mine was unreasonable \nat all.\n  On the other hand, I am sympathetic to the concern expressed by the \nJudicial Conference that in some cases 60 days may not be enough time \nto decide the motion. Its letter points out that, in some cases, an \nevidentiary hearing might be required and the time to fully brief the \nmotion may exhaust a portion of this 60-day period. My committee \namendment allowed for an automatic 10-day extension and an extension of \nany amount if both sides agree.\n  I have read the letter from the Judicial Conference and I am trying \nto come to a reasonable solution. I accept the possibility that the \nchanges I have made to date perhaps are not enough. So I am not wedded \nto the 60-day period itself. What I am wedded to is the idea that these \nmotions should not be permitted to languish unexamined for months and \nmonths. I have made further modifications to the amendment that I \noffered in committee in the hope that the sponsors of the bill would be \nwilling to work with me to reach an accommodation on this issue.\n  The amendment I have proposed on the floor requires the district \ncourt to do one of two things within 60 days of a motion to remand \nbeing filed. First, the court can decide the motion. I hope many, if \nnot most, motions to remand could be decided that quickly. But under my \namendment before the body, the court has another option under this \namendment. It can issue an order within a 60-day time period indicating \nwhy a decision within that time cannot be made. Perhaps the reason is \nthat the factual record cannot be completed within that time, or that \nother pressing matters must receive priority in light of the court's \nfull docket. The amendment does not presume to specify what reasons are \ngood or adequate reasons. The justification is entirely within the \ncourt's discretion, but it must give some explanation, some reason in \nan order that would be issued within this 60-day period.\n  If such an order is issued, the court is then allowed, under the \namendment before the body, to issue a decision up to 180 days after the \nfiling of the motion. That gives the court a full 6 months to make a \ndecision. I argue that should be enough time for even the most complex \nof remand motions. Once again, an extension of any length is permitted \nif all the parties to the case agree.\n  I believe these changes more than address the concerns raised by the \nJudicial Conference, but they also make sure that a remand motion will \nnot languish for more than 6 months because the court simply has not \ngotten around to it.\n  My hope is that the requirement that an order be issued within the 60 \ndays will make it more likely that the court will devote enough time to \nthe motion to realize that it is possible for a final decision to be \nreached within that time. If more time is needed, 180 days should be \nmore than sufficient.\n  A 6-month time limit will not cause undue hardship to our Federal \ncourts. For those who doubt that removal will become a tool for delay, \nlet me call their attention to testimony before the House Judiciary \nCommittee by legal scholar Theodore Eisenberg of Cornell Law School. \nProfessor Eisenberg testified that his research has found that even \nthough the number of class action lawsuits is declining, efforts to \nremove cases are not. More importantly, he found that remand rates are \nincreasing over time.\n  In recent years, more than 20 percent of diversity tort cases removed \nto Federal court have been remanded to State court. Now, that means \nthat one out of five removals are improper. We have no way of knowing \nwhat will happen under this bill. Perhaps some of the 20 percent will \nnow be properly removed to Federal court. But given the complexity of \nthe bill's new requirements, I think it is safe to assume that a \nsignificant number of removals will still turn out to be improper.\n  Once a district court decides to remand a case, that remand order \nwill almost certainly be appealed. Plaintiffs with legitimate class \nactions in State court therefore need the additional protection \nprovided by my amendment in order to avoid being unfairly harmed by \nthis bill. Some time limit on district court consideration of remand \nmotions in class action cases is critical to minimize the denial of \njustice to citizens who legitimately turn to the State courts, even \nunder this bill, to have their grievances heard.\n  I know there is tremendous opposition to any attempt to perfect this \nbill on the floor because of concerns about the other body, but I \nimplore my colleagues who support the bill to not let their no-\namendment strategy prevent them from taking a hard look at this \nproblem. Do we want to leave unaddressed the possibility that a case \ncould sit in Federal court with a motion to remand pending for a year \nor more, only to have the case properly returned to State court once \nthe court finally takes a look at the motion? Is that a just result?\n  I am convinced that we can work at something if my colleagues will \nsimply take a quick look at this issue with an open mind. This \namendment does not even come close to blowing this bill up. It is \ncertainly not a poison pill. It is just an effort to make the bill work \nbetter, and surely the supporters of this bill should have the \nflexibility to do that.\n\n[[Page S1186]]\n\n  This bill is called the Class Action Fairness Act. To be fair to \npeople seeking justice from courts, we should ask the courts to act \nquickly on remand motions at both the court of appeals and district \ncourt levels. So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I begin by thanking the leadership. I thank \nSenator Reid of Nevada particularly because, as my colleagues know, the \nminority in this institution, even a minority of 1, can make life \ndifficult for a majority even of 99.\n  The Framers of the Constitution created an institution that would \nmake sure that the rights of minorities would be protected in this \nbody. Contrary to his own substantive feelings about the matter before \nus, the distinguished Democratic leader has made it possible, because \nof the unanimous consent agreement entered into with the distinguished \nmajority leader, for this matter to proceed. I also thank Senator \nFrist, the majority leader, for working out that arrangement so that we \ncan deal with the matter before us.\n  As someone who a year and a half ago negotiated an agreement that was \nsatisfactory to many, not to all, I am pleased that we are within a day \nor so of adopting this very important legislation. We would not be able \nto do that were it not for the leadership shown by the minority and the \nmajority in allowing this amendment process to go forward. So I begin \nthere.\n  I commend my colleagues who have offered amendments. They have \noffered germane and relevant amendments to this bill that have at the \nvery least some kernels of sound judgment and good ideas to them. I \nregretfully disagree with my colleagues substantively and have \nexpressed that in the Record. I know my colleague from Delaware, \nSenator Carper, who has spent a lot of time on this legislation, has \nbeen more deeply involved in this question than almost anyone in this \nbody and has listened very carefully to all of those who have argued \ntheir amendments and considered them thoroughly. So I thank them for \noffering these ideas. I do not suggest that I would necessarily be \nopposed to all of these amendments under different circumstances, \nalthough I think there are substantive arguments against them.\n  I say to one of my dearest friends in this body--and I know we call \neach other good friends, but Russ Feingold is one of my best friends in \nthe Senate, and it is a rarity when he and I are on different sides of \nan issue. I am not comfortable disagreeing with my friend from \nWisconsin because I admire him so much, but there is a substantive \ndisagreement over having mandatory time requirements.\n  The Judicial Conference of the United States, in a letter dated \nFebruary 7, addresses specifically this amendment and urges our \ncolleagues not to impose a time certain. The Senator from Wisconsin \nmakes a strong argument on having some predictability, and I agree with \nhim about predictability for all involved, for defendants and \nplaintiffs, but there is a danger in making the predictability so \ncertain that it makes it difficult for the judicial process to \nnecessarily work in a fair and balanced way. Because there are so many \nextenuating circumstances which can complicate a given mandatory time \nrequirement, it can actually work adversely to plaintiffs or defendants \nin the case, and I know my colleagues are aware of that.\n  A sound case can be made for Senator Feingold's amendment. There was \na sound argument on the other side as well as to why this can be \ndangerous. The Judicial Conference has come down rather strongly in a \nletter in opposition to a mandatory time requirement. Rather than go \nthrough and read this whole letter, I ask unanimous consent that the \nletter from the Judicial Conference dated February 7 be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Judicial Conference of\n\n\n                                            the United States,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 7, 2005.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, 224 Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write on behalf of the Judicial \n     Conference of the United States, the policy-making body for \n     the federal courts, to express the judiciary's opposition to \n     the amendment offered, and later withdrawn, by Senator Russ \n     Feingold to the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (S. 5) \n     during the Senate Judiciary Committee's business meeting on \n     February 3, 2005. That amendment would require the district \n     court to complete all action on a motion to remand a class \n     action case not later than 60 days after the date on which \n     such motion was made, unless ail parties agree to an \n     extension or the court grants an extension up to 10 days for \n     good cause shown and in the interests of justice. As further \n     explained below, the Judicial Conference opposes the \n     imposition of mandatory time frames for judicial actions. \n     Because the amendment may be considered further as S. 5 moves \n     to the floor of the United States Senate, I wanted to provide \n     you with these views as soon as possible.\n       The Judicial Conference strongly opposes the statutory \n     imposition of litigation priority, expediting requirements, \n     or time limitation rules in specified types of civil cases \n     brought in federal court beyond those civil actions already \n     identified in 28 U.S.C. 1657 as warranting expedited review. \n     The Conference also strongly opposes any attempt to impose \n     statutory time limits for the disposition of specified cases \n     in the district courts, the courts of appeals, or the Supreme \n     Court. (Report of the Proceedings of the Judicial Conference \n     of the United States, September 1990, p. 80.) Section 1657 \n     currently provides that United States courts shall determine \n     the order in which civil actions are heard, except for the \n     following types of actions that must be given expedited \n     consideration: cases brought under chapter 153 (habeas \n     corpus petitions) of title 28 or under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1826 \n     (recalcitrant witnesses); actions for temporary or \n     injunctive relief; and actions for which ``good cause'' is \n     shown.\n       The expansion of statutorily mandated expedited review is \n     unwise for several reasons. Individual actions within a \n     category of cases inevitably have different priority \n     requirements, which are best determined on a case-by-case \n     basis. Also, mandatory priorities and expediting requirements \n     run counter to principles of effective civil case management. \n     In addition, as the number of categories of cases receiving \n     priority treatment increases, the ability of a court to \n     expedite review of any of these cases is necessarily \n     restricted. At the same time, district courts must meet \n     stringent deadlines for the consideration of criminal cases, \n     as required by the Speedy Trial Act.\n       From a practical standpoint, it may be difficult in many \n     situations to meet the 60-day deadline under Senator \n     Feingold's amendment. The filing of a remand motion following \n     a notice of removal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1447 would \n     trigger the 60-day period. Under current local rules of \n     practice in the district courts, a motion to remand may not \n     be fully briefed and ready for court consideration until a \n     substantial portion of the 60-day deadline has expired. In \n     addition, the district court must consider the criteria \n     listed as a threshold for federal court jurisdiction under S. \n     5 before deciding the motion to remand, which may require the \n     court to hold an evidentiary hearing with witnesses.\n       The judiciary shares Senator Feingold's desire to \n     facilitate the consideration of cases. However, for the \n     reasons stated above, the judiciary believes the amendment is \n     unwise. Nevertheless, if Congress determines that a specific \n     reference beyond 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1657 is appropriate, then the \n     following alternative language is suggested for the \n     Committee's consideration as a replacement for subsection (A) \n     on pages 1 and 2 of Senator Feingold's amendment:\n       ``(A) the district court shall complete all action on a \n     motion to remand as soon as practicable after the date on \n     which such motion was made; and''\n       OR\n       ``(A) the district court shall expedite all action on a \n     motion to remand to the greatest extent practicable; and''.\n       Similar language has been used by Congress in other \n     legislation and is now found within the draft asbestos bill \n     being discussed in your Committee. It has reminded federal \n     judges of the importance Congress has given to the resolution \n     of the particular matter without precluding a fair hearing of \n     the issues underlying the motion or action.\n       Thank you for your consideration of the above comments. If \n     you have any questions, please contact Mike Blommer, \n     Assistant Director, Office of Legislative Affairs, at 202-\n     502-1700.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Leonidas Ralph Mecham,\n                                                        Secretary.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I am not going to go through each and every amendment, but \nthe amendments offered by my friends, Senators Kennedy, Bingaman, and \nFeinstein, also make good points, but as the Senator from Delaware and \nothers have pointed out there are substantial and substantive reasons \nwhy those amendments are even incorporated already under the \nlegislation\n\n[[Page S1187]]\n\nand thereby covered or that would undo what we have attempted to \nachieve in this legislation.\n  I pointed out the other day that back in the fall of 2003--I believe \nin October--a group of us who objected to the cloture motion and \nprovided the margin of difference that day from invoking cloture \nprovided the necessary votes to secure passage of the then as written \nclass action reform bill. I think we were right in doing so. That bill, \nI believe, was excessive. There was a real danger it would have undone \na lot of good law in this country which made courts accessible to \nlegitimate class action plaintiffs.\n\n  We were asked, a small group of us who were willing to work on this \nissue, to try to come up with some compromises, and we did. We \nsubmitted a letter to the majority leader saying there were four items \nthat we thought needed to be addressed in that bill. We then sat down \nand negotiated not only the 4 items but 8 items additional to the 4, so \nwe came back with 12 improvements to that bill, far more than we were \nasked to do by those concerned with legislation. I am not suggesting \nthat covered the universe. Obviously, other ideas occurred in the last \nyear and several months since that was struck. I was disappointed we \ndidn't bring up the reform bill in January of last year, as the leader \nannounced we would do. We lost an entire year on this matter, where we \ncould have had the same arrangement we agreed to over a year ago. \nNonetheless, we are back here with that same agreement.\n  Across the country, those who have had a chance to look at this \nlegislation have spoken very extensively in favor of it. In fact, some \n109 editorials across the Nation, from publications, daily publications \nliterally across the Nation in virtually every jurisdiction of the \ncountry, have come out and strongly endorsed this compromise package. I \nhave a list of the 109 editorial comments made in support of this \nlegislation, from publications that have reputations of being center, \nright, and left. It transcends the traditional ideological differences \none might find in our daily newspapers. It is instructive to those of \nus anxious to know what those editorials have to say about this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             109 Editorials Supporting Class Action Reform\n\n     The Washington Post\n     Get Tort Reform Right--January 10, 2005\n     Reforming Class Actions--June 14, 2003\n     Making Justice Work--November 25, 2002\n     Restoring Class to Class Actions--March 9, 2002\n     Actions Without Class--August 27, 2001\n     The Wall Street Journal\n     Tort Reform Roadmap--January 27, 2005\n     Class-Action Showdown--July 8, 2004\n     Class-Action Showdown--June 12, 2003\n     Mayhem in Madison County--December 6, 2002\n     Miracle in Mississippi--December 3, 2002\n     Class War--March 25, 2002\n     Chicago Tribune\n     Mr. Bush goes to Collinsville--January 5, 2005\n     American as apple pie--July 7, 2004\n     Madison (just another) County--June 18, 2004\n     The Judicial Hellhole--March 11, 2004\n     The class-action money chase--June 18, 2003\n     The judges of Madison County--September 6, 2002\n     Financial Times\n     Class Action Repair--September 18, 2003\n     Out of Action--March 18, 2002\n     USA Today\n     Class-action plaintiffs deserve more than coupons--October 9, \n         2002\n     Akron Beacon Journal\n     Classier act--May 2, 2003\n     Baltimore Sun\n     No-Class Action--October 26, 2003\n     Bangor Daily News\n     Class-action reform--June 3, 2004\n     Action on Lawsuits--September 17, 2003\n     Bloomington Pantagraph (Bloomington, IL)\n     Congress should approve class-action suit reforms--June 30, \n         2004\n     The Buffalo News\n     Class Action Compromise--December 6, 2003\n     Class-Action Lawsuits--October 14, 2003\n     Protection for plaintiffs--July 31, 2002\n     Business Insurance\n     Tort Reform Takes Time--July 19, 2004\n     Tort Reform Deserved More--January 26, 2004\n     Redouble Effort in Tort Reform Battle--October 27, 2003\n     Stick With Original Class Action Bill--September 29, 2003\n     Maintain Class-Action Reform Push--September 8, 2003\n     The Christian Science Monitor\n     Reforming class-action suits--April 17, 2003\n     Contra Costa Times (Walnut Creek, CA)\n     Class-Action Reform--July 9, 2004\n     Crain's New York Business\n     A Class Action for Schumer--September 1, 2003\n     Daily Jefferson County Union\n     Take Bite Out of Frivolous Suits--October 20, 2003\n     The Des Moines Register\n     Pass the class-action reform--July 14, 2004\n     Reform class actions--February 14, 2003\n     The Florida Times-Union (Jacksonville, FL)\n     Congress: Minority Rules--July 11, 2004\n     Progress Is Seen--December 16, 2003\n     Class Warfare--September 8, 2003\n     Always Alert--June 17, 2003\n     The Gazette (Cedar Rapids, Iowa)\n     Clamp down on class-action suits--May 19, 2004\n     More class-action suits should be federal cases--July 10, \n         2002\n     The Gazette (Colorado Springs, CO)\n     Our View: A lawyer's paradise--July 5, 2003\n     Greensboro News & Record\n     Class-Action Lawsuit Abuse Less Under Senate Rewrite--January \n         12, 2004\n     The Hartford Courant\n     Abuse of the Courts--June 16, 2004\n     Compromise on Class Action--December 31, 2003\n     Sen.

As a source of some parochial pride, I ask unanimous \nconsent the entire editorial in the Hartford Courant of Hartford, CT, \nbe printed in the Record supporting this legislation. It is entitled \n``Reining In Class-Action Abuses.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Hartford Courant, Feb. 8, 2005]\n\n                     Reining In Class-Action Abuses\n\n       Congress finally appears ready to curtail the worst abuses \n     in class-action lawsuits.\n       The House and Senate have debated the issue for a decade. \n     Now the Senate is prepared to vote, possibly this week, on a \n     bipartisan compromise engineered by Democratic Sen. \n     Christopher Dodd of Connecticut and others. President Bush \n     has indicated he will sign the measure.\n       Lawyers long have had a field day with class-action \n     lawsuits. They sometimes solicit clients and then shop for \n     friendly state courts with reputations for handing down huge \n     monetary awards. Too often, though, plaintiffs end up with \n     pennies, while the lawyers take home millions of dollars.\n       Under a bill that cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     last week, most interstate class-action lawsuits in which \n     claims total more than $5 million would appropriately be \n     moved to federal courts.\n       Truly local lawsuits involving plaintiffs and defendants \n     within a state would properly remain in local courts.\n       The bill, known as the Class Action Fairness Act, has other \n     useful provisions, such as tighter controls on so-called \n     coupon settlements, in which consumers receive discount \n     coupons instead of cash. Also, there would be better scrutiny \n     of settlements in which class members actually lose money.\n       Critics say the bill would unfairly penalize consumers \n     because federal consumer-protection laws are weak. There \n     still is time to address this shortcoming. But lawmakers must \n     resist the temptation to add extraneous amendments--such as \n     one to increase the salaries of federal judges--that would \n     doom the bill.\n       The measure enjoys broad support in the House, which gave \n     it overwhelming approval last year but which must vote again.\n       Once Congress acts on class-action lawsuits, it can turn \n     its attention to two other urgent lawsuit abuses--medical \n     malpractice and asbestos.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me say again to my colleagues here, many of whom I know \nhave offered amendments that have not succeeded in the past, I know it \ncan be disappointing to work on the amendment and not get the necessary \nvotes. But let me remind my colleagues, those who believe--and that is \nmost of us here--that clearly the class action situation in this \ncountry cries out for reform, that this bill is a court reform bill \nrather than a tort reform bill. No courts are closing their doors to \nclass action plaintiffs at all. But the situation had gotten out of \nhand. I think most of us here agree with that.\n  We have written an improved bill--from both a plaintiff's perspective \nas well as a defendant's perspective. We can have access to courts, get \ngood judgments, and see to it that victimized plaintiffs will receive \nthe compensation they deserve as a result of a class action decision in \ntheir favor.\n  I suggest to those who would have liked to have us add additional \namendments here that there was a very real danger indeed that had we \nnot stuck with the agreement reached almost a year and a half ago, the \noriginal bill would have come back or a bill adopted in the other body \nwould have been the vehicle chosen as the vehicle for class action \nreform. I believe that would have been a mistake.\n  I know there are colleagues who are disappointed that some of us did \nnot support them in their efforts. I state there are substantive \nreasons that we did not, but also there is the reason that had we done \nso, this matter would have been opened and the results would have been \na bill that would have been dangerous. I would have opposed it, but I \nthink the votes are here to carry it. It is always a tough call, and I \nam not going to suggest otherwise. Those are the kinds of decisions you \nhave to make in a legislative body with 99 other colleagues, 435 in the \nother body, and a President. We are dealing with a legislative form of \ngovernment. Unfortunately, as much as we would like to write our own \nbills and have everybody go along and agree with our ideas, that is not \nthe way the process works.\n  We think we have a substantially improved piece of legislation, one \nthat I heartily endorse. We will discover in time if there are any \nshortcomings, but by and large I believe we have written a good bill.\n  I mentioned in his absence my friendship with the Senator from \nWisconsin, talking about his amendment. As I said earlier, there is \nmore than just a kernel of truth in what he suggests. There is an \nargument on the other side that I know my colleague, as a very \ndistinguished member of the bar, will appreciate. I will not be able to \nsupport his amendment, but nonetheless I appreciate the point he is \nmaking about certainty and predictability, which is not an irrelevant \nissue when it comes to our courts.\n  For those reasons, I appreciate the fact that a majority of us here \nin a bipartisan way--not overwhelmingly bipartisan but a bipartisan \nfashion--have rejected the amendments offered by our colleagues today. \nMy hope is that a similar result will occur with remaining amendments, \nthat we can have final passage of this bill, that the leadership of the \nHouse will do what they said they were going to do, and that is to \nembrace this compromise package, and that we will be able to send this \nbill to the President for his signature and make a major step forward \nin reforming our courts so that class actions can proceed in the way \nthe Framers intended in the Constitution, which is fair to plaintiffs \nand defendants alike.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me say I appreciate the comments of \nmy friend from Connecticut, as I always do. I just want to point out \nthat the amendment I have offered, as opposed to the one I offered in \ncommittee, has increased the time for deciding these motions from 60 \ndays to 180 days. Surely 6 months is plenty of time, even in a \ncomplicated motion. So I believe the concerns of the Judicial \nConference have been addressed, unless we in the Congress are going to \ngo along with the idea there should be no time limit at all.\n  At this point I simply leave it at that, hoping that prior to the \ntime of actually voting on the amendment tomorrow I would have a few \nminutes to repeat and reiterate my position on this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, while Senator Dodd is still on the floor, \nand Senator Feingold as well, let me first of all say to Senator Dodd \nthat we would not be here today with this compromise, which is good \npublic policy but also something Democrats and Republicans, not all, \ncan support--and I know we will get the support of the House and the \nPresident. I want to say a special thank you for your leadership. I \nhave learned a lot in the last 4 years watching you and listening to \nyou. Certainly in this instance it is no exception, but thank you.\n  I want to say to Senator Feingold, we had a number of amendments that \nhave been presented to us today, all thoughtful amendments by some of \nour\n\n[[Page S1189]]\n\nvery finest Members. I was not able to support any of them.\n  The one amendment that I have literally worked, as he knows, behind \nthe scenes to try to get included in a managers' amendment is this \namendment or some variation of this amendment. I think the underlying \npoint you make--if a class action is filed in a State court and that is \nturned down and there is an effort to move it to Federal court, that is \nturned down, and then there is another effort to move that class action \nfrom State court to Federal court, we limit the second time through. \nThere has to be a response in 60 days to the appeal by the Federal \njudge on the appeal. That would sort of beg the question, Should not \nthere maybe be some kind of time limit as well on the first time there \nis an attempt to remove the case to the Federal court? That strikes me \nas something that makes common sense and seems fair and reasonable. As \nhe knows, I have reached out as recently as last night with some of the \npeople involved in the Judicial Conference and the Rules Committee to \nsee if there is a way to strike the balance, and I believe you have \nmoved toward that balance.\n  My hope is that we could take this amendment or something similar to \nthis amendment and include it in a managers' package. You have heard \nSenator Dodd and me and others say there is a very delicate compromise \nhere, and there is a concern if we change one piece of the bill we \ninvite friends on the other side, who have a different view about the \nbalance and would like to take the bill in a different direction--we \nunleash them to feel free to come forth with their amendments and set \nthe bill back.\n  Having said that, I still think this amendment as you have redrawn it \nwould actually be a good addition to a managers' amendment. I learned \ntoday there is not going to be a managers' amendment. As a result, I am \nnot going to be able to support this amendment.\n  I discussed this this morning with Senator Specter; he finds favor \nwith your amendment. I think he mentioned that at the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee hearing. He said to me--and he has no reason to say this, but \nI think it is just in his heart--he thinks you are onto something here \nand would like to take the Senator's approach on this provision and \ninclude it in another bill that he is working on and presumably will \nhave hearings on.\n  I think this idea, if it does not pass tomorrow and does not get \nincluded in the underlying bill, is going to live for another day and \nwe will be back to where we can hopefully all support it.\n  I thank the Senator for a real thoughtful approach and for his \nwillingness to compromise and try to find some middle ground. I think \nhe has found it. I think his efforts will ultimately be rewarded.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware for \nhis kind remarks and for his genuine efforts to try to reach an accord. \nIt is a shame when we have the chairman of the committee admitting that \nthis ought to be dealt with, and one of the great advocates of this \nlegislation admitting that this is just a question of fixing something, \nwe can't get it done. There is something wrong with the way we are \nproceeding when we can't fix something that basically nobody is really \nagainst if we do it right.\n  I recognize what is likely to happen in the vote. But I take the \nSenator at his word that he is hoping we can resolve it. Perhaps this \nis something that can still happen on this bill. If not, we have to \nresolve it another way. But I thank him for his sincere efforts to \nsolve this problem.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/09/senate-section/article/S1189-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, 2 weeks ago when I talked about relief for \nthe victims of the tsunami in Indonesia and what we are doing there, I \nsaid there was much more I wanted to call to the attention of my \ncolleagues and the people of the United States. One area that is \nextremely important is the enormous effort that is underway in \nIndonesia's mainstream, moderate Muslim population to promote a \nmoderate, pluralistic, democratic Islam, both in Indonesia and \nthroughout the region.\n  Unlike the Middle East, in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, Islam and \nMuslim organizations have been at the forefront of the country's \nstruggle for a democratic society.\n  And Muslim groups and leaders in Indonesia have been among the \nworld's pioneers in driving inter-faith dialogues.\n  During my recent visit to Indonesia, I met Yenny Zannuba Wahid, one \nof the latest leaders in this movement. Yenny is the daughter of His \nExcellency Abdurraham Wahid; a Muslim cleric, a leader in promoting \nreligious tolerance in Indonesia and one of Indonesia's first \ndemocratically elected presidents.\n  Yenny has founded the Wahid Institute, an organization dedicated ``to \nbringing justice and peace to the world by espousing a moderate and \ntolerant view of Islam and working for the welfare of all.''\n  As Yenny noted in a recent speech, Islamist parties gained a sizable \nvote in the 1999 and 2004 Indonesian elections; these developments \npresent the question of what role Islamic forces will play in setting \nthe direction of social and political evolution in today's Indonesia. \nWill Indonesia, a democracy with Muslim population of over 200 million, \nremain on the path of a moderate, pluralistic democracy or will a small \nbut increasingly influential minority of fundamentalistic Islamists \nsteadily gain ground with the masses?\n  Through the creation of the Wahid Institute, Yenny has chosen not to \nallow these currents to flow without resistence. To be precise, the \ngoal of the WI is to expand on the intellectual principles of Gus Dur \nto development of moderate Islamic thought that will promote democratic \nreform, religious pluralism, multiculturalism and tolerance amongst \nMuslims both in Indonesia and around the world. The institute has set \nout to create a dialogue between the highest spiritual and political \nleaders in the West and Muslim world.\n  The Wahid Institute has embarked on an impressive agenda of programs, \nincluding an effort to facilitate communication between Muslim and non-\nMuslim scholars on Islam and Muslim society and on the subjects of \nChristianity, Judaism, Hinduism and Buddhism; through conferences, \ndiscussions, publications and its website--wahidinstitute.org.\n  The Wahid Institute has plans to build a Muslim library, to serve \nscholars, researchers, activists, built on the library and life work of \nPresident Wahid. It is also planning to link Muslim NGOs and committed \nindividuals to build a network of individuals and groups dedicated to \npromoting these ideals.\n  Just an importantly, the Wahid Institute will focus on the education \nof young people, supporting opportunities for promising young men and \nwomen in Indonesia to focus on progressive and tolerant Muslim \nthinking.\n  But the Wahid Institute is the latest of the groups committed to \npromoting moderate Islam. The Liberal Islam Network and International \nCenter for Islam and Pluralism have been hard at work at promoting a \npeaceful and progressive Islam for sometime. I encourage all to become \nfamiliar with these groups.\n  In neighboring Malaysia, a country with a majority Muslim population \nof 18 million Muslims, recently elected Prime Minister, Abdullah \nBadawi, has emerged as a strong voice in promoting ethnic and religious \ntolerance and equality for women.\n  His own country struggled through times of violent race riots and has \nmade ethnic and religious tolerance an\n\n[[Page S1190]]\n\nobjective. Malaysia has been an economic success story and U.S. \nbusinesses consider it a great place to invest and do business. But the \ngrowing strains of fundamentalist Islam have emerged as a challenge. \nThe new Prime Minister has confronted them.\n  As noted in an excellent opinion piece in the Asian Wall Street \nJournal written by Diana Lady Dougan, ``with senior positions held by \nwomen in his government and a strong personal commitment to religious \nand ethnic tolerance, . . . Prime Minister Abdullah walks the talk. If \nhe can combine his strong and vocal advocacy of Islam Hadhari with \ncontinued progress in Malaysia's economic development based on a rule-\nof-law government and market-based economies, he is well positioned to \nbecome an inspiration far beyond the borders of Malaysia''.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Ambassador Dougan's op-ed be \nprinted in the Record at the end of my speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit I).\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, in fact, the Prime Minister speaks \neloquently about Hadhari Islam, meaning ``civilisation Islam,'' meaning \nreligion should be directed toward good, toward progress and toward \ndevelopment--all consistent with the Tenets of Islam.\n  The Prime Minister recently took this message in a powerful address \nbefore the World Council of Churches.\n  I will quote a couple of topics in his speech.\n  He said:\n\n       Islam Hadhari is an approach that emphasises development, \n     consistent with the tenets of Islam, and focuses on enhancing \n     the quality of life. It aims to achieve this via the mastery \n     of knowledge; the development of the individual and the \n     nation; the implementation of a dynamic economic, trading and \n     financial system; and the pursuit of integrated and balanced \n     development to develop pious and capable people, with care \n     for the environment and protection of the weak and \n     disadvantaged.\n\n  Further, he said:\n\n       Malaysia's experience and our promotion of Islam Hadhari \n     also clearly demonstrate a progressive attitude towards \n     relations with non-Muslim minorities and between gender. Our \n     approach does not threaten the rights of non-Muslims. In \n     fact, we celebrate the diversity of our respective cultures \n     and heritage. Those of other faiths in Malaysia, although a \n     minority, have never been persecuted and there is no \n     tolerance in my administration for discrimination and \n     prejudice against any religious group. I am a Muslim, but I \n     am also a leader of all Malaysians--whatever their faith.\n       Similarly, we have tried to ensure that the rights of women \n     are protected and that they fulfil their potential without \n     having to face artificial barriers constructed in the name of \n     Islam. We know Islam to be just and fair, and that it honours \n     the position and rights of women. But there are clear \n     instances of prejudices being cloaked in religious teachings \n     in the Muslim world, aimed at passing off gender \n     discrimination as the accepted norm. This will simply not do.\n\n  Finally, Singapore, which lies between two great nations with \nmajority Muslim populations, should be commended for the valuable role \nis has assumed in promoting a continental dialogue over these critical \nissues.\n  Singapore Senior Minister, Goh Chok Tong, is leading the way to the \ncreation of the Asia-Middle East Dialogue. Bourne out of an extensive \ntrip to the Middle East, where he observed in many Middle East \ncountries a mainstream society both diverse and inclusive, the first \nAsia-Middle East Dialogue, AMED, will be held June 2005 in Singapore.\n  An event of great ambition, AMED will bring together officials, \nacademics, religious leaders and opinion makers for some 50 countries \nin the Middle East and Asia. As was noted to me, this is not a \ngovernment-to-government meeting, this is a meeting best described as \npeople to people.\n  Among many the goals: forging closer political, economic, and \nsecurity ties; a critical one is to improve the socio-cultural \nrelations between the peoples of the two regions. The platform will \nprovide a framework for the two regions to engage, to highlight to \nreformist elements and give a voice to the changes taking place in the \nMiddle East.\n  The growth in economic engagement and the inter-regional linkages \nwill hopefully yield economic opportunities to push further the reform \nand liberalization of the economies of the Middle East.\n  I think there is value in that approach.\n  Above all, AMED will provide a platform for moderate Muslim countries \nto speak up and challenge the extremist strain of Islam. The threat \npresented by global terrorism stems from a militant, extremist ideology \nthat uses religion to foment divisions between and within societies, to \nfoster terrorist acts and murders of innocent civilians, government \nofficials, and other leaders. The forum, among others, will elevate \nelements to counter this movement.\n  In an encouraging sign, the Egyptian Government has offered to host \nthe next AMED. I commend the Senior Minister. I commend Prime Minister \nAbdullah. I commend Yenny Zannuba Wahid, as well as the people of \nSingapore, for this important effort, which will have, I think, long-\nrange benefits not only for the people of Islam and the people of \nIslamic countries, but all of us who are concerned about the rise of \nreligious fanaticism misusing the peaceful religion of Islam.\n  I thank the Chair and my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n          [From the Asian Wall Street Journal, Nov. 19, 2004]\n\n                      Malaysia's Shadow Is Lifting\n\n                         (By Diana Lady Dougan)\n\n       This week's very public reunion between Malaysia's new \n     Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi and former Deputy Prime \n     Minister Anwar Ibrahim may be cause for cautious celebration. \n     It is now six years since then Prime Minister Mahathir \n     Mohamad sacked Mr. Anwar at the height of the Asian financial \n     crisis, replacing him with Mr. Abdullah. Six years in which \n     the headlines generated by the controversial legal process \n     surrounding Mr. Anwar's conviction for corruption and sodomy \n     have cast a shadow over Malaysia's reputation as a rising \n     star among industrializing nations.\n       Now that shadow is starting to lift. The first step came in \n     September, when Malaysia's Federal Court overturned Mr. \n     Anwar's sodomy conviction, a step viewed by many as a signal \n     that Malaysia is back on the all-too-short list of ``rule of \n     law'' countries in the Islamic world. This week saw another \n     highly symbolic step. Mr. Anwar joined the head table of a \n     high-profile banquet hosted by Mr. Abdullah to celebrate the \n     end of Ramadan, the first meeting between the two men since \n     his jailing six years ago.\n       This signaled Mr. Abdullah's emergence from Mr. Mahathir's \n     shadow. Mr. Abdullah is secure in his position as prime \n     minister of one of the largest secular Islamic countries. A \n     leader of particular importance to the West because of his \n     unequivocal denouncement of terrorism and the hate mongering \n     of Islamic fundamentalists.\n       Despite many years in Mr. Mahathir's cabinet, including \n     five as deputy prime minister, Mr. Abdullah was a largely \n     unknown quantity when he quietly stepped into the departing \n     prime minister's shoes last year. When he assumed the role in \n     Oct. 2003, Mr. Abdullah did not wait long to lay the \n     groundwork for governmental reforms. Initially, his efforts \n     to tackle corruption, liberalize Malaysia's capital market \n     and increase business transparency were dismissed in some \n     quarters as predictable political posturing. But in the year \n     since Mr. Abdullah became prime minister, even Moodys and \n     Standard & Poor's have acknowledged Malaysia's efforts to \n     improve its economic fundamentals. Malaysia has jumped to \n     15th place this year from 23rd place in 2003 in the ranking \n     of attractive places for foreign direct investment among the \n     65 countries listed in the FDI Conference Index, according to \n     a recent report from management consultants A.T. Kearney.\n       Malaysia and its new prime minister have a lot going for \n     them. The Malaysian Central Bank reports a 7.6% growth rate \n     during the first half of this year, following growth of 5.2% \n     in 2003. Its foreign reserves leapt to a record high of 221.1 \n     billion ringgits ($58.2 billion) in October.\n       Malaysla also has oil reserves. But unlike many oil \n     producing countries in the Muslin world, Malaysia has a large \n     and stable middle class. An enviable 82% of its population \n     live above the poverty line.\n       Nonethless Malaysia is often stigmatized as a Muslin \n     society where Islam is constitutionally enshrined as the \n     national religion. Although led by pragmatic and progressive \n     leaders today, the country has historically had its share of \n     radical Muslim activists. Indeed few Westerners recall that \n     Mr. Anwar got his political start as a Muslim firebrand \n     activist. And during his six years in jail, the former deputy \n     prime minister has deftly orchestrated the creation of a new \n     splinter party headed by Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, his \n     conservatively shrouded ophthalmologist wife and mother of \n     six. However since his September release, little had been \n     seen of Mr. Anwar until this week. And it remains to be seen \n     how much of the support for his political party will survive \n     now that Mr. Anwar is no longer a folk hero in prison.\n       Although not as colorful as Messrs. Mahathir or Anwar, Mr. \n     Abdullah has long enjoyed a personal reputation untainted by \n     scandal. He is a devout Muslim with a university degree in \n     Islamic studies reinforced by a father who taught the Koran \n     and a\n\n[[Page S1191]]\n\n     grandfather who ran a madrassa religious school.\n       Ironically Mr. Abdullah's reputation as a respected scholar \n     of the Koran has worked to Mr. Anwar's advantage in the past, \n     and the two men have ties that go back far beyond this week's \n     reunion. In 1980, when Mr. Anwar eloped to Thailand with his \n     now wife, his father-in-law dramatically refused to \n     acknowledge the marriage and disowned his daughter. The young \n     couple recruited Mr. Abdullah as intermediary who was \n     credited with using quotes from the Koran to successfully \n     intercede on Mr. Anwar's behalf and convince his \n     fundamentalist father-in-law to accept the marriage.\n       Armed with ethnically Arab heritage as well as Arabic \n     language fluency (the name ``Badawi'' means ``Bedouin'' in \n     Arabic), Abdullah Badawi comes with a credibility in the \n     terror-plagued Middle East that Asian Muslims seldom have. \n     And as a well-respected expert on the Koran, he cannot easily \n     be yanked around nor intimidated by fundamentalist zealots \n     who are distorting the Islamic faith and the world view.\n       Mr. Abdullah is starting to gain attention in the Arab \n     world for his vocal and eloquent championing of ``Islam \n     Hadhari.'' Roughly translated as ``Civilizational Islam,'' \n     Islam Hadhari is not a new religion. Rather it is a rallying \n     point for progressive Muslims in Malaysia. Islam Hadhari is \n     committed to promoting ethnic and religious tolerance, \n     equality for women, protecting the religious as well as \n     political rights of minorities, and pursuing economic \n     development based on education and fairness.\n       With many senior positions held by women in his government \n     and a strong personal commitment to religious and ethnic \n     tolerance embedded in his Chinese, Arab and Malay heritage, \n     Prime Minister Abdullah walks the talk. If he can combine his \n     strong and vocal advocacy of Islam Hadhari with continued \n     progress in Malaysia's economic development based on rule-of-\n     law government and market-based economics, he is well \n     positioned to become an inspiration far beyond the borders of \n     Malaysia.\n       As chair of both the 118 country Non Aligned Movement and \n     the 57 country Organization of the Islamic Conference until \n     2006, Malaysia under Mr. Abdullah's leadership can command an \n     international spotlight--especially in the Muslim world.\n       Clearly no single person can single-handedly defeat the \n     distorted logic and deadly forces being unleashed in the name \n     of Allah around the world, much less the debilitating \n     economics that plague much of the Muslim world. But Mr. \n     Abdullah is clearly working to turn the tide in the most \n     important battle we are facing. For all our sakes, let's hope \n     both Malaysia and its new prime minister take advantage of \n     their unique opportunities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/09/senate-section/article/S1191-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1191-S1192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO REPRESENTATIVE STEVEN J. RUDY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to commend a fellow \nKentuckian who, like all of us, has asked his neighbors for the honor \nof representing them in government. Representative Steven J. Rudy \nspeaks for the residents of Ballard, Carlisle, Hickman, Fulton, and \nMcCracken Counties in the Kentucky General Assembly. Amazingly, he won \nthis honor last November at age 26, in his first bid for public office.\n  Representative Rudy has had a passion for politics and government his \nentire life. As a high school student, he once declared to his American \ngovernment teacher that he would hold elective office by age 30. He has \nalways been eager to share his ideas about issues, and to listen to \nothers. After graduating college he worked as a high school teacher, \nand then at his family's store, Rudy's Farm Center, where he still \nworks when not in Frankfort. In this way he keeps in touch with his \nconstituents.\n  Representative Rudy has accomplished much in a short time, and I have \nno doubt he will continue to excel. I look forward to seeing this \nbright young Kentuckian mature on the political stage. As so many of \nour best and brightest, he has the potential to transform our \nCommonwealth into a worldwide leader in technology, medicine, industry, \nand the cultural arts. I wish him continued success as he follows in \nthe tradition of public service carved out by distinguished Kentuckians \nsuch as Alben Barkley and Henry Clay.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record an \narticle from The Paducah Sun, ``Politician long in the making,'' about \nRepresentative Rudy's accomplishments and respect for public service.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Paducah Sun, Jan. 9, 2005]\n\n                     Politician Long in the Making\n\n                           (By Matt Sanders)\n\n       Kevil, KY--By his senior year at Ballard Memorial High \n     School, Steven Rudy had developed such a keen interest in \n     government that he once proclaimed during a county fiscal \n     court meeting that he would be elected judge-executive before \n     turning 30.\n       Rudy may never get a chance to run the county government \n     because he was elected to the Kentucky House of \n     Representatives on Nov. 2 at age 26. It was his first try for \n     public office.\n       ``Politics has been a lifelong career ambition. There was \n     really no clear goal growing up,'' said Rudy, who was sworn \n     in Jan. 4 and will begin his freshman term in the General \n     Assembly on Feb. 1.\n       But Rudy doesn't dwell on his upset in the general election \n     or being one of the youngest lawmakers in Frankfort. Since \n     his victory, he has focused on becoming a good public servant \n     and studying the lawmaking process.\n       ``I've always liked being involved in open discussions--\n     being able to toss around ideas and make decisions that can \n     help people. At times, I haven't minded playing the devil's \n     advocate.''\n       In the mid-1990s, Julian ``Whitey'' Elliott was Rudy's \n     American government teacher as well as a county magistrate. \n     Elliott had a front-row seat at the meeting when the teenager \n     made his bold prediction. Elliott recalled that he fully \n     expected his student to make good on his promise and was not \n     surprised on Nov. 2 by the Republican Rudy's 1,642-vote upset \n     of 17-year incumbent Charles Geveden in the 1st District.\n       ``I think Steven has always wanted to make things better,'' \n     Elliott said. ``Early on, even at the local level, he was \n     able to see that people could serve and make things better. \n     He never forgot that. Steven saw his chance in this campaign \n     to make things better.''\n       As a magistrate, Elliott frequently incorporated county \n     business into his classroom lectures, which sparked lively \n     roundtable discussions. He said Rudy never held back his \n     political views.\n       ``I kept the students apprised as what was going on in the \n     county, and I thought it was interesting that Steven was \n     always willing to speak his mind,'' Elliott said. ``I liked \n     for the kids to express opinions, but also to respect the \n     opinions of others who did not agree with you. I tried to get \n     them to look at issues from the other perspective.\n       ``I remember Steven leaning toward a Republican stance, and \n     this was when not every Republican was stating his views \n     publicly. There were maybe only 300 Republicans in the county \n     at that time.''\n       The county now has 712 registered Republicans, compared to \n     5,154 registered Democrats, according to the Ballard County \n     Clerk's Office.\n       Rudy smiled widely and noted that he was the first \n     registered Republican in his family.\n       ``My philosophy was always in line with the national \n     (Republican) platform,'' Rudy said.\n       In fact, it was through Rudy's persistence that the fiscal \n     court conducted a meeting in the high school cafeteria so the \n     students could see government in action.\n       The fiscal court met twice monthly, in the early afternoon \n     and at the same time as the American government class. A \n     substitute teacher took over Elliott's class on fiscal court \n     days, but Rudy always pleaded with his teacher to allow the \n     students to attend a meeting. Instead, Elliott brought the \n     meeting to the students.\n       ``It was really interesting to watch the magistrates make \n     decisions on what was right for Ballard County,'' Rudy said.\n       His interest in government and debate also was nurtured at \n     Ballard Memorial in the Future Farmers of America chapter, \n     which taught parliamentary procedure.\n\n\n                            in the beginning\n\n       Rudy's political ambition was born at the side of his \n     grandfather, the late Bill Rudy, who founded the Ballard \n     County agriculture store that would be the forerunner to the \n     family farm supply business, Rudy's Farm Center.\n       Nearly every year, Bill Rudy took his grandson to the Fancy \n     Farm Picnic, Kentucky's most important grassroots political \n     event. The often fiery political rhetoric fascinated both \n     elder and younger Rudy, with their only difference being that \n     Bill Rudy was a lifelong Democrat.\n       ``I remember my grandfather talking about the days when the \n     Democrats bashed the Republicans during the speaking,'' Rudy \n     said. ``I didn't like that, but I started going to the \n     picnics at the time (U.S. Senator) Mitch McConnell came along \n     and he said the things that made me proud.''\n       Bill Rudy also was involved in State politics--he served as \n     manager of the State Department of Agriculture's western \n     Kentucky office in Paducah. He also was a history buff and an \n     avid reader, which gave him a wealth of knowledge about \n     American presidents. He could talk for hours about the \n     presidents and did so at family gatherings.\n       But had Bill Rudy lived longer, he probably would have \n     joined his grandson in the Grand Old Party.\n       ``Dad was really down on Democrats there at the end,'' said \n     Jack Rudy, Steven's father. ``It may have been what was going \n     on with (President) Bill Clinton, but he told me that he had \n     decided on making a change.''\n       But time did not allow Bill Rudy to change parties. He died \n     of a heart attack shortly after that conversation with his \n     son. Bill Rudy's death came in 2000, and ironically on\n\n[[Page S1192]]\n\n     the first Saturday in August--the day of the Fancy Farm \n     Picnic.\n\n\n                        once a republican . . .\n\n       It seems natural that Rudy recalled one of his earliest \n     memories was, as a 3-year-old, watching televised replays of \n     the 1981 assassination attempt of Republican President \n     Reagan.\n       The day he registered to vote was also the day he got into \n     an argument with a deputy county clerk who urged Rudy to \n     register as a Democrat. Republicans, Rudy said he was told, \n     rarely were able to vote in primary elections because it was \n     rare for Republicans to run for elected office in Ballard \n     County.\n       ``I couldn't understand that,'' Rudy said. ``Why would \n     anyone care how you're registered? Voting is what is \n     important.''\n       While in college, Rudy wore his Republican feistiness on \n     his chest during the 1996 presidential campaign. He often \n     wore a Robert Dole-Jack Kemp T-shirt to classes at the then-\n     Paducah Community College, much to the displeasure of his \n     classmates. The Dole-Kemp ticket lost when Democrat Clinton \n     won a second term.\n       Rudy's Spartan office at the farm store could resemble the \n     GOP archives. Atop his filing cabinet is a bottle of red-\n     white-and-blue labeled ``W'' ketchup, a souvenir from the \n     2004 presidential race that poked fun at Democrat \n     presidential nominee John Kerry's wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, \n     and stepchildren, who are heirs to the Heinz ketchup fortune. \n     The bottle stands next to a hardbound copy of ``The Faith of \n     George Bush.'' Not far away is a photo of Rudy with the \n     State's three most powerful Republicans, Senators McConnell \n     and Jim Bunning and Governor Ernie Fletcher.\n       In fact, business photos and a St. Louis Cardinals' 2005 \n     baseball schedule stand among the few nonpartisan mementos.\n       But Rudy said his thinking does not always follow partisan \n     lines. He mentioned two Democrats--former State agriculture \n     commissioner Billy Ray Smith and 2nd District Rep. Frank \n     Rasche of Paducah--whom he admired.\n       ``The Republicans aren't perfect and I don't support \n     everything within the party,'' Rudy said. ``Billy Ray is a \n     real down-to-earth guy who would do what was right for all \n     Kentucky farmers. Frank is someone I feel I can rely on (in \n     the General Assembly). As chairman of education, he does what \n     is right for the children of Kentucky.''\n\n\n                             house hunting\n\n       The new year will continue to be busy. In addition to \n     beginning his freshman term in the General Assembly in \n     February, Rudy and his fiancee, Jessica Patton, are planning \n     a May wedding. Rudy grinned and said he called Fletcher for \n     assurance that there would be no special session, which is \n     usually convened in May.\n       Searching for a home also presented a challenge. By law, \n     Rudy must reside within his district, which consists of \n     Ballard, Hickman, Carlisle and Fulton counties, and nine \n     western McCracken County precincts. Patton is a receptionist \n     with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at Barkley Dam, and the \n     soon-to-be newlyweds decided to live in McCracken County, \n     which would be between their work places. That limits their \n     search to the precincts of Ragland, Woodville, Grahamville, \n     Lamont, Maxon, Lang, Lone Oak 3, Massac-Milan and Melber.\n       Rudy pointed to a large map of the nine precincts, covering \n     nearly one wall in his office. ``Every time she calls and \n     tells me she found a house, I ask for the location and check \n     it on the map to see if it's an option,'' Rudy said.\n\n\n                          Reluctant Candidate\n\n       Despite his early boasting of political ambitions, there \n     was not much planning by Rudy prior to announcing his \n     candidacy. As a small businessman, Rudy said, ``I have seen \n     things that make Kentucky an unfriendly business state, like \n     the tax structure.'' He also said he heard much frustration \n     in the community over the inability of lawmakers to pass a \n     budget.\n       Rudy had been active within the party during several \n     campaigns, including Fletcher's gubernatorial bid, and he \n     received what he called an unlikely phone call from state \n     party leaders wanting him to challenge for the 1st District \n     seat. ``If you would have asked me 18 months ago, it would \n     have seemed unlikely that I would run. I was very reluctant. \n     I thought I was too young to be taken seriously,'' Rudy said. \n     ``But then I figured it was a win-win situation, so I gave it \n     a shot. If I won the election, great. If I didn't win, the \n     campaign would have given me plenty of name recognition and I \n     would have met a great deal of people, which would benefit my \n     next campaign.''\n\n\n                          The Family Business\n\n       Inside Rudy's Farm Center, customers are treated like \n     family. They are greeted with a smile and a handshake. \n     Conversations easily flow over a variety of topics--planting \n     and harvest, weather, church, community events and, of \n     course, politics.\n       Retired Barlow farmer Bobby Myers was a frequent customer \n     and the day was never too busy to pass up discussing current \n     events with Rudy.\n       ``We always talked about what was happening, around here \n     and in Frankfort. He always seemed to know what was going \n     on,'' Myers said.\n       Although Myers admitted he never thought then of Rudy as a \n     future politician, he's confident the freshman lawmaker will \n     prosper in his new position.\n       ``I knew his daddy and his granddaddy and Steven is just \n     like them, good and honest and fair,'' Myers said. ``Those \n     are the kind of people we need in Frankfort.''\n       The store--which offers farm, home, hardware and industrial \n     merchandise--is a family business started in 1986 by his \n     parents, Jack and Jeanette Rudy. His brother, Matt, also \n     works at the store. Another brother, Jeff, is a seminary \n     student.\n       Steven Rudy handles the center's industrial sales, which \n     keeps him on his cell phone and behind a computer for much of \n     his work day.\n       Rudy took his agriculture education degree from Murray \n     State University in 2000 and became an agriculture instructor \n     at Lyon County High School in Eddyville. He used \n     parliamentary procedure to start the same kind of classroom \n     debates that he loved as one of Elliott's students.\n       But his father had always told Rudy there was an opening \n     for him in the family business. After much prayer and \n     realizing he could jump-start the store's industrial sales, \n     Rudy left the classroom, came home and never looked back.\n       The store lies on the border in both McCracken and Ballard \n     counties. The front acreage is lined with large merchandise, \n     but there also is room for a soccer field, complete with two \n     goals, which the Rudys set up for a local youth league.\n       Transactions at the farm store typically are finalized with \n     a bag of freshly popped popcorn, Jack Rudy's favorite snack. \n     A theater-style popper stands behind the counter, and the \n     Rudys hand out 50 pounds of the snack every two to three \n     weeks.\n       ``Everyone tells me that I eat more than half of it, but \n     it's a way of saying thanks,'' Jack Rudy said.\n\n\n                             Going To Work\n\n       Since his election, Rudy splits his time by attending \n     sessions in Frankfort for freshmen legislators, working at \n     the farm store and helping plan the wedding.\n       The General Assembly will convene Feb. 1 for 25 working \n     days to consider and act upon legislation.\n       ``I'm proud of him and I hope he does well,'' Elliott said. \n     ``The state needs people in Frankfort who care about \n     people.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/09/senate-section/article/S1192-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1192-S1193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     Corporal Timothy Gibson, USMC\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to remember and honor Cpl \nTimothy Gibson of Hillsborough, New Hampshire for his service and \nsupreme sacrifice for his country.\n  Corporal Gibson demonstrated a willingness and dedication to serve \nand defend his country by joining the United States Marine Corps. Just \nas many of America's heroes have taken up arms in the face of dire \nthreats, Tim dedicated himself to the defense of our ideals, values, \nfreedoms, and way of life. His valor and service cost him his life, but \nhis sacrifice will have spared millions from lives of tyranny and \nsorrow.\n  Tim graduated from Merrimack High School in Merrimack, NH in 2000 and \nenlisted in the Marine Corps on April 9, 2001. He then reported to \nMarine Corps recruit training and subsequently received further \ntraining as a rifleman in the infantry. Upon completion of this \ntraining, he became a member of 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment, 3rd \nMarine Division, III Marine Expeditionary Force, Marine Corps Base \nHawaii. From this unit's home base in Hawaii, he would later deploy to \nIraq in pursuit of those who would threaten our way of life.\n  Tragically, on Januaury 26, 2005, Cpl Gibson gave his last full \nmeasure for our Nation when the CH-53E helicopter he was in crashed \nnear Ar Rutbah, Iraq. Throughout his short career, Tim earned a series \nof accolades which testify to the dedication and devotion he held for \nthe Marine Corps, his fellow Marines, and his country. Tim's hard work \nand dedication contributed greatly to his unit's successes and placed \nhim among many of the great heroes and citizens that have given the \nultimate sacrifice for their country. Tim was recognized for his \nservice by the Combat Action Ribbon, the Marine Corps Good Conduct \nMedal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Sea Service \nDeployment Ribbon, Second Award, and the National Defense Service \nMedal. He was also the recipient of a Certificate of Appreciation, a \nLetter of Appreciation, and Meritorious Mast for his performance above \nand beyond expectations while in the Marine Corps.\n  My condolences and prayers go out to Tim's family, and I offer them \nmy deepest sympathies and most heartfelt thanks for the service, \nsacrifice, and example of their Marine, Cpl Timothy Gibson. Tim \nexemplified the words of Daniel Webster who said, ``God grants liberty \nonly to those who love it, and are always ready to guard and defend\n\n[[Page S1193]]\n\nit.'' Because of his efforts, the liberty of this country is made more \nsecure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/09/senate-section/article/S1193-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SHIRLEY CHISHOLM TRIBUTE\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a devoted public \nservant and a former Member of the U.S. Congress, Shirley Chisholm. As \na passionate activist, the first African-American woman to be elected \nto Congress, as well as the first African-American to seek the \nPresidential nomination from a major political party, Congresswoman \nChisholm was a person of exceptional courage and profound impact. She \nwill be missed.\n  Before her election to the New York State Legislature in 1964, she \nwas a dedicated educator in New York City, serving as a teacher as well \nas a daycare director. Elected to national office in 1969, \nCongresswoman Chisholm worked for both gender and racial equality. She \nwas cofounder of New York NOW, the first chapter of the National \nOrganization for Women. In 1969, she became a founding member of the \nCongressional Black Caucus, and in 1971 she cofounded the National \nWomen's Political Caucus.\n  She continued her fight for minority representation when she sought \nthe Democratic nomination for President of the United States in 1972. \nAlthough many criticized her campaign as a futile effort, she \ntenaciously continued her fight for the nomination and laid the \ngroundwork for future minorities to run for the Presidency. In her own \nwords, she ``ran for the Presidency, despite hopeless odds, to \ndemonstrate sheer will and refusal to accept the status quo.'' And \nindeed she was instrumental in opening the door for women and \nminorities to enter Presidential races in the future. As she noted in \nher autobiography, ``The Good Fight,'' ``the next time a woman runs or \na black, a Jew or anyone from a group that the country is `not ready' \nto elect to its highest office, I believe he or she will be taken \nseriously from the start. The door is not open yet, but it is ajar.''\n  Throughout her lifetime, Shirley Chisholm worked to open doors for \nwomen and minorities inside and outside of the political arena, and in \nthe process gained the respect and acknowledgement of even her most \nardent political foes. By remaining loyal to her own beliefs and \nsteadfastly working to accomplish her goals, Shirley Chisholm truly was \nwhat the title of her autobiography declared: ``unbought and \nunbossed.''\n  Her vision, her ideals, and her courage are certainly not to be \nforgotten. I extend my deepest sympathies to her family and friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/09/senate-section/article/S1193-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1193-S1194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       RULES OF PROCEDURE--COMMITTEE ON RULES AND ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the National Guard, \nto mark its 368th birthday on December 13.\n  The National Guard was founded in 1636 and has answered the call to \nprotect this great Nation in the face of every conflict. It was formed \neven before the birth of America and continues to serve as a safeguard \nagainst all enemies and oppressors.\n  The Guard is now a force of more than 450,000 men and women strong, \nproudly bearing the seal of American dreams. More than 95,000 of those \nare serving overseas in Iraq, Afghanistan and Bosnia, protecting \nAmerica on foreign soil. As some of the Nation's finest, they do not \nonly protect us abroad but do the same here at home, dependably \ndefending us against foreign threats and terrorists.\n  However, protecting the American people is only part of the heroic \ncontributions the Guard provides us. Those brave souls also serve as \nrescuers, reaching out to those who are victims of natural disaster, \nand supporting our people in neighborhoods and communities in times of \ndesperation and need. From coast to coast and around the world, all \nhumanity can count on these valiant Americans.\n  Each of us owes a great debt of gratitude to every member of the \nNational Guard, from the past and the present, for their sacrifice and \ndedication to protecting America's cherished freedoms and democracy. It \nis wonderful that we can honor the National Guard on its birthday and \nremember its significance to the people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/09/senate-section/article/S1194-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  Late last summer, a man was beaten, robbed, and sexually assaulted by \na group of three men and one teenager. The alleged motivation behind \nthe assault was the sexual orientation of the victim. The group of \nassailants met the victim at a gay bar, and he was allegedly targeted \nbecause he was gay.\n  I believe that the government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/09/senate-section/article/S1194-3", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS EXPORT FACILITATION ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a bill that will \nfacilitate the sale of U.S. agricultural products abroad. I am \ndelighted to join colleagues from both sides of the aisle in \ncosponsoring this bill, which will help remove potential impediments to \nthe shipment of U.S. agricultural goods to Cuba.\n  Cuba's geographic proximity to the U.S makes it an important market \nfor U.S. exporters. This bill will maintain significant economic \nbenefits not only for the farmers in my home State of Indiana, but for \nfarmers throughout the country. Agricultural trade with Cuba is \ncurrently allowed under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export \nEnhancement Act of 2000, TSREEA. This legislation was enacted in the \n106th Congress to provide additional markets for U.S. agricultural \nproducts and support the American farmer. I have long been an advocate \nof exercising care when imposing unilateral economic sanctions. \nNumerous studies have shown that unilateral sanctions rarely succeed \nand often harm the United States more than the target country. \nSanctions can jeopardize billions of dollars in U.S. export earnings \nand hundreds of thousands of American jobs. They frequently weaken our \ninternational competitiveness by yielding to other countries those \nmarkets and opportunities that we abandon.\n  There have been indications that TSREEA will be interpreted in a way \nthat may serve to impede agricultural exports to Cuba, which is \ncontrary to the original intent of the bill. This would be a departure \nfrom current policy and undermine the benefits for U.S. farmers which \nthe act has achieved. Groups such as the American Farm Bureau have \nindicated that the opening up of Cuba as a market has provided \nsignificant benefit to their members.\n  Without the important changes that this bill will make, the U.S. \neconomy could be impacted, not only in agricultural exports, but also \nin related economic output. To prevent this occurrence and to help \nbolster the agricultural export industry in the U.S., I ask you to join \nme and the other co-sponsors in support of this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/09/senate-section/article/S1194-4", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1194-S1195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           BRUNSWICK NAVAL AIR STATION'S STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, Brunswick Naval Air Station, which is in \nmy own home State of Maine, is a facility of great importance to our \nNation's military. While I could reflect today upon the bravery and \ntenacity of the P-3 Orion pilots at Brunswick who have supported the \nglobal war on terrorism, today I share with my colleagues the \nsignificant benefits and strategic advantages that Brunswick Naval Air \nStation offers our efforts in the areas of homeland defense and \nmaritime interdiction operations. As we look toward the future, and \ndevelop new tools to address future threats, we must ensure that these \ntools are located in facilities where their advanced capabilities can \nbe fully utilized. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that a white \npaper, authored by Ralph Dean, one of Brunswick's great advocates, \nentitled Homeland Defense and Maritime Interdiction Operations, be \nprinted in the Congressional Record. The white paper provides \nsignificant insight on the great advantages that Brunswick Naval Air \nStation offers.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Homeland Defense and Maritime Interdiction Operations\n\n       In the business of homeland defense (as in real estate), \n     location is the key. Imagine a naval search for a single, \n     relatively small merchant ship, which intelligence sources \n     have revealed has a hold full of weaponized chemicals. Its \n     destination is a major coastal city. After tense hours of \n     searching, a maritime patrol aircraft locates two possible \n     suspect vessels out of hundreds in one of the world's busiest \n     maritime areas. The aircraft directs two fast naval frigates \n     to the vicinity of the targets. The frigates and their \n     onboard helicopters intercept and challenge the target \n     vessels. One vessel submits to search and is determined to be \n     harmless. The other however, resists interception and \n     boarding. Finally, helicopter-borne special operations \n     commandoes descend upon the vessel, board and secure the ship \n     and its potentially deadly cargo.\n       This scenario actually occurred in the western \n     Mediterranean Sea last month. The weapons of mass destruction \n     seized were simulated; the entire sequence of events part of \n     a successful exercise of Maritime Interdiction Operations \n     conducted by forces of four NATO nations.\n       Maritime interdiction capability is a hot item right now \n     for defense planners, a particularly important focus of a \n     larger effort known as the Proliferation Security Initiative \n     (PSI). PSI is being advanced by 15 core member nations, \n     brought together at the request of President Bush last year \n     to develop cooperative diplomatic, military, and intelligence \n     means to stop ships which may be carrying weapons of mass \n     destruction (WMD). Many of the maritime interdiction precepts \n     under PSI are evolving from a multinational ``game'' \n     conducted last September at the Naval War College in Newport, \n     Rhode Island, and refining these concepts and procedures is \n     clearly a high priority for the nations involved. Japan \n     recently hosted the latest multinational PSI exercise, the \n     twelfth in the short time since the Initiative began.\n       As the Mediterranean exercise and others showed, Maritime \n     Patrol Aircraft (MPA) are a critical, almost always essential \n     part of successful maritime interdiction. Whether conducting \n     a broad-area search, refining a datum provided by other \n     (including national) sensors, or vectoring surface, rotary-\n     wing or\n\n[[Page S1195]]\n\n     special-warfare assets to a target, MPA are a key link in the \n     chain from initial intelligence to intercept. MPA are of \n     particular value in crowded shipping lanes, in areas of poor \n     weather or visibility. No other platform is as versatile in \n     this mission area, one as old and enduring as naval aviation \n     itself. But land-based aircraft need bases to fly from--bases \n     which optimize their speed, range, and turnaround capability \n     on missions protecting the nation's most vital areas. The \n     seaborne WMD threat has become primary. Maritime interdiction \n     platforms and infrastructure must be top concerns for naval \n     strategists and planners.\n       Fortunately help is on the way, again from patrol aviation. \n     The Multi-mission Maritime Aircraft (MMA) promises a \n     substantial increase in capability for commanders responsible \n     for maritime interdiction. Based on the Boeing 737-800, the \n     MMA will bring increased speed, range, and reliability \n     compared to the current workhorse MPA, the P-3C Orion. MMA \n     sensors for interdiction missions will include a new electro-\n     optical and infrared spectrum sensor, moving target \n     indicators, an enhanced inverse synthetic aperture / \n     synthetic aperture radar, and a new signals intelligence \n     suite. Perhaps best of all, MMA will control and exploit the \n     capabilities of the Broad-Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) \n     Unmanned Aerial Vehicle.\n       The aircraft themselves will certainly be fantastic, but \n     land-based planes are only as good as the base they operate \n     from, and the future homes for MMA/BAMS have not yet been \n     identified. Conventional wisdom has it that the transition \n     from the P-3 force to one of fewer than half as many MMA will \n     inevitably result in a reduction in the number of maritime \n     patrol aircraft bases in the U.S. This assumption may be \n     incorrect, since optimum basing for maritime interdiction \n     assets is as important as the assets themselves. Bases must \n     be located to provide rapid response to all coastal areas, \n     particularly those containing major population centers and \n     port facilities. They must be versatile, able to support not \n     just MPA, but rotary wing units and special warfare forces \n     with easy access, unencumbered space and facilities for \n     joint, coordinated training, and self-protection and security \n     from intrusion or attack. Maritime interdiction is a team \n     game, and collocation of the assets for training and \n     operations is essential.\n       The current MPA force laydown includes P-3 bases at Kaneohe \n     Bay in Hawaii, Jacksonville, Florida, Brunswick, Maine, and \n     Whidbey Island in Washington State. A robust P-3 capability \n     is maintained for fleet support and other missions at the \n     North Island Naval Air Station in San Diego. These last four \n     bases, at the ``corners'' of the continental U.S. are \n     perfectly situated for maritime interdiction of WMD threats. \n     From these sites, MMA response time to any point on the coast \n     will be less than two hours, and all major sea lanes of \n     approach can be covered within the 1200--1500 nautical mile \n     operational range of the aircraft.\n       All four sites have their advantages, and all are essential \n     to that coverage. For example, the Naval Air Station in \n     Brunswick, Maine has remarkable potential as a joint forces \n     maritime interdiction center under the PSI initiative: The \n     only remaining fully capable active-duty military airfield in \n     the northeastern U.S. and near its coastal cities--a region \n     of over 48 million people; immediately adjacent to all major \n     sea lanes in the North Atlantic; more than 63,000 square \n     miles of unencumbered airspace for training and exercise \n     missions; versatile and extensive modern facilities \n     (including a new hangar designed specifically for MMA and \n     BAMS) and land with no encroachment issues; an established \n     all-weather training area available for Special Forces and \n     other units; completely secured perimeter and outstanding \n     force protection layout and capability; and easy access by \n     all forms of transportation.\n       The ports and shipping lanes to the northeastern region of \n     the United States deserve the protection which can only be \n     provided by maritime interdiction forces operating from a \n     base within that region. Obviously transatlantic shipping is \n     critical to our nation's economy, but as west coast ports \n     operate at capacity, more and more operators are redirecting \n     their shipments from Asia directly to the northeast. These \n     shippers prefer to have their cargo spend the additional 7 to \n     10 days at sea rather than accept delays at west coast ports \n     and during rail transport across the continent. Container \n     traffic to New York alone has risen 65% in the last five \n     years, the fastest rate of growth in over 50 years. All of \n     the enormous volume of shipping to the region must be \n     monitored, and if necessary interdicted whenever it may pose \n     a threat.\n       The Defense Department's Base Closure and Realignment \n     Commission (BRAC) will in 2005 identify military \n     infrastructure for permanent elimination. The BRAC process \n     must carefully factor in future requirements for maritime \n     interdiction as they are just now being developed under the \n     PSI. Caution is indicated--the nation cannot afford to close \n     irreplaceable military facilities just as new concepts and \n     capabilities are being developed to address a burgeoning \n     threat. Maritime interdiction of weapons of mass destruction \n     headed for our shores is zero-defect work, and the selection \n     of bases for that effort must be equally judicious and \n     effective. Location is an enduring essential--we must keep \n     open our bases ``at the corners.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/09/senate-section/article/S1195-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1195-S1196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         VIRGINIA DAVIS COCHRAN\n\n Mr. LEAHY. It is with great sadness that I inform the Senate \nthat Virginia ``Ginny'' Cochran of Richmond, VT, died this past \nSaturday. She was 76.\n  Ginny Cochran was a native Vermonter originally from Hartland Four \nCorners. Like her husband Mickey who died in 1998, she attended the \nUniversity of Vermont. Over the years, the Cochran name became \nsynonymous with Vermont skiing. Ginny and Mickey established their own \nski area where thousands of children learned to ski. They instilled a \ncompetitive spirit in each of their four children who went on to become \ninternationally known ski racers. One daughter, Marilyn, won a World \nCup race in 1969, and another, Barbara Ann, won an Olympic gold medal \nin 1972. Several of Ginny's grandchildren are already outstanding ski \nracers.\n  Ginny Cochran was one of those lifelong Vermonters who personified \nthe essence of what it means to be a Vermonter. She loved the four \nseasons, she was loved by her community, and she taught countless \npeople how to enjoy freezing weather and beautiful scenery while \ngliding down snow covered mountains with style.\n  I ask that a February 6, 2005, article in the Burlington Free Press \nabout the extraordinary life of Ginny Cochran be printed in the Recrod.\n  The article follows.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Burlington Free Press, Feb. 6, 2005]\n\n                  Skiing Matriarch Ginny Cochran Dies\n\n\n      Mother of Olympians taught thousands to love the sport, and \n                             sportsmanship\n\n                            (By Susan Green)\n\n       Virginia Davis Cochran, whose name has been entwined with \n     Vermont's skiing heritage for more than four decades, died \n     Saturday morning at age 76.\n       Cochran, known as Ginny, started the Cochran Ski Area in \n     Richmond with her husband, Mickey, in 1961 and over the years \n     taught more than 10,000 children to ski. She also helped her \n     own four children and 10 grandchildren become top skiers--\n     with some joining the U.S. Ski Team and one winning an \n     Olympic gold medal.\n       Cochran died at Vermont Respite House in Williston of \n     complications from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Mickey Cochran \n     died in 1998.\n       The Cochran Ski Area began as a family affair when the \n     couple moved to a former dairy farm along the Winooski River. \n     They soon constructed a rope tow for their children: son Bob \n     and daughters, Marilyn, Barbara Ann and Lindy.\n       Barbara Ann went on to earn the 1972 Olympic gold medal in \n     slalom at Sapporo, Japan. In 1969, Marilyn was the first \n     American to win a World Cup in the giant slalom.\n       ``From the start, neighbors wanted to ski their hill,'' \n     said David Healy, a friend of the Cochrans, ``so Ginny opened \n     her back door and welcomed them in. Her kitchen became the \n     lodge.''\n       The ski area was a modest business offering affordable \n     access to the sport. ``They ran a small mom-and-pop \n     operation,'' Healy said, ``and it's the nation's first \n     nonprofit ski area.''\n       In the winter nowadays, 800 schoolchildren come to ski at \n     Cochran's each week, he said.\n       Cochran also ran the town's after-school ski program for 35 \n     years as a volunteer, Healy said.\n       Ginny Cochran, who hailed from Hartland Four Corners, met \n     Mickey on a ski trip to Stowe while both were UVM students in \n     the late 1940s. They married in 1949 and moved to Windsor, \n     where Mickey taught high school science.\n       ``They skied with their kids at Mount Ascutney,'' Healy \n     said, ``but they came back to Burlington in 1958. He worked \n     as an engineer at General Electric.''\n       With the purchase of about 190 acres in Richmond, however, \n     the Cochran clan didn't have to stray far from home to \n     indulge their love of the slopes.\n       ``The kids were already racing at Smugglers' Notch,'' Healy \n     said. ``Mickey recognized they needed to practice during the \n     week. His goal was to give them a place to train after \n     school.''\n       Peggy Farr, who met the Cochrans when they arrived in \n     Richmond, remembers the early years at the ski area.\n       ``When the kitchen was still the lodge, one day Ginny had \n     made brownies for her family. My son Chuck spent a lot of \n     time at their house. He and his pals ate them all,'' she \n     recalled with a laugh.\n       By way of a belated apology, the now-grown Chuck Farr and \n     his wife made brownies for Ginny Cochran on her 75th birthday \n     in March 2003.\n       ``She had a great influence on so many children,'' Peggy \n     Farr said. ``Two of my three kids and all my grandchildren \n     learned to ski there.''\n       Ditto for Marvin Carpenter, who grew up nearby on what \n     would later be called Cochran Road.\n\n[[Page S1196]]\n\n       ``There'd be 60 or 70 of us kids waiting in line for their \n     rope tow on a knoll behind the house,'' he said. ``We'd tramp \n     through the kitchen with our ski boots on, open the fridge. \n     If you needed gloves, they gave you gloves. The Cochrans made \n     trampolines we could jump on as part of our ski training. In \n     the summer, Ginny took us swimming. She was a mother to the \n     whole community.''\n       Carpenter, who now owns the Bridge Street Cafe in Richmond, \n     boasts that Ginny Cochran ``called me her second son. Of \n     course, there are about nine other guys who make that \n     claim.''\n       The Cochran skiing philosophy, Carpenter said, has always \n     been to teach parents who would in turn teach their children. \n     When it came to ski lessons, ``Ginny was a tough \n     taskmaster,'' he said.\n       ``Ginny never pulled any punches,'' said her friend Jack \n     Linn, who got to know her in 1978. ``She was direct as all \n     get-out, thanks to her old Vermont stock.''\n       As the ski area grew in popularity, the Cochrans added to \n     the property. They bought another 140 acres in 1965. The \n     facility includes eight trails, four lifts and a T-bar. Other \n     lodges were built, allowing the family to reclaim its \n     kitchen; the most recent one went up in 1984.\n       Although skiing was central, Ginny Cochran had other \n     interests. ``She was an avid tennis player and loved \n     bridge,'' said Linn, her bridge partner.\n       ``Ginny was very competitive at everything she did,'' noted \n     Carpenter, who participated in the regular card games, ``She \n     also bicycled and walked a lot. This was a busy lady. I \n     remember the calendar in her kitchen had activities written \n     down on every day of the week.''\n       Linn surmised that her legacy is the kind that endures. \n     ``Ginny was a supercitizen of Richmond.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/09/senate-section/article/S1196-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NATIONAL GIRLS AND WOMEN IN SPORTS DAY\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nNational Girls and Women in Sports Day.\n  Tomorrow evening the Louisiana State University women's basketball \nteam, which is currently ranked No. 1 in the Nation, will take on the \nfifth ranked University of Tennessee's Lady Volunteers. On Friday, \nLSU's lady gymnastics team, ranked third in the Nation, will face the \nwomen of the University of Georgia, ranked seventh nationally.\n  While I mention these two sporting events to highlight the \nachievements of the lady Tigers, I am also citing them to show how far \nwomen's sports have come in the past 35 years. Girls and women in \nsports today are leading our high schools, our colleges and \nuniversities, and our society. Seimone Augustus, the 6' 1\" guard for \nLSU's women's basketball team, is now a candidate to receive the Player \nof the Year Award for 2005. Last year, Carly Patterson of Baton Rouge, \nLA, became the first American woman since Mary Lou Retton to win the \nwomen's all-around competition for gymnastics.\n  In an age in which one in six girls are obese and heart disease is \nthe number one cause of death among American women, it is important \nthat we encourage our girls to participate in athletics and other \nphysical activities. And the benefits that girls receive from \nparticipating in sports are far more than physical. Through sports, \nyoung girls learn leadership, self confidence, teamwork, and a host of \nother skills that they will use through their entire life. It is \nimportant that we, as a society, support these girls and women in their \nathletic endeavors.\n  Aside from just praising the fine women sports teams of Louisiana, I \nwould like to offer special thanks to the organizations that are \nmembers of the coalition for National Girls and Women in Sports Day: \nthe American Association of University Women, Girl Scouts of the USA, \nGirls Incorporated, the National Association for Girls and Women in \nSports, the National Women's Law Center, the Women's Sports Foundation, \nand the YWCA USA.\n  Introducing our young women to athletics and encouraging their active \nparticipation in such events, is an important task, and one I look \nforward to doing with my own daughter. Today I commend the achievements \nof all girls and women throughout this country that participate in \nsports, and ask that my colleagues join me in honoring the National \nGirls and Women in Sports Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/09/senate-section/article/S1196-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO UNDEFEATED AUBURN UNIVERSITY TIGERS\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nundefeated 2004 Auburn University football team. The Auburn Tigers went \n13-0 this season winning both the Southeastern Conference Championships \nand the Nokia Sugar Bowl. They finished the season tied for the best \nrecord in the land and, in my opinion, made a strong case for a \nnational championship.\n  The Auburn Tigers finished the season ranked first in the Nation in \nscoring defense and fifth in the Nation in total defense. They also won \nfour games over Associated Press top 10 teams--the most of any Division \nI team during the 2004 season.\n  While many Auburn players and coaches received individual accolades \nthroughout the season, I believe that their dedication to extraordinary \nteamwork is an enduring tribute more impressive than any trophy or \naward. Saturday after Saturday, this team came prepared to play their \nhearts out and leave it all on the field. As the weeks passed, it \nbecame apparent to anyone watching that their efforts were more about a \nteam, a brotherhood, and a community focused on victory than on \nindividual accomplishments. The dedication, hard work, and focus of \nthese players and their coaches are undeniable.\n  Individually, Auburn's players accomplished great things. Four Auburn \nplayers earned All-America honors: offensive tackle Marcus McNeill, \ndefensive back Carlos Rogers, safety Junior Rosegreen, and running back \nCarnell Williams. Two freshmen, Stanley McClover and Quenton Groves, \nearned Freshman All-America honors, and Carlos Rogers won the Jim \nThorpe Award, which is presented to the Nation's top defensive back. \nSenior quarterback Jason Campbell won the most valuable player award \nfor the Sugar Bowl and the Southeastern Conference Championship game; \nwhile also garnering SEC offensive player of the year and SEC player of \nthe year honors as well as Most Valuable Player of the South squad in \nthe 2005 Senior Bowl.\n  I believe it is important to emphasize that the young men who make up \nthis outstanding Auburn football team understand that they are students \nfirst, and then athletes. The academic focus of these players is \nexemplified by the fact that 9 of the 18 seniors playing in the Sugar \nBowl had already earned their bachelor's degrees and 17 players made \nthe Southeastern Conference Academic honor roll. I commend the players \nand coaches for ensuring that academic achievement is not sacrificed \nfor athletic success.\n  Auburn's head coach Tommy Tuberville is to be commended for his \nachievements as well. Coach Tuberville was the recipient of six Coach \nof the Year awards including the Associated Press, Paul ``Bear'' \nBryant, American Football Coaches Association, Schutt Sports, Walker \nCamp, and Southeastern Conference awards.\n  I join Auburn fans across the country in recognizing their \naccomplishments, honoring their achievements and praising their \nteamwork. I am proud of their outstanding record and am inspired by \ntheir ability to overcome adversity to achieve success. The Auburn \nUniversity Tigers showed football fans everywhere what it means to play \nas a team.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/09/senate-section/article/S1196-3", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1196-S1197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING VEL PHILLIPS\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I honor the accomplishments \nof Vel Phillips, a pioneer in Wisconsin history, who turns 81 on \nFebruary 18.\n  The celebration of Black History Month in the State of Wisconsin \ncannot be complete without including Vel. In 1951, Vel was the first \nAfrican-American woman to graduate from the University of Wisconsin Law \nSchool. She and her husband Dale moved to Milwaukee, where they became \nthe first husband-wife attorney team admitted to the Federal bar.\n  Vel's is a household name in Milwaukee, where she was first inspired \nto run for office doing door-to-door voter registration. She was the \nfirst woman and first African American elected to the Milwaukee Common \nCouncil. Vel literally came under fire as she fought for open housing \nin Milwaukee, when gunshots left a bullet lodged in her oven. But no \nthreats, no matter how real or how terrifying, could change Vel's \nunshakeable commitment to making Milwaukee a more just city and to \nmaking the world a better place.\n  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said, ``We must be the drum majors for\n\n[[Page S1197]]\n\npeace,'' and Vel heeded his marching orders. She was arrested at a \nrally at the burned-out NAACP Freedom House, the site of a previous \nnight's retaliatory firebombing. Two weeks before Dr. King's \nassassination, the Milwaukee Common Council passed the open housing \nbill.\n  In 1971, Vel Phillips was appointed Wisconsin's first African-\nAmerican judge. In 1978, she again reached another milestone with her \nelection as secretary of state, first statewide office held by an \nAfrican American. Now, at 81, Vel continues to make a difference in \nMilwaukee, and it is a privilege to call her a friend.\n  Vel Phillips is a distinguished figure in the progress of the civil \nrights movement in Wisconsin. Her life of firsts and steadfast \ndetermination to make a difference is an inspiration to me and a \nreminder of the need to advance and protect the civil rights of all \nAmericans as we celebrate Black History Month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/09/senate-section/article/S1197-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING ERIC A.

Orsini of Stafford, VA, \ndeparted Government work at the age of 87.\n  Mr. Orsini began his service to country as a private in the Army in \n1941. During World War II, he was highly decorated, earning the Bronze \nStar, the Silver Star and the Purple Heart in combat which included \nfighting in the Battle of the Bulge. Upon retiring from the military as \na Colonel with 30 years of service, Mr. Orsini began working as a \nSenior Executive in the Department of the Army, where he would spend an \nadditional 34 years, specializing in improving logistics support to our \nsoldiers.\n  Today, I wish Mr. Orsini the best in his well-deserved retirement. \nI'm pleased to hear that he will now finally have the opportunity to \nimprove his golf game, go fishing more often and spend more time with \nhis family.\n  It is truly an honor to recognize a fellow Virginian for his \ndistinguished service as both a soldier and a government civil servant. \nMr. Orsini, your country thanks you for your courageous and meritorious \nwork in the name of freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/09/senate-section/article/S1197-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING LTC DANIEL L.

LTC Robey \nrecently retired after serving 19 years in the U.S. Army Reserve as a \nJudge Advocate and Civil Affairs Officer.\n  A Fairfax county native, Lieutenant Colonel Robey graduated from W.T. \nWoodson High School, received his B.A. degree from Lebanon Valley \nCollege and then went on to receive his J.D. from George Mason \nUniversity School of Law. During his military service, he has received \nnumerous decorations and awards, including the Purple Heart after \nserving in the Vietnam War, the Bronze Star Medal, three Meritorious \nService Medals and four Army Commendation Medals and recently, the \nLegion of Merit.\n  Earlier in his military judicial career, LTC Robey was deployed to \nBosnia in support of Operation Joint Endeavor as an International Law \nOfficer. Recently, he was a part of the U.S. Army Special Operations \nCommand and was deployed to Baghdad in support of Operation Iraqi \nFreedom as a Civil Affairs Officer.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Robey currently works in Fairfax County as a \nlitigator. He and his wife, Lisa, live in Reston. He has three sons, \nBrian, Kevin and Matthew. Among his military peers, the Lieutenant \nColonel is regarded as a ``legend'' and surely will be missed in his \nretirement from the service. Today, I congratulate him on his \noutstanding performance of meritorious service to the Armed Forces of \nthe United States and wish him well in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/09/senate-section/article/S1197-3", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/09/senate-section/article/S1197-4", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting \nnominations which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/09/senate-section/article/S1197-5", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT CONCERNING THE PLAN FOR SECURING NUCLEAR WEAPONS, MATERIAL, AND \n        EXPERTISE OF THE STATES OF THE FORMER SOVIET UNION--PM 4\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Consistent with section 1205 of the National Defense Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-314), I am providing a report \nprepared by my Administration on implementation during 2003 of the plan \nfor securing nuclear weapons, material, and expertise of the states of \nthe former Soviet Union.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to provide additional protections for recipients of \nthe earned income tax credit; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Taxpayer Abuse \nPrevention Act. Earned income tax credit, EITC, benefits intended for \nworking families are significantly reduced by the use of refund \nanticipation loans, RALs, which typically carry triple digit interest \nrates.\n  According to the Brookings Institution, an estimated $1.9 billion \nintended to assist low-income families was received by commercial tax \npreparers and affiliated national banks to pay for tax assistance, \nelectronic filing of returns, and high-cost refund loans in 2002. \nFifty-seven percent of consumers who received RALs in 2003 earned the \nEITC. The Children's Defense Fund recently conducted a review of EITC \nrefunds in eight states and the District of Columbia. In Texas, it is \nestimated that EITC families lost an estimated $251 million in tax \npreparation fees and high interest loans. EITC families had an \nestimated $82.6 million diverted to tax preparers in Ohio.\n\n[[Page S1200]]\n\n  The interest rates and fees charged on RALs are not justified because \nof the short length of time that these loans are outstanding and the \nminimal risk they present. These loans carry little risk because of the \nDebt Indicator program.\n  The Debt Indicator, DI, is a service provided by the Internal Revenue \nService, IRS, that informs the lender whether or not an applicant owes \nFederal or state taxes, child support, student loans, or other \nGovernment obligations, which assists the tax preparer in ascertaining \nthe applicant's ability to obtain their full refund so that the RAL is \nrepaid. The Department of the Treasury should not be facilitating these \npredatory loans that allow tax preparers to reap outrageous profits by \nexploiting working families.\n  Unfortunately too many working families are susceptible to predatory \nlending because they are left out of the financial mainstream. Between \n25 and 56 million adults are unbanked, or not using mainstream, insured \nfinancial institutions. The unbanked rely on alternative financial \nservice providers to obtain cash from checks, pay bills, send \nremittances, utilize payday loans, and obtain credit. Many of the \nunbanked are low- and moderate-income families that can ill afford to \nhave their earnings unnecessarily diminished by their reliance on these \nhigh-cost and often predatory financial services. In addition, the \nunbanked are unable to save securely to prepare for the loss of a job, \na family illness, a down payment on a first home, or education \nexpenses.\n  My bill will protect consumers against predatory loans, reduce the \ninvolvement of the Department of the Treasury in facilitating the \nexploitation of taxpayers, and expand access to opportunities for \nsaving and lending at mainstream financial services.\n  My bill prohibits refund anticipation loans that utilize EITC \nbenefits. Other Federal benefits, such as Social Security, have similar \nrestrictions to ensure that the beneficiaries receive the intended \nbenefit.\n  My bill also limits several of the objectionable practices of RAL \nproviders. It will prohibit lenders from using tax refunds to collect \noutstanding obligations for previous RALs. In addition, mandatory \narbitration clauses for RALs that utilize Federal tax refunds would be \nprohibited to ensure that consumers have the ability to take future \nlegal action if necessary.\n  I am deeply troubled that the Department of the Treasury plays such a \nprominent role in the facilitation and subsequent promotion of refund \nanticipation loans. In 1995, the use of the DI was suspended because of \nmassive fraud in e-filed returns with RALs. After the program was \ndiscontinued, RAL participation declined. The use of the DI was \nreinstated in 1999, according to H Block, to ``assist with screening \nfor electronic filing fraud and is also expected to substantially \nreduce refund anticipation loan pricing.'' Although RAL prices were \nexpected to go down as a result of the reinstatement of the DI, this \nhas not occurred. Use of the Debt Indicator should once again be \nstopped. The DI is helping tax preparers make excessive profits from \nlow- and moderate-income taxpayers who utilize RALs. The IRS should not \nbe aiding efforts that take the earned benefit away from low-income \nfamilies and allow unscrupulous preparers to take advantage of low-\nincome taxpayers. My bill terminates the DI program. In addition, this \nbill removes the incentive to meet congressionally mandated electronic \nfiling goals by facilitating the exploitation of taxpayers. My bill \nwould exclude any electronically filed tax returns resulting in tax \nrefunds distributed by refund anticipation loans from being counted \ntowards the goal established by the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of \n1998, which is to have at least 80 percent of all returns filed \nelectronically by 2007.\n\n  Mr. President, my bill also expands access to mainstream financial \nservices. Electronic Transfer Accounts, ETA, are low-cost accounts at \nbanks and credit unions intended for recipients of certain Federal \nbenefit payments. Currently, ETAs are provided for recipients of other \nFederal benefits such as Social Security payments. My bill expands the \neligibility for ETAs to include EITC benefits. These accounts will \nallow taxpayers to receive direct deposit refunds into an account \nwithout the need for a refund anticipation loan.\n  Furthermore, my bill would mandate that low- and moderate-income \ntaxpayers be provided opportunities to open low-cost accounts at \nfederally insured banks or credit unions via appropriate tax forms. \nProviding taxpayers with the option of opening a bank or credit union \naccount through the use of tax forms provides an alternative to RALs \nand immediate access to financial opportunities found at banks and \ncredit unions.\n  I thank my colleagues, Senators Bingaman, Sarbanes, Dayton, and \nDurbin for cosponsoring this legislation. I also thank Representative \nJan Schakowsky for introducing the companion legislation in the other \nbody.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Taxpayer Abuse \nPrevention Act, support letters and an accompanying fact sheet from the \nAssociation of Community Organizations for Reform, the Children's \nDefense Fund, the Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, the \nNational Consumer Law Center, the Center for Responsible Lending, and \nthe text of the national summary of the refund anticipation studies \ndone by the Children's Defense Fund be printed in the Record.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation that will \nrestrict predatory RALs and expand access to mainstream financial \nservices.\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 324\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: The Association of Community \n     Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), Center for Responsible \n     Lending, Children's Defense Fund, Consumer Federation of \n     America, Consumers Union, and National Consumer Law Center \n     (on behalf of its low-income clients), write to support your \n     bill, the ``Taxpayer Abuse Prevention Act.'' By prohibiting \n     lenders from making loans against the Earned Income Tax \n     Credit, this bill would greatly reduce the scope of abuses \n     caused by refund anticipation loans (RALs), which carry \n     effective annualized interest rates of about 40% to over \n     700%.\n       According to IRS data, 57% of consumers who received RALs \n     in 2003 were beneficiaries of the Earned Income Tax Credit. \n     These EITC recipients paid about $740 million in loan and \n     ``administrative'' fees for RALs. These fees divert hundreds \n     of millions of EITC dollars, paid out of the U.S. Treasury, \n     into the coffers of multimillion dollar commercial \n     preparation chains and big banks. It's time to stop lenders \n     from making high cost, abusive loans using the precious \n     dollars intended to support working poor families.\n       Furthermore, we support the ``Taxpayer Abuse Prevention \n     Act'' for its provisions that halt several of the most \n     egregious practices of RAL lenders, such as seizing \n     taxpayers' tax refunds as a form of debt collection and \n     slipping in mandatory arbitration clauses, which leave RAL \n     consumers without their day in court. Moreover, we appreciate \n     the termination of the IRS Debt Indicator program, which \n     would stop the IRS's practice of sharing taxpayer's personal \n     financial information in order to make RALs more profitable \n     for lenders. Finally, we applaud the provisions of the bill \n     that support linking unbanked taxpayers with bank accounts, \n     such as the provision to permit them to open Electronic \n     Transaction Accounts to receive federal tax refunds.\n       Thank you again for all your efforts to combat taxpayer \n     abuse by the RAL industry.\n           Sincerely,\n         Maude Hurd, National President Association of Community \n           Organizations for Reform Now; Jean Ann Fox, Director of \n           Consumer Protection, Consumer Federation of America; \n           Chi Chi Wu, Staff Attorney, National Consumer Law \n           Center; Deborah Cutler-Ortiz, Director of Family \n           Income, Children's Defense Fund; Susanna Montezemolo, \n           Legislative Representative, Consumers Union; Yolanda \n           McGill, Senior Policy Counsel, Center for Responsible \n           Lending.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  How the Taxpayer Abuse Prevention Act Addresses the Worst Aspect of \n                       Refund Anticipation Loans\n\n     What are Refund Anticipation Loans (RALs)?\n       Refund anticipation loans (RALs) are high cost short-term \n     loans secured by taxpayers' expected tax refunds. To get a \n     RAL, consumers pay:\n       A loan fee to the lender, ranging from about $30 to $115 in \n     2005.\n       A fee for commercial tax preparation, typically around \n     $120;\n       In some cases, a fee to the commercial preparer to process \n     the RAL, sometimes called a ``administrative'', \n     ``application'', or ``document preparation'' fee, around $30;\n     Who gets RALs?\n       Over 12 million taxpayers got RALs in 2003, according to \n     the latest available data from IRS, costing taxpayers an \n     estimated $1.4 billion dollars. Nearly 80% of these taxpayers \n     are low-income, making less than $35,000 per year. Over half \n     taxpayers who get RALs receive the Earned Income Tax Credit \n     (EITC). The EITC is a tax benefit for working people who earn \n     low or moderate incomes. It reduces the tax burden on these \n     working families, boosting millions of households out of \n     poverty. EITC recipients are disproportionately represented \n     in the ranks of those who get RALs, since these taxpayers \n     make up just 17% of the taxpayer population. RALs cost EITC \n     recipients $740 million in loan and application/\n     administrative fees, plus these EITC recipients paid nearly \n     an estimated $1 billion in tax preparation and check cashing \n     fees.\n     What are some of the problems with RALs?\n       RALs drain hundreds of millions in EITC benefits, and \n     diminish the EITC's poverty-fighting power.\n       The Taxpayer Abuse Prevention Act prohibits RALs made \n     against EITC funds. RAL contracts permit a lender to grab a \n     taxpayer' refund to repay any outstanding RAL debt, even if \n     the debt was to another lender.\n       The Taxpayer Abuse Prevention Act prohibits debt collection \n     from a taxpayer's refund. RAL contracts contain anti-consumer \n     mandatory arbitration clauses that deprive taxpayers of their \n     day in court if they have a problem with their RALs.\n       The Taxpayer Abuse Prevention Act prohibits mandatory \n     arbitration clauses in RAL contracts. The IRS helps increase \n     profits for RAL lenders by sharing taxpayer's personal \n     financial information in the form of the Debt Indicator, \n     which tells tax preparers and RAL lenders when a tax refund \n     offset exists.\n       The Taxpayer Abuse Prevention Act terminates the Debt \n     Indicator program, ensuring that IRS resources are not used \n     to help the bottom line of RAL lenders.\n     Isn't this denying EITC taxpayers an option to get their \n         refund money at tax time?\n       RALs cost an enormous amount for what is essentially a loan \n     of less than two weeks, draining billions for a mostly \n     useless product. Because they are such short term loans, the \n     RAL loan fee translates into effective annualized interest \n     rates of about 40% to over 700%, or 70% to over 1700% if \n     administrative fees are included. If the taxpayer's refund is \n     reduced or denied by the IRS, the taxpayer is on the hook to \n     repay the loan--a tough task for the low-income taxpayers who \n     mostly get RALs.\n       The EITC is money paid out of the federal Treasury to make \n     sure working families are lifted out of poverty. Other \n     similar government programs have longstanding similar \n     prohibitions against making a loan against those benefits. \n     For example, the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 407(a), \n     prohibits lenders from seizing, garnishing, attaching, taking \n     an assignment in or securing a loan against Social Security \n     benefits. The Taxpayer Abuse Prevention Act prohibition's \n     against RALs secured by the EITC was modeled on this \n     provision of the Social Security Act, with the addition of a \n     prohibition against offsets of EITC benefits.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      Children's Defense Fund,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, February, 2005.\n\n     Keeping What They've Earned: Working Families and Tax Credits\n\n       As the height of tax-filing season approaches, Americans \n     are being bombarded with advertisements from commercial tax \n     preparers on high-cost options for getting their taxes \n     prepared. Many of these commercial tax preparers focus on \n     low-income neighborhoods and lure their clients with the \n     promise of ``Fast Money,'' Money Now'' or ``Rapid Refunds.''\n       Two out of every three people nationwide who claim the \n     Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) use commercial tax preparers \n     to prepare their returns. These low-income families end up \n     paying high preparation fees and many of them take out high-\n     interest loans against their expected refund. Unfortunately, \n     many of these low- to moderate-income working Americans are \n     unaware of other options--including free tax preparation \n     through Volunteer Income Tax Assistance sites.\n       Enacted in 1975, the EITC is our nation's largest and most \n     effective anti-poverty program, generating billions of \n     dollars to help\n\n[[Page S1202]]\n\n     families meet their most basic needs. Research shows families \n     use their refunds to pay bills such as utilities and rent, to \n     purchase basic household commodities and clothing, to cover \n     the costs of tuition, and some even reserve parts of their \n     EITC for savings. In sum, EITC helps low- to moderate-income \n     families make ends meet while stimulating the local economy.\n\n\n     THE FULL VALUE OF THE PROGRAM IS NOT REACHING WORKING FAMILIES\n\n       Unfortunately, low-income taxpayers lost over $690 million \n     in loan charges in 2003 and a total of $2.3 billion if the \n     cost of commercial tax preparation is included. These costs \n     can include tax preparation, documentation preparation or \n     application handling fees, electronic filing fees and a \n     Refund Anticipation Loan (RALs). The RALs are loans secured \n     by tax-payer's tax refund, including the EITC.\n       In middle and upper income communities, consumers have \n     access to loans and credit cards at competitive rates, and \n     branch offices of mainstream banks and savings and loans \n     offer a full array of banking services. Low-income consumers \n     are forced to patronize fringe financial service providers \n     that charge exorbitant rates for personal loans and limited \n     banking services.\n\n\n                     RALS TARGET HIGH POVERTY AREAS\n\n       Recent research has shown that low-income taxpayers who \n     claim the EITC represent the majority of the marketplace for \n     RALs. The product's popularity varies substantially across \n     the U.S., but the most recent Internal Revenue Service \n     figures indicate that 79 percent of RAL recipients in 2003 \n     had adjusted gross incomes of $35,000 or less. Minority \n     consumers are heavier RAL users. Twenty-eight percent of \n     African Americans and 21 percent of Latino taxpayers told \n     surveyors they received RALs compared with 17 percent of \n     White consumers.\n       The Children's Defense Fund's review of eight states and \n     the District of Columbia reveals that almost $960 million \n     dollars has been siphoned away from low-income tax payers in \n     these states, because of tax preparation and high interest \n     loan fees.\n       California lost an estimated $236.5 million.\n       Minnesota lost and estimated 5.1 million.\n       Mississippi lost an estimated $54 million.\n       New York lost an estimated $182 million.\n       Ohio lost an estimated $82.6 million.\n       South Carolina lost an estimated $57 million.\n       Tennessee lost an estimated $57 million.\n       Texas lost an estimated $251 million.\n       Washington D.C. lost an estimated $5.8 million.\n\n\n           THE APPEAL OF RALS AND WHAT TAXPAYERS AREN'T TOLD\n\n       Many low-income families may feel they have little choice \n     but to take out a RAL. First, many are unlikely to have $100 \n     on hand to pay for tax preparation fees. In setting up the \n     loan, the commercial tax preparers deduct these fees first, \n     relieving the families from the need to find alternative \n     resources. Second, and probably more significantly, RALs \n     enable families to access the amount of money they expect \n     from their refunds within 48 hours, rather than having to \n     wait for the IRS to process their returns. This wait could \n     last 6-8 weeks if the family does not file electronically and \n     does not have a bank account to accept an electronic transfer \n     of the refund. Indeed, many low-income families lack bank \n     accounts. According to the Federal Reserve, one out of four \n     families with incomes less than $25,000 does not have a bank \n     account of any kind.\n\n\n                            RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n       1. Simplify the rules and process. Working families should \n     be able to complete their own taxes, without having to pay \n     for professional assistance. Federal and state laws, \n     especially those that govern working families income taxes, \n     need to be simplified and federal and state tax credit \n     programs need to be coordinated.\n       2. Ensure that free tax assistance for EITC families is \n     available, accessible and well-publicized. Very few people \n     know that free tax assistance for low-income families is \n     available at Volunteer Income Tax Assistance sites, Tax \n     Counseling for the Elderly, AARP and other free tax \n     preparation sites in many communities, but very few people \n     know this. The community groups and nonprofit \n     organizations that operate many of these sites need help. \n     Different levels of government, employers, foundations, \n     churches and other community groups can all provide \n     financial assistance, make site locations available, \n     donate computers for electronic filing, help recruit \n     volunteers and conduct outreach with potential EITC \n     families. EITC families should also be made aware that \n     there are free or low-cost tax filing websites available \n     that they can access through the IRS and other websites.\n       3. Strengthen consumer protection and education. There is \n     little regulation of tax preparers even though they are \n     entrusted with personal information and expected to stay \n     abreast of many complex tax laws. The federal and state \n     governments could do more to regulate and monitor the \n     practices of paid preparers as well as the national banks \n     with which they partner to offer RALs. Families need to \n     understand what they can expect of their tax preparer, as \n     well as the drawbacks and hidden costs of RALs. On the \n     federal level, the Taxpayer Abuse Prevention Act (TAPA) \n     legislation introduced by Senators Akaka (D-HI) and Bingaman \n     (D-NM) and Representative Schakowsky (DIL) would prohibit the \n     use of RALs against the EITC.\n       4. Connect more low-income families with fmancial \n     institutions and increase their financial literacy. Having a \n     tax refund electronically deposited directly into a bank \n     account speeds up the turnaround time significantly, but one \n     out of four families with incomes less than $25,000 does not \n     have a bank account. Recent efforts to partner free tax \n     assistance with financial institutions have been successful.\n\n\n  CHILDREN NEED ADEQUATE FAMILY INCOME IF THEY ARE TO MEET THEIR MOST \n BASIC NEEDS, FROM DIAPERS To DOCTORS To HEALTHY FOOD AND SAFE HOUSING\n\n       Whether a child will flounder or flourish can hinge on \n     things that money buys: good quality child care, eyeglasses \n     to read the chalkboard, a little league fee, a musical \n     instrument, or simply the peace of mind that lets parents \n     create a warm and nurturing family life free from worries \n     about eviction or hunger.\n       Yet almost 13 million children are poor and millions more \n     live in struggling families with incomes just above the \n     official poverty line. Giving children economic security \n     means providing stronger tax credits for low-paid working \n     families and a more reliable safety net when jobs fall short. \n     It also means making more effective use of available programs \n     and ensuring that families have access to the tax credits and \n     food, health, and other benefits that already exist.\n       The millions of dollars lost by working families to \n     commercial tax preparers is money that could have been used \n     to help provide their children with a safe home, nutritious \n     meals and a good education.\n       These hardworking families are trying to lift themselves \n     out of poverty but are falling victim to targeted marketing \n     tactics that are taking their hard-earned money. The \n     Children's Defense Fund's efforts to educate and assist \n     families that may otherwise, fall prey to these \n     unconscionable sales tactics can make a difference in the \n     lives of the working poor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM (for himself and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 327. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe tip credit to certain employers and to promote tax compliance; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to introduce, along with my \ncolleague, Senator Lincoln of Arkansas, the Small Business Tax \nEqualization and Compliance Act of 2005, which would amend the tax code \nto expand the tip credit to certain employers and to promote tax \ncompliance.\n  This bill addresses an unfair aspect of our current tax code that \nadversely affects tens of thousands of small businesses across the \ncountry. Under current law, certain small business owners are required \nto pay Social Security and Medicare (FICA) taxes on tips their \nemployees earn, despite having no control over or share of the tip \nearnings. This legislation will allow these small business owners to \nclaim a tax credit against their income taxes for their share of the \nFICA tax paid on their employees' tips. The Small Business Tax \nEqualization and Compliance Act would place cosmetology service owners \non equal footing with other similarly tip-intensive businesses such as \nthe restaurant and food delivery industries that already benefit from a \nsimilar tax credit.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord, and am hopeful my colleagues will join me in support of this \nlegislation.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 327\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Tax \n     Equalization and Compliance Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend title 11, United States Code, to increase the \namount of unsecured claims for salaries and wages given priority in \nbankruptcy, to provide for cash payments to retirees to compensate for \nlost health insurance benefits resulting from the bankruptcy of their \nformer employer, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, over the last several years as the \neconomy came down from the high of the 1990s, we have seen how \ndevastating it can be for workers when their companies declare \nbankruptcy. From the enormous Enron bankruptcy at the end of 2001 to \nthe bankruptcies of Wheeling-Pitt and then Weirton Steel in my own home \nState, every bankruptcy has brought heartache for workers who had \ndedicated themselves to their employers. In many cases, employees and \nretirees have very limited ability to recover the wages, severance, or \nbenefits they are due when their companies seek protection from \ncreditors.\n  Workers deserve better. So today I am introducing the Bankruptcy \nFairness Act to strengthen workers' rights in bankruptcy and to provide \ngreater authority to bankruptcy courts to ensure a fair distribution of \nassets. I am very pleased that Senator Leahy, the distinguished ranking \nDemocrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee is an original cosponsor of \nthis bill.\n  Specifically, the bill will do three things. It will ensure that \nretirees whose promised health insurance is taken away receive at least \nsome compensation for their lost benefits. Second, my legislation would \nallow employees to recover more of the back-pay or other compensation \nthat is owed to them at the time of the bankruptcy. And lastly, it \nwould provide bankruptcy courts the authority to recover company assets \nin cases where company managers flagrantly paid excessive compensation \nto favored employees just before declaring bankruptcy.\n  I first introduced this legislation in the 108th Congress. I am \nreintroducing\n\n[[Page S1204]]\n\nit because this issue is as important in West Virginia today as it has \never been. I am hopeful that as Congress considers any changes to \nbankruptcy law we will debate how we can better protect workers whose \ncompanies file for bankruptcy. I do not pretend to have all the \nanswers. But I do know that we must do a better job of easing the \nburden that bankruptcy imposes on employees and retirees. And I believe \nthat we can do so in creative ways that do not make it more difficult \nfor companies to successfully reorganize and emerge from bankruptcy. I \nlook forward to the ideas and suggestions of my colleagues.\n  In the simplest economic terms, employees sell their labor to their \ncompanies. They toil away in offices, plants, factories, mills, and \nmines, because they are promised that at the end of the day they will \nreceive certain compensation. One of the most important types of \ncompensation that workers earn is the right to enjoy certain benefits \nwhen they retire. Pensions, life insurance, or health care coverage are \nearned by workers in addition to their weekly paychecks. Yet, sadly we \nhave seen many companies in the last few years abandon these promises \nwhen they declare bankruptcy.\n  More and more we see companies taking the easy road to profitability \nby abandoning commitments that they made to workers. For retirees who \nhave planned for their golden years based on the benefits they have \nearned, losing health insurance can be a devastating blow. Retirees \nmust have the right to reasonable compensation if the company seeks to \nbreak its promise to provide health insurance. Under current law, these \nretirees receive what is called a general unsecured claim for the value \nof the benefits they lost. As any creditor will tell you, a general \nunsecured claim is essentially worthless in most bankruptcies. It means \nyou are at the end of the line, and there are not enough assets to go \naround. This law allows companies to essentially rescind compensation \nthat retirees have earned with virtually no cost to the company. Of \ncourse that is a great deal for the company, but it is spectacularly \nunfair to the retirees.\n  Recognizing that so-called legacy costs are often an impossible \nburden for a company that is trying to emerge from bankruptcy, my \nlegislation would still allow companies in some circumstances to alter \nthe health coverage offered to retirees. However, it would require that \nthe company pay a minimum level of compensation to retirees. Under this \nbill, each retiree would be entitled to a payment equal to the cost of \npurchasing comparable health insurance for a period of 18 months. Of \ncourse, 18 months of health insurance coverage is a lot less than many \nof these retirees are losing, but it can ease the transition as \nretirees make alternative plans, and it will discourage companies from \nthinking that terminating retiree health coverage is an easy solution. \nThe retirees would still be entitled to a general unsecured claim for \nthe value of the benefits lost in excess of this one time payment. This \nchange would ensure that retirees, while still not being made whole on \nlost benefits, will at least receive some compensation for the broken \npromises.\n\n  Many active workers, too, have a difficult time recovering what is \nowed to them by their employer when the company files bankruptcy. Under \ncurrent law, employees are entitled to a priority claim of up to \n$4,925. But that figure is usually not enough to cover the back-wages, \nvacation time, severance pay, or benefit payments that the employees \nare owed for work done prior to the bankruptcy. Congress needs to \nupdate the amount of the priority claim to ensure that more workers are \nable to receive what is rightfully theirs. The Bankruptcy Fairness Act \nwould establish a priority claim for the first $15,000 of compensation \nowed to an employee.\n  In most cases, employees have been working their hardest to help the \ncompany avoid the nightmare of bankruptcy, only to find that they will \nnot be compensated for their services as promised. As we saw so clearly \nwith the Enron case, employees are often left holding the bag when \ntheir company declares bankruptcy. In that case, employees were owed an \naverage of $35,000 in back-wages, severance, and other promised \ncompensation. They deserved to recover more than a mere $4,925 of what \nwas owed them. Let me be clear, this bill does not establish any new \nobligation for a company to pay severance or other compensation to \nemployees caught up in a company's bankruptcy. It merely ensures that \nemployees can recover more of what is already owed to them through the \nbankruptcy process.\n  I understand that many creditors or investors are not able to recover \nwhat is rightfully owed to them in bankruptcy, but employees deserve \nprotection that recognizes the unique nature of their dependence on \ntheir employer. Any smart investor diversifies his or her portfolio so \nthat a bankruptcy at one company does not bankrupt the investor. \nLikewise, suppliers and creditors that do business with a company \ntypically have many other clients. This is not the case with workers. \nThey cannot diversify away the risk of working for a bankrupt company, \nand the financial hardship a bankruptcy brings is more devastating to \nthe average worker than the average creditor or supplier.\n  Now, I know that some of my colleagues listening to this may be \nworrying that this legislation is insensitive to the needs of companies \nthat are trying to reorganize in order to emerge from bankruptcy and go \nforward as successful businesses. I am fully aware that sometimes, too \noften in the real world, the bankruptcy process can help companies stay \nopen and maintain jobs by restructuring obligations to creditors. Too \nmany companies in West Virginia have had to go through the painful \nprocess of Chapter 11 reorganization. I completely understand the need \nto keep the factories open. And I have always worked side by side with \ncompanies to help them recover.\n  I will continue that important work, and I have included a provision \nin this bill to help bankrupt companies that are struggling to survive \nto recover assets that have been pilfered from the corporate coffers. \nIn too many cases, company executives reward themselves even as their \ncompanies careen toward bankruptcy. The most egregious recent example \nis at Enron in 2001. In the days and weeks leading up to the bankruptcy \nfiling, executives granted large bonuses to themselves and their \nfavored employees. Millions of dollars were paid to a select group of \nemployees just before the company declared bankruptcy. It is \nunconscionable that executives would grant themselves undeserved \nbonuses and then weeks later claim that the company did not have the \nresources to pay its rank and file employees.\n  My legislation provides bankruptcy courts greater authority to \nrecover excessive compensation that was paid just prior to the \nbankruptcy filing. If the court finds that compensation was out of the \nordinary course of business or was unjust enrichment, the court can \nrecover those assets for the bankrupt company, ensuring that more \ncreditors, employees, and retirees can receive what is rightfully owed \nto them by the company.\n  The reforms I have outlined are modest. They will not take the sting \nout of bankruptcy. By definition a bankruptcy is a failure, and it is \npainful for the company's employees, retirees, and business partners. \nBut the Bankruptcy Fairness Act I am introducing today would make \nprogress toward ensuring that bankruptcies are more fair to the workers \nwho gave their time and energy and sweat to the company in exchange for \ncertain promised compensation. And by helping a company recover assets \nthat should not have been paid out as undeserved bonuses just before \nbankruptcy the bill ensures that more of a company's assets are paid to \nthe employees, retirees, and creditors who are rightfully owed.\n  It is my hope that this legislation will receive serious \nconsideration from my colleagues, and that this can open an important \ndebate about how workers and retirees can be better protected from the \nugly side of prolonged economic downturns. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe text of the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 329\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to require \na voter-verified permanent record or hardcopy under title III of such \nAct, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, in the November 2004 elections, Nevadans \nentered a new frontier for casting their votes. We became the first \nstate in the nation to require that voter-verified paper audit trail \nprinters be used with touch-screen voting machines.\n  Not only did our election go off without a hitch, but voters across \nNevada left the polls with the knowledge that their vote would be \ncounted and that their vote would be counted accurately.\n  I understand better than most the importance of the integrity of the \nballot box. I was at the mercy of a paperless-machine election in my \n1998 race for the U.S. Senate. When the votes were tallied with a \ndifference of only a few hundred, I asked for a recount in Clark \nCounty, the only county at the time using electronic voting machines. \nThe result of the recount was identical to the first count. That is \nbecause there was nothing to recount. After rerunning a computer \nprogram, the computer predictably produced the same exact tally.\n  I conceded that race and was elected to Nevada's other Senate seat in \n2000. But that experience made me realize the importance of ensuring \nAmericans that their votes will count--it is absolutely fundamental to \nour democracy.\n  That is why I led the fight for voter verification paper trails in \nthe Help America Vote Act (HAVA) that President Bush signed into law in \n2002. A voter-verified paper trail would allow voters to review a \nphysical printout of their ballot and correct any errors before leaving \nthe voting booth. This printout would be preserved at the polling place \nfor use in any recounts. This is exactly what Nevadans experienced when \nthey voted in November.\n  Unfortunately, the language that is contained in HAVA has not \nresolved this issue for most other states. Now, I am working to ensure \nvoting integrity across the country. By introducing the Voting \nIntegrity and Verification Act, I want to ensure that HAVA is clear--\nvoters must be assured that their votes will be accurate and will be \ncounted properly. A paper trail provides just such an assurance.\n  Technology has transformed the way we do many things--including \nvoting. But we cannot simply sit on the sidelines and assume that our \ndemocracy will withstand such changes. We recently witnessed the birth \nof democracy in Afghanistan and Iraq and watched as citizens risked \ntheir lives to cast their votes. Our continued work to ensure that each \nvote counts here in the United States underscores the idea that we must \nalways be vigilant in protecting democracy--whether it is brand new or \nmore than 200 years old. The Voting Integrity and Verification Act \nprotects democracy by protecting the sanctity of our vote.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 332. A bill to prohibit the retirement of F-117 Nighthawk stealth \nattack aircraft during fiscal year 2006; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill prohibiting \nretirement of F-117 stealth fighter aircraft during fiscal year 2006. I \nam also pleased my colleague, Senator Bingaman, has joined me as a \ncosponsor. The Department of Defense budget proposed for next year \nreduces operations and maintenance funds for the stealth fighter. As a \nresult, ten aircraft would be retired. I believe this would be \ndetrimental to our national security and so I offer a very simple bill \nto maintain the current F-117 force structure.\n  The mission of the stealth fighter is to strike highly important, \nhighly defended enemy targets. Pilots from Holloman Air Force Base, NM \nhave flown thousands of successful sorties while evading heavy air \ndefenses because of the F-117's stealth capability. As I think most \nknow, F-117s played a key role during operations in Serbia, in \nOperation Iraqi Freedom and in other dangerous theaters around the \nworld. The F-117 has been this nation's preeminent first strike \nplatform. And I would submit, that retiring nearly 20 percent of our \nproven stealth fighter fleet before new planes such as the F-22 and the \nJoint Strike Fighter enter the force is not prudent.\n  Last year, a similar budget request was made to reduce the F-117 \nfleet. I recommended that the Department of Defense delay such a \ndecision until new stealth platforms enter the fleet. Both the Armed \nServices committee and the Defense Appropriations subcommittee agreed \nwith my assessment and included language in their bills prohibiting the \nretirement. For fiscal year 2006 my goal remains the same: to retain \nthe vital first-strike capability this Nation has come to rely upon for \nthe immediate future.\n  I recognize that this is a time when our military forces are \ntransforming to a different kind of force--one that is more agile. I \nalso recognize that this will require new kinds of platforms and \ndifferent force structures. But at a time when the world presents a \nnumber of challenges that may require use of stealth capability, I am \ncommitted to maintaining the current configuration of the F-117 fleet \nand I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 332\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S1206]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with \nrespect to the importation of prescription drugs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing my bipartisan \nprescription drug importation legislation, the Pharmaceutical Market \nAccess and Drug Safety Act, along with Senators Snowe, Grassley, \nKennedy, McCain, Stabenow, Jeffords and many others. In all, the bill \nhas 28 cosponsors, and I expect we will add more cosponsors in the \ncoming weeks and months.\n  I am particularly pleased that Finance Committee Chairman Charles \nGrassley has joined forces with us on this year's bill. Chairman \nGrassley has made a significant contribution to the drug importation \ndebate and has provided invaluable assistance in ensuring that our bill \ncomplies with our country's trade obligations. Chairman Grassley's \nsupport also helps to demonstrate the growing momentum in the Senate \nfor a vote on our bipartisan drug importation legislation.\n  I am also glad that, in addition to being tri-partisan, this year's \nbill is also bicameral. Congresswoman JoAnn Emerson and Congressman \nSherrod Brown are introducing the companion to my bill in the House of \nRepresentatives today.\n  This is an issue whose time has come. By now, it is well-documented \nthat American consumers pay by far the highest prices in the world for \nprescription medicines, and our citizens are desperate for relief. \nEarlier this month, we learned that prices on 31 of the top-50 \nbestselling drugs went up during the last two-month period. For \ninstance, the price of the top-selling drug Lipitor has gone up 5 \npercent--double the inflation rate for all of 2004--in just the two \nmonths since November, 2004. Lipitor costs the American consumer nearly \ntwice as much per pill as the Canadian consumer.\n  These recent price increases come at the expense of American \nconsumers--especially those seniors and uninsured Americans who do not \nhave health insurance coverage for prescription drugs. The \nPharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act is a step that the \nCongress can take to put downward pressure on drug prices in our \ncountry. By some estimates, U.S. consumers could save up to $38 billion \nif they could purchase prescription medicines at the Canadian prices.\n  This year's bill is substantially similar to the bill that Senator \nSnowe and I introduced last year but it has been refined in response to \ntechnical assistance we have received from various stakeholders. We \nhave thoroughly and pro-actively addressed all of the safety issues \nthat some have raised with respect to drug importation. The fact is \nthat a system of drug importation, called parallel trade, has \nflourished with no safety problems within the European Union for the \nlast two decades. I am convinced that if the Europeans can safely trade \npharmaceuticals within Europe, the United States can safely do so, and \nour bill gives the Food and Drug Administration the authority and \nresources it needs to oversee such a system.\n  We simply cannot continue on our current course of inaction, and I \nwant to put my colleagues on notice that I am determined to get a vote \non this legislation this year on the Senate floor. The agreement that \nSenator Snowe and I reached earlier this month with Majority Leader \nFrist and new Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee Chairman \nEnzi to hold a hearing specifically on the Dorgan-Snowe bill is a step \nin the right direction.\n  I am convinced that if the full Senate is given the opportunity to \nvote on our bill, it will pass with overwhelming bipartisan support. I \nlook forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to get this \nlegislation passed by Congress and sent to the President for his \nsignature.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Mr. Warner, Mr. Allen, and Ms. \n        Mikulski):\n  S. 336. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to carry out a \nstudy of the feasibility of designating the Captain John Smith \nChesapeake National Historic Watertrail as a national historic trail; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \ninitiate a study of the feasibility of designating the route of Captain \nJohn Smith's exploration of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries as a \nNational Historic Trail. Joining me in sponsoring this legislation are \nmy colleagues Senators Warner, Allen and Mikulski.\n  Our system of National Historic Trails, NHTs, commemorate major \nroutes of historic travel and mark major events which shaped American \nhistory. To date, 13 National Historic Trails have been established in \nthe National Park Service including the Lewis and Clark, the Pony \nExpress, Selma to Montgomery, and Trail of Tears National Historic \nTrails. To be designated as a National Historic Trail, a trail must \nmeet three basic criteria: it must be nationally significant, have a \ndocumented route through maps or journals, and provide for recreational \nopportunities. In my judgment, the proposed Captain John Smith \nChesapeake National Historic Watertrail meets all three criteria.\n  Captain John Smith was one of America's earliest explorers. His role \nin the founding of Jamestown, VA--the first permanent English \nsettlement in North America--and in exploring the Chesapeake Bay region \nduring the years 1607 to 1609 marks a defining period in the history of \nour Nation. His contemporaries and historians alike credit Smith's \nstrong leadership with ensuring the survival of the fledgling colony \nand laying the foundation for the future establishment of our nation.\n  With a dozen men in a 30-foot open boat, Smith's expeditions in \nsearch of food for the new colony and the fabled Northwest Passage took \nhim nearly 3,000 miles around the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries \nfrom the Virginia capes to the mouth of the Susquehanna. On his voyages \nand as President of the Jamestown Colony, Captain Smith became the \nfirst point of contact for scores of Native American leaders from \naround the Bay region. His relationship with Pocahontas is now an \nimportant part of American folklore. Smith's notes describing the \nindigenous people he met and the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem are still \nwidely studied by historians, environmental scientists, and \nanthropologists.\n  The remarkably accurate maps and charts that Smith made of his \nvoyages into the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries served as the \ndefinitive map of the region for nearly a century. His voyages, as \nchronicled in his journals, ignited the imagination of the Old World, \nand helped launch an era of adventure and discovery in the New World. \nHundreds, and then thousands of people aspired to settle in what Smith \ndescribed as one of `` the most pleasant places known, for large and \npleasant navigable rivers, heaven and earth never agreed better to \nframe a place for man's habitation.'' Even today, his vivid \ndescriptions of the Bay's abundance still serve as a benchmark for the \nhealth and productivity of the Bay.\n  With the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown quickly \napproaching, the designation of this route as a national historic trail \nwould be a tremendous way to celebrate an important part of our \nnation's story and serve as a reminder of John Smith's role in \nestablishing the colony and opening the way for later settlements in \nthe New World. It would also give recognition to the Native American \nsettlements, culture and natural history of the 17th century \nChesapeake. Similar in historic importance to the Lewis and Clark \nNational Trail,\n\n[[Page S1207]]\n\nthis new historic watertrail will inspire generations of Americans and \nvisitors to follow Smith's journeys, to learn about the roots of our \nnation and to better understand the contributions of the Native \nAmericans who lived within the Bay region.\n  Equally important, the Captain John Smith Chesapeake National \nWatertrail can serve as a national outdoor resource by providing rich \nopportunities for education, recreation, and heritage tourism not only \nfor more than 16 million Americans living in the Bay's watershed, but \nfor visitors to this area. The water trail would be the first National \nWatertrail established in the United States and would allow voyagers in \nsmall boats, cruising boats, kayaks and canoes to travel from the \ndistant headwaters to the open Bay--an accomplishment that would \ninspire today's explorers and would generate national and international \nattention and participation. The Trail would complement the Chesapeake \nBay Gateways and Watertrails Initiative and help highlight the Bay's \nremarkable maritime history, its unique watermen and their culture, the \ndiversity of its peoples, its historical settlements and our current \nefforts to restore and sustain the world's most productive estuary.\n  This legislation enjoys strong bipartisan support in the Congress and \nin the States through which the trail passes. The legislation has been \nendorsed by the Governors of Virginia, Pennsylvania, Delaware and \nMaryland. The measure is also strongly supported by The Conservation \nFund, Izaak Walton League, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and the \nChesapeake Bay Commission. I ask unanimous consent that letters from \nthe latter two organizations expressing support for the legislation be \nprinted in the Record. I want to commend Pat Noonan, Chairman Emeritus \nof The Conservation Fund, for his vision in conceiving this trail and \nurge that the legislation be quickly enacted.\n  As John Smith wrote four centuries ago and as many Americans today \nagree, ``no place is more convenient for pleasure, profit and man's \nsustenance'' than the Chesapeake Bay.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Chesapeake Bay Foundation,\n\n                                  Annapolis, MD, February 3, 2005.\n     Hon.

His courageous crew traveled almost 3,000 \n     miles along the Chesapeake exploring the rivers and making \n     contact with American Indian tribes from what today is known \n     as Maryland, Virginia, Washington D.C., Pennsylvania, and \n     Delaware.\n       In honor of the 400th anniversary of the founding of \n     Jamestown in 1607 and the voyages of exploration in the \n     Chesapeake Bay, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation heartily \n     supports the establishment of the Capt. John Smith Chesapeake \n     National Historic Watertrai1. We also see the Trail as a \n     vital complement to a strong Chesapeake Bay Gateways Network \n     and believe that valuable synergy can result from the \n     combination.\n       Accordingly, we wish to express our support for the \n     bipartisan legislation you are introducing to authorize the \n     National Park Service to study the national significance of \n     Smith's voyages of exploration and the feasibility of \n     estabIihing a watertrail to commemorate the voyage.\n       We believe that the Capt. John Smith Chesapeake National \n     Historic Watertrail would provide invaluable assistance in \n     meeting the goals of the Chesapeake 2000 Agreement, our \n     blueprint for restoring and sustaining the Bay's ecosystem, \n     which has been badly damaged over the past 400 years by the \n     heavy footprints of our large and still-growing presence in \n     its watershed.\n       By focusing national attention upon the inherent beauty and \n     abundance of the Bay and its rich cultural and historic \n     values, America's first national watertrail would educate and \n     inspire visitors to explore, restore, and protect this unique \n     resource. The watertrail would provide exceptional \n     interpretation and stewardship opportunities, promote habitat \n     restoration and protection, and provide unparalleled \n     recreational and eco-heritage experiences--all in a cost-\n     efficient and low-impact manner.\n       Involving Communities, non-governmental organizations \n     public agencies, businesses, and private landowners in \n     establishing the Capt. John Smith Chesapeake National \n     Historic Watertrail would demonstrate a new model for public-\n     private partnerships that will form the basis of how we care \n     for our national treasures in the 21st century.\n       Nearly 400 years ago Smith sailed the Chesapeake and saw \n     the promise of a nation built on exploration, discovery and \n     partnership. America's first national watertrail will \n     celebrate the waters that once captured America's imagination \n     and instill awe and the, spirit of discovery in future \n     explorers, while it motivates them to take up active roles in \n     restoring its health.\n       Your support of the study is critical to recognize this \n     magnificent national resource.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                 William C.

Mr. President, come 2007, Virginia, along with the rest \nof our great Nation, will celebrate the 400th anniversary of the \nhistoric founding of Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement \nin the New World. At this site, back in 1607, an adventurous band of \nEnglishmen, led by Captain John Smith, pitched down their stakes on the \nshores of the Chesapeake Bay, tired from a long journey across the blue \nocean, but full of hope for the possibilities that lay ahead. And \nalthough they primarily came in search of economic gain, they brought \nwith them many of the principles that were integral to the formation of \nour American Democracy. Free enterprise, the entrepreneurial spirit, \nand respect for the principles of representative government and the \nrights of man would guide these settlers through the trials and \ntribulations of those tough, early years.\n  As we Virginians know, nobody was more influential in this founding \nendeavor, than their leader: Captain John Smith. Captain Smith was not \njust the man famously saved from death by Pocahontas, and he was more \nthan the mere commander of a small group of pioneers. John Smith, as \nVirginians learn at a young age, was the first ambassador to the native \npeoples of the Chesapeake, exchanging cultural customs, trading goods \nnecessary for the fledgling colonists survival. John Smith was also the \nfirst English explorer of the many creeks and rivers\n\n[[Page S1208]]\n\nthat populate the Maryland and Virginia of today. From 1607 to 1609, \nCaptain Smith plied the briny Bay waters, recording history and \nsurveying the land, even this patch of Earth where our Nation's Capitol \nstands today. In honor of Captain Smith's historic 3,000 mile journey \nthrough the choppy Chesapeake's main stem and tributaries, I rise \ntoday, joined by Senator Sarbanes and my colleagues from the Bay \nStates, to propose a bill authorizing the study of the feasibility of \ndesignating the Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic \nWatertrail.\n  What would this trail accomplish? What would be its purpose? Outside \nof the obvious tourism it would bring to the region, and besides the \nfact that its creation would complement the existing Chesapeake \nGateways Network, the Watertrail would educate Americans on the perils \nof our first English settlers, on their interaction with the numerous \nNative tribes, on the voyages they undertook to better understand the \nNew World they had come to inhabit. First hand, students and seniors, \nparents and children, would be able to retrace the paddle strokes and \nfootsteps of Captain John Smith, to see what he saw, to learn what he \nlearned, to know what he meant when he wrote in his diary that \n``oysters lay thick as stones'' and fish could be caught ``with frying \npan(s).''\n  Ultimately, this trail would allow for a deeper appreciation for the \nChesapeake, for a better understanding of the settlers hardships, and \nfor the distinct cultures, English and Indian, that came to pass, in \nthat historic era, at this historic place. Today I rise to celebrate \nCaptain Smith's foresight, to celebrate the founding steps of America, \nand to celebrate the bounty of the Bay. I urge my colleagues to join me \nin supporting this feasibility study for the Captain John Smith \nChesapeake National Historic Watertrail.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Jeffords, \n        Mr. Santorum, Mr. Kerry, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Chafee, \n        Mrs. Lincoln, Ms. Collins, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. \n        Voinovich, Mr. Corzine, and Mr. Coleman):\n  S. 338. A bill to provide for the establishment of a Bipartisan \nCommission on Medicaid; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, first, let me thank the twenty-or-so \norganizations that have offered their support for our bill which \ncreates a Medicaid Commission. I ask unanimous consent that the full \nlist of groups and their letters of support be printed in the Record. \nThe importance of this bill, I believe, is demonstrated by the \noutpouring of support expressed by such a diverse group of people \nrepresenting state and local elected officials, providers and \nadvocates. It is truly impressive.\n  With the debate growing over the President's budget proposal for the \nMedicaid program, Senator Bingaman and I are joining together with many \nof our colleagues to introduce this bill that calls for the creation of \na Medicaid Commission. We are joined by Senators Snowe, Lincoln, \nSantorum, Ben Nelson, DeWine, Jeffords, Collins, Durbin, Chafee and \nKerry in introducing the bill today.\n  For too long Medicaid has gone unnoticed by policy makers. Over the \npast few decades Congress has spent a great deal of time and effort \nmodernizing the Medicare program, developing ideas to fund Social \nSecurity, reforming our intelligence gathering apparatus, and enacting \nlegislation that stimulates the economy. Yet, through it all Medicaid \nhas gone unnoticed, even though it recently became the nation's largest \nhealth care program.\n  As the former President of the Oregon Senate, I have long championed \nMedicaid and worked to protect the vulnerable populations who are \nhelped by it. As a new member of the Finance Committee in 2003, I \nhelped lead the effort to provide $20 billion in short-term fiscal \nassistance. However, since that time it has become clear that Medicaid \nrequires more than band-aide fixes.\n  Medicaid requires a thorough review that should be performed by all \nkey stakeholders working together to evaluate the program. We need to \nconsider its pluses and minuses, and then chart a new path for the \nfuture. Our proposed Medicaid Commission will do just that.\n  As I have discussed with Governors, Secretary Leavitt and \nAdministrator McClellan, we have a unique opportunity in the history of \nthe Medicaid program. For once, everyone seems to be focused on \nprotecting and improving the program. The challenge lies in bringing \neveryone together.\n  It certainly won't be easy, but accomplishing great things never is. \nIt will require both parties to work together. It will require Congress \nto reach out to the Administration, Governors, State Legislators, \nproviders and advocates to determine how best to improve such a vital \nprogram.\n  And it will require advocates and providers to be willing to listen \nto new ideas that may help improve the program by creating \nefficiencies, improving quality and expanding access to care. This \ncan't be accomplished working against each other or only with select \npartners--it can only be accomplished when everyone works together.\n  I have never argued that this Commission is necessary because \nMedicaid is broken. I truly believe in this program because I have seen \nthe difference it makes in Americans' lives. It helps support poor \nchildren so they can go to school healthy and ready to learn.\n  It helps a poor expectant-mother receive the prenatal care necessary \nfor her new child to be born healthy and able to live a fulfilling \nlife, it helps a family manage the care of a disabled child, and it \nhelps an elderly person spend their last few years living with dignity. \nHowever, this program is not perfect; improvements can and should be \nmade.\n  I don't have to look any further than my home State of Oregon to see \nthat change can be beneficial. In Oregon, most people who live with a \ndisability or who are elderly are served in their home or community. It \nseems appropriate that this would happen, but Oregon actually had to \napply for a waiver to care for people in this way. That's because under \nMedicaid States receive incentives to care for people in nursing homes, \nit's called an institutional bias.\n  On the other hand, extreme reforms should be instituted simply to \nsave money. Medicaid is expensive, but so is private health care \ncoverage in this country. And in comparison, Medicaid is a pretty good \ndeal.\n  On a per-capita basis, Medicaid has only grown at a little more than \nfour percent while private sector health care costs have grown at over \n12 percent. The problem with Medicaid is that enrollment is growing and \na lot more money is being spent on long-term care compared to years \npast.\n  Much work is ahead of us. And one of the best ways to keep Medicaid \non the right path and ensure its long-term sustainability is to enact \nthis bill right now. If this Commission were made law today, we could \nhave its recommendations in time to inform Congress' deliberations next \nyear. We have a short window of opportunity before us. I urge my \ncolleagues, the President and all supporters to embrace this bill today \nand call for its passage so the Medicaid Commission can get to work.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Organizations Supporting the Bipartisan Commission on Medicaid Act of \n                                  2005\n\n       National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI); National \n     Association of Public Hospitals & Health Systems (NAPH); \n     American Hospitals Association (AHA); National Association of \n     Community Health Centers (NACHC); National Association of \n     Children's Hospitals (NACH); AIDS Institute; National Rural \n     Health Association; Catholic Health Association of the United \n     States; National Conference on Aging (NCOA); Conference of \n     State Legislatures (NCSL); National Hispanic Medical \n     Association (NHMA); The American Academy of HIV Medicine; \n     American Association of Family Physicians (AAFP); Association \n     for Community Affiliated Plans (ACAP); American Health Care \n     Association (AHCA); National Association of Counties (NACo); \n     American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists (ACOG); \n     American Dental Association (ADA); American Psychiatric \n     Association; Alliance for Quality Nursing Home Care; American \n     Geriatrics Society.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             American Health Care Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 7, 2005.\n     Hon.

Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Smith and Bingaman: I am writing on behalf of \n     the American Health\n\n[[Page S1209]]\n\n     Care Association and the National Center for Assisted Living, \n     the nation's leading long term care organizations. AHCA/NCAL \n     represent more than 10,000 non-profit and proprietary \n     facilities dedicated to continuous improvement in the \n     delivery of professional and compassionate care for our \n     nation's frail, elderly and disabled citizens who live in \n     nursing facilities, assisted living residences, subacute \n     centers and homes for persons with mental retardation and \n     developmental disabilities. AHCA/NCAL and their membership \n     are committed to performance excellence and Quality First, a \n     covenant for healthy, affordable and ethical long term care.\n       We review with great interest your draft legislation that \n     would establish a Bipartisan Commission on Medicaid and the \n     Medically Underserved. We welcome focus on the Medicaid \n     program from a population and a payment perspective. Long \n     term care is unique in that the government is the purchaser \n     of almost all nursing home services. The government demands \n     that quality be first rate--as it should--yet the payment \n     structure that would support greater quality is regulated in \n     silos, separate from each other. At a time when we as a \n     nation ought to be strengthening our long term care \n     infrastructure to prepare for the wave of baby-boom retirees \n     who will enter the system, we are, instead, allowing the \n     infrastructure to deteriorate.\n       Heretofore, Congress has focused on Medicare primarily for \n     the long term care sector, yet Medicare is a small albeit \n     significant portion of our patient population. lt is becoming \n     a better known fact that the Medicaid program funds the \n     majority of the care for people in nursing homes. \n     Approximately 67% of the average nursing home patient \n     population relies on Medicaid to pay their bill. And, \n     approximately 50% of the average nursing home's revenues come \n     from Medicaid.\n       This is why we find it illogical that the Medicare Payment \n     Advisory Commission (MEDPAC) continues to focus solely on the \n     sector's Medicare-only issues--without also looking at \n     Medicaid. When it comes to making important public policy \n     recommendations that truly impact people's lives, it is \n     inconceivable that data used to reach conclusions about the \n     sufficiency of Medicare funding fails to look collectively at \n     the real, and growing, interdependence between Medicare and \n     Medicaid.\n       We must take steps to begin to reform the long term care \n     system in terms of its reliance on the Medicaid program. Yet, \n     reform does not happen in a vacuum and we must have a debate \n     of ideas. We know a key stakeholder--the National Governors \n     Association--has placed this issue high on their list of \n     priorities. We are also beginning to see this issue raised \n     within the Social Security debate.\n       We support your legislation but do so with some \n     recommendations. First, we recommend that your legislation \n     consider the entire long term sector in terms of our payment \n     structure. Second, time is running out for reform and so we \n     believe the Commission should be vested with adequate power \n     and authority that its recommendations make a significant \n     impact on the policymaking process. We are not sure if the \n     Commission in its current form has enough force to really be \n     the catalyst for new ideas for reform.\n       We wholeheartedly believe that a far more holistic \n     evaluation is called for at this critical point in time, so \n     that beneficiaries will not fall through the cracks due to an \n     incomplete data picture and a short-sighted policy. Again, \n     thank you for the opportunity to review your legislation and \n     I look forward to working with you on Medicaid issues this \n     year.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Hal Daub,\n     CEO and President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           The AIDS Institute,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 24, 2005.\n     Re Bipartisan Commission on Medicaid and the Medically \n         Underserved Act of 2005.\n\n     Senator Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Senator Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington DC.\n       Dear Senators Smith and Bingaman: As the single largest \n     source of federal financing of health care and treatment for \n     low income people with HIV/AIDS, the future viability of our \n     Nation's Medicaid program will have a direct bearing on the \n     health of hundreds of thousands of Americans living with HIV/\n     AIDS. Since Medicaid provides access to healthcare for 55 \n     percent of all people living with AIDS, 44 percent of people \n     with HIV, and 90 percent of all children living with AIDS, it \n     plays a critical role in providing access to life-saving \n     medications that prevent illness and disability, and allow \n     people to live longer, more productive lives.\n       Because many people with HIV/AIDS are low income, or become \n     low income-and disabled, Medicaid is an important source of \n     coverage. In FY 2002, Medicaid spending on AIDS care totaled \n     $7.7 billion, including $4.2 billion in federal dollars and \n     $3.5 billion in state funds.\n       Any radical change to the benefits provided by Medicaid or \n     its financing structure can have devastating impacts that can \n     seriously jeopardize access to HIV/AIDS care in the United \n     States. What is needed is a carefully crafted, long term \n     solution to the current challenges facing the Medicaid \n     program so that low income and disabled Americans, including \n     those living with HIV/AIDS, are provided the necessary \n     healthcare they require.\n       The AIDS Institute applauds you on the introduction of the \n     ``Bipartisan Commission on Medicaid and the Medically \n     Underserved Act of 2005'', and looks forward to its passage \n     in the very near future. The Bipartisan Commission envisioned \n     by the bill would create the necessary careful review of the \n     Medicaid program in a truly bipartisan manner with the \n     expertise of representatives of the affected communities and \n     government entities. The AIDS Institute strongly believes \n     that such a review, as designed by your legislation, will \n     result in a process to conduct a thoughtful review of the \n     Medicaid program outside of the often partisan political \n     process.\n       The AIDS Institute congratulates you on your leadership on \n     this program, which is critically important to so many people \n     living with HIV/AIDS, and the introduction of the \n     ``Bipartisan Commission on Medicaid and the Medically \n     Underserved Act of 2005''. We look forward to its enactment, \n     participating in the Commission activities, and the eventual \n     recommendations of its final report.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Dr. A. Gene Copello,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                         Children's Hospitals,\n\n                                 Alexandria, VA, February 8, 2005.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith and Senator Bingaman: On behalf of the \n     National Association of Children's Hospitals (N.A.C.H.) and \n     our more than 120 members nationwide, I thank you for your \n     leadership in introducing the ``Bipartisan Commission on \n     Medicaid Act of 2005.'' Medicaid's critical role in providing \n     health coverage to low-income children, as a major payer for \n     children's hospital services and the primary safety net in \n     the nation's pediatric health care infrastructure cannot be \n     overstated. We welcome a thoughtful review to strengthen and \n     secure this vital program for years to come.\n       Medicaid is now the largest single source of health care \n     coverage for children in the nation. Half of its 53 million \n     enrollees are children and one in four children in the \n     country relies on Medicaid for health coverage. But children \n     account for only 22 percent of the costs, with the lion's \n     share of the costs attributable to people with significant \n     health and long term care needs such as the elderly and \n     people with disabilities.\n       Medicaid and children's hospitals are partners in caring \n     for children. Our member hospitals are major providers of \n     both inpatient and outpatient care to children on Medicaid. \n     In fact, children on Medicaid represented 47 percent of all \n     discharges and 41 percent of all outpatient visits at \n     children's hospitals in FY 2003.\n       And children's hospitals rely on Medicaid to serve all \n     children, not just low-income children. When provider \n     reimbursements are cut, or benefits and eligibility changes \n     are made, it affects children's hospitals' ability to provide \n     a wide range of services that all children rely upon.\n       As the single largest payer of children's health care, \n     Medicaid's performance affects the health care of all \n     children. It's coverage of low income children has enabled \n     advancements in pediatric medicine that would not have been \n     otherwise possible. We need to sustain Medicaid's successes \n     and move forward to ensure that eligible children are \n     enrolled, with access to appropriate, effective and safe \n     care.\n       Your legislation recognizes, as do our member hospitals, \n     that the future of Medicaid is not simply about cost. A hasty \n     move toward program reforms without a thorough review of the \n     program with input from those most closely associated with \n     the program would be irresponsible. The National Association \n     of Children's Hospitals applauds your efforts to direct \n     attention to how to improve service delivery and quality care \n     in Medicaid.\n       We again congratulate you on your leadership in introducing \n     this important legislation and we look forward to working \n     toward its enactment.\n           Sincerely,\n     Lawrence A. McAndrews.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   Association for\n\n\n                                   Community Affiliated Plans,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 8, 2005.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Smith and Bingaman: I write today on behalf \n     of the members of the Association for Community Affiliated \n     Plans (ACAP), an organization of Medicaid-focused community \n     affiliated health plans committed to improving the health of \n     vulnerable\n\n[[Page S1210]]\n\n     populations and the providers who serve them, to express our \n     support for your legislation, ``The Bipartisan Commission on \n     Medicaid Act of 2005.'' ACAP's Medicaid-focused managed care \n     plans serve over 1.7 million Medicaid beneficiaries in states \n     across the country.\n       The demand for efficiency and quality in our nation's \n     health care system combined with the fiscal pressures on the \n     federal, state and local governments has spurred \n     consideration of a broad spectrum of proposals to reform the \n     Medicaid program. Like you, ACAP believes the forty year-old \n     program is in need of updating. However meaningful and \n     sustainable changes will only occur if federal and state \n     policymakers along with providers, health plans, consumers \n     and others undertake a comprehensive and forthright \n     examination of the Medicaid program.\n       The purpose of such a review should be to improve the \n     efficiency of the Medicaid program based on historical \n     experiences and recent advances in health care while \n     preserving the fundamental purpose of the program--to serve \n     as the nation's health care safety net for the millions of \n     low income children, families, elderly, and disabled.\n       ACAP believes that your legislation establishing a Medicaid \n     commission would move our nation's policymakers and health \n     care leaders in the right direction. The commission's work \n     would be instrumental in understanding the underlying \n     inefficiencies as well as the initiatives and programs that \n     have proven successful. In turn, the commission would direct \n     health care leaders to respond accordingly with improvements \n     that can and should be made to the Medicaid program.\n       Should your legislation be enacted into law, we encourage \n     you to include a representative of the managed care plans on \n     the Commission. Medicaid managed care has been shown to \n     provide greater quality of care and access to providers at a \n     lower price than the traditional fee-for-service programs. As \n     such, it can serve as a model for reform of the Medicaid \n     program.\n       Tens of millions of Americans rely on Medicaid to receive \n     health care services. ACAP believes your commission would \n     result in reform that will be thoughtfully considered in \n     light of the significant consequences for Medicaid enrollees \n     as well as the providers that deliver their care.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is any way we \n     can contribute further to this effort.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Margaret A. Murray,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                               Community Health Centers, Inc.,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 7, 2005.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Smith and Bingaman: On behalf of the National \n     Association of Community Health Centers, the advocate voice \n     for our nation's Community, Migrant, Public Housing and \n     Homeless Health Centers, and the more than 15 million \n     underserved people cared for by them, I am writing to offer \n     our strong endorsement of your legislation to create a \n     bipartisan commission on Medicaid.\n       Pressure undoubtedly is growing at the federal and state \n     levels to consider reforms to Medicaid, some of which could \n     dramatically alter its fundamental structure. The commission \n     envisioned by your legislation would provide the necessary \n     leadership and serve as a credible forum for developing \n     viable solutions to strengthen Medicaid's long-term financial \n     health and assure that it continues its crucial role as a \n     safety net for our nation's most vulnerable populations.\n       Community health centers serve as a major provider of \n     primary and preventive care to nearly 6 million of the \n     estimated 51 million people served by Medicaid. Moreover, \n     studies continue to demonstrate that health centers save \n     Medicaid 30% in total health care costs compared to other \n     providers. Unfortunately, some reform proposals now being \n     discussed merely seek to cap spending or restrict Medicaid's \n     long-term cost, raising significant concerns about the \n     continued ability of health centers and other safety net \n     providers to provide quality health care to Medicaid \n     patients.\n       Health centers believe efforts to improve Medicaid should \n     seek to preserve the federal guarantee of its coverage, and \n     not reduce or eliminate its services or consumer protections. \n     In addition, we also believe it is important that these \n     efforts recognize the critical role that health centers and \n     other safety net providers play as essential sources of care \n     for millions of Medicaid recipients and uninsured Americans.\n       Medicaid is a health insurance program of critical \n     importance in this country, and finding solutions to its \n     current challenges can be daunting. However, lawmakers must \n     strive to forge a bipartisan consensus that aims to protect \n     the public's health, while ensuring that its benefits and \n     services remain a reality for low-income individuals. We \n     strongly believe that your commission is the appropriate \n     forum to achieve this goal. Therefore, we are proud to \n     endorse and offer our full support for your legislation, and \n     we stand ready to assist you in helping to achieve its \n     enactment.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact me or Licy Do Canto, \n     Assistant Director of Health Care Financing Policy, if there \n     is any way we can contribute further to this effort.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                       Daniel R. Hawkins, Jr.,\n\n                                Vice President for Federal, State,\n     and Public Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    The Catholic Health Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 8, 2005.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     Chairman, Special Committee on Aging, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Smith: On behalf of the Catholic Health \n     Association of the United States (CHA), the national \n     leadership organization of more than 2,000 Catholic health \n     care sponsors, systems, facilities, and related \n     organizations, I am writing to express our strong support for \n     the ``Bipartisan Commission on Medicaid Act of 2005.''\n       As you know, Medicaid provides crucial services to over 50 \n     million low-income children and pregnant women, the elderly, \n     and persons with disabilities. Many of these individuals \n     receive care in Catholic hospitals and Catholic long-term \n     care facilities. Without a strong and vibrant Medicaid \n     program, the number of uninsured individuals in the United \n     States would be dramatically worse. In light of the critical \n     role that Medicaid plays in the health of our nation, we \n     believe that it is important to undertake a comprehensive \n     review of the program before making any dramatic changes. To \n     do otherwise could further unravel an already frail health \n     care safety net.\n       For that reason, we are pleased to offer our support for \n     your legislation. By assembling a 23-member commission to \n     undertake a thorough review of the Medicaid program, your \n     legislation can help ensure that Medicaid continues to play a \n     key role in the health care safety net for years to come. We \n     are particularly pleased that the commission would be \n     comprised in part from important stakeholders in the Medicaid \n     program, including representation from the health care \n     provider community and advocates for Medicaid beneficiaries.\n       We are grateful for your continued efforts in support of \n     the Medicaid program. If we can be of further assistance, \n     please do not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Michael Rodgers,\n     Vice President, Advocacy and Public Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                National Association of Public\n\n                                 Hospitals and Health Systems,\n\n                                  Washington, DC February 8, 2005.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Smith and Bingaman: I am writing on behalf of \n     the National Association of Public Hospitals and Health \n     Systems (NAPH) to express our support for the Bipartisan \n     Commission on Medicaid Act of 2005. The legislation \n     recognizes Medicaid's critical role in supporting our \n     nation's safety net and emphasizes the need to carefully \n     consider any changes to the program in order to protect \n     Medicaid patients and the providers who serve them.\n       NAPH represents more than 100 of America's metropolitan \n     area safety net hospitals and health systems. NAPH hospital \n     systems serve unique roles in their communities often as the \n     largest provider of inpatient and ambulatory care to Medicaid \n     patients and patients without insurance and as providers of \n     essential services needed by everyone in their communities, \n     such as trauma and burn care services. Medicaid is the \n     primary mechanism for ensuring the provision of access to \n     health care for low-income patients. It supports safety net \n     providers, including NAPH members, who dedicate themselves to \n     providing high quality care to anyone, regardless of their \n     ability to pay. Medicaid payments provide 49 percent of the \n     net patient care revenues of NAPH members and Medicaid \n     disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments alone support \n     nearly 25 percent of the unreimbursed care provided by NAPH \n     members. Therefore, Medicaid payment issues are of critical \n     importance to NAPH members.\n       The proposed Commission on Medicaid could play an important \n     role in protecting the future of Medicaid and in ensuring \n     that any changes to Medicaid account for the various roles \n     that the program currently serves. Promoting a thorough \n     discussion among representatives of various Medicaid \n     stakeholders to develop comprehensive recommendations is a \n     responsible approach to examining the program. Measured \n     consideration is especially important today as the number of \n     uninsured continues to rise and as state Medicaid budgets \n     experience increasing pressure. NAPH does not believe that \n     reductions in the rate of growth or caps on Medicaid spending \n     are necessary to achieve stability in the program.\n       Thank you for your ongoing support of Medicaid and safety \n     net providers. We look forward to continuing to work with you \n     on finding sustainable ways to preserve and protect Medicaid.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Larry S. Gage,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                         NAMI,\n\n                                  Arlington, VA, February 7, 2005.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Smith and Bingaman: On behalf of the 210,000 \n     members and 1,200 affiliates of the National Alliance for the \n     Mentally III (NAMI), I am writing to express our\n\n[[Page S1211]]\n\n     strong support for your legislation to form a bipartisan \n     commission to study the future of the Medicaid program. As \n     the nation's largest organization representing people with \n     severe mental illnesses and their families, NAMI is pleased \n     to support this important measure.\n       As you know, Medicaid is now the dominant source of funding \n     for treatment and support services for both children and \n     adults living with severe mental illness--currently, Medicaid \n     comprises 50% of overall public mental health spending, a \n     figure that is expected to rise to 60% by 2010. More \n     importantly, Medicaid is a safety net program that is \n     intended to protect the most disabled and vulnerable children \n     and adults struggling with severe chronic illness and severe \n     disabilities such as mental illness.\n       At the same time, Medicaid is facing enormous stress at the \n     state level and in 2005 we expect more and more states will \n     be seeking to curtail future spending. NAMI remains extremely \n     concerned that these cuts are being made at the state level \n     without any discussion about the long-term impact of the \n     program. It is critically important that this debate gets \n     beyond cost and considers reforms that can make the program \n     more effective in meeting the needs of individuals who depend \n     on Medicaid as a health care and community support safety \n     net.\n       Your legislation to establish a bipartisan commission on \n     Medicaid is critically important step forward to helping the \n     federal government and the states consider and promote \n     policies that improve the program and maintain its role in \n     protecting the needs of low income people with severe \n     disabilities. NAMI thanks you for your leadership on this \n     important issue. We look forward to working with you to move \n     this important legislation forward in 2005.\n           Sincerely,\n                                   Michael J.

Gordon Smith,\n     Russell Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: On behalf of the National Council on \n     the Aging (NCOA)--the first organization formed to represent \n     America's seniors and those who serve them--is grateful for \n     your leadership on Medicaid issues and supports your proposal \n     to establish a bipartisan Commission on Medicaid.\n       Medicaid is the critical health care safety net for over 50 \n     million of our nation's most vulnerable, poorest citizens. \n     Seniors who depend on Medicaid are our oldest and most frail.\n       While Medicaid is an extremely important program, it is \n     also quite expensive. Some have gone so far as to question \n     our ability to continue to afford the essential services \n     provided under the program. We fear that some proposals to \n     reform Medicaid may be driven solely by budget concerns and \n     misplaced priorities, rather than what is best for our nation \n     and its citizens.\n       Medicaid is also a very complex program. We fear that only \n     a small handful of members in the Congress and their staff \n     understand how the program works, who it serves and what it \n     covers.\n       Largely due to our record federal budget deficit and \n     increasing budget challenges in the states, Medicaid this \n     year is being considered for significant spending reductions \n     and possible structural reforms. In our view, we should be \n     very cautious before moving forward with far-reaching changes \n     that could harm millions of Americans in need.\n       With the aging of the baby boom generation, Medicaid will \n     face increasingly serious challenges in the future, not \n     unlike those under the Medicare and Social Security programs. \n     For those programs, Congress established bipartisan \n     Commissions to consider reforms to strengthen and improve \n     them as we begin to address demographic challenges. A similar \n     non-partisan analysis is desirable for Medicaid. Bringing \n     together experts and key stakeholders is a necessary \n     prerequisite to reforming the program. For example, we need \n     to be more creative about how to finance long-term care, \n     while promoting access to a broader range of home and \n     community services. We therefore support your proposal to \n     establish a bipartisan Commission on Medicaid and look \n     forward to working with you to enact legislation into law.\n           Sincerely\n                                                     James Firman,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                American Hospital Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 4, 2005.\n     Hon.

Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Smith and Bingaman: On behalf of our 4,700 \n     hospitals, health care systems, and other health care \n     provider members, and our 31,000 individual members, the \n     American Hospital Association (AHA) strongly supports your \n     legislation to create a bipartisan commission on Medicaid and \n     the uninsured. Pressure is mounting to reform Medicaid, our \n     nation's largest health care safety net program. Your \n     commission would provide the right setting to carefully \n     deliberate needed policy changes and ensure the long-term \n     financial stability of the program.\n       Medicaid serves over 52 million people, surpassing the \n     number served by the Medicare program. Half of Medicaid's \n     beneficiaries are children and one-quarter are elderly and \n     disabled. It serves our nation's most vulnerable populations, \n     and provides half of all the dollars spent on long term care \n     in this country. Reform will have enormous consequences for \n     those Medicaid covers and the providers that deliver their \n     care. The blue ribbon panel you propose would be a \n     responsible approach to examining the program.\n       The American Hospital Association does not believe that \n     reductions in the rate of growth or caps on spending for \n     Medicaid is needed to achieve positive, successful \n     modernizations. The AHA stands ready to assist you in \n     securing passage legislation for thoughtful, deliberate \n     change to protect our most vulnerable citizens.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Rick Pollack,\n     Executive Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             American Psychiatric Association,\n\n                                  Arlington, VA, February 9, 2005.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     Chairman, Senate, Special Committee on Aging,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Smith and Senator Bingaman: The American \n     Psychiatric Association (APA), the nation's oldest medical \n     specialty society representing more than 35,000 psychiatric \n     physicians nationwide, is pleased to commend your legislation \n     to establish the Bipartisan Commission on Medicaid and the \n     Medically Underserved. The establishment of a Commission to \n     examine Medicaid and the medically underserved will help \n     identify Medicaid's current benefits and areas of needed \n     strengthening.\n       For millions of Americans with mental illnesses, Medicaid \n     is a critical source of care. Medicaid is especially \n     important to states as they face deficits that threaten the \n     stability of Medicaid funding for patients. We are also \n     concerned about the possible consequences for those of our \n     dual eligible patients who face potential disruptions of \n     treatment as they shift from Medicaid to Medicare. This bears \n     close attention.\n       Your leadership in calling for an assessment of Medicaid is \n     timely and appreciated. APA would be pleased to be a resource \n     of expertise in psychiatry and medicine with respect to \n     Medicaid.\n       Thank you again for your leadership in assessing the needs \n     of the nation's medically underserved.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        James H. Scully Jr., M.D.,\n     Medical Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  American Dental Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 8, 2005.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Smith and Bingaman: On behalf of the American \n     Dental Association (ADA), our 152,000 members and 597 state \n     and local dental societies, we would like to offer strong \n     support for your legislation to establish a bipartisan \n     commission on Medicaid and the uninsured. As Congress and \n     individual states begin to contemplate and propose Medicaid \n     reform options, it is critical to ensure an open dialogue \n     with all Medicaid stakeholders. Your commission would allow \n     policymakers, practitioners, provider institutions, patients \n     and others to work together to provide necessary reforms to \n     this important program.\n       The ADA is particularly concerned with improving access to \n     oral health care for low-income children and adults served by \n     the Medicaid program. In the 2000 landmark report, Oral \n     Health in America, the Surgeon General concluded that dental \n     decay is the most prevalent childhood disease--five times as \n     common as asthma, particularly for this population. We know \n     that only one-in-four children enrolled in Medicaid receives \n     dental care and only eight states currently provide \n     comprehensive adult dental benefits. Cumbersome \n     administrative requirements, lack of case management and \n     inadequate payment rates affect dentist participation in the \n     program and utilization of dental services. More must be done \n     to improve the Medicaid program to ensure adequate access to \n     oral health services.\n       The ADA looks forward to working with you to pass this \n     legislation and address ways to strengthen and improve the \n     dental Medicaid program, and the Medicaid program as a whole.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Richard Haught, D.D.S.,\n                                                        President.\n                                         James B. Bramson, D.D.S.,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, Senator Smith and I have worked together \nsuccessfully on several issues within the last year to defend and \nimprove our Nation's health care safety, including on an amendment to \nthe Medicare prescription drug bill addressing community health center \npayments within Medicare that passed by a vote of 94-1. However, none \nof these initiatives have been more important than the legislation that \nwe are introducing together today, along with a list of 13 other \nsenators--7 Republicans, 5 Democrats, and 1 Independent, 7 of which \nserve on the Senate Finance Committee--to create a Bipartisan \nCommission on Medicaid.\n\n[[Page S1212]]\n\nJoining Senator Smith and I as original cosponsors are: Senators Snowe, \nJeffords, Santorum, Kerry, DeWine, Durbin, Chafee, Lincoln, Collins, \nNelson of Nebraska, Voinovich, Corzine, and Coleman.\n  I will not go into the specifics of the legislation, as Senator Smith \nhas explained how the Commission would be formed and would operate. \nInstead, I will take the time to explain why it is that the formation \nof commission is so important.\n  Medicaid is a critically important health care safety net program \nthat provides health care services to over 50 million low-income \nchildren, pregnant women, seniors, and people with disabilities.\n  In New Mexico, Medicaid is the single largest payor for health care. \nAll told, Medicaid covers the health care costs of more than 400,000 \nNew Mexicans--nearly one-quarter of our State's population.\n  Although the least expensive to cover, those who benefit most from \nMedicaid are nearly 300,000 of New Mexico's children. Of the various \npopulations covered, children represent almost two-thirds of all our \nState's beneficiaries, which is the highest ratio in the Nation \naccording to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n  However, Medicaid is much more than just a safety net program for \nchildren from low-income families. It also serves low-income adults and \npregnant women. It also serves senior citizens and people with \ndisabilities who receive the bulk of their health care through Medicare \nbut who still rely on Medicaid for a substantial share of their \nbenefits and cost-sharing assistance. Medicaid also provides critically \nneeded funding to support our Nation's safety net providers, including \ndisproportionate share hospitals.\n  In the President's budget that was just released, the administration \nhas proposed cutting Medicaid by $60 billion over the next 10 years. \nSecretary Leavitt recently testified in the Senate Finance Committee \nthat he believes ``Medicaid is flawed and inefficient.''\n  There are others that believe Medicaid is not working and that costs \nare spiraling out of control and so the program needs dramatic \noverhaul.\n  In contrast. there are also those that will attest that there is \nabsolutely nothing wrong with Medicaid. I firmly believe neither point \nof view is correct.\n  First, Medicaid is far from broken. The cost per person in Medicaid \nrose just 4.5 percent per year from 2000 to 2004. That compares to a 12 \npercent rise in the annual cost of premiums in the private sector. If \nthat is the comparison, Medicaid seems to be about the most efficient \nhealth care program around, even more so than Medicare.\n  The overall cost of Medicaid is going up largely, not because the \nprogram is inefficient, but because more and more people find \nthemselves depending on this safety net program for their health care \nduring a recession. When nearly 5 million people lost employer coverage \nbetween 2000 and 2003, Medicaid added nearly 6 million to its program. \nCosts rose in Medicaid precisely because it is working--and working \nwell--as our Nation's safety net program.\n  Consequently, as noted previously, Medicaid now provides health care \nto over 50 million low-income Americans, including one-quarter of all \nNew Mexicans.\n  This is precisely why I so strongly oppose block grants or any \narbitrary caps on Federal spending for Medicaid. If we had caps in 2000 \nand Medicaid could not have responded to the economic downturn, we \nwould have 50 million uninsured today. Medicaid is a Federal-State \npartnership and an arbitrary cap of the Federal share to States is \nnothing more than the Federal Government trying to shift all risk to \nStates.\n  On the other hand, it is also not true that Medicaid is not in need \nof improvement. The administration is rightly concerned about certain \nState efforts to provide ``enhanced payments'' to institutional \nproviders as a significant factor in driving Medicaid costs. Secretary \nLeavitt, in a speech to the World Health Care Congress on February 1, \n2005, referred to State efforts to maximize Federal funding as ``the \nSeven Harmful Habits of Highly Desperate States.'' As a result, he \ncalled for ``an uncomfortable, but necessary, conversation with our \nfunding partners, the States.''\n  Unfortunately, Medicaid reform driven by a budget reconciliation \nprocess is not a dialogue or conversation. It is a one-way mechanism \nfor the Federal Government to impose its will on the States. The \nadministration's budget calls for $60 billion in cuts to Medicaid, \nincluding $40 billion that would directly harm States.\n  Where is the conversation in that? In fact, the States have a fair \namount of complaint with Federal cost shifting to the States. While I \ncertainly do not speak for the National Governors' Association or \nNational Conference of States Legislatures, some of those grievances \nare rather obvious and I share them.\n  For example, according to data from Kaiser Family Foundation, 42 \npercent of the costs in Medicaid are due to Medicare dual eligible \nbeneficiaries. These dual eligibles are also a major driver of health \ncosts in Medicare and this is a prime example of where better \ncoordination between Medicare and Medicaid could improve both programs. \nStates have been calling for better coordination for years to no avail.\n\n  In the Medicare prescription drug bill that was passed by the \nCongress in 2003, the Federal Government imposed what is referred to as \na ``clawback'' mechanism which forces the States to help pay for the \nFederally-passed Medicare prescription drug benefit. Although States \nwill derive a financial windfall from moving dual eligibles from \nMedicaid coverage to Medicare, some of the States believe the \n``clawback'' will cost them more than if they continued to provide \nprescription drug coverage themselves.\n  The prescription drug bill also impacted States financially in a host \nof other ways that went largely unnoticed, including those that \nincreased Medicaid costs for dual eligibles as a result of increases in \nthe Medicare Part B deductible and increased payments to the new \nMedicare Advantage plans. The law also required States to help enroll \nlow-income Medicare beneficiaries into the low-income drug benefit.\n  In fact, the Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, estimated that \nStates had $5.8 billion in added enrollment of dual eligibles in \nMedicaid due to what they refer to as a ``woodworking'' effect on dual \neligibles trying to sign up for the low-income drug benefit discovering \nthey are also eligible for Medicaid benefits. CBO further estimated \nthat States had $3.1 billion in new administrative and other costs \nadded by the prescription drug legislation.\n  States had no ability to ``have a conversation'' with the Federal \nGovernment about the imposition of such costs on them when the Medicare \nprescription1rrug drug bill was passed, but they should have and will \nhave in our Bipartisan Commission on Medicaid.\n  Furthermore, due to a recent rebenchmarking done by the Department of \nCommerce's Bureau of Economic Affairs with respect to the calculation \nof per capita income in the States and the application of that data by \nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, the Medicaid \nFederal Medical Assistance Percentage, or FMAP, many States, including \nNew Mexico, will see a rather dramatic decline in their Federal \nMedicaid matching percentage. In fact, due to the rebenchmarking and \nother factors, 29 states will lose Medicaid funding in 2006 by an \namount of in excess of $800 million. Again, this occurred with no \ndialogue or conversation.\n  Mr. President, I agree with Secretary Leavitt that there should be a \nconversation among all the stakeholders about the future of Medicaid \nand about what are the fair division of responsibilities between the \nFederal Government, States, local governments, providers, and the over \n50 million people served by Medicaid. It is for this reason that the \nBipartisan Commission on Medicaid includes all of those stakeholders at \nthe table to have a full discussion and debate about the future of \nMedicaid.\n  It is our intent that the recommendations would not be focused on \ncutting costs but about improving health care delivery to our Nation's \nmost vulnerable citizens. However, they are not mutually exclusive. In \nfact, both can and should be done.\n  There are those that will argue that a commission may not reach a \nconsensus to make recommendations to\n\n[[Page S1213]]\n\nimprove the Medicaid program and so is not worth the effort. I would \nstrongly disagree and point to the fact that the National Academy for \nState Health Policy recently convened a workgroup they called Making \nMedicaid Work for the 21st Century that included many of the Medicaid \nstakeholders and came forth with a 78-page report with numerous \nrecommendations with respect to eligibility, benefits, and financing. \nAccording to the report entitled Improving Health and Long-Term Care \nCoverage for Low-Income Americans, the workgroup attempted to ``assess \nareas where it would be most productive to focus on improvement in the \nprogram, and to develop consensus around recommendations for reform.'' \nI would underscore the emphasis of the workgroup on ``improving'' \nMedicaid and health coverage. This should be the primary and overriding \ngoal of the Bipartisan Commission on Medicaid that we are introducing \ntoday.\n  Before closing, I once again thank Senator Smith, the other 12 Senate \ncosponsors, and the various stakeholders--State and local governments, \nproviders, and consumers that have endorsed this legislation--in an \neffort, not to cut Medicaid, but to make it more efficient and \neffective in the delivery of care to our Nation's most vulnerable \ncitizens.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a copy of the Fact Sheet accompanying \nthis legislation printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Fact Sheet\n\n\n                   BIPARTISAN COMMISSION ON MEDICAID\n\n       Senators Gordon Smith (R-OR), Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), Olympia \n     Snowe (R-ME), Jim Jeffords (I-VT), Rick Santorum (R-PA), John \n     Kerry (D-MA), Mike DeWine (R-OH), Richard J. Durbin (D-IL), \n     Lincoln D. Chafee (R-RI) Blanche L. Lincoln (D-AR), Susan \n     Collins (R-ME), Ben Nelson (D-NE), George Voinovich (R-OH), \n     Jon S. Corzine (D-NJ), and Norm Coleman (R-MN) are \n     introducing legislation that calls for the creation of a \n     Bipartisan Commission on Medicaid.\n       Just as the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 called for the \n     creation of the Bipartisan Commission on the Future of \n     Medicare, the Medicaid program should also undergo a \n     comprehensive and thorough review of what is and is not \n     working and how to improve service delivery and quality in \n     the most cost-effective way possible.\n       This legislation recognizes that determining the future of \n     Medicaid is not simply about cost. While Medicaid is \n     estimated to cost the federal government $188 billion in FY \n     2005, attention also should be given to the diverse \n     population served. Over 50 million people receive care \n     through Medicaid, including low-income seniors, people with \n     disabilities, children, and pregnant women. Further, it is \n     important to note that while costs are increasing, Medicaid \n     is growing at a slower per capita rate than either Medicare \n     or the private sector.\n       The Medicaid Commission would be charged with a number of \n     duties, including reviewing and making recommendations with \n     respect to the long-term goals, populations served, financial \n     sustainability (federal and state responsibility), \n     interaction with Medicare and the uninsured, and the quality \n     of care provided.\n       Medicaid is a critically important program helping meet the \n     health care needs of a diverse population through four \n     different programs by serving as:\n       (1) a source of traditional insurance for poor children and \n     some of their parents;\n       (2) a payer for a complex range of acute and long term care \n     services for the frail elderly and people with disabi1ities;\n       (3) a source of wrap-around coverage or assistance for low-\n     income seniors and people with disabilities on Medicare, \n     including coverage of additional benefits and assistance with \n     Medicare premiums and copayments; and,\n       (4) the primary source of funding to safety net providers \n     that serve both Medicaid patients and the 45 million \n     uninsured.\n       In recognition of this diversity, the bill's Medicaid \n     Commission would be comprised of 23 members that reflect all \n     the stakeholders and components in the Medicaid program. \n     Those members include the following: One Member appointed by \n     the President; Two House members (current or former) \n     appointed by the Speaker and Minority Leader; Two Senators \n     (current or former) appointed by the Majority and Minority \n     Leader; Two Governors designated by NGA; Two Legislators \n     designated by NCSL; Two state Medicaid directors designated \n     by NASMD; Two local elected officials appointed by NACo; Four \n     consumer advocates appointed by congressional leadership; \n     Four providers appointed by congressional leadership; Two \n     program experts appointed by Comptroller General.\n       The Commission has just one year to hold public hearings, \n     conduct its evaluations and deliberations, and issue its \n     report and recommendations to the President, the Congress, \n     and the public.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with a number of my \ncolleagues in cosponsoring the Bipartisan Commission on Medicaid and \nthe Medically Underserved Act of 2005, which Senator Smith and Senator \nBingaman are introducing today.\n  The Medicaid program provides essential medical services to low-\nincome and uninsured children and their families, pregnant women, \nsenior citizens, individuals with disabilities, and others. Last year, \nnearly 55 million Americans were enrolled in Medicaid, including more \nthan 300,000 in Maine where one in five people now receive health care \nservices through MaineCare, our State's Medicaid program.\n  Individuals who rely upon Medicaid-funded health services have no \nother option. Without Medicaid, they would join the ever growing ranks \nof the uninsured in this country, which now numbers an all-time high of \nmore than 45 million Americans who lacked health coverage at some point \nlast year. These two groups represent a total of 100 million Americans \nwho would have no health insurance were it not for Medicaid coverage \nwhich reaches just over half of them. And to the extent that the \nFederal Government reduces its support for Medicaid funding, the \nnumbers of uninsured Americans will rise at an even faster rate.\n  As Congress begins to consider the administration's Fiscal Year 2006 \nBudget, I believe we must take a balanced approach that is both \nfiscally responsible and reflects our long-standing commitments to \nprovide health care for many of the low-income and uninsured through \nthe Medicaid program. Although we face growing budget deficits and ever \ntightening Federal budgets, the Federal Government cannot simply \nabandon its responsibility to help states provide health care access to \nour most vulnerable citizens.\n  Today, Medicaid is the fastest growing component of State budgets, \naccording to the most recent survey of the National Governors \nAssociation. Total Medicaid spending nationwide now averages 22 percent \nof State budgets, while State spending on all healthcare functions is \napproximately 31 percent. However, although its costs are increasing, \nthe annual growth in Medicaid spending on a per capita basis is growing \nmore slowly, at 4.5 percent a year, than the private sector where \nhealth insurance premiums have increased an average of 12.5 percent a \nyear for the last 3 years.\n  The economic downturn which State economies experienced several years \nago, and from which many States are only now emerging, has continued to \nleave many families jobless and without health insurance, forcing them \nto turn to Medicaid. This has put an enormous strain on the states \nalready strapped with budget scarcities. Many States reduced Medicaid \nbenefits last year and even more restricted Medicaid eligibility in an \neffort to satisfy their budgetary obligations.\n  In fact, the Chairman of the National Governors Association, Governor \nWarner of Virginia, and the Vice Chairman, Governor Huckabee of \nArkansas, recently warned Congress that if Federal spending for \nMedicaid were capped and the number of Medicaid recipients increased \nsharply, States would face dire fiscal consequences. According to the \nGovernors, total costs for State Medicaid programs are growing at an \nannual rate of 12 percent, and total Medicaid expenditures now exceed \nthat of Medicare, due primarily to factors beyond States' control, \nespecially the costs of long-term care: Medicaid now accounts for 50 \npercent of all State long-term care spending and pays for the care of \n70 percent of those in nursing homes.\n\n  At this time, therefore, it is crucial that we continue to provide \nsufficient Federal funding for Medicaid, which has worked so well since \nit began providing care for some of our most vulnerable populations 40 \nyears ago. We must proceed cautiously before making any significant \nchanges in the program, and the Medicaid Commission established by this \nbill will ensure that necessary deliberative approach.\n  The concept of a commission to undertake a comprehensive review of \nthe Medicaid program and recommend possible changes is similar to the \ncommission which Congress established in the late 1990s, the Bipartisan \nCommission on the Future of Medicare. That commission examined various \naspects of\n\n[[Page S1214]]\n\nthe Medicare program to determine areas that should be modernized and \nlater recommended a number of changes, including a prescription drug \nbenefit. Those recommendations initiated the process of congressional \ndebate and consideration of reforming the Medicare program, culminating \nin the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act \nwhich passed in 2003 and, among other reforms, included the new \nprescription drug benefit for seniors which will take effect next year.\n  The new Medicare prescription drug benefit will have a major impact \non Medicaid since it will shift Federal expenditures for drug benefits \ncurrently provided by Medicaid for the ``dual eligible'' population--\nthose who are eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare--to Medicare. \nHowever, this will not lift most of the financial responsibility and \nburden of prescription drug costs from the States. Recent estimates by \nthe National Governors Association show that currently 42 percent of \nall Medicaid dollars are spent on ``dual eligible'' Medicare \nbeneficiaries, although they comprise only a small percentage of \nMedicaid cases, and they are covered by Medicare for other services.\n  The new prescription drug program includes a provision known as the \n``claw-back'' which will require States to remit funds to the Federal \nGovernment, based on their inflation-adjusted 2003 per person Medicaid \nexpenditures for prescription drugs for these beneficiaries. Although \nthe percentage share of drug costs that States must pay for the dual \neligibles will decline over time, from 90 percent to 75 percent, States \nwill continue to pay the lion's share of dual eligibles' prescription \ndrug costs. Many States are just now recognizing this fact and are \nlooking for ways to accommodate these ongoing costs.\n  Unanswered questions like these remain concerning the ultimate impact \nof the Medicare drug program on State budgets and Medicaid programs. \nOne of the primary duties of the Medicaid Commission would be to review \nand make recommendations on the interaction of Medicaid with Medicare \nand other Federal health programs.\n  Moreover, the formula for calculating the Federal matching rate, \nknown as the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, FMAP, which \ndetermines the Federal Government's share of a State's expenditures for \nMedicaid each year, has also contributed to the Medicaid problems that \nStates are facing. The FMAP formula is designed so that the Federal \nGovernment pays a larger portion of Medicaid costs in States with a per \ncapita income lower than the national average. However, the formula \nlooks back 3 years, to points in time that are not necessarily \nreflective of a State's current financial situation.\n\n  In fiscal year 2003, for example, the FMAP for that year was \ncalculated in 2001 for the fiscal year beginning October 2002. The FMAP \nfor FY 2003 was determined on the basis of State per capita income over \nthe 3-year period of 1998 through 2000, when State economies were \ngrowing significantly. Yet in 2003, when this matching rate was in \neffect, a serious economic downturn was affecting many State budgets, \nand that downturn has contributed greatly to the growth of Medicaid for \nseveral years now.\n  We recognized this situation in the last Congress and provided for \nState fiscal relief by providing a temporary increase in the Federal \nMedicaid matching rate, which provided $10 billion in fiscal relief to \nStates during fiscal 2003 and 2004, when we passed the Jobs and Growth \nTax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. But that fiscal relief has \nsunset.\n  One of the duties of the Medicaid Commission would be to make \nrecommendations on how to make Federal matching payments more equitable \nwith respect to the States and the populations they serve, as well as \nhow to make them more responsive to changes in States' economic \nconditions.\n  The fact is, Medicaid and Medicare have complex responsibilities, \nfinancing, and interrelationships and that is why a Medicaid Commission \nis vital for the future state budgets and the Medicaid program as a \nwhole.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us supporting this legislation to help \nsustain and improve this critical health care safety net for our most \nvulnerable Americans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Nelson of \n        Nebraska, and Mr. Ensign):\n  S. 339. A bill to reaffirm the authority of States to regulate \ncertain hunting and fishing activities; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I am introducing the ``Reaffirmation \nof State Regulation of Resident and Nonresident Hunting and Fishing Act \nof 2005.'' This legislation explicitly reaffirms each State's right to \nregulate hunting and fishing. I am pleased that Senators Ben Nelson, \nJohn Ensign, Max Baucus, and Ted Stevens are joining me in sponsoring \nthis important bill.\n  This is a Nevada issue, but it also is a national issue, as a recent \nFederal circuit court ruling undermines traditional hunting and fishing \nlaws. In Conservation Force v. Dennis Manning, the Ninth Circuit Court \nof Appeals ruled that State laws that distinguish between State \nresidents and non-residents for the purpose of affording hunting and \nrelated privileges are constitutionally suspect.\n  This threatens the conservation of wildlife resources and \nrecreational opportunities. Although the Ninth Circuit found the \npurposes of such regulation to be sound, the court questioned the \nvalidity of tag limits for non-resident hunters.\n  I respect the authority of States to enact laws to protect their \nlegitimate interests in conserving fish and game, as well as providing \nopportunities for in-State and out-of-State residents to hunt and fish. \nThat's what this legislation says--we respect that State right.\n  Sportsmen are ardent conservationists. They support wildlife \nconservation not only through the payment of State and local taxes and \nother fees, but also through local non-profit conservation efforts and \nby volunteering their time.\n  For example, in Nevada there are great groups such as Nevada Bighorns \nUnlimited and the Fraternity of Desert Bighorn. These are dedicated \nsportsmen who spend countless hours and much of their own money \nbuilding ``guzzlers'' in the desert, which help provide a reliable \nsource of water for bighorn sheep and other wildlife. Without these \nefforts it would be extremely hard for bighorn sheep to survive in much \nof their historic range in Nevada because much of their historic range \nhas been fragmented by development. Today, Southern Nevada is in the \nmidst of a very difficult 500-year drought, and the work of the \nconservation groups has saved thousands of our bighorn sheep.\n  The deep involvement of local sportsmen in protecting and conserving \nwildlife is one important justification for the traditional resident/\nnon-resident distinctions, and provides the motivation for our \nlegislation. The regulation of wildlife is traditionally within a \nState's purview, and this legislation simply affirms the traditional \nrole of States in the regulation of fish and game.\n  This bill is time sensitive. The out-of-State hunters that brought \nthe suit in the 9th Circuit are now threatening to get a restraining \norder from the Federal court to delay the opening of the big game \nseason in Nevada this year. This threat itself is causing great damage \nto conservation and fish and game management in Nevada.\n  According to The Las Vegas Sun, Nevada's Wildlife Department has \nalready borrowed $3 million to get through the fiscal year, eliminated \nthree positions, and has plans to eliminate five more. Delaying hunting \nseasons while the courts resolve this issue could cause the Department \nto literally shut down.\n  Uncertainty with regard to hunting and fishing regulations is bad for \nthe conservation of Nevada's resources. This bill needs to pass now. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to expedite passage of this \nimportant legislation. I ask that the text of this bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 339\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Reaffirmation of State \n     Regulation of Resident and\n\n[[Page S1215]]\n\n     Nonresident Hunting and Fishing Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DECLARATION OF POLICY AND CONSTRUCTION OF \n                   CONGRESSIONAL SILENCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--It is the policy of Congress that it is in \n     the public interest for each State to continue to regulate \n     the taking for any purpose of fish and wildlife within its \n     boundaries, including by means of laws or regulations that \n     differentiate between residents and nonresidents of such \n     State with respect to the availability of licenses or permits \n     for taking of particular species of fish or wildlife, the \n     kind and numbers of fish and wildlife that may be taken, or \n     the fees charged in connection with issuance of licenses or \n     permits for hunting or fishing.\n       (b) Construction of Congressional Silence.--Silence on the \n     part of Congress shall not be construed to impose any barrier \n     under clause 3 of Section 8 of Article I of the Constitution \n     (commonly referred to as the ``commerce clause'') to the \n     regulation of hunting or fishing by a State or Indian tribe.\n\n     SEC. 3. LIMITATIONS.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed--\n       (1) to limit the applicability or effect of any Federal law \n     related to the protection or management of fish or wildlife \n     or to the regulation of commerce;\n       (2) to limit the authority of the United States to prohibit \n     hunting or fishing on any portion of the lands owned by the \n     United States; or\n       (3) to abrogate, abridge, affect, modify, supersede or \n     alter any treaty-reserved right or other right of any Indian \n     tribe as recognized by any other means, including, but not \n     limited to, agreements with the United States, Executive \n     Orders, statutes, and judicial decrees, and by Federal law.\n\n     SEC. 4. STATE DEFINED.\n\n       For purposes of this Act, the term ``State'' includes the \n     several States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of \n     Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and \n     the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 340. A bill to maintain the free flow of information to the public \nby providing conditions for the federally compelled disclosure of \ninformation by certain persons connected with the news media; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Free Flow of \nInformation Act of 2005. This bill was originally introduced in the \nHouse of Representatives by my friend and colleague, Congressman Mike \nPence. I applaud the initiative by my colleague to address this \nimportant issue and I am pleased to have this opportunity to be the \nSenate sponsor.\n  Last year, Congress passed legislation I proposed that directed the \nState Department to increase and add greater focus to international \ninitiatives to support the development of free, fair, legally protected \nand sustainable media in developing countries.\n  I am pleased to announce that the State Department and the National \nEndowment for Democracy have embraced this initiative and are now \nproceeding with implementing this initiative.\n  Our Founders understood that free press is a cornerstone of \ndemocracy. To embrace and implement President Bush's bold and visionary \ncall for the spread of democracy and freedom in the world, it is \nincumbent upon us to ensure that foreign assistance programs focus on \nthe development of all the institutions that help democracies work and \nprotect basic human rights.\n  While we focus on those needs abroad, we cannot let those basic \nfreedoms erode at home. The Constitution makes very clear that freedom \nof the press should not be infringed. A cornerstone of our society is \nthe open market of information which can be shared through ever \nexpanding mediums. The media serves as a conduit of information between \nour governments and communities across the country.\n  It is important that we ensure reporters certain rights and abilities \nto seek sources and report appropriate information without fear of \nintimidation or imprisonment. This includes the right to refuse to \nreveal confidential sources. Without such protection, many \nwhistleblowers will refuse to step forward and reporters will be \ndisinclined to provide our constituents with the information that they \nhave a right to know. Promises of confidentiality are essential to the \nflow of information the public needs about its government.\n  The Free Flow of Information Act closely follows existing Department \nof Justice guidelines for issuing subpoenas to members of the news \nmedia. These guidelines were adopted in 1973 and have been in \ncontinuous operation for more than 30 years. The legislation codifies \nthe conditions that must be met by the government to compel the \nidentity of confidential sources.\n  I am hopeful that my colleagues will give careful consideration to \nthe merits of this legislation. It provides an appropriate approach and \ncareful balance to protect our freedom of information while still \nenabling legitimate law enforcement access to information.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/09/senate-section/article/S1215-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4.
