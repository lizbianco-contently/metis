Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 3057, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3057) making appropriations for foreign \n     operations, export financing, and related programs for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 2006, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Majority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today, we return to the consideration of \nthe Foreign Operations appropriations bill. We began that bill last \nFriday with opening statements. Senators McConnell and Leahy are ready \nfor Members to offer their amendments during today's session. They are \nnot encouraging amendments, but if Senators do want to offer \namendments, we do ask they come forward as soon as possible. I am very \nhopeful we can complete this bill tomorrow. I think it is likely we can \ndo that if Senators will come forward today and offer amendments, if \nthey have any.\n  We will be voting this afternoon at about 5:30, and we will be \nannouncing a little bit later today what the nature of that vote will \nbe. Senators will be notified once we lock in the time. It will be \naround 5:30 today.\n  As a reminder, tomorrow, at 10 o'clock in the morning, there will be \na joint meeting with the House of Representatives. The Prime Minister \nof India, Manmohan Singh, will be speaking to both Houses of Congress \nat that joint meeting.\n  We have 2 weeks remaining before our next recess. We have a lot of \nbusiness over the next 2 weeks to conduct. The Democratic leader and I \nwere just talking, going through our objectives, and will be sharing \nthat and consulting with our colleagues as to how these next 2 weeks \nwill play out. The floor schedule is going to be very busy. It will \ntake precedence over other schedules, so we do ask Senators to keep \ntheir schedules flexible so we can accomplish the many tasks before us.\n\n\n                     Health Information Technology\n\n  Mr. President, on another issue, briefly--but it is an issue that \nmeans a lot to me as one who sees the real advantage in legislating in \nthis arena--I want to comment on the issue of electronic medical \nrecords and the increasing necessity, if we are going to eliminate the \nwaste and abuse in our health care system today, of focusing on ways to \nshare information throughout our health care system, which has been too \nfragmented and too disjointed in terms of communication.\n  I want to share with our colleagues that we have worked a lot on this \nissue over the last 4 to 5 days, including the weekend, and that we \nhave made real progress and have come very close to achieving the goal \nof having privacy-protected electronic health records legislation come \nbefore this body.\n  Senator Clinton and I introduced legislation last June. Senators Enzi \nand Kennedy have been working on legislation. Our goal has been to pull \nthis legislation together. Indeed, we have made real progress in \nagreeing to outlines of strong legislation, which I am absolutely \nconvinced will eliminate a lot of waste in the system, will improve \nquality, will increase efficiencies in the delivery of health care, \nwill empower payments, and will improve patient safety throughout our \nhealth care system. So I am very excited about it.\n  We promote the use of electronic health records by adopting \nstandards. You have to have similar standards throughout the system if \npeople are going to come in and participate and share information. So \nwe approached standards. We ensure quality measurement. We eliminate \nbarriers to the adoption of this technology of electronic health \nrecords. And we incentivize providers and those throughout the system \nwho use this information to actually adopt the standards with lowered \nbarriers so the advantages can be realized.\n\n[[Page S8394]]\n\n  I thank Senators Clinton, Enzi, and Kennedy for all of their \ntremendous work. Chairman Enzi plans to take that legislation to the \nHELP Committee, I believe, on Wednesday morning. Following that, I look \nforward to working with my colleagues for Senate passage.\n  Mr. President, we have a very busy week before us. Again, we will be \nturning to the foreign operations legislation shortly.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 3130\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my distinguished colleague leaves the \nfloor, I ask unanimous consent that the Appropriations Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of H.R. 3130, the veterans health \ncare supplemental bill, that the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration, and that the bill be amended to increase the funding \nlevel to $1.5 billion; that the bill, as amended, be read a third time \nand passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we have been here before. Indeed, the \nSenate has voted twice, most recently on the Homeland Security \nappropriations bill we finished last week, and then a week before that \non the Interior appropriations bill, to provide $1.5 billion for \nveterans health programs for the current fiscal year, with the \nremainder of it to be used until expended.\n  I supported those amendments, as did the Democratic leader.\n  The conference on the Interior bill, I understand, is well underway \nand will be completed by the end of this week. I fully expect that the \n$1.5 billion in additional funding for veterans health care will be on \nthe President's desk for his signature before we leave in 2 weeks for \nthe August recess.\n  In addition, I should also mention it is important that no veteran \nright now--no single veteran--is being denied needed health care. The \nother thing I want to mention to the Democratic leader, because I have \nnot mentioned it before, is that if, for some unexpected reason, the \nInterior appropriations conference report is not finished, then I think \nhe and I could join together and sponsor legislation, stand-alone \nlegislation if need be, to accomplish the same thing that he requests. \nI do not believe it is necessary today because we will accomplish this \ngoal before we leave. The conference on the Interior bill is underway \nand will provide that funding.\n  Therefore, I object to the unanimous consent request by the minority \nleader.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could just briefly say, I appreciate \nthe statement of the distinguished majority leader. I want this matter \nto stay before the attention of the Senate. I think it would be better \nto do it this way and send it to the House. I think that would be so \nmuch better. It would be done, I believe, more quickly.\n  But I also say at this stage the veterans programs are being \ncannibalized. Those programs for capital construction are being used \nfor health care. I think it would be better if we dispose of this. I \nwill watch the conference committee very closely. It is really not a \nplace for veterans funding programs, but we will take it wherever we \nget it. Again, I am sorry we were not able to work it out more quickly, \nbut I do look forward to completing it in this work period.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have a question I want to ask my friend.\n  The money in the Interior bill, I hope it is additional money, not \nmoney coming from other programs. Does the distinguished majority \nleader know about that? Do you understand my question? I hope it is new \nmoney. I hope it is not money we are taking from other programs.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in response, I will check with Chairman \nBurns to see where specifically the money comes from. I am not exactly \naware where the money comes from.\n  Mr. REID. Because if it is going to come from other Interior \nprograms, I would even go so far as to suggest maybe the Presiding \nOfficer would not want $1.5 billion to come out of the Interior bill \nfor programs that are not within the Interior bill. I know I would not \nlike that.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it is all new money. It is not being taken \nfrom other programs.\n  Mr. REID. That is real good news.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1239\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, for many years, I have been active in \nefforts to stop exploitative child labor as well as trafficking in \nchild and female slaves around the world. In my travels to many \ncountries, I have seen this scourge firsthand. I have come to the floor \nof the Senate many times to speak about this issue. I have spoken about \nhow shocked I was to see the deplorable conditions under which these \nkids are forced to work. Many are physically, emotionally, and sexually \nabused. All of them, every child engaged in abusive child labor is \ndeprived of a childhood solely for someone else's gain.\n  Why should we as a nation tolerate children being used in such a \nmanner? We should not. It is a moral outrage and an affront to human \ndignity. When a child is exploited for the economic gains for others, \nnot only does the child lose, but the family loses and I think the \nwhole world loses. It is bad economics, and it is bad development \nstrategy. A nation cannot achieve prosperity on the backs of children, \nand there should simply be no place in the global economy for child \nlabor.\n  So when news reports about forced child labor on west African cocoa \nfarms first emerged in 2001, I was not entirely surprised. According to \none report in a series of articles by Knight Ridder, the child laborers \nof Ivory Coast ``are whipped, beaten, and broken like horses to harvest \nthe almond-sized beans that are made into chocolate treats for more \nfortunate children in Europe and the United States.''\n  After looking into this, I resolved to do everything I could to end \nthis tragic exploitation of children working on cocoa farms. However, I \nsought a legislative remedy not as a first resort but as a last resort. \nTogether with Congressman Eliot Engel of New York, we engaged the major \nchocolate companies in lengthy, intense negotiations. The result is \nwhat is now called the Harkin-Engel protocol for the growing and \nprocessing of cocoa beans in a manner that complies with the \nInternational Labor Organization Convention 182 concerning the \nprohibition and immediate action for the elimination of the worst forms \nof child labor. This protocol would apply to everywhere cocoa is grown \nand processed.\n  The agreement laid out a series of date-specific actions, including \nthe development of credible, mutually acceptable, voluntary \nindustrywide standards of public certification by July 1 of 2005, this \nmonth, in order to give a public accounting of labor practices in cocoa \nfarming.\n  The Harkin-Engel protocol marked an important first--an entire \nindustry, including companies from the United States, Europe, and the \nUnited Kingdom, taking responsibility for addressing the worst forms of \nchild labor and forced labor in its supply chain.\n\n[[Page S8396]]\n\n  Today the protocol stands as a framework for progress in west Africa, \nbringing together industry, west African governments, organized labor, \nnongovernmental organizations, farmers groups, and experts in a \nconcerted effort to eliminate the worst forms of child labor and forced \nlabor from the growing and processing of cocoa.\n  Since the Harkin-Engel protocol was signed, a number of positive \nsteps have been taken to address the worst forms of child labor in \ncocoa growing. These include the creation of the International Cocoa \nInitiative Foundation, which is now beginning to form partnerships with \nnongovernmental organizations to provide social protection programs in \nwest Africa. Also, in Ghana, the International Labor Organization \ncarried out a small pilot project, and in the Ivory Coast, the \ngovernment is committed to conducting a similar pilot project to \nexamine the labor situation and social protection needs on cocoa farms. \nThese pilot programs will then be assessed and used to develop a child \nlabor monitoring system.\n\n  Although I was disappointed that the July 1 deadline was not fully \nmet by the industry, they have given us a commitment to achieving a \ncertification system which can be expanded across the cocoa-growing \nareas of west Africa and which will cover 50 percent of the cocoa-\ngrowing areas of Ivory Coast and Ghana in 3 years' time. I am very \npleased with this commitment.\n  Going forward, the industry has pledged to dedicate more than $5 \nmillion annually to support the full implementation of a certification \nsystem for cocoa growing farming practices and for programs to improve \nthe well-being of the more than 1.5 million farm families growing cocoa \nin west Africa, including efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child \nlabor and forced labor.\n  Specifically, the rollout of the certification system, including \nmonitoring, data analysis reporting, and activities to reduce the worst \nforms of child labor, will proceed as aggressively as possible in Ivory \nCoast and Ghana with the goal of covering 50 percent of the two \ncountries' cocoa-producing areas by July of 2008. This is, indeed, a \nmilestone on the way toward the ultimate goal of 100 percent coverage \nin cocoa-producing countries around the world.\n  In addition, the industry pledges to improve conditions in west \nAfrica cocoa farming communities and to address the worst forms of \nchild labor and forced labor at the community level through the \nInternational Cocoa Initiative Foundation, the World Cocoa Foundation, \nand the Initiative for Africa Cocoa Communities. Congressman Engel and \nI have accepted the industry's pledge and commitment, and we \ncongratulate them for this.\n  The protocol framework continues. However, as President Reagan used \nto say regarding arms agreements with the Soviet Union, we decided to \ntrust but verify. To ensure accountability and transparency, \nCongressman Engel and I will establish an independent oversight entity \nto monitor future implementations of the accord. This entity will \ninclude experts on child and forced labor, as well as on corporate \nsocial responsibility, and will monitor the industry's work and produce \nperiodic publicly available reports on its progress.\n  Again, I applaud the cocoa industry, the chocolate industry for their \nagreement to accept such an independent oversight entity.\n  In addition, to accelerate progress, I support the recommendation of \nthe verification working group, a group charged under the protocol with \nan independent assessment of the certification system to create a \nskilled, multi-stakeholder working group on certification.\n  Yes, I am disappointed that the July 1 deadline was not fully met, \nbut I am reassured that the industry is committed to the goal we all \nshare, which is to eliminate the scourge of the worst forms of child \nlabor and forced labor in cocoa-producing countries.\n  Obviously, I will be closely monitoring progress under the protocol \nin the months and years ahead, and I will make periodic reports on the \nSenate floor and in the media. As Justice Brandeis once said, sunlight \nis the best disinfectant. Progress under the protocol will be \ntransparent. It will be documented and reported for the entire world to \nsee.\n  Congressman Engel and I are fully committed to meeting the terms and \ngoals of the protocol. As I also said, we are pleased that the \nchocolate industry likewise has pledged its full commitment to these \nterms and goals. I would also like to commend the governments of the \nCote d'Ivoire and Ghana for their cooperation in meeting the terms of \nthe protocol. Clearly, it is in the interest of these national \ngovernments to eradicate the worst forms of child labor for their own \neconomic and social well-being.\n  We all realize the stakes are incredibly high and that the time for \njust talking has passed. Child labor and forced labor continue in the \ncocoa fields of west Africa and elsewhere. Children today are \nsuffering, being deprived of their childhood, being beaten, being \ndeprived of education. And ultimately the chocolate companies have a \nbig responsibility in stopping this suffrage. I will continue to work \nwith them and with the west African governments to eliminate this \nscourge.\n  At this time I would like to inform my colleagues of my intent to \noffer a sense-of-the-Senate resolution to the Foreign Operations \nappropriations bill that the Senate is now considering. My amendment \nsimply reaffirms the industry's commitments to eradicate child labor \nfrom cocoa plantations. The resolution I will offer reflects the main \npoints I have mentioned today. I hope it will be a noncontroversial \namendment and that it can be accepted by the managers of the bill.\n  Furthermore, Mr. President, I would remiss if I did not mention in \npassing, at least right now, some of the other problems facing the \nAfrican continent today: HIV/AIDS, hunger, the genocide in Darfur, debt \nrelief, millions of displaced people. Unfortunately, the list is long \nand the problems severe. I was pleased that the recent G8 meeting held \nin Scotland addressed some of these issues. This is a positive but, I \nmust add, a small step forward. In order to successfully meet the \nchallenges facing African nations, nations of the world must work \ntogether. And I will continue to support our chairman and ranking \nmember and our committee on the foreign operations appropriations \nsubcommittee to do all we can to help in those efforts.\n  Mr. President, I am going to just read briefly some parts of the \namendment that I will be offering to H.R. 3057. Basically, it is just, \nagain, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution to express the sense of \nCongress regarding abusive child labor practices in the growing and \nprocessing of cocoa. It has a number of findings, but it is a sense of \nCongress that:\n\n       The cocoa industry is to be commended, as the Protocol \n     agreement is the first time that an industry has accepted \n     moral, social, and financial responsibility for the \n     production of raw materials wherever they are produced;\n       The Government of the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire and the \n     Government of the Republic of Ghana should be commended for \n     the tangible steps they have taken to address the situation \n     of child labor in the cocoa sector;\n       An independent oversight body should be designated and \n     supported to work with the chocolate industry, national \n     governments and nongovernmental organizations on the progress \n     of the development and implementation of the certification \n     system by July 1, 2008 through a series of public reports;\n       The governments of West African nations that grow and \n     manufacture cocoa should consider child labor and forced \n     labor issues of top priorities;\n       The Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons of \n     the Department of State should include information on the \n     association between trafficking in persons and the cocoa \n     industry of Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, and other cocoa producing \n     regions in the annual trafficking in persons that is \n     submitted to Congress.\n\n  Mr. President, I will not read all of it, but those are some of the \nbasic elements of the sense-of-the-Congress resolution that I want to \npropose.\n  Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Is there an amendment pending \nat this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would ask the manager of the bill, would this be an \nappropriate time to send my amendment to the desk.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. That would be fine. I would like to take a look at it. \nI am not sure we have seen it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Certainly. I just got it finished a bit ago.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I think it would be appropriate to send it to the \ndesk.\n\n[[Page S8397]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate it.\n  Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk and ask for its \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1239.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress regarding abusive child \n        labor practices in the growing and processing of cocoa)\n\n       On page 326, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n\n\n            ABUSIVE CHILD LABOR PRACTICES IN COCOA INDUSTRY\n\n       Sec. 6113. (a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The plight of hundreds of thousands of child slaves \n     toiling in cocoa plantations in West Africa was reported in a \n     series by Knight Ridder newspapers in June 2001. (global)\n       (2) The report found that some of these children are sold \n     or tricked into slavery. Most of them are between the ages of \n     12 and 16 and some are as young as 9 years old.\n       (3) There are 1,500,000 farms in West Africa that produce \n     approximately 72 percent of the total global supply of cocoa, \n     with Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana producing about 62 percent and \n     22 percent, respectively, of the total cocoa production in \n     Africa. Other key producers are Indonesia, Nigeria, Cameroon, \n     and Brazil.\n       (4) United States consumers purchase over $13,000,000,000 \n     in chocolate products annually.\n       (5) On September 19, 2001, representatives of the chocolate \n     industry signed a voluntary Protocol for the Growing and \n     Processing of Cocoa Beans and their Derivative Products in a \n     Manner that Complies with ILO Convention 182 Concerning the \n     Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the \n     Worst Forms of Child Labor.\n       (6) The Protocol outlines 6 steps the industry formally \n     agreed to undertake to end abusive and forced child labor on \n     cocoa farms by July 2005.\n       (7) A vital step of the Protocol was the development and \n     implementation by the industry of a credible, transparent, \n     and publicly accountable industry-wide certification system \n     to ensure, by July 1, 2005, that cocoa beans and their \n     derivative products have not been grown or processed by \n     abusive child labor or slave labor.\n       (8) Since the Protocol was signed, some positive steps have \n     been taken to address the worst forms of child labor and \n     slave labor in cocoa growing, but the July 1, 2005, deadline \n     for creation and implementation of the certification system \n     was not fully met.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the cocoa industry is to be commended, as the Protocol \n     agreement is the first time that an industry has accepted \n     moral, social, and financial responsibility for the \n     production of raw materials, wherever they are produced;\n       (2) the Government of the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire and the \n     Government of the Republic of Ghana should be commended for \n     the tangible steps they have taken to address the situation \n     of child labor in the cocoa sector;\n       (3) even though the cocoa industry did not fully meet the \n     July 1, 2005, deadline for creation and implementation of the \n     labor certification system, it has agreed to redouble its \n     efforts to achieve a certification system that will cover 50 \n     percent of the cocoa growing regions of Cote d'Ivoire and \n     Ghana by July 1, 2008;\n       (4) the cocoa industry should make every effort to meet \n     this deadline in Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana and expand the \n     certification process to other West African nations and any \n     other country where abusive child labor and slave labor are \n     used in the growing and processing of cocoa;\n       (5) an independent oversight body should be designated and \n     supported to work with the chocolate industry, national \n     governments, and nongovernmental organizations on the \n     progress of the development and implementation of the \n     certification system by July 1, 2008, through a series of \n     public reports;\n       (6) the governments of West African nations that grow and \n     manufacture cocoa should consider child labor and forced \n     labor issues top priorities;\n       (7) the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons \n     of the Department of State should include information on the \n     association between trafficking in persons and the cocoa \n     industries of Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, and other cocoa producing \n     regions in the annual report on trafficking in persons that \n     is submitted to Congress; and\n       (8) the Department of State should assist the Government of \n     Cote d'Ivoire and the Government of Ghana in preventing the \n     trafficking of persons into the cocoa fields and other \n     industries in West Africa.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the chairman for taking a look at it. I hope it \nwill meet his approval.\n  Basically, as I said, the chocolate industry, I believe, is to be \ncommended for taking positive steps in agreeing to do 50 percent of the \nfarms by July 1 of 2008. We have to be vigilant. It is really a sense \nof the Congress commending them and then urging we stay on to meet \nthose goals and eventually the ultimate goal of making sure that we \ndon't have any forced labor and child trafficking on cocoa farms \nanywhere.\n  It always struck me as really kind of telling, almost bordering on \nthe obscene that so many of our kids in our country, in Europe, around \nthe world enjoy eating chocolate. Who doesn't enjoy eating chocolate? \nWe all love chocolate, hot chocolate, or chocolate of any form. And so \nI think many people who enjoy chocolate don't know that it is being \nproduced by forced child labor in many cases, kids who are beaten, kids \nwho are deprived of their childhood, kids who are basically child \nslaves. So I think this is something that we should pay attention to. \nAs I said, we have been working on this now, this is our fourth year, \nworking with the chocolate industry. We have this protocol. We have the \nframework. Progress is being made. We just need to make sure we don't \nslip behind, that we continue to support these efforts, to support the \nGovernments, as I said, both Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana, in their efforts, \nand the chocolate industry, also.\n  That is basically what this sense-of-the-Congress resolution is all \nabout.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as the distinguished Senator from Kentucky \nsaid earlier, we are on the Foreign Operations, State Department bill. \nWe have virtually completed our work. There is a pending amendment. We \nare going to be ready very soon to go to third reading.\n  We have had a number of Members say they might have an amendment, and \nI am delighted to hear that, but if they ``might,'' they might want to \ndo it while the bill is still on the floor because it is going to be \ngone.\n  Some of these amendments are very well thought out. Some Members have \ntheir press releases already written. But if Members want the press \nrelease released--as well as the well-thought-out amendment--one might \nwant to do it while the bill is on the floor.\n  I have no desire to hold up this piece of legislation. Senator \nMcConnell has no desire to hold up this legislation. We spent several \nhours of quorum calls Friday and today. If Members are serious about an \namendment, bring it to the floor. Otherwise, from this Senator's point \nof view, as soon as there is not an amendment pending, I will have no \nobjection to moving to third reading.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Prescription Drug Prices\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will just take a few minutes. Later this \nafternoon, at 5:45, we have ordered a vote on the nomination of Dr. \nLester Crawford to be Commissioner of the FDA. I had intended to come \nand speak prior to that vote. My understanding is that there is only a \n30-minute time period for debate, equally divided, just prior to the \nvote on that nomination, so I will take a couple of minutes now to \nexplain why I am going to vote against this nomination.\n  I have spent most of my time in the Senate voting for nominees sent \nto us by Presidents, Republicans and Democrats alike, because I believe \nthose who win the Presidency largely have the right to select their own \nteam and to have their own advisers. So I have, in most cases, voted \nfor the nominees who have come before the Senate to serve in the \nPresident's Cabinet and other important positions in the \nadministration.\n  This position is the head of the Food and Drug Administration, a very \nimportant agency--one, incidentally, that\n\n[[Page S8398]]\n\nhas had a substantial amount of controversy in recent years. I have \nbeen particularly interested in the FDA because we--myself along with \nothers in the Senate--have spent a lot of time working to try to see if \nwe can put some downward pressure on prescription drug prices.\n  Much to our chagrin--to those of us on both the Democratic side and \nthe Republican side who have been working toward this end--the \nopposition, in many cases, has come from the Food and Drug \nAdministration. The FDA has alleged safety issues where, in fact, there \nare no safety issues at all. It has been the Food and Drug \nAdministration that has been shaking the pom-poms for and cheerleading \nwith the pharmaceutical industry on these issues.\n\n  Let me describe the issue just for a moment.\n  The American consumer pays the highest prices in the world for brand-\nname prescription drugs. Consumers who purchase those prescription \ndrugs are charged much higher prices in the United States than \nelsewhere around the world. The pharmaceutical industry says it charges \nthese prices because it can. I held a hearing on this issue when I \nchaired a subcommittee some years ago. The result is, the drug industry \nsaid: Well, we can charge that amount here in the United States, but we \ncan't charge it in other countries because other countries have price \ncontrols on prescription drugs.\n  Yet I notice--because of a sweetheart little tax provision that was \nput in law about a year ago--that the drug industry has made \nsubstantial profits overseas. The sweetheart deal allows those \ncompanies that have started enterprises overseas and are earning \nprofits overseas to now pay taxes at a 5.25-percent rate for the income \nthey repatriate to this country, quite a deal for big companies that \nmove their jobs overseas. According to newspaper reports, the \npharmaceutical industry now has as much as $75 billion in profits they \nhave made in other countries that they are set to repatriate to this \ncountry for a 5.25-percent income tax rate.\n  Interesting. They tell us they have to charge higher prices to the \nAmerican consumers for prescription drugs, and they charge lower prices \nelsewhere because they are required by pricing policies in those \ncountries to do so. They say they do not make much money in those \ncountries, yet now they have $75 billion in profits from overseas sales \nin countries in which they have charged dramatically lower prices. So, \nobviously, they are making substantial profits in their sales in other \ncountries even though the consumers in those other countries enjoy \nlower prescription drug prices.\n  Mr. President, let me, by unanimous consent, show two pill bottles, \nif I might.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is a medicine called Celebrex, made \nby Pfizer. These bottles are large containers that happen to be empty. \nIt would contain 500 capsules; 200 milligrams, the usual adult dosage, \nit says. As you can see, this other bottle is also Celebrex. It is the \nsame pill, made by the same company, put in the same bottle. The only \ndifference in these bottles is the color on the labels is a bit \ndifferent, but the pills that were inside were the same. This one \nbottle is sold in the United States and the other is sold in Canada.\n  What is the difference? Well, the U.S. consumer pays $2.93 per \ncapsule out of this bottle. The Canadian consumer pays $1.32 out of the \nother bottle. So the one costs almost $3, the other just over $1. The \nAmerican consumer is charged double the price of the Canadian consumer. \nIt is the same pill, put in the same bottle, made by the same company, \nat an FDA-approved plant, sent to two different places, and the \nAmerican consumers pay two and a half times more than the Canadian \nconsumer.\n  Why is that the case? Well, the drug industry says they charge that \nprice in the United States because they can and because they must in \norder to gather the funds for research and development. But, of course, \nthe record shows that is not the case either. The drug industry \nactually spends more money on marketing and advertising than they do on \nresearch and development. And they actually spend about the same amount \non research and development in Europe that they do in the United States \nwhen, in fact, in Europe they charge lower prices for exactly the same \nprescription drugs.\n  So what does all of this have to do with Dr. Crawford and the FDA? \nWell, for those of us who are working to allow for the importation \nof FDA-approved drugs from other countries--notably from Canada and \nEurope--one of the most significant areas of opposition has been from \nthe FDA.\n\n  Dr. Mark McClellan was the head of the FDA for a while. He was an \naggressive advocate on behalf of the pharmaceutical industry. The \npharmaceutical industry could not have had a better cheerleader than \nDr. McClellan. And during that time, Dr. Crawford has also been at the \nFDA serving as deputy. He has been there as acting commissioner for \nmuch of this administration, both before and now after Dr. McClellan. \nAnd during that time, the FDA has continued to be a roadblock to try to \nget lower prices on prescription drugs for American consumers.\n  The problem is that there is a law on the books that says the only \nentity that can import a prescription drug from another country is the \nmanufacturer of that prescription drug. So a licensed pharmacist in \nMinot, ND, cannot go to Regina, Canada, for example, and buy an FDA-\napproved prescription drug, even one made in the United States and \nshipped to Canada. A licensed U.S. pharmacist cannot go to a licensed \npharmacist in Canada, buy the FDA-approved drug at half or a third of \nthe price and bring it back and pass the savings along to the customer.\n  Why is that the case? Well, because once again there is a sweetheart \ndeal. Under this deal, trade should apparently only work for everybody \nbut the little guy, the consumer. One would think, with free trade and \nthe opportunity to cross boundaries, that if you are talking about FDA-\napproved medicines, that American consumers, particularly American \npharmacists, would be able to also take advantage of the global \nmarketplace, but they cannot.\n  So I, along with a bipartisan group of colleagues, have been trying \nto change the law. We are not proposing price controls but instead \ncompetition. Very simple: Allow an American pharmacist, a main street \ndrugstore owner to access the identical prescription drug in Canada or \nEurope at a fraction of the price and bring it back and pass the \nsavings along to the consumer. We are told that American consumers \ncould save as much as $38 billion--that is with a ``B''--a year if that \nwere to happen.\n  As a point of fact, if we were able to get our legislation passed, we \nwould not have people shopping in Canada for prescription drugs. But \nthe very fact that they could would force the repricing of prescription \ndrugs based on market forces here in the United States. Unfortunately, \nwe have been thwarted in our efforts. Senator Olympia Snowe, John \nMcCain, myself, Senator Kennedy, Senator Grassley, Senator Stabenow, \nand many others have all worked on this for a long, long time. The \nfirst bill I introduced on this was in 1999, and still drug importation \nhas not been allowed because it has been blocked.\n  Opponents have said there would be safety issues. Well, let me give \nyou an example of the safety issue. In Europe, what we propose is done \nevery single day: cross-border trading in prescription drugs. A \npharmacist in Germany wants to buy a prescription drug from Spain, that \nis not a problem. If you are a pharmacy in England and want to buy a \nprescription drug from France, that is no problem either because they \nhave something called parallel trading. In fact, we had the person who \nheaded the parallel trading association come and testify before a U.S. \nCongressional committee. That person said there are no safety issues. \nBut it opens the market, so consumers see lower drug prices as a result \nof it. But in this country, we are told we apparently cannot do it. It \ndoes not take rocket science to understand there is no safety issue.\n  Let me talk about Canada just for a moment. Canada has nearly an \nidentical chain of custody for the prescription drug that comes from \nthe manufacturer that goes to the consumer. The Canadian system is \nnearly identical to ours. So if an American licensed pharmacist were to \nbuy a lower\n\n[[Page S8399]]\n\npriced FDA-approved drug from a licensed Canadian pharmacist, how on \nEarth could there be any kind of safety issue? There simply is not.\n  This is not about safety. It is about profits for the pharmaceutical \nindustry. Now, I understand that issue. If the pharmaceutical industry \nwere represented by people here--rather than serving in the Senate, \nthey served the pharmaceutical industry--I would understand why you \nwould make the case you want maximum profits. But that is not the way \nour economic system works. It works best for consumers when you have \ncompetition and open borders and an opportunity to trade. That is what \nwe have been trying to do.\n  It is disappointing that over 6 years now we have found a lot of \nopposition to something that is so filled with common sense. The \nopposition comes from the pharmaceutical industry, from allies of the \npharmaceutical industry here in this Chamber in the Senate, and from \nthe FDA. Now, the FDA is supposed to regulate, not represent. The FDA \nis to regulate the pharmaceutical industry, not represent the \npharmaceutical industry.\n  These are, in many cases, lifesaving drugs. I don't diminish the \nimportance of prescription drugs. They provide miracles in many cases. \nBut miracle drugs offer no miracles to those who cannot pay for them. \nWe have all heard from people who go to the grocery store and go to the \npharmacy in the back of the store first to buy the pharmaceuticals in \norder to understand how much money they have left for groceries. We \nalso know that senior citizens are especially hard hit. They make up 12 \npercent of America's population, yet they consume one-third of the \nprescription drugs. It is not unusual to talk to a senior citizen who \nis taking 5, 7, 12 different prescription drugs every single day. Many \nof them simply can't afford it. America's most vulnerable population \nrepresents those who are hardest hit by prescription drugs prices.\n  I was at a farm in North Dakota last summer, as I was touring around. \nOne fellow, who was about 85 years old, and his wife, who was in her \nmid 80s, sat on a hay bale and told me their story. He said: My wife \nhas been fighting breast cancer for 4 years. For 4 years we have driven \nto the Canadian border to buy Tamoxifen because you can buy Tamoxifen \nat 80-percent less cost in Canada than in the United States. He talked \nabout the number of trips they made. The only reason they could afford \nTamoxifen was because they could drive to the border and get it. A \nsmall supply of drugs for personal use, a 3-month supply, has been \nallowed to come across the border for individuals. But very few \nAmericans can reach that Canadian border and, on a routine basis, find \na way to buy their FDA-approved drugs from Canada.\n  I took a group of American retired folks to Canada in a bus. We went \nto a little, one-room drugstore in Emerson, Canada. I saw person to \nperson the prescription drugs they had to buy and the savings with each \nof them. You should have seen the look of surprise on their faces when \nthey found out what the price was in Canada versus what they had been \npaying here in the U.S. This is unfair pricing. We need to do something \nabout it. But the cavalier attitude at the FDA, the attitude of \nrepresenting the drug companies rather than regulating the drug \ncompanies, means that we will continue to have to battle the FDA. \nHaving to battle the FDA to do something that is so filled with common \nsense is a frustrating thing for those of us who have been working on \nthis for years and years.\n  Incidentally, there are some other issues with this Commissioner, and \nI will not spend my time talking about those.\n  My colleagues, including Senator Kennedy, with whom I spoke the other \nday, will make the point eloquently that we need an FDA Commissioner. \nIt is unbelievable that we have gone all this time without having an \nFDA Commissioner. We have had someone who is acting for the bulk of \nthis administration. I don't disagree with that notion. It doesn't make \nany sense that we have not had a full-time, permanent FDA Commissioner \nfilling that term. But that doesn't mean that Dr. Crawford is the right \nperson. He is not in my judgment. I wish I could vote for him, but I \ndon't intend to.\n  My hope is that in the coming months, we will persuade the majority \nleader and others, to get a vote on drug importation legislation. If \nnecessary, we will offer amendments at the right time and on the right \nbills that forces the hand of those who oppose the work we are trying \nto do.\n  My hope is at the end of the day, we will get a vote. If we get a \nvote allowing the reimportation of prescription drugs, there is no \nquestion it is going to pass the Senate. It will get 60-65 or more \nvotes in the Senate. The question is getting the vote. We thought we \nhad a commitment in the last Congress for a vote. The Senate majority \nleader and I had a disagreement about what the commitment said, and so \nwe didn't get the vote. What has happened is, the majority has \nsuccessfully blocked it, and the White House that stands with the \npharmaceutical industry has successfully blocked it. There is now a \nvery strong bipartisan group of Senators. I mentioned Senator Snowe, \nSenators Vitter, McCain, Stabenow, Kennedy, and many others. We have \nover 30 Senators who have now joined as cosponsors of this legislation. \nOne way or another we are going to prevail. When it is passed, we will \nsee reasonable and competitive prices for prescription drugs.\n  I regret to say that I will vote against Dr. Crawford's nomination \nwhen the vote occurs. I wish I could come to the floor and say I will \nvote for the nominee. But I don't want to put further roadblocks in the \nway of those of us who are trying to get fair prescription drug pricing \nfor American citizens. I believe it is critically important that we \nunderstand prescription drugs are something different, something \nunusual. Most countries have already understood that. If you need a \nprescription drug, a lifesaving drug that can either save your life or \nkeep you out of an acute care hospital bed, you don't have a choice. \nYou have to try and buy it, at prices that are double, triple and, in \nsome cases, 10 times the cost for the identical drug in other \ncountries. That is unfair to the American consumer.\n  Some day we will force enough people on the floor of this Senate to \nstand up and vote. When we do, we will have sufficient votes to move \nthis through the Senate. I will say this: I doubt whether it will be \nwith anything other than the obstruction of Dr. Crawford. He and Dr. \nMcClellan before him have run the play called by the pharmaceutical \nindustry. I really regret that is the way it is going.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am going to be filing an amendment and \nalso noticing an intention to suspend the rules for such an amendment. \nI want to preserve the right to address it on this piece of \nlegislation. This is an amendment that would prohibit the sale of \nUnocal, an American oil company, to CNOOC, a Chinese Government-\ncontrolled and owned oil company.\n  I mentioned Friday that I think that this is a fairly simple \nproposition. The Chinese Government would never, ever allow an American \ncompany, let alone an American oil company, to buy a Chinese oil \ncompany. The Chinese oil companies are controlled by the Chinese \nGovernment. What we have here is a proposal by CNOOC, which is a \nChinese oil company controlled by the Government, wishing to purchase \nan American oil company. You don't have reciprocal capabilities.\n  They say: Let the free market deal with this. Let's let the \nmarketplace decide.\n  There is no free market or marketplace in a circumstance where the \nChinese Government controls a company and the controlled company, \nthrough deeply subsidized Government loans, wishes to buy an American \ncompany, especially in something as strategic as oil.\n  I don't bear any ill will toward the Chinese. They are a big and \ngrowing country with a significant impact around the world. They will \nbe a significant part of our future. But we do\n\n[[Page S8400]]\n\nhave an extraordinary trade deficit with China which is dangerous for \nus. It is headed to over $200 billion this year. That is completely \nunsustainable. It is dangerous for us. Our relationship with the \nChinese should and must be mutually beneficial, especially in the area \nof trade. Regrettably, it is not.\n  We are a cash cow for the hard currency needs of China. They continue \nto ratchet up these deficits in a significant way. In many cases, the \nChinese markets are closed to our country. We also find on the streets \nof China a substantial amount of counterfeit and pirated goods that \ncome from intellectual property in this country. The Chinese say they \nhave trouble controlling all that. They don't have trouble controlling \nit. In fact, the logo now that belongs to the Chinese Government for \nthe Olympic games, the minute that showed up on the streets in China \nunder counterfeiting, the Chinese Government took immediate action, and \nyou can't find it any more because the Chinese Government had an \ninterest in stopping counterfeit and piracy when it came to the logo \nfor the Chinese Olympic games.\n  We have a lot of issues with the Chinese--counterfeiting, piracy, \ntrade deficit, many more. This issue is simple; should we allow a \nChinese-controlled and largely Chinese-owned oil company to purchase an \nAmerican oil company, especially in circumstances where they would not \nallow that same transaction to take place?\n  My answer to that is no. I don't think it makes sense for this \ncountry's strategic or economic future, and it does not make sense from \nthe standpoint of national security. I don't believe it makes sense \nfrom the standpoint of reciprocal trade opportunities, and I don't \nbelieve those who say this is some sort of marketplace transaction. \nThere is not a marketplace when you have government control of both the \nindustry and the companies in the industry trying to buy American \nbusinesses.\n  I am filing the amendment and noticing along with it an intent to \nsuspend the rules which would be required for me to do when I offer \nsuch an amendment. I mentioned that I also likely would offer a funding \nlimitation amendment in the Appropriations Committee, and the House of \nRepresentatives has done the same. The funding limitation would apply \nto the Treasury Department, where approval for such a transaction would \nbe required to take place.\n  This is not a reflection of whether I think the Chinese country is \ntrying to do harm to our economy or anything of the sort. China is a \nlarge and growing country with 1.3 billion people, an economy that is \ngrowing by leaps and bounds. I have been to China a couple of times, \nand it is quite a remarkable place. But with respect to our \nrelationship with China, that relationship must be mutually beneficial, \nespecially in the area of international trade. It is not now mutually \nbeneficial. There is one-way trade going on, and we are up to our neck \nin trade debt to the Chinese.\n  This transaction does not advance our interest. It might advance the \nChinese interest by giving them more access to oil, but it does not \nadvance America's interest. I hope that it is viewed through the prism \nof what advances our country's interests. What is it that represents \nthe best policy choice for our country?\n  My sense of that is that we ought to prohibit this sale. The \namendment is very simple. It doesn't beat around the bush. It is very \nshort. It is an amendment that would prohibit the sale of an American \noil company to a Government-controlled and deeply subsidized oil \ncompany in the country of China.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to read into the \nRecord a statement about the passing of one of our most dedicated \npublic officials.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Landrieu are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1245\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I call up an amendment to the underlying \nbill, Foreign Operations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1245.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress regarding the use of funds \n           for orphans, and displaced and abandoned children)\n\n       On page 326, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n\n\n             ORPHANS, AND DISPLACED AND ABANDONED CHILDREN\n\n       Sec. 6113. (a) Congress--\n       (1) reaffirms its commitment to the founding principle of \n     the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-\n     Operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption, that a child, \n     for the full and harmonious development of the child's \n     personality, should grow up in a family environment, in an \n     atmosphere of happiness, love, and understanding;\n       (2) recognizes that each State should take, as a matter of \n     priority, every appropriate measure to enable a child to \n     remain in the care of the child's family of origin, but when \n     not possible should strive to place the child in a permanent \n     and loving home through adoption;\n       (3) affirms that intercountry adoption may offer the \n     advantage of a permanent family to a child for whom a family \n     cannot be found in the child's State of origin;\n       (4) affirms that long-term foster care or \n     institutionalization are not permanent options and should \n     therefore only be used when no other permanent options are \n     available; and\n       (5) recognizes that programs that protect and support \n     families can reduce the abandonment and exploitation of \n     children.\n       (b) The funds appropriated under title III of this Act \n     shall be made available in a manner consistent with the \n     principles described in subsection (a).\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I send this amendment to the desk and I \nask my colleagues to consider this amendment. We can vote on the \namendment at any time before, of course, the final passage of this \nbill. I send this amendment to the desk, and I will spend a few minutes \nthis afternoon talking about the underlying bill as it relates to the \nU.S. work and position on orphans.\n  We have done a lot of great work promoting the idea that children \nshould be raised in families. We have in the United States made a lot \nof progress over the last 10 years. The former administration, the \nClinton administration, and the current Bush administration have made \nchild welfare a priority, have made families a priority.\n  We believe very strongly in the Congress, both on the Republican side \nand the Democratic side, that children are best raised in families. We \nwould like our budget to reflect that commonsense principle. I have \nbeen in a couple of hearings and a couple of meetings over the course \nof the last year or two that have given me, some question whether that \nis clear in this Foreign Operations bill. So my amendment attempts to \nmake clear in the underlying bill what I think is the clear and \noverwhelming contention of the Senate--and I would imagine the House of \nRepresentatives--that we spend money promoting social policy around the \nworld, and that we adhere to a very commonsense principle--it is not an \nAmerican principle; it is a universal principle. But I can most \ncertainly say in America people feel very strongly about the fact that \nchildren should not raise themselves and should not be raised in \norphanages, unless absolutely necessary. They should not be raised in \ngroup homes and should not be left alone to raise themselves on the \nstreet. We should do everything we can to keep children in families.\n  Let me spend a few minutes being a little more specific. A couple of \nyears ago, under the great leadership of Senator Jesse Helms, we passed \nan international treaty that put into place this principle, which \nbasically says that in our foreign policy it is the principle of the \nUnited States to say clearly that\n\n[[Page S8401]]\n\nchildren should remain in the families to which they are born--that our \npolicies should promote family stabilization, family reunification, \nreunifying children who might be separated because of war or disease. \nWe should try our very best to keep children in the families to which \nthey are born.\n  Separation is occurring at an alarming rate in this world today for a \nnumber of reasons. AIDS is like a factory for orphans. There is an \nunprecedented number of children becoming orphaned because of this \nparticular disease. The way this disease affects families, it takes \nboth the father and the mother, leaving children truly orphaned. \n``Double orphaned'' is the way the international community talks about \na child who has lost both a mother and a father. So we have a growing \nnumber of orphans in the world because of the AIDS epidemic.\n  But even if it weren't for the AIDS epidemic moving through, for \ninstance, Africa and India at an alarming rate, we would still have a \ngrowing number of orphans in the world. The question is: What do we do \nas a human family to see that each of these children has a home, a \nplace? That is simply what my amendment does. It recognizes it is the \nsense of the Congress and it recognizes the principle that children \nshould grow up in the homes to which they were born. But if they are \nseparated by disease, or war, or death, or for good reason--because \nsome children are at risk in the home, perhaps from mental or physical \nabuse; sometimes children, unfortunately, have to be taken from \nparents, according to laws and customs of some countries. When that \nhappens, those children should be raised by a relative, a caring, \nresponsible relative, someone right there in the extended family.\n  If a relative is not available or willing or able to take on the care \nof this orphan or sibling group, then those children should be raised \nright there in the community or within the country of origin. And if \nnot, then we should find a way for these children to be adopted \nsomewhere in the world. My amendment is not making this the law; this \nis the law now in the United States. These are the principles that are \nfollowed by our treaty, as passed by this Congress.\n  My amendment simply restates, for the purpose of this bill, that the \n$1.6 billion the U.S. taxpayers are sending out all over the world to \nsupport children's health and survival through USAID, which is our \nprimary agency that distributes these funds, shall be distributed \nmindful of this principle on which this Congress has already acted.\n  I believe we will have a unanimous vote on this amendment. I do not \nthink it is something that will generate opposition, but if there are \nMembers who oppose it, I will be happy to talk with them about \nadjusting any language they find objectionable.\n  One of the things we need to promote in this world, not only at home \nbut abroad, is the strength and support of families because if families \nare strong, if children can be nurtured and cared for within the loving \ncontext of a family, then I believe communities are strong, and when \ncommunities are strong, then nations are strong. It does start with the \nfamily unit.\n  Any idea that we could promote successful social policy around that \nprinciple or over it or underneath it instead of embracing it fully I \nthink is a real mistake.\n  That is all my amendment does. The language tracks from The Hague \nTreaty which has already been passed. It will leave no shadow of a \ndoubt that the Members of this body think that as USAID gives this \nmoney to NGOs or to regular recipients, that this principle be included \nin the distribution of this $1.6 billion.\n  I would be happy to answer any questions about the amendment. The \namendment is rather short, a page and a half. It is rather clear. \nAgain, I think it will go a long way in restating in this funding bill \nthat we are, in fact, committed to the idea that children should be \nraised in families and that there is really so such thing as unwanted \nchildren, just unfound families. If we would spend a little extra time \nand be a little bit more committed on this issue, we could, despite the \ngrowing numbers, I believe, find a home for every child who needs one. \nI know that is a tall order, and I know people will say: Senator, that \ncan never be done. I know the number of orphans is on the rise. But I \nalso know from my personal experience and the thousands of parents who \nhave adopted children that there is plenty of room in the homes and \nhearts of people all over the world. If governments would just make a \nlittle better effort to identify some of these families and to promote \nthese concepts and continue to restate them in all of our work, that is \nnot as farfetched as it may seem.\n  We want to respect the family, recognize the extended family, \nrecognize the right of relatives to raise children, but when relatives \nand extended family members cannot be found, we believe that children \nshould be placed in another family, to be raised as their own, and \nsibling groups kept together, which is the new practice in child \nwelfare, not only in the United States but around the world, and that \ngovernments have an obligation to reduce barriers to adoption, to cut \ndown the costs, to eliminate the corruption, to encourage transparency, \nto cut down on the paperwork, and to do their best to make what is so \nnatural and what happened before governments existed, I am certain of \nit. When a parent or parents died, the most responsible adult next to \nthe child took that child under their wing and raised them as their \nown. It is the way it has been done since the beginning of time. I \ndon't know why governments in this world find this very complicated. It \nreally is not. It is quite simple.\n  I want to make sure our primary aid giver USAID, understands clearly \nthat the Members of this Senate are not trying to dictate, are not \ntrying to earmark, are not trying to tell them the specifics of how to \ndo their work. This amendment says that in giving money for social \nwelfare and child survival and health, the principle that children \nshould be raised in a family should be ever present in their \ndecisionmaking. I believe this amendment would make this issue very \nclear, and there needs to be clarity on this subject.\n  If there are no other questions, I submit the amendment for \nconsideration by the body and will expect a vote sometime at the \nmanagers' discretion. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, is the Landrieu amendment now pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct, the Landrieu amendment is \npending.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nLandrieu amendment be temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

(a) The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The plight of hundreds of thousands of child slaves \n     toiling in cocoa plantations in West Africa was reported in a \n     series by Knight Ridder newspapers in June 2001. (global)\n       (2) The report found that some of these children are sold \n     or tricked into slavery. Most of them are between the ages of \n     12 and 16 and some are as young as 9 years old.\n       (3) There are 1,500,000 farms in West Africa that produce \n     approximately 72 percent of the total global supply of cocoa, \n     with Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana producing about 62 percent and \n     22 percent, respectively, of the total cocoa production in \n     Africa. Other key producers are Indonesia, Nigeria, Cameroon, \n     and Brazil.\n       (4) United States consumers purchase over $13,000,000,000 \n     in chocolate products annually.\n       (5) On September 19, 2001, representatives of the chocolate \n     industry signed a voluntary Protocol for the Growing and \n     Processing of Cocoa Beans and their Derivative Products in a \n     Manner that Complies with ILO Convention 182 Concerning the \n     Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the \n     Worst Forms of Child Labor.\n       (6) The Protocol outlines 6 steps the industry formally \n     agreed to undertake to end abusive and forced child labor on \n     cocoa farms by July 2005.\n       (7) A vital step of the Protocol was the development and \n     implementation by the industry of a credible, transparent, \n     and publicly accountable industry-wide certification system \n     to ensure, by July 1, 2005, that cocoa beans and their \n     derivative products have not been grown or processed by \n     abusive child labor or slave labor.\n       (8) Since the Protocol was signed, some positive steps have \n     been taken to address the worst forms of child labor and \n     slave labor in cocoa growing, but the July 1, 2005, deadline \n     for creation and implementation of the certification system \n     was not fully met.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the cocoa industry is to be commended, as the Protocol \n     agreement is the first time that an industry has accepted \n     moral, social, and financial responsibility for the \n     production of raw materials, wherever they are produced;\n       (2) the Government of the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire and the \n     Government of the Republic of Ghana should be commended for \n     the tangible steps they have taken to address the situation \n     of child labor in the cocoa sector;\n       (3) even though the cocoa industry did not fully meet the \n     July 1, 2005, deadline for creation and implementation of the \n     labor certification system, it has agreed to redouble its \n     efforts to achieve a certification system that will cover 50 \n     percent of the cocoa growing regions of Cote d'Ivoire and \n     Ghana by July 1, 2008;\n       (4) the cocoa industry should make every effort to meet \n     this deadline in Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana and expand the \n     certification process to other West African nations and any \n     other country where abusive child labor and slave labor are \n     used in the growing and processing of cocoa;\n       (5) an independent oversight body should be designated and \n     supported to work with the chocolate industry, national \n     governments, and nongovernmental organizations on the \n     progress of the development and implementation of the \n     certification system by July 1, 2008, through a series of \n     public reports;\n       (6) the governments of West African nations that grow and \n     manufacture cocoa should consider child labor and forced \n     labor issues top priorities;\n       (7) the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons \n     of the Department of State should include information on the \n     association between trafficking in persons and the cocoa \n     industries of Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, and other cocoa producing \n     regions in the annual report on trafficking in persons that \n     is submitted to Congress; and\n       (8) the Department of State should assist the Government of \n     Cote d'Ivoire and the Government of Ghana in preventing the \n     trafficking of persons into the cocoa fields and other \n     industries in West Africa.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. For the information of our colleagues, these are three \namendments, one is a modification to the Harkin amendment previously \nfiled, one is a Leahy technical amendment regarding Nepal, and one\nis a Lieberman-Brownback-Kennedy amendment regarding refugees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am advised these amendments are cleared \nby all the parties with interest on this side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto.\n  The amendments (Nos. 1248, 1249, and 1239, as modified) were agreed \nto.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I know Senator Leahy shares my view \nthat we are going to finish this bill tomorrow. Last year, we were \nfortunate to finish it in half a day. Obviously, that will not be the \ncase this year because we started it on Friday and clearly will not be \nable to finish it tonight. We do intend to finish it tomorrow. The \nSenate will be interrupted in the morning by a speech to a joint \nmeeting by the Prime Minister of India, which many Members will want to \nattend. But we intend to press on as rapidly as possible. If any \nMembers on this side of the aisle have any amendments they have not \ndiscussed yet with either myself or staff, we would appreciate them \ncoming over now and discussing it with us because we intend to move \nrapidly tomorrow and hopefully clear this bill out of the Senate by \nsometime in the afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I totally concur with the senior Senator \nfrom Kentucky. Friday, both he and I were here in a rather lonely \nChamber, I might say. We would have been happy to have gone to third \nreading on Friday. We were advised Members on both sides of the aisle \nhad matters to come before this committee. Of course, extending the \nnormal courtesy managers do on such bills, we did not go to third \nreading so we could accommodate those Members. We are fast approaching \nthat time. Frankly, if we reach a time tomorrow where we are ready to \nwrap up this bill, I will join with the Senator from Kentucky in doing \nthat.\n  I note to all Members that the bill is different than it has been in \npast years. We have both the operations of the State Department as well \nas what we normally consider the foreign aid bill. There are a number \nof items in the bill strongly supported by both Democrats and \nRepublicans and a number of items sought by the President as part of \nhis efforts in foreign policy.\n  We have crafted what, by anybody's measure, has to be considered a \nbipartisan piece of legislation, one that should get overwhelming \nsupport by this body. We have taken into consideration those items the \nWhite House needs in the normal conduct of foreign affairs, as well as \nthose items the State Department needs in their normal operations. But \nwe still have to pass the bill. The bill, if it was brought to a vote \nright now, would pass overwhelmingly. But it still has to pass.\n  I have never served as either leader of the Senate, but I sympathize \nwith them. The leaders of this Senate--majority leaders Senator \nMansfield, Senator Byrd, Senator Baker, Senator Dole, Senator Mitchell, \nSenator Lott, Senator Frist, as well as their counterparts--Senator \nScott, Senator Griffin, and some of the same Senators I mentioned \nserved as both minority and majority leaders, and Senator Reid. It is \nnot an easy job to schedule the Senate. The distinguished Senator from \nKentucky is the deputy Republican leader. He knows that. We are trying \nto accommodate him. We have done everything Senator Frist or Senator \nReid have asked us to do in moving this bill forward. With a little \ncooperation from everybody else, we can wrap up this bill and get on to \nother matters because we still have to go to conference, which I would \nlike to get to very quickly so we can get a final package before the \nSenate.\n  I say that hoping someone will hear and know what the heck we are \ntalking about, other than Supreme Court Justices. We really do want to \nget this bill wrapped up. Please do because once we reach a point with \nthe amendments, we\n\n[[Page S8403]]\n\nare going to vote them up or down and finish the bill. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me add, we will finish the bill \ntomorrow for certain. It will be, obviously, easier on the membership \nif we do it earlier in the day.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1239\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, for many years, I have been active in \nefforts to stop exploitative child labor as well as trafficking in \nchild and female slaves around the world. In my travels to many \ncountries, I have seen this scourge firsthand. I have come to the floor \nof the Senate many times to speak about this issue. I have spoken about \nhow shocked I was to see the deplorable conditions under which these \nkids are forced to work. Many are physically, emotionally, and sexually \nabused. All of them, every child engaged in abusive child labor is \ndeprived of a childhood solely for someone else's gain.\n  Why should we as a nation tolerate children being used in such a \nmanner? We should not. It is a moral outrage and an affront to human \ndignity. When a child is exploited for the economic gains for others, \nnot only does the child lose, but the family loses and I think the \nwhole world loses. It is bad economics, and it is bad development \nstrategy. A nation cannot achieve prosperity on the backs of children, \nand there should simply be no place in the global economy for child \nlabor.\n  So when news reports about forced child labor on west African cocoa \nfarms first emerged in 2001, I was not entirely surprised. According to \none report in a series of articles by Knight Ridder, the child laborers \nof Ivory Coast ``are whipped, beaten, and broken like horses to harvest \nthe almond-sized beans that are made into chocolate treats for more \nfortunate children in Europe and the United States.''\n  After looking into this, I resolved to do everything I could to end \nthis tragic exploitation of children working on cocoa farms. However, I \nsought a legislative remedy not as a first resort but as a last resort. \nTogether with Congressman Eliot Engel of New York, we engaged the major \nchocolate companies in lengthy, intense negotiations. The result is \nwhat is now called the Harkin-Engel protocol for the growing and \nprocessing of cocoa beans in a manner that complies with the \nInternational Labor Organization Convention 182 concerning the \nprohibition and immediate action for the elimination of the worst forms \nof child labor. This protocol would apply to everywhere cocoa is grown \nand processed.\n  The agreement laid out a series of date-specific actions, including \nthe development of credible, mutually acceptable, voluntary \nindustrywide standards of public certification by July 1 of 2005, this \nmonth, in order to give a public accounting of labor practices in cocoa \nfarming.\n  The Harkin-Engel protocol marked an important first--an entire \nindustry, including companies from the United States, Europe, and the \nUnited Kingdom, taking responsibility for addressing the worst forms of \nchild labor and forced labor in its supply chain.\n\n[[Page S8396]]\n\n  Today the protocol stands as a framework for progress in west Africa, \nbringing together industry, west African governments, organized labor, \nnongovernmental organizations, farmers groups, and experts in a \nconcerted effort to eliminate the worst forms of child labor and forced \nlabor from the growing and processing of cocoa.\n  Since the Harkin-Engel protocol was signed, a number of positive \nsteps have been taken to address the worst forms of child labor in \ncocoa growing. These include the creation of the International Cocoa \nInitiative Foundation, which is now beginning to form partnerships with \nnongovernmental organizations to provide social protection programs in \nwest Africa. Also, in Ghana, the International Labor Organization \ncarried out a small pilot project, and in the Ivory Coast, the \ngovernment is committed to conducting a similar pilot project to \nexamine the labor situation and social protection needs on cocoa farms. \nThese pilot programs will then be assessed and used to develop a child \nlabor monitoring system.\n\n  Although I was disappointed that the July 1 deadline was not fully \nmet by the industry, they have given us a commitment to achieving a \ncertification system which can be expanded across the cocoa-growing \nareas of west Africa and which will cover 50 percent of the cocoa-\ngrowing areas of Ivory Coast and Ghana in 3 years' time. I am very \npleased with this commitment.\n  Going forward, the industry has pledged to dedicate more than $5 \nmillion annually to support the full implementation of a certification \nsystem for cocoa growing farming practices and for programs to improve \nthe well-being of the more than 1.5 million farm families growing cocoa \nin west Africa, including efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child \nlabor and forced labor.\n  Specifically, the rollout of the certification system, including \nmonitoring, data analysis reporting, and activities to reduce the worst \nforms of child labor, will proceed as aggressively as possible in Ivory \nCoast and Ghana with the goal of covering 50 percent of the two \ncountries' cocoa-producing areas by July of 2008. This is, indeed, a \nmilestone on the way toward the ultimate goal of 100 percent coverage \nin cocoa-producing countries around the world.\n  In addition, the industry pledges to improve conditions in west \nAfrica cocoa farming communities and to address the worst forms of \nchild labor and forced labor at the community level through the \nInternational Cocoa Initiative Foundation, the World Cocoa Foundation, \nand the Initiative for Africa Cocoa Communities. Congressman Engel and \nI have accepted the industry's pledge and commitment, and we \ncongratulate them for this.\n  The protocol framework continues. However, as President Reagan used \nto say regarding arms agreements with the Soviet Union, we decided to \ntrust but verify. To ensure accountability and transparency, \nCongressman Engel and I will establish an independent oversight entity \nto monitor future implementations of the accord. This entity will \ninclude experts on child and forced labor, as well as on corporate \nsocial responsibility, and will monitor the industry's work and produce \nperiodic publicly available reports on its progress.\n  Again, I applaud the cocoa industry, the chocolate industry for their \nagreement to accept such an independent oversight entity.\n  In addition, to accelerate progress, I support the recommendation of \nthe verification working group, a group charged under the protocol with \nan independent assessment of the certification system to create a \nskilled, multi-stakeholder working group on certification.\n  Yes, I am disappointed that the July 1 deadline was not fully met, \nbut I am reassured that the industry is committed to the goal we all \nshare, which is to eliminate the scourge of the worst forms of child \nlabor and forced labor in cocoa-producing countries.\n  Obviously, I will be closely monitoring progress under the protocol \nin the months and years ahead, and I will make periodic reports on the \nSenate floor and in the media. As Justice Brandeis once said, sunlight \nis the best disinfectant. Progress under the protocol will be \ntransparent. It will be documented and reported for the entire world to \nsee.\n  Congressman Engel and I are fully committed to meeting the terms and \ngoals of the protocol. As I also said, we are pleased that the \nchocolate industry likewise has pledged its full commitment to these \nterms and goals. I would also like to commend the governments of the \nCote d'Ivoire and Ghana for their cooperation in meeting the terms of \nthe protocol. Clearly, it is in the interest of these national \ngovernments to eradicate the worst forms of child labor for their own \neconomic and social well-being.\n  We all realize the stakes are incredibly high and that the time for \njust talking has passed. Child labor and forced labor continue in the \ncocoa fields of west Africa and elsewhere. Children today are \nsuffering, being deprived of their childhood, being beaten, being \ndeprived of education. And ultimately the chocolate companies have a \nbig responsibility in stopping this suffrage. I will continue to work \nwith them and with the west African governments to eliminate this \nscourge.\n  At this time I would like to inform my colleagues of my intent to \noffer a sense-of-the-Senate resolution to the Foreign Operations \nappropriations bill that the Senate is now considering. My amendment \nsimply reaffirms the industry's commitments to eradicate child labor \nfrom cocoa plantations. The resolution I will offer reflects the main \npoints I have mentioned today. I hope it will be a noncontroversial \namendment and that it can be accepted by the managers of the bill.\n  Furthermore, Mr. President, I would remiss if I did not mention in \npassing, at least right now, some of the other problems facing the \nAfrican continent today: HIV/AIDS, hunger, the genocide in Darfur, debt \nrelief, millions of displaced people. Unfortunately, the list is long \nand the problems severe. I was pleased that the recent G8 meeting held \nin Scotland addressed some of these issues. This is a positive but, I \nmust add, a small step forward. In order to successfully meet the \nchallenges facing African nations, nations of the world must work \ntogether. And I will continue to support our chairman and ranking \nmember and our committee on the foreign operations appropriations \nsubcommittee to do all we can to help in those efforts.\n  Mr. President, I am going to just read briefly some parts of the \namendment that I will be offering to H.R. 3057. Basically, it is just, \nagain, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution to express the sense of \nCongress regarding abusive child labor practices in the growing and \nprocessing of cocoa. It has a number of findings, but it is a sense of \nCongress that:\n\n       The cocoa industry is to be commended, as the Protocol \n     agreement is the first time that an industry has accepted \n     moral, social, and financial responsibility for the \n     production of raw materials wherever they are produced;\n       The Government of the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire and the \n     Government of the Republic of Ghana should be commended for \n     the tangible steps they have taken to address the situation \n     of child labor in the cocoa sector;\n       An independent oversight body should be designated and \n     supported to work with the chocolate industry, national \n     governments and nongovernmental organizations on the progress \n     of the development and implementation of the certification \n     system by July 1, 2008 through a series of public reports;\n       The governments of West African nations that grow and \n     manufacture cocoa should consider child labor and forced \n     labor issues of top priorities;\n       The Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons of \n     the Department of State should include information on the \n     association between trafficking in persons and the cocoa \n     industry of Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, and other cocoa producing \n     regions in the annual trafficking in persons that is \n     submitted to Congress.\n\n  Mr. President, I will not read all of it, but those are some of the \nbasic elements of the sense-of-the-Congress resolution that I want to \npropose.\n  Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Is there an amendment pending \nat this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would ask the manager of the bill, would this be an \nappropriate time to send my amendment to the desk.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. That would be fine. I would like to take a look at it. \nI am not sure we have seen it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Certainly. I just got it finished a bit ago.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I think it would be appropriate to send it to the \ndesk.\n\n[[Page S8397]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate it.\n  Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk and ask for its \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1239.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress regarding abusive child \n        labor practices in the growing and processing of cocoa)\n\n       On page 326, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n\n\n            ABUSIVE CHILD LABOR PRACTICES IN COCOA INDUSTRY\n\n       Sec. 6113. (a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The plight of hundreds of thousands of child slaves \n     toiling in cocoa plantations in West Africa was reported in a \n     series by Knight Ridder newspapers in June 2001. (global)\n       (2) The report found that some of these children are sold \n     or tricked into slavery. Most of them are between the ages of \n     12 and 16 and some are as young as 9 years old.\n       (3) There are 1,500,000 farms in West Africa that produce \n     approximately 72 percent of the total global supply of cocoa, \n     with Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana producing about 62 percent and \n     22 percent, respectively, of the total cocoa production in \n     Africa. Other key producers are Indonesia, Nigeria, Cameroon, \n     and Brazil.\n       (4) United States consumers purchase over $13,000,000,000 \n     in chocolate products annually.\n       (5) On September 19, 2001, representatives of the chocolate \n     industry signed a voluntary Protocol for the Growing and \n     Processing of Cocoa Beans and their Derivative Products in a \n     Manner that Complies with ILO Convention 182 Concerning the \n     Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the \n     Worst Forms of Child Labor.\n       (6) The Protocol outlines 6 steps the industry formally \n     agreed to undertake to end abusive and forced child labor on \n     cocoa farms by July 2005.\n       (7) A vital step of the Protocol was the development and \n     implementation by the industry of a credible, transparent, \n     and publicly accountable industry-wide certification system \n     to ensure, by July 1, 2005, that cocoa beans and their \n     derivative products have not been grown or processed by \n     abusive child labor or slave labor.\n       (8) Since the Protocol was signed, some positive steps have \n     been taken to address the worst forms of child labor and \n     slave labor in cocoa growing, but the July 1, 2005, deadline \n     for creation and implementation of the certification system \n     was not fully met.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the cocoa industry is to be commended, as the Protocol \n     agreement is the first time that an industry has accepted \n     moral, social, and financial responsibility for the \n     production of raw materials, wherever they are produced;\n       (2) the Government of the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire and the \n     Government of the Republic of Ghana should be commended for \n     the tangible steps they have taken to address the situation \n     of child labor in the cocoa sector;\n       (3) even though the cocoa industry did not fully meet the \n     July 1, 2005, deadline for creation and implementation of the \n     labor certification system, it has agreed to redouble its \n     efforts to achieve a certification system that will cover 50 \n     percent of the cocoa growing regions of Cote d'Ivoire and \n     Ghana by July 1, 2008;\n       (4) the cocoa industry should make every effort to meet \n     this deadline in Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana and expand the \n     certification process to other West African nations and any \n     other country where abusive child labor and slave labor are \n     used in the growing and processing of cocoa;\n       (5) an independent oversight body should be designated and \n     supported to work with the chocolate industry, national \n     governments, and nongovernmental organizations on the \n     progress of the development and implementation of the \n     certification system by July 1, 2008, through a series of \n     public reports;\n       (6) the governments of West African nations that grow and \n     manufacture cocoa should consider child labor and forced \n     labor issues top priorities;\n       (7) the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons \n     of the Department of State should include information on the \n     association between trafficking in persons and the cocoa \n     industries of Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, and other cocoa producing \n     regions in the annual report on trafficking in persons that \n     is submitted to Congress; and\n       (8) the Department of State should assist the Government of \n     Cote d'Ivoire and the Government of Ghana in preventing the \n     trafficking of persons into the cocoa fields and other \n     industries in West Africa.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the chairman for taking a look at it. I hope it \nwill meet his approval.\n  Basically, as I said, the chocolate industry, I believe, is to be \ncommended for taking positive steps in agreeing to do 50 percent of the \nfarms by July 1 of 2008. We have to be vigilant. It is really a sense \nof the Congress commending them and then urging we stay on to meet \nthose goals and eventually the ultimate goal of making sure that we \ndon't have any forced labor and child trafficking on cocoa farms \nanywhere.\n  It always struck me as really kind of telling, almost bordering on \nthe obscene that so many of our kids in our country, in Europe, around \nthe world enjoy eating chocolate. Who doesn't enjoy eating chocolate? \nWe all love chocolate, hot chocolate, or chocolate of any form. And so \nI think many people who enjoy chocolate don't know that it is being \nproduced by forced child labor in many cases, kids who are beaten, kids \nwho are deprived of their childhood, kids who are basically child \nslaves. So I think this is something that we should pay attention to. \nAs I said, we have been working on this now, this is our fourth year, \nworking with the chocolate industry. We have this protocol. We have the \nframework. Progress is being made. We just need to make sure we don't \nslip behind, that we continue to support these efforts, to support the \nGovernments, as I said, both Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana, in their efforts, \nand the chocolate industry, also.\n  That is basically what this sense-of-the-Congress resolution is all \nabout.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as the distinguished Senator from Kentucky \nsaid earlier, we are on the Foreign Operations, State Department bill. \nWe have virtually completed our work. There is a pending amendment. We \nare going to be ready very soon to go to third reading.\n  We have had a number of Members say they might have an amendment, and \nI am delighted to hear that, but if they ``might,'' they might want to \ndo it while the bill is still on the floor because it is going to be \ngone.\n  Some of these amendments are very well thought out. Some Members have \ntheir press releases already written. But if Members want the press \nrelease released--as well as the well-thought-out amendment--one might \nwant to do it while the bill is on the floor.\n  I have no desire to hold up this piece of legislation. Senator \nMcConnell has no desire to hold up this legislation. We spent several \nhours of quorum calls Friday and today. If Members are serious about an \namendment, bring it to the floor. Otherwise, from this Senator's point \nof view, as soon as there is not an amendment pending, I will have no \nobjection to moving to third reading.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Prescription Drug Prices\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will just take a few minutes. Later this \nafternoon, at 5:45, we have ordered a vote on the nomination of Dr. \nLester Crawford to be Commissioner of the FDA. I had intended to come \nand speak prior to that vote. My understanding is that there is only a \n30-minute time period for debate, equally divided, just prior to the \nvote on that nomination, so I will take a couple of minutes now to \nexplain why I am going to vote against this nomination.\n  I have spent most of my time in the Senate voting for nominees sent \nto us by Presidents, Republicans and Democrats alike, because I believe \nthose who win the Presidency largely have the right to select their own \nteam and to have their own advisers. So I have, in most cases, voted \nfor the nominees who have come before the Senate to serve in the \nPresident's Cabinet and other important positions in the \nadministration.\n  This position is the head of the Food and Drug Administration, a very \nimportant agency--one, incidentally, that\n\n[[Page S8398]]\n\nhas had a substantial amount of controversy in recent years. I have \nbeen particularly interested in the FDA because we--myself along with \nothers in the Senate--have spent a lot of time working to try to see if \nwe can put some downward pressure on prescription drug prices.\n  Much to our chagrin--to those of us on both the Democratic side and \nthe Republican side who have been working toward this end--the \nopposition, in many cases, has come from the Food and Drug \nAdministration. The FDA has alleged safety issues where, in fact, there \nare no safety issues at all. It has been the Food and Drug \nAdministration that has been shaking the pom-poms for and cheerleading \nwith the pharmaceutical industry on these issues.\n\n  Let me describe the issue just for a moment.\n  The American consumer pays the highest prices in the world for brand-\nname prescription drugs. Consumers who purchase those prescription \ndrugs are charged much higher prices in the United States than \nelsewhere around the world. The pharmaceutical industry says it charges \nthese prices because it can. I held a hearing on this issue when I \nchaired a subcommittee some years ago. The result is, the drug industry \nsaid: Well, we can charge that amount here in the United States, but we \ncan't charge it in other countries because other countries have price \ncontrols on prescription drugs.\n  Yet I notice--because of a sweetheart little tax provision that was \nput in law about a year ago--that the drug industry has made \nsubstantial profits overseas. The sweetheart deal allows those \ncompanies that have started enterprises overseas and are earning \nprofits overseas to now pay taxes at a 5.25-percent rate for the income \nthey repatriate to this country, quite a deal for big companies that \nmove their jobs overseas. According to newspaper reports, the \npharmaceutical industry now has as much as $75 billion in profits they \nhave made in other countries that they are set to repatriate to this \ncountry for a 5.25-percent income tax rate.\n  Interesting. They tell us they have to charge higher prices to the \nAmerican consumers for prescription drugs, and they charge lower prices \nelsewhere because they are required by pricing policies in those \ncountries to do so. They say they do not make much money in those \ncountries, yet now they have $75 billion in profits from overseas sales \nin countries in which they have charged dramatically lower prices. So, \nobviously, they are making substantial profits in their sales in other \ncountries even though the consumers in those other countries enjoy \nlower prescription drug prices.\n  Mr. President, let me, by unanimous consent, show two pill bottles, \nif I might.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is a medicine called Celebrex, made \nby Pfizer. These bottles are large containers that happen to be empty. \nIt would contain 500 capsules; 200 milligrams, the usual adult dosage, \nit says. As you can see, this other bottle is also Celebrex. It is the \nsame pill, made by the same company, put in the same bottle. The only \ndifference in these bottles is the color on the labels is a bit \ndifferent, but the pills that were inside were the same. This one \nbottle is sold in the United States and the other is sold in Canada.\n  What is the difference? Well, the U.S. consumer pays $2.93 per \ncapsule out of this bottle. The Canadian consumer pays $1.32 out of the \nother bottle. So the one costs almost $3, the other just over $1. The \nAmerican consumer is charged double the price of the Canadian consumer. \nIt is the same pill, put in the same bottle, made by the same company, \nat an FDA-approved plant, sent to two different places, and the \nAmerican consumers pay two and a half times more than the Canadian \nconsumer.\n  Why is that the case? Well, the drug industry says they charge that \nprice in the United States because they can and because they must in \norder to gather the funds for research and development. But, of course, \nthe record shows that is not the case either. The drug industry \nactually spends more money on marketing and advertising than they do on \nresearch and development. And they actually spend about the same amount \non research and development in Europe that they do in the United States \nwhen, in fact, in Europe they charge lower prices for exactly the same \nprescription drugs.\n  So what does all of this have to do with Dr. Crawford and the FDA? \nWell, for those of us who are working to allow for the importation \nof FDA-approved drugs from other countries--notably from Canada and \nEurope--one of the most significant areas of opposition has been from \nthe FDA.\n\n  Dr. Mark McClellan was the head of the FDA for a while. He was an \naggressive advocate on behalf of the pharmaceutical industry. The \npharmaceutical industry could not have had a better cheerleader than \nDr. McClellan. And during that time, Dr. Crawford has also been at the \nFDA serving as deputy. He has been there as acting commissioner for \nmuch of this administration, both before and now after Dr. McClellan. \nAnd during that time, the FDA has continued to be a roadblock to try to \nget lower prices on prescription drugs for American consumers.\n  The problem is that there is a law on the books that says the only \nentity that can import a prescription drug from another country is the \nmanufacturer of that prescription drug. So a licensed pharmacist in \nMinot, ND, cannot go to Regina, Canada, for example, and buy an FDA-\napproved prescription drug, even one made in the United States and \nshipped to Canada. A licensed U.S. pharmacist cannot go to a licensed \npharmacist in Canada, buy the FDA-approved drug at half or a third of \nthe price and bring it back and pass the savings along to the customer.\n  Why is that the case? Well, because once again there is a sweetheart \ndeal. Under this deal, trade should apparently only work for everybody \nbut the little guy, the consumer. One would think, with free trade and \nthe opportunity to cross boundaries, that if you are talking about FDA-\napproved medicines, that American consumers, particularly American \npharmacists, would be able to also take advantage of the global \nmarketplace, but they cannot.\n  So I, along with a bipartisan group of colleagues, have been trying \nto change the law. We are not proposing price controls but instead \ncompetition. Very simple: Allow an American pharmacist, a main street \ndrugstore owner to access the identical prescription drug in Canada or \nEurope at a fraction of the price and bring it back and pass the \nsavings along to the consumer. We are told that American consumers \ncould save as much as $38 billion--that is with a ``B''--a year if that \nwere to happen.\n  As a point of fact, if we were able to get our legislation passed, we \nwould not have people shopping in Canada for prescription drugs. But \nthe very fact that they could would force the repricing of prescription \ndrugs based on market forces here in the United States. Unfortunately, \nwe have been thwarted in our efforts. Senator Olympia Snowe, John \nMcCain, myself, Senator Kennedy, Senator Grassley, Senator Stabenow, \nand many others have all worked on this for a long, long time. The \nfirst bill I introduced on this was in 1999, and still drug importation \nhas not been allowed because it has been blocked.\n  Opponents have said there would be safety issues. Well, let me give \nyou an example of the safety issue. In Europe, what we propose is done \nevery single day: cross-border trading in prescription drugs. A \npharmacist in Germany wants to buy a prescription drug from Spain, that \nis not a problem. If you are a pharmacy in England and want to buy a \nprescription drug from France, that is no problem either because they \nhave something called parallel trading. In fact, we had the person who \nheaded the parallel trading association come and testify before a U.S. \nCongressional committee. That person said there are no safety issues. \nBut it opens the market, so consumers see lower drug prices as a result \nof it. But in this country, we are told we apparently cannot do it. It \ndoes not take rocket science to understand there is no safety issue.\n  Let me talk about Canada just for a moment. Canada has nearly an \nidentical chain of custody for the prescription drug that comes from \nthe manufacturer that goes to the consumer. The Canadian system is \nnearly identical to ours. So if an American licensed pharmacist were to \nbuy a lower\n\n[[Page S8399]]\n\npriced FDA-approved drug from a licensed Canadian pharmacist, how on \nEarth could there be any kind of safety issue? There simply is not.\n  This is not about safety. It is about profits for the pharmaceutical \nindustry. Now, I understand that issue. If the pharmaceutical industry \nwere represented by people here--rather than serving in the Senate, \nthey served the pharmaceutical industry--I would understand why you \nwould make the case you want maximum profits. But that is not the way \nour economic system works. It works best for consumers when you have \ncompetition and open borders and an opportunity to trade. That is what \nwe have been trying to do.\n  It is disappointing that over 6 years now we have found a lot of \nopposition to something that is so filled with common sense. The \nopposition comes from the pharmaceutical industry, from allies of the \npharmaceutical industry here in this Chamber in the Senate, and from \nthe FDA. Now, the FDA is supposed to regulate, not represent. The FDA \nis to regulate the pharmaceutical industry, not represent the \npharmaceutical industry.\n  These are, in many cases, lifesaving drugs. I don't diminish the \nimportance of prescription drugs. They provide miracles in many cases. \nBut miracle drugs offer no miracles to those who cannot pay for them. \nWe have all heard from people who go to the grocery store and go to the \npharmacy in the back of the store first to buy the pharmaceuticals in \norder to understand how much money they have left for groceries. We \nalso know that senior citizens are especially hard hit. They make up 12 \npercent of America's population, yet they consume one-third of the \nprescription drugs. It is not unusual to talk to a senior citizen who \nis taking 5, 7, 12 different prescription drugs every single day. Many \nof them simply can't afford it. America's most vulnerable population \nrepresents those who are hardest hit by prescription drugs prices.\n  I was at a farm in North Dakota last summer, as I was touring around. \nOne fellow, who was about 85 years old, and his wife, who was in her \nmid 80s, sat on a hay bale and told me their story. He said: My wife \nhas been fighting breast cancer for 4 years. For 4 years we have driven \nto the Canadian border to buy Tamoxifen because you can buy Tamoxifen \nat 80-percent less cost in Canada than in the United States. He talked \nabout the number of trips they made. The only reason they could afford \nTamoxifen was because they could drive to the border and get it. A \nsmall supply of drugs for personal use, a 3-month supply, has been \nallowed to come across the border for individuals. But very few \nAmericans can reach that Canadian border and, on a routine basis, find \na way to buy their FDA-approved drugs from Canada.\n  I took a group of American retired folks to Canada in a bus. We went \nto a little, one-room drugstore in Emerson, Canada. I saw person to \nperson the prescription drugs they had to buy and the savings with each \nof them. You should have seen the look of surprise on their faces when \nthey found out what the price was in Canada versus what they had been \npaying here in the U.S. This is unfair pricing. We need to do something \nabout it. But the cavalier attitude at the FDA, the attitude of \nrepresenting the drug companies rather than regulating the drug \ncompanies, means that we will continue to have to battle the FDA. \nHaving to battle the FDA to do something that is so filled with common \nsense is a frustrating thing for those of us who have been working on \nthis for years and years.\n  Incidentally, there are some other issues with this Commissioner, and \nI will not spend my time talking about those.\n  My colleagues, including Senator Kennedy, with whom I spoke the other \nday, will make the point eloquently that we need an FDA Commissioner. \nIt is unbelievable that we have gone all this time without having an \nFDA Commissioner. We have had someone who is acting for the bulk of \nthis administration. I don't disagree with that notion. It doesn't make \nany sense that we have not had a full-time, permanent FDA Commissioner \nfilling that term. But that doesn't mean that Dr. Crawford is the right \nperson. He is not in my judgment. I wish I could vote for him, but I \ndon't intend to.\n  My hope is that in the coming months, we will persuade the majority \nleader and others, to get a vote on drug importation legislation. If \nnecessary, we will offer amendments at the right time and on the right \nbills that forces the hand of those who oppose the work we are trying \nto do.\n  My hope is at the end of the day, we will get a vote. If we get a \nvote allowing the reimportation of prescription drugs, there is no \nquestion it is going to pass the Senate. It will get 60-65 or more \nvotes in the Senate. The question is getting the vote. We thought we \nhad a commitment in the last Congress for a vote. The Senate majority \nleader and I had a disagreement about what the commitment said, and so \nwe didn't get the vote. What has happened is, the majority has \nsuccessfully blocked it, and the White House that stands with the \npharmaceutical industry has successfully blocked it. There is now a \nvery strong bipartisan group of Senators. I mentioned Senator Snowe, \nSenators Vitter, McCain, Stabenow, Kennedy, and many others. We have \nover 30 Senators who have now joined as cosponsors of this legislation. \nOne way or another we are going to prevail. When it is passed, we will \nsee reasonable and competitive prices for prescription drugs.\n  I regret to say that I will vote against Dr. Crawford's nomination \nwhen the vote occurs. I wish I could come to the floor and say I will \nvote for the nominee. But I don't want to put further roadblocks in the \nway of those of us who are trying to get fair prescription drug pricing \nfor American citizens. I believe it is critically important that we \nunderstand prescription drugs are something different, something \nunusual. Most countries have already understood that. If you need a \nprescription drug, a lifesaving drug that can either save your life or \nkeep you out of an acute care hospital bed, you don't have a choice. \nYou have to try and buy it, at prices that are double, triple and, in \nsome cases, 10 times the cost for the identical drug in other \ncountries. That is unfair to the American consumer.\n  Some day we will force enough people on the floor of this Senate to \nstand up and vote. When we do, we will have sufficient votes to move \nthis through the Senate. I will say this: I doubt whether it will be \nwith anything other than the obstruction of Dr. Crawford. He and Dr. \nMcClellan before him have run the play called by the pharmaceutical \nindustry. I really regret that is the way it is going.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am going to be filing an amendment and \nalso noticing an intention to suspend the rules for such an amendment. \nI want to preserve the right to address it on this piece of \nlegislation. This is an amendment that would prohibit the sale of \nUnocal, an American oil company, to CNOOC, a Chinese Government-\ncontrolled and owned oil company.\n  I mentioned Friday that I think that this is a fairly simple \nproposition. The Chinese Government would never, ever allow an American \ncompany, let alone an American oil company, to buy a Chinese oil \ncompany. The Chinese oil companies are controlled by the Chinese \nGovernment. What we have here is a proposal by CNOOC, which is a \nChinese oil company controlled by the Government, wishing to purchase \nan American oil company. You don't have reciprocal capabilities.\n  They say: Let the free market deal with this. Let's let the \nmarketplace decide.\n  There is no free market or marketplace in a circumstance where the \nChinese Government controls a company and the controlled company, \nthrough deeply subsidized Government loans, wishes to buy an American \ncompany, especially in something as strategic as oil.\n  I don't bear any ill will toward the Chinese. They are a big and \ngrowing country with a significant impact around the world. They will \nbe a significant part of our future. But we do\n\n[[Page S8400]]\n\nhave an extraordinary trade deficit with China which is dangerous for \nus. It is headed to over $200 billion this year. That is completely \nunsustainable. It is dangerous for us. Our relationship with the \nChinese should and must be mutually beneficial, especially in the area \nof trade. Regrettably, it is not.\n  We are a cash cow for the hard currency needs of China. They continue \nto ratchet up these deficits in a significant way. In many cases, the \nChinese markets are closed to our country. We also find on the streets \nof China a substantial amount of counterfeit and pirated goods that \ncome from intellectual property in this country. The Chinese say they \nhave trouble controlling all that. They don't have trouble controlling \nit. In fact, the logo now that belongs to the Chinese Government for \nthe Olympic games, the minute that showed up on the streets in China \nunder counterfeiting, the Chinese Government took immediate action, and \nyou can't find it any more because the Chinese Government had an \ninterest in stopping counterfeit and piracy when it came to the logo \nfor the Chinese Olympic games.\n  We have a lot of issues with the Chinese--counterfeiting, piracy, \ntrade deficit, many more. This issue is simple; should we allow a \nChinese-controlled and largely Chinese-owned oil company to purchase an \nAmerican oil company, especially in circumstances where they would not \nallow that same transaction to take place?\n  My answer to that is no. I don't think it makes sense for this \ncountry's strategic or economic future, and it does not make sense from \nthe standpoint of national security. I don't believe it makes sense \nfrom the standpoint of reciprocal trade opportunities, and I don't \nbelieve those who say this is some sort of marketplace transaction. \nThere is not a marketplace when you have government control of both the \nindustry and the companies in the industry trying to buy American \nbusinesses.\n  I am filing the amendment and noticing along with it an intent to \nsuspend the rules which would be required for me to do when I offer \nsuch an amendment. I mentioned that I also likely would offer a funding \nlimitation amendment in the Appropriations Committee, and the House of \nRepresentatives has done the same. The funding limitation would apply \nto the Treasury Department, where approval for such a transaction would \nbe required to take place.\n  This is not a reflection of whether I think the Chinese country is \ntrying to do harm to our economy or anything of the sort. China is a \nlarge and growing country with 1.3 billion people, an economy that is \ngrowing by leaps and bounds. I have been to China a couple of times, \nand it is quite a remarkable place. But with respect to our \nrelationship with China, that relationship must be mutually beneficial, \nespecially in the area of international trade. It is not now mutually \nbeneficial. There is one-way trade going on, and we are up to our neck \nin trade debt to the Chinese.\n  This transaction does not advance our interest. It might advance the \nChinese interest by giving them more access to oil, but it does not \nadvance America's interest. I hope that it is viewed through the prism \nof what advances our country's interests. What is it that represents \nthe best policy choice for our country?\n  My sense of that is that we ought to prohibit this sale. The \namendment is very simple. It doesn't beat around the bush. It is very \nshort. It is an amendment that would prohibit the sale of an American \noil company to a Government-controlled and deeply subsidized oil \ncompany in the country of China.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to read into the \nRecord a statement about the passing of one of our most dedicated \npublic officials.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress regarding the use of funds \n           for orphans, and displaced and abandoned children)\n\n       On page 326, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n\n\n             ORPHANS, AND DISPLACED AND ABANDONED CHILDREN\n\n       Sec. 6113. (a) Congress--\n       (1) reaffirms its commitment to the founding principle of \n     the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-\n     Operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption, that a child, \n     for the full and harmonious development of the child's \n     personality, should grow up in a family environment, in an \n     atmosphere of happiness, love, and understanding;\n       (2) recognizes that each State should take, as a matter of \n     priority, every appropriate measure to enable a child to \n     remain in the care of the child's family of origin, but when \n     not possible should strive to place the child in a permanent \n     and loving home through adoption;\n       (3) affirms that intercountry adoption may offer the \n     advantage of a permanent family to a child for whom a family \n     cannot be found in the child's State of origin;\n       (4) affirms that long-term foster care or \n     institutionalization are not permanent options and should \n     therefore only be used when no other permanent options are \n     available; and\n       (5) recognizes that programs that protect and support \n     families can reduce the abandonment and exploitation of \n     children.\n       (b) The funds appropriated under title III of this Act \n     shall be made available in a manner consistent with the \n     principles described in subsection (a).\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I send this amendment to the desk and I \nask my colleagues to consider this amendment. We can vote on the \namendment at any time before, of course, the final passage of this \nbill. I send this amendment to the desk, and I will spend a few minutes \nthis afternoon talking about the underlying bill as it relates to the \nU.S. work and position on orphans.\n  We have done a lot of great work promoting the idea that children \nshould be raised in families. We have in the United States made a lot \nof progress over the last 10 years. The former administration, the \nClinton administration, and the current Bush administration have made \nchild welfare a priority, have made families a priority.\n  We believe very strongly in the Congress, both on the Republican side \nand the Democratic side, that children are best raised in families. We \nwould like our budget to reflect that commonsense principle. I have \nbeen in a couple of hearings and a couple of meetings over the course \nof the last year or two that have given me, some question whether that \nis clear in this Foreign Operations bill. So my amendment attempts to \nmake clear in the underlying bill what I think is the clear and \noverwhelming contention of the Senate--and I would imagine the House of \nRepresentatives--that we spend money promoting social policy around the \nworld, and that we adhere to a very commonsense principle--it is not an \nAmerican principle; it is a universal principle. But I can most \ncertainly say in America people feel very strongly about the fact that \nchildren should not raise themselves and should not be raised in \norphanages, unless absolutely necessary. They should not be raised in \ngroup homes and should not be left alone to raise themselves on the \nstreet. We should do everything we can to keep children in families.\n  Let me spend a few minutes being a little more specific. A couple of \nyears ago, under the great leadership of Senator Jesse Helms, we passed \nan international treaty that put into place this principle, which \nbasically says that in our foreign policy it is the principle of the \nUnited States to say clearly that\n\n[[Page S8401]]\n\nchildren should remain in the families to which they are born--that our \npolicies should promote family stabilization, family reunification, \nreunifying children who might be separated because of war or disease. \nWe should try our very best to keep children in the families to which \nthey are born.\n  Separation is occurring at an alarming rate in this world today for a \nnumber of reasons. AIDS is like a factory for orphans. There is an \nunprecedented number of children becoming orphaned because of this \nparticular disease. The way this disease affects families, it takes \nboth the father and the mother, leaving children truly orphaned. \n``Double orphaned'' is the way the international community talks about \na child who has lost both a mother and a father. So we have a growing \nnumber of orphans in the world because of the AIDS epidemic.\n  But even if it weren't for the AIDS epidemic moving through, for \ninstance, Africa and India at an alarming rate, we would still have a \ngrowing number of orphans in the world. The question is: What do we do \nas a human family to see that each of these children has a home, a \nplace? That is simply what my amendment does. It recognizes it is the \nsense of the Congress and it recognizes the principle that children \nshould grow up in the homes to which they were born. But if they are \nseparated by disease, or war, or death, or for good reason--because \nsome children are at risk in the home, perhaps from mental or physical \nabuse; sometimes children, unfortunately, have to be taken from \nparents, according to laws and customs of some countries. When that \nhappens, those children should be raised by a relative, a caring, \nresponsible relative, someone right there in the extended family.\n  If a relative is not available or willing or able to take on the care \nof this orphan or sibling group, then those children should be raised \nright there in the community or within the country of origin. And if \nnot, then we should find a way for these children to be adopted \nsomewhere in the world. My amendment is not making this the law; this \nis the law now in the United States. These are the principles that are \nfollowed by our treaty, as passed by this Congress.\n  My amendment simply restates, for the purpose of this bill, that the \n$1.6 billion the U.S. taxpayers are sending out all over the world to \nsupport children's health and survival through USAID, which is our \nprimary agency that distributes these funds, shall be distributed \nmindful of this principle on which this Congress has already acted.\n  I believe we will have a unanimous vote on this amendment. I do not \nthink it is something that will generate opposition, but if there are \nMembers who oppose it, I will be happy to talk with them about \nadjusting any language they find objectionable.\n  One of the things we need to promote in this world, not only at home \nbut abroad, is the strength and support of families because if families \nare strong, if children can be nurtured and cared for within the loving \ncontext of a family, then I believe communities are strong, and when \ncommunities are strong, then nations are strong. It does start with the \nfamily unit.\n  Any idea that we could promote successful social policy around that \nprinciple or over it or underneath it instead of embracing it fully I \nthink is a real mistake.\n  That is all my amendment does. The language tracks from The Hague \nTreaty which has already been passed. It will leave no shadow of a \ndoubt that the Members of this body think that as USAID gives this \nmoney to NGOs or to regular recipients, that this principle be included \nin the distribution of this $1.6 billion.\n  I would be happy to answer any questions about the amendment. The \namendment is rather short, a page and a half. It is rather clear. \nAgain, I think it will go a long way in restating in this funding bill \nthat we are, in fact, committed to the idea that children should be \nraised in families and that there is really so such thing as unwanted \nchildren, just unfound families. If we would spend a little extra time \nand be a little bit more committed on this issue, we could, despite the \ngrowing numbers, I believe, find a home for every child who needs one. \nI know that is a tall order, and I know people will say: Senator, that \ncan never be done. I know the number of orphans is on the rise. But I \nalso know from my personal experience and the thousands of parents who \nhave adopted children that there is plenty of room in the homes and \nhearts of people all over the world. If governments would just make a \nlittle better effort to identify some of these families and to promote \nthese concepts and continue to restate them in all of our work, that is \nnot as farfetched as it may seem.\n  We want to respect the family, recognize the extended family, \nrecognize the right of relatives to raise children, but when relatives \nand extended family members cannot be found, we believe that children \nshould be placed in another family, to be raised as their own, and \nsibling groups kept together, which is the new practice in child \nwelfare, not only in the United States but around the world, and that \ngovernments have an obligation to reduce barriers to adoption, to cut \ndown the costs, to eliminate the corruption, to encourage transparency, \nto cut down on the paperwork, and to do their best to make what is so \nnatural and what happened before governments existed, I am certain of \nit. When a parent or parents died, the most responsible adult next to \nthe child took that child under their wing and raised them as their \nown. It is the way it has been done since the beginning of time. I \ndon't know why governments in this world find this very complicated. It \nreally is not. It is quite simple.\n  I want to make sure our primary aid giver USAID, understands clearly \nthat the Members of this Senate are not trying to dictate, are not \ntrying to earmark, are not trying to tell them the specifics of how to \ndo their work. This amendment says that in giving money for social \nwelfare and child survival and health, the principle that children \nshould be raised in a family should be ever present in their \ndecisionmaking. I believe this amendment would make this issue very \nclear, and there needs to be clarity on this subject.\n  If there are no other questions, I submit the amendment for \nconsideration by the body and will expect a vote sometime at the \nmanagers' discretion. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, is the Landrieu amendment now pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct, the Landrieu amendment is \npending.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

(a) The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The plight of hundreds of thousands of child slaves \n     toiling in cocoa plantations in West Africa was reported in a \n     series by Knight Ridder newspapers in June 2001. (global)\n       (2) The report found that some of these children are sold \n     or tricked into slavery. Most of them are between the ages of \n     12 and 16 and some are as young as 9 years old.\n       (3) There are 1,500,000 farms in West Africa that produce \n     approximately 72 percent of the total global supply of cocoa, \n     with Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana producing about 62 percent and \n     22 percent, respectively, of the total cocoa production in \n     Africa. Other key producers are Indonesia, Nigeria, Cameroon, \n     and Brazil.\n       (4) United States consumers purchase over $13,000,000,000 \n     in chocolate products annually.\n       (5) On September 19, 2001, representatives of the chocolate \n     industry signed a voluntary Protocol for the Growing and \n     Processing of Cocoa Beans and their Derivative Products in a \n     Manner that Complies with ILO Convention 182 Concerning the \n     Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the \n     Worst Forms of Child Labor.\n       (6) The Protocol outlines 6 steps the industry formally \n     agreed to undertake to end abusive and forced child labor on \n     cocoa farms by July 2005.\n       (7) A vital step of the Protocol was the development and \n     implementation by the industry of a credible, transparent, \n     and publicly accountable industry-wide certification system \n     to ensure, by July 1, 2005, that cocoa beans and their \n     derivative products have not been grown or processed by \n     abusive child labor or slave labor.\n       (8) Since the Protocol was signed, some positive steps have \n     been taken to address the worst forms of child labor and \n     slave labor in cocoa growing, but the July 1, 2005, deadline \n     for creation and implementation of the certification system \n     was not fully met.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the cocoa industry is to be commended, as the Protocol \n     agreement is the first time that an industry has accepted \n     moral, social, and financial responsibility for the \n     production of raw materials, wherever they are produced;\n       (2) the Government of the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire and the \n     Government of the Republic of Ghana should be commended for \n     the tangible steps they have taken to address the situation \n     of child labor in the cocoa sector;\n       (3) even though the cocoa industry did not fully meet the \n     July 1, 2005, deadline for creation and implementation of the \n     labor certification system, it has agreed to redouble its \n     efforts to achieve a certification system that will cover 50 \n     percent of the cocoa growing regions of Cote d'Ivoire and \n     Ghana by July 1, 2008;\n       (4) the cocoa industry should make every effort to meet \n     this deadline in Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana and expand the \n     certification process to other West African nations and any \n     other country where abusive child labor and slave labor are \n     used in the growing and processing of cocoa;\n       (5) an independent oversight body should be designated and \n     supported to work with the chocolate industry, national \n     governments, and nongovernmental organizations on the \n     progress of the development and implementation of the \n     certification system by July 1, 2008, through a series of \n     public reports;\n       (6) the governments of West African nations that grow and \n     manufacture cocoa should consider child labor and forced \n     labor issues top priorities;\n       (7) the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons \n     of the Department of State should include information on the \n     association between trafficking in persons and the cocoa \n     industries of Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, and other cocoa producing \n     regions in the annual report on trafficking in persons that \n     is submitted to Congress; and\n       (8) the Department of State should assist the Government of \n     Cote d'Ivoire and the Government of Ghana in preventing the \n     trafficking of persons into the cocoa fields and other \n     industries in West Africa.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. For the information of our colleagues, these are three \namendments, one is a modification to the Harkin amendment previously \nfiled, one is a Leahy technical amendment regarding Nepal, and one\nis a Lieberman-Brownback-Kennedy amendment regarding refugees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am advised these amendments are cleared \nby all the parties with interest on this side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto.\n  The amendments (Nos. 1248, 1249, and 1239, as modified) were agreed \nto.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I know Senator Leahy shares my view \nthat we are going to finish this bill tomorrow. Last year, we were \nfortunate to finish it in half a day. Obviously, that will not be the \ncase this year because we started it on Friday and clearly will not be \nable to finish it tonight. We do intend to finish it tomorrow. The \nSenate will be interrupted in the morning by a speech to a joint \nmeeting by the Prime Minister of India, which many Members will want to \nattend. But we intend to press on as rapidly as possible. If any \nMembers on this side of the aisle have any amendments they have not \ndiscussed yet with either myself or staff, we would appreciate them \ncoming over now and discussing it with us because we intend to move \nrapidly tomorrow and hopefully clear this bill out of the Senate by \nsometime in the afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I totally concur with the senior Senator \nfrom Kentucky. Friday, both he and I were here in a rather lonely \nChamber, I might say. We would have been happy to have gone to third \nreading on Friday. We were advised Members on both sides of the aisle \nhad matters to come before this committee. Of course, extending the \nnormal courtesy managers do on such bills, we did not go to third \nreading so we could accommodate those Members. We are fast approaching \nthat time. Frankly, if we reach a time tomorrow where we are ready to \nwrap up this bill, I will join with the Senator from Kentucky in doing \nthat.\n  I note to all Members that the bill is different than it has been in \npast years. We have both the operations of the State Department as well \nas what we normally consider the foreign aid bill. There are a number \nof items in the bill strongly supported by both Democrats and \nRepublicans and a number of items sought by the President as part of \nhis efforts in foreign policy.\n  We have crafted what, by anybody's measure, has to be considered a \nbipartisan piece of legislation, one that should get overwhelming \nsupport by this body. We have taken into consideration those items the \nWhite House needs in the normal conduct of foreign affairs, as well as \nthose items the State Department needs in their normal operations. But \nwe still have to pass the bill. The bill, if it was brought to a vote \nright now, would pass overwhelmingly. But it still has to pass.\n  I have never served as either leader of the Senate, but I sympathize \nwith them. The leaders of this Senate--majority leaders Senator \nMansfield, Senator Byrd, Senator Baker, Senator Dole, Senator Mitchell, \nSenator Lott, Senator Frist, as well as their counterparts--Senator \nScott, Senator Griffin, and some of the same Senators I mentioned \nserved as both minority and majority leaders, and Senator Reid. It is \nnot an easy job to schedule the Senate. The distinguished Senator from \nKentucky is the deputy Republican leader. He knows that. We are trying \nto accommodate him. We have done everything Senator Frist or Senator \nReid have asked us to do in moving this bill forward. With a little \ncooperation from everybody else, we can wrap up this bill and get on to \nother matters because we still have to go to conference, which I would \nlike to get to very quickly so we can get a final package before the \nSenate.\n  I say that hoping someone will hear and know what the heck we are \ntalking about, other than Supreme Court Justices. We really do want to \nget this bill wrapped up. Please do because once we reach a point with \nthe amendments, we\n\n[[Page S8403]]\n\nare going to vote them up or down and finish the bill. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me add, we will finish the bill \ntomorrow for certain. It will be, obviously, easier on the membership \nif we do it earlier in the day.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/18/senate-section/article/S8403-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8403-S8408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF LESTER M. CRAWFORD TO BE COMMISSIONER OF FOOD AND DRUGS, \n                DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to executive session to consider Executive Calendar No. 172, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Lester M. Crawford, of \nMaryland, to be Commissioner of Food and Drugs, Department of Health \nand Human Services.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 30 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to the vote.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  I rise to discuss the pending nomination of Dr. Lester Crawford to be \nthe Commissioner of Food and Drugs. I particularly thank all of the \npeople who have been involved in this nomination process. It has been a \ngreat bipartisan effort. It has been thoroughly explored and we finally \nare at a point where we can have an actual FDA Commissioner approved. \nIt will be a tremendous relief to me and to the Nation, I am sure.\n  I particularly want to thank Senator Kennedy for his efforts in \nproceeding through the different hearings that we have had and all of \nthe other work that we have had to do. The Food and Drug Administration \nis tasked with the broad and critical mission of protecting public \nhealth. The FDA Commissioner is in charge of an agency that regulates \n$1 trillion worth of products a year.\n  The agency ensures the safety and effectiveness of all drugs and \nbiological products like vaccines, medical devices, and animal drugs \nand feed. It also oversees the safety of a vast variety of food \nproducts as well as medical and consumer products, including cosmetics.\n  In addition, the Commissioner is responsible for advancing the public \nhealth by helping to speed innovations in its mission areas and by \nhelping the public get accurate, science-based information on medicines \nand foods. The FDA has been without a confirmed Commissioner for more \nthan a year.\n  In January of this year, 17 members of the Senate Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions sent a bipartisan letter to the \nPresident urging him to nominate a Commissioner to provide the agency \nwith greater clarity and certainty in its mission to protect our food \nand drug supplies. Recent breakthroughs in medical science and \ntechnology show how quickly science and technology are changing our \nlives each and every day.\n  The FDA is at a critical point in its history. The potential benefits \nfrom our medical research are staggering. A fully confirmed FDA \nCommissioner is essential to ensuring that these medical breakthroughs \ncan be brought to the market safely and effectively. Consumers deserve \nto have a fully functional FDA that can oversee the industry with \nconfidence and authority and harness the technical achievements that \ncan improve and save lives.\n  I believe the President's nominee, Dr. Lester Crawford, has the right \nqualifications to lead the FDA and to bring about the necessary reforms \nto maintain consumer confidence in our Nation's drug safety. Clearly we \nneed someone at the helm of the FDA who can direct the agency and work \nwith Congress to find the answers to these and many other difficult \nissues that will continue to come before us.\n  Dr. Crawford has been Acting Commissioner of FDA since March of 2004. \nHe has a long and distinguished career in private and public service. \nHe worked at the FDA in other capabilities before joining the agency \nagain in 2002.\n  The show of support for Dr. Crawford's nomination has been strong. In \nthe runup to Dr. Crawford's confirmation hearing in March, my committee \nreceived letters of support from more than 100 individuals and \norganizations. It is high time we had this debate and this vote. We \nwaited many months for President Bush to send us a qualified nominee \nfor the post.\n  In response to our bipartisan letter to the President, the President \nnominated Dr. Crawford. We have waited long enough. I think we can all \nagree that we need a strong leader at the FDA right now and one who has \na mandate to act. We must be forward looking. There are many items \nbefore the FDA that require the immediate attention of an FDA \nCommissioner vested with full authority.\n  The authority flows directly from the act of Senate confirmation. \nWithout a Senate-confirmed leader, we cannot expect the FDA to be as \neffective as we need it to be.\n  Dr. Crawford's nomination was reported favorably out of the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor and Pensions on June 15. So I am pleased \nthat we are now ready to confirm Dr. Crawford so that he can take \ncharge, take action, and take responsibility for leading the FDA in the \nbest interests of the public health.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I congratulate my friend and chairman of \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions for his \nleadership in ensuring that the Senate will have an opportunity to vote \non Dr. Crawford and, hopefully, approve his nomination.\n  During one time or another during 3 of the last 4 years we have not \nhad a head of the Food and Drug Administration. As Chairman Enzi has \npointed out, this agency has enormous power, influence, and say-so on \nmany of the different issues that affect every family in this country. \nIt regulates food, cosmetics, drugs, medical devices, even televisions \nand cell phones a full quarter of every dollar consumers spend. And FDA \nreally sets the standard for the rest of the world in how it regulates \nthese products. The rest of the world looks to our Food and Drug \nAdministration as the gold standard, and, as Chairman Enzi pointed out, \nwe have not had a permanent Commissioner for 3 of the last 4 years. I \nthink we have suffered because of it.\n  Now we have the opportunity, with Dr. Crawford, to fill that job, and \nI will explain in just a few moments why I think he is eminently \nqualified.\n  I agree with those who believe that we are in the life science \ncentury. We have seen a commitment to the promise of the this century \nby the Congress and by administrations in recent times when we \neffectively doubled the NIH budget. We have seen the sequencing of the \ngene, the progress that we have made with DNA, the real possibility of \nbreakthrough drugs, and the debates we are having on stem cell \nresearch. This is truly the life science century.\n  Quite frankly, the most important position in this life science \ncentury is who is heads the Food and Drug Administration, because we \nwill want to have these breakthrough drugs and other treatments \navailable to people at the earliest possible time, and that is FDA's \njob. We want to make sure these treatments are safe and effective. That \nis going to be an enormous responsibility, but I believe the \npossibilities and the meaning for families will be breathtaking.\n  So that is why this position, and the FDA, is so important. There are \nmany things that we do in this body, and many people who are directly \ninvolved say this or that thing is the most important thing that we are \ngoing to do in the session. Well, this might not be the most important \nthing that is done in this session, but having a responsible, informed, \nenlightened, future-looking, tough-minded administrator at the Food and \nDrug Administration is enormously important for all Americans. That is \nwhat this debate and discussion is about.\n\n[[Page S8404]]\n\n  It has also been about the importance of following science. This is \nenormously important, and I will say an additional word about that. It \nis important for the FDA to have the confidence of the American people \nthat the FDA is calling the important decisions it makes as the science \nreveals that ideology and politics have not become involved.\n  I rise in support of Dr. Crawford to be the Commissioner of the Food \nand Drug Administration. Modern drugs, vaccines, and medical devices \ncan work miracles but only if FDA does its job to see that they are \nsafe and effective. We use food and food products from around the world \nand we count on the FDA to see that they are not contaminated.\n  FDA touches the lives of every American every day. As I said before, \na full quarter of consumer products are regulated by the FDA. That is \nwhy it is so important the FDA have a full-fledged Commissioner. I \nfully support Dr. Crawford's nomination for the position.\n  His impressive record and clear commitment to public health will \nserve the agency well. He has dedicated his life to public service and \nto public health. He is trained as both a veterinarian and a \npharmacologist and has many years of experience in government, \nindustry, and the academic world.\n  His leadership experience at FDA dates back to 1978 when he headed \nthe Center for Veterinary Medicine. Over the years since then, he has \nled the Food Safety and Inspection Service at the Department of \nAgriculture, headed a major association on veterinary medical \neducation, and most recently served as Deputy Commissioner and Acting \nCommissioner of the Food and Drug Administration itself.\n  Under Dr. Crawford's leadership at FDA, we have seen stepped up \nefforts to monitor drug safety and to inform patients and doctors about \nthe risks of drugs. We have recently seen increased scrutiny of drug \nadvertising. FDA also made Herculean efforts to seek and permit the use \nof flu vaccines from other sources after the vaccine shortage last \nyear, and I am hopeful that these efforts will pay off this year and in \nthe following years in new manufacturers of flu vaccine for the U.S. \nmarket.\n  Clearly, more must be done. With a Commissioner in place, we can work \nmuch more effectively on the key issues facing the agency, from how FDA \nmonitors drug safety to ways to address the flu vaccine shortage, to \nhow it handles the conflicts of interest on its advisory committees and \nhow it has acted on Plan B.\n  I intend to work with Chairman Enzi and the other members of our HELP \nCommittee to see that these issues are addressed, to help Dr. Crawford \nmake any changes at the agency that are needed, and to help craft \nlegislation that will allow FDA to do its vital job more effectively.\n  On drug safety, FDA can only request drug companies to take action to \nprotect the public. It is obvious that companies often have conflicts \nof interest and the FDA needs the authority to require better labels \nand insist on clinical trials of drugs already on the market, not just \nrequest them.\n  We need to improve the post-market monitoring of drug safety. \nClinical trials before approval can and do detect many safety problems, \nbut they should not end FDA's responsibility for the safety of drugs \nalready on the market. When needed, new clinical trials should be \nrequired.\n  I just mention at this time that we intend to report out information \ntechnology legislation from the HELP Committee, hopefully this week. \nWith information technology, we will be able to better monitor how \ndrugs are used and the adverse reactions to those drugs, and hopefully \nhave those reports promptly so that we will be able to provide greater \nprotection to the public. That legislation will hopefully come out of \nour committee with a strong bipartisan commitment and with new \nleadership, and the opportunities that are out at the FDA with these \nnew breakthrough drugs, it can make an enormous difference in terms of \nthe quality of health care and the safety of treatments for the \nAmerican people.\n  Above all, FDA needs enough resources to do its job effectively. The \nOffice of Drug Safety does not even have computer systems capable of \nanalyzing data as thoroughly as possible, and it cannot always purchase \naccess to drug usage databases that could identify safety problems. It \ninspects less than 2 percent of imported food, and this much only \nbecause of a large increase in funds to FDA for that purpose after 9/\n11.\n  I note my friend and colleague, the Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, \nwhen he was chairman of the Health and Human Resources Committee, we \nworked together to try to help make sure the FDA would get the kind of \nresources to modernize itself and develop the kinds of technology to \ndeal with a number of these issues.\n  I know of Dr. Crawford's concern for these problems and look forward \nto working with him to address them. I also commend Senator Murray and \nSenator Clinton for their leadership in addressing the FDA's refusal to \nact on Plan B. Thanks to their leadership, the FDA has committed to \nmaking a decision on this application by September 1. I commend \nSecretary Leavitt and Dr. Crawford for this commitment.\n  I commend Chairman Enzi of the HELP Committee, who both in committee \nand on the floor has been even handed yet persistent in pursuing Dr. \nCrawford's nomination to be Commissioner. Once again, he has shown the \nleadership that will serve our committee well. I look forward to \nworking with him to assist Dr. Crawford and the agency in its important \npublic health work.\n  Dr. Crawford is well qualified to be Commissioner. He deserves to \nhave full authority as Commissioner. It is time for the Senate to give \nhim the title as well as the responsibility. I support his \nconfirmation. I urge my colleagues to do so as well and I look forward \nto working with him in the years ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Utah, \nMr. Hatch, a former chairman of the committee that handles this. He has \nhandled these confirmations before.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the nomination \nof Dr. Lester Crawford for the Commissioner of Food and Drugs.\n  I am pleased that the Senate is finally considering Dr. Crawford's \nnomination and urge my colleagues to support his nomination.\n  I want to stress that tonight's vote is extremely important--not only \nfor the FDA--but for all Americans.\n  FDA needs a permanent Commissioner--in fact, the agency has not had a \nCommissioner since May 2004.\n  The FDA needs someone to lead on important matters where the agency \nhas oversight--such as drug safety, food safety, approval for drugs and \nmedical devices, and counteracting biological attacks.\n  Dr. Crawford is that man.\n  Since Dr. Crawford has been the Acting Commissioner of the FDA, he \nhas had many accomplishments of considerable note.\n  Under his leadership, the FDA has undergone the most significant \nconsolidation of FDA expertise in history with the physical facility \nmoves to the Harvey Wiley building--the FDA's Center for Food Safety & \nApplied Nutrition near University of Maryland--and the White Oak \ncampus.\n  As a result of Dr. Crawford's personal intervention and involvement, \nthe most at-risk Americans were able to receive a safe and effective \nflu vaccine last year during the shortage crisis.\n  Dr. Crawford steered the FDA through one of the most difficult times \nin its history with the various drug safety issues of last year \nresulting in the creation of a new Drug Safety Oversight Board and Drug \nWatch internet page for consumers. This is a landmark milestone in drug \nsafety and a paradigm shift for the FDA to one of openness and \ntransparency.\n  Dr. Crawford has led the FDA on a series of important decisions that \nhave transformed the regulation of food in the United States.\n  Under his leadership, the FDA fully implemented the Bioterrorism Act \nof 2002 a law that helps make our food supply safe on a daily basis. We \nhave much more work to do and I am pleased to say you are helping to \nlead in that regard, Mr. President, and I am very appreciative of that.\n  Dr. Crawford implemented a risk management plan for the shell eggs \nindustry that reduces dramatically the probability of salmonella.\n\n[[Page S8405]]\n\n  Dr. Crawford is personally responsible for the complete overhaul and \nreform of good manufacturing practices for drugs, foods, and dietary \nsupplements. When all of these major regulations are fully implemented, \nDr. Crawford will be successful in creating the best quality control \nsystem in the world for regulating these consumer products.\n  Most recently, he assured me that the agency's final action on \ndietary supplement GMPs will be forthcoming in the near future. I \nwelcomed his decision and the finality he has promised to this long \noverdue process.\n  Dr. Crawford has overseen user fee programs for both medical devices \nand veterinary drugs.\n  Dr. Crawford has led the agency in the development of the ``critical \npath'' that promotes a plan for bringing novel discoveries to market \nthrough the FDA system to fight such diseases as cancer.\n  I am convinced that Dr. Crawford is the best person for the job and \nthe sooner we get him confirmed, the better.\n  On a personal note, I have known Dr. Crawford for many years.\n  He is a man of integrity.\n  He is a strong leader.\n  He is accessible.\n  He is someone who understands both science and public policy.\n  I believe that Dr. Crawford has all the qualities necessary to be the \nbest Commissioner the FDA has ever had.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of Dr. Crawford today, a vote \nso long overdue.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Iowa, \nMr. Grassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have considered Dr. Crawford's \nexperience and performance on the job for well over a year now. In \nfact, Dr. Crawford has been the man in charge at FDA since I began \ntaking a hard look at the FDA. It has been a long year for the FDA and \nI have taken a long look at Dr. Crawford's efforts to address FDA's \nproblems.\n  I know Dr. Crawford is intimately familiar with how the FDA operates. \nHe has twice served as acting Commissioner, most recently since March \n2004, and his lengthy service at the FDA is commendable. Dr. Crawford \nand I have met on a couple occasions. He is a gentleman and seems to \nhave the best of intentions. He told me personally that he understands \nthere are problems at the FDA that need to be fixed. I believed at one \npoint that he was capable of fixing those problems. However, as the \nsaying goes, ``the proof is in the pudding.'' Today, I am here to say \nthat I cannot vote for Dr. Crawford to be the next Commissioner of the \nFDA.\n  During the last 18 months, this country's confidence in the FDA has \nbeen shaken. It has been shaken not because of one isolated incident or \none isolated whistleblower. It has been shaken because multiple drug \nsafety concerns have been exposed by more than one courageous \nwhistleblower. My oversight of the FDA leads me to the conclusion that \nthere are cultural and systemic problems at the FDA. Unfortunately, Dr. \nCrawford has long been part of that same culture and system. The \nevidence is overwhelming that the FDA must change to better protect the \nAmerican people. Dr. Crawford does not appear willing to be the man to \nchange the FDA.\n  During Dr. Crawford's tenure, I have witnessed the suppression of the \nscientific process and the muzzling of scientific dissent. First, with \nDr. Mosholder finding a link between anti-depressants, children and \nsuicide. And second with Dr. Graham's allegations regarding the FDA, \nVioxx and post-marketing safety generally. Dr. Graham's testimony \nbefore the Finance Committee suggests that the problems are systemic. \nOversight of the FDA exposed the cozy relationship that exists between \nthe FDA and the drug industry. It revealed that the FDA negotiated for \nalmost 2 years with Merck about how to change the Vioxx label so people \nwould know about the risk of heart attacks.\n  But the problems are not isolated to the Center for Drug Evaluation \nand Research. My staff continues to interview FDA staff across the \nagency, employees who are doing important work on drugs, devices, and \nbiologics. It is becoming more and more obvious to me that FDA is \nplagued by structural, personnel, cultural, and scientific problems. \nThose problems should be equally obvious to Dr. Crawford. But under the \nleadership of Dr. Crawford, the FDA appears to be in a state of denial. \nOver the past 18 months, Dr. Crawford has not stepped up to the plate. \nI have seen no recognition of the depth and breadth of the problems at \nthe FDA. I have only seen a few short-term band-aids.\n  The systemic problems at the FDA demand visionary leadership. Dr. \nCrawford has not shown me that he is the leader to fix the FDA.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise in favor of the nomination of Dr. \nLester Crawford to be the Commissioner of the Food and Drug \nAdministration. I do this because I believe it is important for the FDA \nto have stable, permanent leadership at this critical time in its \nhistory. Dr. Crawford has valuable experience both in and out of \ngovernment and has a background that makes him qualified for this \nposition.\n  I want to highlight several issues where I would like to work with \nDr. Crawford in the future. First, Congress passed the Dietary \nSupplement Health and Education Act, DSHEA, in 1994 to ensure the \navailability and safety of dietary supplements that millions of \nAmericans rely on. Under the leadership of Dr. Crawford as Acting \nCommissioner, FDA has made significant progress in implementing and \nenforcing it. There is still work to be done on this issue, and I look \nforward to continuing to work with FDA to fully implement DSHEA, and to \nmake sure that U.S. consumers have access to safe, effective, and \naffordable dietary supplements. ,\n  Second, given the Nation's obesity epidemic, I appreciate the efforts \nDr. Crawford and the agency are making to improve consumer education \nand information regarding nutrition choices. I urge Dr. Crawford to \nfollow-up and implement recommendations contained in the FDA report on \nobesity, ``Calories Count.'' In particular, Dr. Crawford should direct \nthe entire restaurant industry to follow the recommendation to develop \na nationwide and point-of-sale nutrition information campaign for \nconsumers to include information on calories.\n  However, I am also voting in favor of Dr. Crawford's nomination in \nfull support of the efforts of my colleagues, Senators Murray and \nClinton, to obtain a commitment from Dr. Crawford prior to his \nconfirmation that the FDA will act promptly and in a scientifically \nappropriate manner on the sale of emergency contraception. I understand \nthey have secured that commitment. I share Senator Murray's and Senator \nClinton's concern about the FDA's handling of the application for over-\nthe-counter sale of emergency contraception, or the ``morning after'' , \npill. There is absolutely no dispute that emergency contraception is \nsafe and effective. The FDA's own advisory panel concluded unanimously \nin December 2004 that emergency contraception was both safe and \neffective. I strongly disagree with the FDA's decision last year to \ndeny over the counter status to emergency contraception. Over the \ncounter sale is about prevention. The morning after pill prevents the \nneed for abortions, a goal that every Member of this body supports.\n  I am voting in favor of Dr. Crawford today. However, with this vote, \nI urge the FDA to address some fundamental challenges facing it in the \nfuture. The FDA must continue to take action to address post-market \nsafety of the drugs it approves. In several high profile cases, the \npublic's trust in the agency has been eroded. I look forward to working \nwith Dr. Crawford on safety issues in the future.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nLester Crawford to serve as Commissioner of the Food and Drug \nAdministration, FDA. The FDA has been without a permanent director for \ntoo long. I believe Lester Crawford is qualified to head the FDA and \nhope the establishment of permanent leadership can put to rest some of \nthe uncertainty and delayed decisions that have been plaguing the \nagency for the last year.\n\n[[Page S8406]]\n\n  While I remain concerned about resistance by the FDA to allow the \nreimportation of prescription drugs to ensure that our seniors have \naccess to affordable prescription drugs, I have expressed my concerns \nto Dr. Crawford. The reality is that drug importation is already \nhappening. It's time to stop defending the status quo and setting up \nnew roadblocks, and I am hopeful that Dr. Crawford will work with \nCongress to give Americans the price relief and safety assurances they \nneed.\n  I am also hopeful that the appointment of Dr. Crawford will help \nrestore the agency's focus on ensuring that safe and effective drugs \nreach the market in a timely manner, and that recent issues that have \nplagued the FDA, such as questions regarding drug safety, advisory \ncommittee conflicts of interest and drug advertisements, to name only a \nfew, will be addressed.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the nomination of \nLester Crawford to be Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.\n  The FDA is a vitally important agency, charged with ensuring that the \nproducts we rely on for our health and well-being are safe and \neffective. Having a strong leader at the helm is essential to a well-\nfunctioning agency.\n  Ultimately, after weighing the facts and considering the events that \nhave occurred under Dr. Crawford's watch as Acting Commissioner, I came \nto the conclusion that I cannot support this nominee.\n  As I said during Dr. Crawford's confirmation hearing and during the \nHELP Committee's consideration of his nomination, Dr. Crawford's tenure \nat the FDA has been marked by controversy. The agency has faced \nscrutiny over its response to various crises: the failure to adequately \nwarn us of the possibility of an influenza vaccine shortage, the \nfailure to heed concerns about drug safety raised by both agency \nemployees and outside scientists, and the failure to adequately \nseparate science from what is viewed as ideology-driven decisionmaking.\n  As a result, public confidence in the ability of the FDA to ensure \nthe safety and efficacy of drugs is failing. The dedicated scientists \nand civil servants who work at the agency are losing morale. They have \nclearly identified the need for reform, for change, and for \nimprovements at the agency.\n  In December 2004, the Office of the Inspector General of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services released the results of a \nsurvey that found two-thirds of FDA scientists do not believe the \nagency adequately monitors the safety of prescription drugs.\n  In March 2005, Dr. Sandra Kweder, Deputy Director of the Office of \nNew Drugs at the FDA, testified that it ``would be helpful'' to change \nFDA authority, and give them the power to require changes in drug \nlabels, rather than have to negotiate such changes in a lengthy back-\nand-forth process with manufacturers.\n  And just last week, Dr. Janet Woodcock, Deputy Commissioner of \nOperations at the agency, told an Institute of Medicine panel:\n\n       This system has obviously broken down to some extent, as \n     far as the fully informed provider and the fully informed \n     patient.\n\n  But Dr. Crawford's response to these concerns has been less than \nadequate. He has maintained that the agency ``is fully capable of \ncarrying out its mission under its current regulatory and statutory \nauthority,'' despite statements and evidence to the contrary from both \nthose inside and outside the agency.\n  His attempts to address the clear issues faced by the agency have \nbeen inadequate to the task. For example, despite his November 2004 \nannouncement that the FDA would fill the position of Director of Office \nof Drug Safety, this position is still vacant--at a time when concerns \nover drug safety have been at the forefront of news about the FDA.\n  At a time when the FDA needs a strong leader to restore its \nreputation, Dr. Crawford represents an unacceptable status quo. I fear \nthat his record demonstrates that he lacks the vision and the drive \nnecessary to ensure that the FDA is the gold standard of drug \nregulation. He has failed to address the concerns raised by his own \nemployees about the needs of the agency. And he cannot provide \nassurances that the FDA will place science, not ideology or other \ninterests, as the cornerstone of its decisionmaking.\n  In addition, I am deeply concerned about the interference of personal \nbeliefs over science in the decisionmaking process surrounding \nemergency contraception. By now, the details are all too familiar: the \nFDA's scientific advisory committees voted 23 to 4 in favor of the drug \nbeing made available over the counter. More than 70 organizations, \nincluding the American Academy of Physicians, American Associations of \nFamily Physicians, American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists, \nand the American Medical Association, submitted testimony in support of \nPlan B being made available over the counter.\n  Press reports later revealed that internal FDA memos indicated that \ncareer professionals at the agency had recommended unconditional \napproval of the application. And according to a May 8, 2004, article in \nthe New York Times, several former FDA officials said they ``could not \nremember another instance in which Dr. Galson, a career officer in the \npublic health service or any of his predecessors had overruled both an \nadvisory committee and staff recommendations.''\n  In May, both The Nation and the Washington Post reported that Dr. \nHager, a member of the Reproductive Health Advisory Committee, had \nstated, on videotape that he was asked to write a minority report \narguing that Plan B should not be made available over the counter.\n  And the result, up until Friday, was foot dragging by the FDA. That \nis why my colleague, Senator Murray, and I felt it necessary to hold up \nDr. Crawford's nomination. We wanted to send a strong message that the \nFDA needed to act on this application, which it has had for more than 2 \nyears. We believed, and still do, that the American people have a right \nto an answer.\n  On Friday, we received a letter stating that the FDA would make a \ndecision on Barr Laboratory's application to move Plan B to over-the-\ncounter status by September 1, 2005. This is a giant step forward, but \nit does not erase the missteps under Dr. Crawford's watch.\n  That is why I cannot in good faith support Dr. Crawford to be \nCommissioner of the FDA. Like so many Members of this body, I want the \nFDA to have a permanent Commissioner, and I think it is high time for \nthat. But that Commissioner must be someone who can restore the drug \napproval and safety processes to the gold standard that the New Yorkers \nwho I represent and the Americans who rely on this process for their \nhealth and, even their lives, deserve.\n  I vote ``nay'' and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise before you today to discuss the \nnomination of Lester Crawford as Commissioner of the FDA.\n  I first want to say that I love the FDA. FDA is in my home State of \nMaryland. It employs over 10,000 of my constituents. It is right down \nthe road from the NIH. I am proud to have all that research at NIH, and \nthen have FDA in Maryland standing up for the food safety of the \nAmerican people, looking out to make sure that the drugs and the \ntechnologies that we use are safe.\n  Over the years I have fought for the right facilities, the right \nresources, and now the right leadership at the FDA. But I tell you, \ntoday is a very sad day for me because I cannot bring myself to support \nLester Crawford as the Commissioner, and it is because I am so \nenthusiastic about FDA.\n  While I agree the agency has needed someone in charge, Dr. Crawford \nhas not been in charge. His stewardship of the agency going back to \n2002 has been both tepid and passive.\n  For example, under Dr. Crawford's leadership, the drug Vioxx was \nfound to have increased risk of heart attacks long before FDA took any \naction. FDA was slow to reveal the knowledge of increased rates of \nsuicides among teenagers taking antidepressants. There was delay. There \nis the politicizing of science as exemplified by the endless dispute \nover emergency contraception. And then there has been a ``just say no'' \nattitude to imported drugs.\n  And all of those people looking at homeland security tell us that our \nfood supply is vulnerable to terrorist attacks. And what do we get from \nthe FDA? We get passivity.\n\n[[Page S8407]]\n\n  I am particularly concerned about the issue of drug safety. The FDA \nhas been and must remain the gold standard in maintaining drug safety. \nYet today there is a crisis of confidence over drug safety in the \npublic's mind. At Dr. Crawford's nomination hearing in the HELP \nCommittee earlier this year, he suggested that the newly formed Drug \nSafety Board within the FDA will be a way to guarantee this safety. I \nasked him how he could guarantee this board--which will exist within \nthe FDA--will be able to provide independent review.\n  He gave me the bureaucratic answer and bureaucratic structure. I \nasked if he would be in charge of this important guarantee. He said \n``no,'' he was going to delegate that to an Assistant Commissioner. I \nasked ``Why?'' He said: ``Because I would have to be involved in \npersonnel and budgets.'' Well--that is his job, isn't it? That is \nexactly the kind of answer we are talking about. You cannot preside \nover FDA. You have to run FDA.\n  The nations of the world that cannot afford it look to our FDA to be \nthe gold standard. Physicians and other allied health people who are \nprescribing drugs or using technologies need to know that they have an \nFDA that they can count on. And also we, the patients of the United \nStates of America, need to know that we can count on the FDA. And the \npharmaceutical industry has to have an FDA that provides evenhanded \nregulatory authority. That is why I cannot support Lester Crawford as \nCommissioner.\n  It is with great reluctance that I have come to this decision, but it \nis because I love FDA and its mission, and know that the people of \nAmerica are counting on it. Whether you are a doctor, or whether you \nare a patient, we need the FDA, and we need strong leadership. \nTherefore, regretfully, and reluctantly, and sadly, I am going to vote \n``nay''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  I thank everybody who has made comments today. I wish to address the \nlast few comments that were made because our committee has oversight \nover the Food and Drug Administration. We are concerned about any \nsituation that would give people less than full confidence in the \nmedicines they are taking.\n  What we have been faced with for the last 18 months, which has been \nmentioned, is kind of giving a person a job. We have not given him the \njob, we have kind of given him the job. Anybody who has read \ntranscripts from previous confirmation hearings would know that this is \nan extremely difficult position to ever get confirmed from. There are a \nlot of viewpoints from both sides. We have to have somebody in charge \nwho has full authority, who has the right to look at the science and \nmake decisions, who has full authority to make structural changes. I \nwould say that Senator Kennedy and I have been looking at that, doing \nthe oversight.\n  With respect to drug safety, I want my colleagues to know that I take \nthe recent drug safety concerns seriously. Senator Kennedy and I are \nworking together with our fellow committee members to develop \ncomprehensive FDA drug safety legislation in this Congress and to bring \nthat bill before the Senate so there can be those changes.\n  We will act, but we will act in a way that is mindful of the \nimportance of weighing the risks of drugs and the benefits of the drugs \non the same scale. Every drug has risks, and we would do the American \npeople a grave disservice if we overreact to recent controversies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Iowa that the Vioxx \nincident was an important failure for FDA. But that was not the failure \nof Dr. Crawford or even of FDA. The main problem is the FDA does not \nhave the resources necessary to do the kind of work that is required. \nIt happens to be the case. The main problem at FDA is one of resources. \nThe FDA does not have the money it needs to address drug safety, to do \nthe monitoring of drugs, the post-approval surveillance that it should. \nThe Office of Drug Safety needs better computers and better access to \nthe databases that are out there that can tell us about how drugs are \nbeing used and what happens when they are used. Congress needs to give \nthe FDA more resources to do this.\n  With respect to the antidepressants, the FDA quite legitimately \nworked to better understand the issue before it required the label \nchange. With respect to the Vioxx label change, the Senator is correct \nthat it took too long, but that is because we in Congress have not \ngiven FDA the authority to require label changes. We need to change \nthat.\n  The FDA does not have all of the kinds of authority it needs to \nregulate drugs after they are approved. I will be glad to work with the \nSenator from Iowa because, as one who has been interested since I have \nbeen in the Senate about strengthening the FDA, we have not given them \nthe authority and the power to be able to do that kind of job.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Isn't it true we passed the FDA revitalization bill back \nin 1989 to create this central campus where we could have the best \nstate-of-the-art equipment? We had 48 different locations where FDA was \nlocated all over the greater Washington area; is that true?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. We have treated the FDA like a wicked stepsister instead \nof giving it the money it needs. It handles more than 25 percent of all \nconsumer products in America, right?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. No matter who is FDA Commissioner, under those \ncircumstances it is very difficult to get a handle on everything that \nneeds to be addressed by the FDA.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. I look forward to the \nopportunity of working with the Senator from Utah, the Senator from \nWyoming, and the Senator from Iowa. We ought to give this agency the \nauthority, the power and the responsibility, as well as the resources \nto use it effectively. I know under Chairman Enzi we will have the \noversight to make sure the agency is doing what it should.\n  But I do believe this nominee deserves to be the Commissioner. I \nthink it is about time we have a Commissioner. Then let's all work \ntogether to make sure he and the agency meet his and its \nresponsibilities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, as we move to a vote on the nomination of \nDr. Lester Crawford to serve as Commissioner of Food and Drugs, I want \nto remind my colleagues of the important role the Food and Drug \nAdministration plays in protecting and promoting the public health.\n  The FDA's mission is broad. The FDA regulates food, drugs, biologics, \nmedical devices, animal feed, and cosmetics. The FDA regulates \neverything from cellular phones to cell tissue and gene therapies. In \nfact, Americans spend more than 25 cents of every dollar on products \nregulated by the FDA.\n  And as science progresses, the challenges of regulation grow. For \ninstance, the FDA regulates a host of new products that blur the FDA's \ntraditional boundaries. Today, the FDA is charged with regulating drug-\ndelivery devices, such as coronary stents coated with drugs that \ncontribute to keeping arteries open. Then there are next- generation \northopedic implants with biologic products built into them to stimulate \ntissue growth.\n  All of these new innovations require a nimble and responsive agency \nto regulate them, and they require resources to match. Today, in fact, \nSenator Kennedy and I are introducing legislation to protect and \nstrengthen a critical user-fee program. This program provides FDA with \na stable stream of revenues to support the agency's mission to review \nand approve new medical devices. Without our action, that program would \nexpire at the end of this fiscal year.\n  I believe that is just one expression of bipartisan support for FDA. \nIs FDA perfect? Of course not. FDA is staffed by human beings, and from \ntime to time they make mistakes--as do we all.\n  But the FDA plays a critical role in our Nation's public health, and \nan important agency such as FDA needs to\n\n[[Page S8408]]\n\nhave a strong leader with the power vested in him by Presidential \nnomination and Senate confirmation.\n  So I urge my colleagues to accept the President's nominee, Dr. Lester \nCrawford, and to vote to confirm him as the next Commissioner of Food \nand Drugs.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield another minute? Am I right, we \nhave until a quarter of?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has a minute 20 \nseconds remaining, the Senator from Massachusetts has 2 minutes 40 \nseconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. May I ask the Senator for a minute?\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Seeing who is in the chair, does the Senator not agree \nwith me that one of the additional important responsibilities of the \nFDA is going to be bioterrorism? We are going to need a Commissioner at \nthe FDA to lead this important work to prepare us against a \nbioterrorist attack. That is going to be enormously important. The HELP \nCommittee has had our recent briefings on this issue, and bioterrorism \nis certainly an important area on which we will need the leadership of \nthe FDA. I know the Senator from Wyoming is concerned about this \nbioterrorism, and the BioShield legislation, to make sure we have the \nvaccines and other medical products on line to respond to the dangers \nof bioterrorism. Bioterrorism is a pressing area in which we are going \nto have to work, and we need a leader at FDA to help us.\n  Mr. ENZI. The Senator is absolutely correct. The Presiding Officer is \nchairing that subcommittee and holding extensive hearings on that and \nbringing together some great experts to help us resolve that.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield also for just a moment? We \nintroduced the bioshield II, the Lieberman-Hatch bill that has gone a \nlong way to resolving this matter, and I intend to work with the \nSenator from North Carolina and the distinguished chairman and ranking \nmember to see if we can bring this to a conclusion that works.\n  I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield any remaining time we have. I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second. The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent \nto the nomination of Lester M. Crawford, of Maryland, to be \nCommissioner of Food and Drugs, Department of Health and Human \nServices. On this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Oklahoma (Mr. Coburn), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. \nMcCain), and the Senator from Alaska (Ms. Murkowski).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nCorzine), the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd), and the Senator from \nArkansas (Mrs. Lincoln) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn).

CRAWFORD TO BE COMMISSIONER OF FOOD AND DRUGS, \n                DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to executive session to consider Executive Calendar No. 172, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Lester M. Crawford, of \nMaryland, to be Commissioner of Food and Drugs, Department of Health \nand Human Services.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 30 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to the vote.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  I rise to discuss the pending nomination of Dr. Lester Crawford to be \nthe Commissioner of Food and Drugs. I particularly thank all of the \npeople who have been involved in this nomination process. It has been a \ngreat bipartisan effort. It has been thoroughly explored and we finally \nare at a point where we can have an actual FDA Commissioner approved. \nIt will be a tremendous relief to me and to the Nation, I am sure.\n  I particularly want to thank Senator Kennedy for his efforts in \nproceeding through the different hearings that we have had and all of \nthe other work that we have had to do. The Food and Drug Administration \nis tasked with the broad and critical mission of protecting public \nhealth. The FDA Commissioner is in charge of an agency that regulates \n$1 trillion worth of products a year.\n  The agency ensures the safety and effectiveness of all drugs and \nbiological products like vaccines, medical devices, and animal drugs \nand feed. It also oversees the safety of a vast variety of food \nproducts as well as medical and consumer products, including cosmetics.\n  In addition, the Commissioner is responsible for advancing the public \nhealth by helping to speed innovations in its mission areas and by \nhelping the public get accurate, science-based information on medicines \nand foods. The FDA has been without a confirmed Commissioner for more \nthan a year.\n  In January of this year, 17 members of the Senate Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions sent a bipartisan letter to the \nPresident urging him to nominate a Commissioner to provide the agency \nwith greater clarity and certainty in its mission to protect our food \nand drug supplies. Recent breakthroughs in medical science and \ntechnology show how quickly science and technology are changing our \nlives each and every day.\n  The FDA is at a critical point in its history. The potential benefits \nfrom our medical research are staggering. A fully confirmed FDA \nCommissioner is essential to ensuring that these medical breakthroughs \ncan be brought to the market safely and effectively. Consumers deserve \nto have a fully functional FDA that can oversee the industry with \nconfidence and authority and harness the technical achievements that \ncan improve and save lives.\n  I believe the President's nominee, Dr. Lester Crawford, has the right \nqualifications to lead the FDA and to bring about the necessary reforms \nto maintain consumer confidence in our Nation's drug safety. Clearly we \nneed someone at the helm of the FDA who can direct the agency and work \nwith Congress to find the answers to these and many other difficult \nissues that will continue to come before us.\n  Dr. Crawford has been Acting Commissioner of FDA since March of 2004. \nHe has a long and distinguished career in private and public service. \nHe worked at the FDA in other capabilities before joining the agency \nagain in 2002.\n  The show of support for Dr. Crawford's nomination has been strong. In \nthe runup to Dr. Crawford's confirmation hearing in March, my committee \nreceived letters of support from more than 100 individuals and \norganizations. It is high time we had this debate and this vote. We \nwaited many months for President Bush to send us a qualified nominee \nfor the post.\n  In response to our bipartisan letter to the President, the President \nnominated Dr. Crawford. We have waited long enough. I think we can all \nagree that we need a strong leader at the FDA right now and one who has \na mandate to act. We must be forward looking. There are many items \nbefore the FDA that require the immediate attention of an FDA \nCommissioner vested with full authority.\n  The authority flows directly from the act of Senate confirmation. \nWithout a Senate-confirmed leader, we cannot expect the FDA to be as \neffective as we need it to be.\n  Dr. Crawford's nomination was reported favorably out of the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor and Pensions on June 15. So I am pleased \nthat we are now ready to confirm Dr. Crawford so that he can take \ncharge, take action, and take responsibility for leading the FDA in the \nbest interests of the public health.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I congratulate my friend and chairman of \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions for his \nleadership in ensuring that the Senate will have an opportunity to vote \non Dr. Crawford and, hopefully, approve his nomination.\n  During one time or another during 3 of the last 4 years we have not \nhad a head of the Food and Drug Administration. As Chairman Enzi has \npointed out, this agency has enormous power, influence, and say-so on \nmany of the different issues that affect every family in this country. \nIt regulates food, cosmetics, drugs, medical devices, even televisions \nand cell phones a full quarter of every dollar consumers spend. And FDA \nreally sets the standard for the rest of the world in how it regulates \nthese products. The rest of the world looks to our Food and Drug \nAdministration as the gold standard, and, as Chairman Enzi pointed out, \nwe have not had a permanent Commissioner for 3 of the last 4 years. I \nthink we have suffered because of it.\n  Now we have the opportunity, with Dr. Crawford, to fill that job, and \nI will explain in just a few moments why I think he is eminently \nqualified.\n  I agree with those who believe that we are in the life science \ncentury. We have seen a commitment to the promise of the this century \nby the Congress and by administrations in recent times when we \neffectively doubled the NIH budget. We have seen the sequencing of the \ngene, the progress that we have made with DNA, the real possibility of \nbreakthrough drugs, and the debates we are having on stem cell \nresearch. This is truly the life science century.\n  Quite frankly, the most important position in this life science \ncentury is who is heads the Food and Drug Administration, because we \nwill want to have these breakthrough drugs and other treatments \navailable to people at the earliest possible time, and that is FDA's \njob. We want to make sure these treatments are safe and effective. That \nis going to be an enormous responsibility, but I believe the \npossibilities and the meaning for families will be breathtaking.\n  So that is why this position, and the FDA, is so important. There are \nmany things that we do in this body, and many people who are directly \ninvolved say this or that thing is the most important thing that we are \ngoing to do in the session. Well, this might not be the most important \nthing that is done in this session, but having a responsible, informed, \nenlightened, future-looking, tough-minded administrator at the Food and \nDrug Administration is enormously important for all Americans. That is \nwhat this debate and discussion is about.\n\n[[Page S8404]]\n\n  It has also been about the importance of following science. This is \nenormously important, and I will say an additional word about that. It \nis important for the FDA to have the confidence of the American people \nthat the FDA is calling the important decisions it makes as the science \nreveals that ideology and politics have not become involved.\n  I rise in support of Dr. Crawford to be the Commissioner of the Food \nand Drug Administration. Modern drugs, vaccines, and medical devices \ncan work miracles but only if FDA does its job to see that they are \nsafe and effective. We use food and food products from around the world \nand we count on the FDA to see that they are not contaminated.\n  FDA touches the lives of every American every day. As I said before, \na full quarter of consumer products are regulated by the FDA. That is \nwhy it is so important the FDA have a full-fledged Commissioner. I \nfully support Dr. Crawford's nomination for the position.\n  His impressive record and clear commitment to public health will \nserve the agency well. He has dedicated his life to public service and \nto public health. He is trained as both a veterinarian and a \npharmacologist and has many years of experience in government, \nindustry, and the academic world.\n  His leadership experience at FDA dates back to 1978 when he headed \nthe Center for Veterinary Medicine. Over the years since then, he has \nled the Food Safety and Inspection Service at the Department of \nAgriculture, headed a major association on veterinary medical \neducation, and most recently served as Deputy Commissioner and Acting \nCommissioner of the Food and Drug Administration itself.\n  Under Dr. Crawford's leadership at FDA, we have seen stepped up \nefforts to monitor drug safety and to inform patients and doctors about \nthe risks of drugs. We have recently seen increased scrutiny of drug \nadvertising. FDA also made Herculean efforts to seek and permit the use \nof flu vaccines from other sources after the vaccine shortage last \nyear, and I am hopeful that these efforts will pay off this year and in \nthe following years in new manufacturers of flu vaccine for the U.S. \nmarket.\n  Clearly, more must be done. With a Commissioner in place, we can work \nmuch more effectively on the key issues facing the agency, from how FDA \nmonitors drug safety to ways to address the flu vaccine shortage, to \nhow it handles the conflicts of interest on its advisory committees and \nhow it has acted on Plan B.\n  I intend to work with Chairman Enzi and the other members of our HELP \nCommittee to see that these issues are addressed, to help Dr. Crawford \nmake any changes at the agency that are needed, and to help craft \nlegislation that will allow FDA to do its vital job more effectively.\n  On drug safety, FDA can only request drug companies to take action to \nprotect the public. It is obvious that companies often have conflicts \nof interest and the FDA needs the authority to require better labels \nand insist on clinical trials of drugs already on the market, not just \nrequest them.\n  We need to improve the post-market monitoring of drug safety. \nClinical trials before approval can and do detect many safety problems, \nbut they should not end FDA's responsibility for the safety of drugs \nalready on the market. When needed, new clinical trials should be \nrequired.\n  I just mention at this time that we intend to report out information \ntechnology legislation from the HELP Committee, hopefully this week. \nWith information technology, we will be able to better monitor how \ndrugs are used and the adverse reactions to those drugs, and hopefully \nhave those reports promptly so that we will be able to provide greater \nprotection to the public. That legislation will hopefully come out of \nour committee with a strong bipartisan commitment and with new \nleadership, and the opportunities that are out at the FDA with these \nnew breakthrough drugs, it can make an enormous difference in terms of \nthe quality of health care and the safety of treatments for the \nAmerican people.\n  Above all, FDA needs enough resources to do its job effectively. The \nOffice of Drug Safety does not even have computer systems capable of \nanalyzing data as thoroughly as possible, and it cannot always purchase \naccess to drug usage databases that could identify safety problems. It \ninspects less than 2 percent of imported food, and this much only \nbecause of a large increase in funds to FDA for that purpose after 9/\n11.\n  I note my friend and colleague, the Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, \nwhen he was chairman of the Health and Human Resources Committee, we \nworked together to try to help make sure the FDA would get the kind of \nresources to modernize itself and develop the kinds of technology to \ndeal with a number of these issues.\n  I know of Dr. Crawford's concern for these problems and look forward \nto working with him to address them. I also commend Senator Murray and \nSenator Clinton for their leadership in addressing the FDA's refusal to \nact on Plan B. Thanks to their leadership, the FDA has committed to \nmaking a decision on this application by September 1. I commend \nSecretary Leavitt and Dr. Crawford for this commitment.\n  I commend Chairman Enzi of the HELP Committee, who both in committee \nand on the floor has been even handed yet persistent in pursuing Dr. \nCrawford's nomination to be Commissioner. Once again, he has shown the \nleadership that will serve our committee well. I look forward to \nworking with him to assist Dr. Crawford and the agency in its important \npublic health work.\n  Dr. Crawford is well qualified to be Commissioner. He deserves to \nhave full authority as Commissioner. It is time for the Senate to give \nhim the title as well as the responsibility. I support his \nconfirmation. I urge my colleagues to do so as well and I look forward \nto working with him in the years ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Utah, \nMr. Hatch, a former chairman of the committee that handles this. He has \nhandled these confirmations before.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the nomination \nof Dr. Lester Crawford for the Commissioner of Food and Drugs.\n  I am pleased that the Senate is finally considering Dr. Crawford's \nnomination and urge my colleagues to support his nomination.\n  I want to stress that tonight's vote is extremely important--not only \nfor the FDA--but for all Americans.\n  FDA needs a permanent Commissioner--in fact, the agency has not had a \nCommissioner since May 2004.\n  The FDA needs someone to lead on important matters where the agency \nhas oversight--such as drug safety, food safety, approval for drugs and \nmedical devices, and counteracting biological attacks.\n  Dr. Crawford is that man.\n  Since Dr. Crawford has been the Acting Commissioner of the FDA, he \nhas had many accomplishments of considerable note.\n  Under his leadership, the FDA has undergone the most significant \nconsolidation of FDA expertise in history with the physical facility \nmoves to the Harvey Wiley building--the FDA's Center for Food Safety & \nApplied Nutrition near University of Maryland--and the White Oak \ncampus.\n  As a result of Dr. Crawford's personal intervention and involvement, \nthe most at-risk Americans were able to receive a safe and effective \nflu vaccine last year during the shortage crisis.\n  Dr. Crawford steered the FDA through one of the most difficult times \nin its history with the various drug safety issues of last year \nresulting in the creation of a new Drug Safety Oversight Board and Drug \nWatch internet page for consumers. This is a landmark milestone in drug \nsafety and a paradigm shift for the FDA to one of openness and \ntransparency.\n  Dr. Crawford has led the FDA on a series of important decisions that \nhave transformed the regulation of food in the United States.\n  Under his leadership, the FDA fully implemented the Bioterrorism Act \nof 2002 a law that helps make our food supply safe on a daily basis. We \nhave much more work to do and I am pleased to say you are helping to \nlead in that regard, Mr. President, and I am very appreciative of that.\n  Dr. Crawford implemented a risk management plan for the shell eggs \nindustry that reduces dramatically the probability of salmonella.\n\n[[Page S8405]]\n\n  Dr. Crawford is personally responsible for the complete overhaul and \nreform of good manufacturing practices for drugs, foods, and dietary \nsupplements. When all of these major regulations are fully implemented, \nDr. Crawford will be successful in creating the best quality control \nsystem in the world for regulating these consumer products.\n  Most recently, he assured me that the agency's final action on \ndietary supplement GMPs will be forthcoming in the near future. I \nwelcomed his decision and the finality he has promised to this long \noverdue process.\n  Dr. Crawford has overseen user fee programs for both medical devices \nand veterinary drugs.\n  Dr. Crawford has led the agency in the development of the ``critical \npath'' that promotes a plan for bringing novel discoveries to market \nthrough the FDA system to fight such diseases as cancer.\n  I am convinced that Dr. Crawford is the best person for the job and \nthe sooner we get him confirmed, the better.\n  On a personal note, I have known Dr. Crawford for many years.\n  He is a man of integrity.\n  He is a strong leader.\n  He is accessible.\n  He is someone who understands both science and public policy.\n  I believe that Dr. Crawford has all the qualities necessary to be the \nbest Commissioner the FDA has ever had.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of Dr. Crawford today, a vote \nso long overdue.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Iowa, \nMr. Grassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have considered Dr. Crawford's \nexperience and performance on the job for well over a year now. In \nfact, Dr. Crawford has been the man in charge at FDA since I began \ntaking a hard look at the FDA. It has been a long year for the FDA and \nI have taken a long look at Dr. Crawford's efforts to address FDA's \nproblems.\n  I know Dr. Crawford is intimately familiar with how the FDA operates. \nHe has twice served as acting Commissioner, most recently since March \n2004, and his lengthy service at the FDA is commendable. Dr. Crawford \nand I have met on a couple occasions. He is a gentleman and seems to \nhave the best of intentions. He told me personally that he understands \nthere are problems at the FDA that need to be fixed. I believed at one \npoint that he was capable of fixing those problems. However, as the \nsaying goes, ``the proof is in the pudding.'' Today, I am here to say \nthat I cannot vote for Dr. Crawford to be the next Commissioner of the \nFDA.\n  During the last 18 months, this country's confidence in the FDA has \nbeen shaken. It has been shaken not because of one isolated incident or \none isolated whistleblower. It has been shaken because multiple drug \nsafety concerns have been exposed by more than one courageous \nwhistleblower. My oversight of the FDA leads me to the conclusion that \nthere are cultural and systemic problems at the FDA. Unfortunately, Dr. \nCrawford has long been part of that same culture and system. The \nevidence is overwhelming that the FDA must change to better protect the \nAmerican people. Dr. Crawford does not appear willing to be the man to \nchange the FDA.\n  During Dr. Crawford's tenure, I have witnessed the suppression of the \nscientific process and the muzzling of scientific dissent. First, with \nDr. Mosholder finding a link between anti-depressants, children and \nsuicide. And second with Dr. Graham's allegations regarding the FDA, \nVioxx and post-marketing safety generally. Dr. Graham's testimony \nbefore the Finance Committee suggests that the problems are systemic. \nOversight of the FDA exposed the cozy relationship that exists between \nthe FDA and the drug industry. It revealed that the FDA negotiated for \nalmost 2 years with Merck about how to change the Vioxx label so people \nwould know about the risk of heart attacks.\n  But the problems are not isolated to the Center for Drug Evaluation \nand Research. My staff continues to interview FDA staff across the \nagency, employees who are doing important work on drugs, devices, and \nbiologics. It is becoming more and more obvious to me that FDA is \nplagued by structural, personnel, cultural, and scientific problems. \nThose problems should be equally obvious to Dr. Crawford. But under the \nleadership of Dr. Crawford, the FDA appears to be in a state of denial. \nOver the past 18 months, Dr. Crawford has not stepped up to the plate. \nI have seen no recognition of the depth and breadth of the problems at \nthe FDA. I have only seen a few short-term band-aids.\n  The systemic problems at the FDA demand visionary leadership. Dr. \nCrawford has not shown me that he is the leader to fix the FDA.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise in favor of the nomination of Dr. \nLester Crawford to be the Commissioner of the Food and Drug \nAdministration. I do this because I believe it is important for the FDA \nto have stable, permanent leadership at this critical time in its \nhistory. Dr. Crawford has valuable experience both in and out of \ngovernment and has a background that makes him qualified for this \nposition.\n  I want to highlight several issues where I would like to work with \nDr. Crawford in the future. First, Congress passed the Dietary \nSupplement Health and Education Act, DSHEA, in 1994 to ensure the \navailability and safety of dietary supplements that millions of \nAmericans rely on. Under the leadership of Dr. Crawford as Acting \nCommissioner, FDA has made significant progress in implementing and \nenforcing it. There is still work to be done on this issue, and I look \nforward to continuing to work with FDA to fully implement DSHEA, and to \nmake sure that U.S. consumers have access to safe, effective, and \naffordable dietary supplements. ,\n  Second, given the Nation's obesity epidemic, I appreciate the efforts \nDr. Crawford and the agency are making to improve consumer education \nand information regarding nutrition choices. I urge Dr. Crawford to \nfollow-up and implement recommendations contained in the FDA report on \nobesity, ``Calories Count.'' In particular, Dr. Crawford should direct \nthe entire restaurant industry to follow the recommendation to develop \na nationwide and point-of-sale nutrition information campaign for \nconsumers to include information on calories.\n  However, I am also voting in favor of Dr. Crawford's nomination in \nfull support of the efforts of my colleagues, Senators Murray and \nClinton, to obtain a commitment from Dr. Crawford prior to his \nconfirmation that the FDA will act promptly and in a scientifically \nappropriate manner on the sale of emergency contraception. I understand \nthey have secured that commitment. I share Senator Murray's and Senator \nClinton's concern about the FDA's handling of the application for over-\nthe-counter sale of emergency contraception, or the ``morning after'' , \npill. There is absolutely no dispute that emergency contraception is \nsafe and effective. The FDA's own advisory panel concluded unanimously \nin December 2004 that emergency contraception was both safe and \neffective. I strongly disagree with the FDA's decision last year to \ndeny over the counter status to emergency contraception. Over the \ncounter sale is about prevention. The morning after pill prevents the \nneed for abortions, a goal that every Member of this body supports.\n  I am voting in favor of Dr. Crawford today. However, with this vote, \nI urge the FDA to address some fundamental challenges facing it in the \nfuture. The FDA must continue to take action to address post-market \nsafety of the drugs it approves. In several high profile cases, the \npublic's trust in the agency has been eroded. I look forward to working \nwith Dr. Crawford on safety issues in the future.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nLester Crawford to serve as Commissioner of the Food and Drug \nAdministration, FDA. The FDA has been without a permanent director for \ntoo long. I believe Lester Crawford is qualified to head the FDA and \nhope the establishment of permanent leadership can put to rest some of \nthe uncertainty and delayed decisions that have been plaguing the \nagency for the last year.\n\n[[Page S8406]]\n\n  While I remain concerned about resistance by the FDA to allow the \nreimportation of prescription drugs to ensure that our seniors have \naccess to affordable prescription drugs, I have expressed my concerns \nto Dr. Crawford. The reality is that drug importation is already \nhappening. It's time to stop defending the status quo and setting up \nnew roadblocks, and I am hopeful that Dr. Crawford will work with \nCongress to give Americans the price relief and safety assurances they \nneed.\n  I am also hopeful that the appointment of Dr. Crawford will help \nrestore the agency's focus on ensuring that safe and effective drugs \nreach the market in a timely manner, and that recent issues that have \nplagued the FDA, such as questions regarding drug safety, advisory \ncommittee conflicts of interest and drug advertisements, to name only a \nfew, will be addressed.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the nomination of \nLester Crawford to be Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.\n  The FDA is a vitally important agency, charged with ensuring that the \nproducts we rely on for our health and well-being are safe and \neffective. Having a strong leader at the helm is essential to a well-\nfunctioning agency.\n  Ultimately, after weighing the facts and considering the events that \nhave occurred under Dr. Crawford's watch as Acting Commissioner, I came \nto the conclusion that I cannot support this nominee.\n  As I said during Dr. Crawford's confirmation hearing and during the \nHELP Committee's consideration of his nomination, Dr. Crawford's tenure \nat the FDA has been marked by controversy. The agency has faced \nscrutiny over its response to various crises: the failure to adequately \nwarn us of the possibility of an influenza vaccine shortage, the \nfailure to heed concerns about drug safety raised by both agency \nemployees and outside scientists, and the failure to adequately \nseparate science from what is viewed as ideology-driven decisionmaking.\n  As a result, public confidence in the ability of the FDA to ensure \nthe safety and efficacy of drugs is failing. The dedicated scientists \nand civil servants who work at the agency are losing morale. They have \nclearly identified the need for reform, for change, and for \nimprovements at the agency.\n  In December 2004, the Office of the Inspector General of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services released the results of a \nsurvey that found two-thirds of FDA scientists do not believe the \nagency adequately monitors the safety of prescription drugs.\n  In March 2005, Dr. Sandra Kweder, Deputy Director of the Office of \nNew Drugs at the FDA, testified that it ``would be helpful'' to change \nFDA authority, and give them the power to require changes in drug \nlabels, rather than have to negotiate such changes in a lengthy back-\nand-forth process with manufacturers.\n  And just last week, Dr. Janet Woodcock, Deputy Commissioner of \nOperations at the agency, told an Institute of Medicine panel:\n\n       This system has obviously broken down to some extent, as \n     far as the fully informed provider and the fully informed \n     patient.\n\n  But Dr. Crawford's response to these concerns has been less than \nadequate. He has maintained that the agency ``is fully capable of \ncarrying out its mission under its current regulatory and statutory \nauthority,'' despite statements and evidence to the contrary from both \nthose inside and outside the agency.\n  His attempts to address the clear issues faced by the agency have \nbeen inadequate to the task. For example, despite his November 2004 \nannouncement that the FDA would fill the position of Director of Office \nof Drug Safety, this position is still vacant--at a time when concerns \nover drug safety have been at the forefront of news about the FDA.\n  At a time when the FDA needs a strong leader to restore its \nreputation, Dr. Crawford represents an unacceptable status quo. I fear \nthat his record demonstrates that he lacks the vision and the drive \nnecessary to ensure that the FDA is the gold standard of drug \nregulation. He has failed to address the concerns raised by his own \nemployees about the needs of the agency. And he cannot provide \nassurances that the FDA will place science, not ideology or other \ninterests, as the cornerstone of its decisionmaking.\n  In addition, I am deeply concerned about the interference of personal \nbeliefs over science in the decisionmaking process surrounding \nemergency contraception. By now, the details are all too familiar: the \nFDA's scientific advisory committees voted 23 to 4 in favor of the drug \nbeing made available over the counter. More than 70 organizations, \nincluding the American Academy of Physicians, American Associations of \nFamily Physicians, American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists, \nand the American Medical Association, submitted testimony in support of \nPlan B being made available over the counter.\n  Press reports later revealed that internal FDA memos indicated that \ncareer professionals at the agency had recommended unconditional \napproval of the application. And according to a May 8, 2004, article in \nthe New York Times, several former FDA officials said they ``could not \nremember another instance in which Dr. Galson, a career officer in the \npublic health service or any of his predecessors had overruled both an \nadvisory committee and staff recommendations.''\n  In May, both The Nation and the Washington Post reported that Dr. \nHager, a member of the Reproductive Health Advisory Committee, had \nstated, on videotape that he was asked to write a minority report \narguing that Plan B should not be made available over the counter.\n  And the result, up until Friday, was foot dragging by the FDA. That \nis why my colleague, Senator Murray, and I felt it necessary to hold up \nDr. Crawford's nomination. We wanted to send a strong message that the \nFDA needed to act on this application, which it has had for more than 2 \nyears. We believed, and still do, that the American people have a right \nto an answer.\n  On Friday, we received a letter stating that the FDA would make a \ndecision on Barr Laboratory's application to move Plan B to over-the-\ncounter status by September 1, 2005. This is a giant step forward, but \nit does not erase the missteps under Dr. Crawford's watch.\n  That is why I cannot in good faith support Dr. Crawford to be \nCommissioner of the FDA. Like so many Members of this body, I want the \nFDA to have a permanent Commissioner, and I think it is high time for \nthat. But that Commissioner must be someone who can restore the drug \napproval and safety processes to the gold standard that the New Yorkers \nwho I represent and the Americans who rely on this process for their \nhealth and, even their lives, deserve.\n  I vote ``nay'' and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise before you today to discuss the \nnomination of Lester Crawford as Commissioner of the FDA.\n  I first want to say that I love the FDA. FDA is in my home State of \nMaryland. It employs over 10,000 of my constituents. It is right down \nthe road from the NIH. I am proud to have all that research at NIH, and \nthen have FDA in Maryland standing up for the food safety of the \nAmerican people, looking out to make sure that the drugs and the \ntechnologies that we use are safe.\n  Over the years I have fought for the right facilities, the right \nresources, and now the right leadership at the FDA. But I tell you, \ntoday is a very sad day for me because I cannot bring myself to support \nLester Crawford as the Commissioner, and it is because I am so \nenthusiastic about FDA.\n  While I agree the agency has needed someone in charge, Dr. Crawford \nhas not been in charge. His stewardship of the agency going back to \n2002 has been both tepid and passive.\n  For example, under Dr. Crawford's leadership, the drug Vioxx was \nfound to have increased risk of heart attacks long before FDA took any \naction. FDA was slow to reveal the knowledge of increased rates of \nsuicides among teenagers taking antidepressants. There was delay. There \nis the politicizing of science as exemplified by the endless dispute \nover emergency contraception. And then there has been a ``just say no'' \nattitude to imported drugs.\n  And all of those people looking at homeland security tell us that our \nfood supply is vulnerable to terrorist attacks. And what do we get from \nthe FDA? We get passivity.\n\n[[Page S8407]]\n\n  I am particularly concerned about the issue of drug safety. The FDA \nhas been and must remain the gold standard in maintaining drug safety. \nYet today there is a crisis of confidence over drug safety in the \npublic's mind. At Dr. Crawford's nomination hearing in the HELP \nCommittee earlier this year, he suggested that the newly formed Drug \nSafety Board within the FDA will be a way to guarantee this safety. I \nasked him how he could guarantee this board--which will exist within \nthe FDA--will be able to provide independent review.\n  He gave me the bureaucratic answer and bureaucratic structure. I \nasked if he would be in charge of this important guarantee. He said \n``no,'' he was going to delegate that to an Assistant Commissioner. I \nasked ``Why?'' He said: ``Because I would have to be involved in \npersonnel and budgets.'' Well--that is his job, isn't it? That is \nexactly the kind of answer we are talking about. You cannot preside \nover FDA. You have to run FDA.\n  The nations of the world that cannot afford it look to our FDA to be \nthe gold standard. Physicians and other allied health people who are \nprescribing drugs or using technologies need to know that they have an \nFDA that they can count on. And also we, the patients of the United \nStates of America, need to know that we can count on the FDA. And the \npharmaceutical industry has to have an FDA that provides evenhanded \nregulatory authority. That is why I cannot support Lester Crawford as \nCommissioner.\n  It is with great reluctance that I have come to this decision, but it \nis because I love FDA and its mission, and know that the people of \nAmerica are counting on it. Whether you are a doctor, or whether you \nare a patient, we need the FDA, and we need strong leadership. \nTherefore, regretfully, and reluctantly, and sadly, I am going to vote \n``nay''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  I thank everybody who has made comments today. I wish to address the \nlast few comments that were made because our committee has oversight \nover the Food and Drug Administration. We are concerned about any \nsituation that would give people less than full confidence in the \nmedicines they are taking.\n  What we have been faced with for the last 18 months, which has been \nmentioned, is kind of giving a person a job. We have not given him the \njob, we have kind of given him the job. Anybody who has read \ntranscripts from previous confirmation hearings would know that this is \nan extremely difficult position to ever get confirmed from. There are a \nlot of viewpoints from both sides. We have to have somebody in charge \nwho has full authority, who has the right to look at the science and \nmake decisions, who has full authority to make structural changes. I \nwould say that Senator Kennedy and I have been looking at that, doing \nthe oversight.\n  With respect to drug safety, I want my colleagues to know that I take \nthe recent drug safety concerns seriously. Senator Kennedy and I are \nworking together with our fellow committee members to develop \ncomprehensive FDA drug safety legislation in this Congress and to bring \nthat bill before the Senate so there can be those changes.\n  We will act, but we will act in a way that is mindful of the \nimportance of weighing the risks of drugs and the benefits of the drugs \non the same scale. Every drug has risks, and we would do the American \npeople a grave disservice if we overreact to recent controversies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Iowa that the Vioxx \nincident was an important failure for FDA. But that was not the failure \nof Dr. Crawford or even of FDA. The main problem is the FDA does not \nhave the resources necessary to do the kind of work that is required. \nIt happens to be the case. The main problem at FDA is one of resources. \nThe FDA does not have the money it needs to address drug safety, to do \nthe monitoring of drugs, the post-approval surveillance that it should. \nThe Office of Drug Safety needs better computers and better access to \nthe databases that are out there that can tell us about how drugs are \nbeing used and what happens when they are used. Congress needs to give \nthe FDA more resources to do this.\n  With respect to the antidepressants, the FDA quite legitimately \nworked to better understand the issue before it required the label \nchange. With respect to the Vioxx label change, the Senator is correct \nthat it took too long, but that is because we in Congress have not \ngiven FDA the authority to require label changes. We need to change \nthat.\n  The FDA does not have all of the kinds of authority it needs to \nregulate drugs after they are approved. I will be glad to work with the \nSenator from Iowa because, as one who has been interested since I have \nbeen in the Senate about strengthening the FDA, we have not given them \nthe authority and the power to be able to do that kind of job.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Isn't it true we passed the FDA revitalization bill back \nin 1989 to create this central campus where we could have the best \nstate-of-the-art equipment? We had 48 different locations where FDA was \nlocated all over the greater Washington area; is that true?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. We have treated the FDA like a wicked stepsister instead \nof giving it the money it needs. It handles more than 25 percent of all \nconsumer products in America, right?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. No matter who is FDA Commissioner, under those \ncircumstances it is very difficult to get a handle on everything that \nneeds to be addressed by the FDA.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. I look forward to the \nopportunity of working with the Senator from Utah, the Senator from \nWyoming, and the Senator from Iowa. We ought to give this agency the \nauthority, the power and the responsibility, as well as the resources \nto use it effectively. I know under Chairman Enzi we will have the \noversight to make sure the agency is doing what it should.\n  But I do believe this nominee deserves to be the Commissioner. I \nthink it is about time we have a Commissioner. Then let's all work \ntogether to make sure he and the agency meet his and its \nresponsibilities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, as we move to a vote on the nomination of \nDr. Lester Crawford to serve as Commissioner of Food and Drugs, I want \nto remind my colleagues of the important role the Food and Drug \nAdministration plays in protecting and promoting the public health.\n  The FDA's mission is broad. The FDA regulates food, drugs, biologics, \nmedical devices, animal feed, and cosmetics. The FDA regulates \neverything from cellular phones to cell tissue and gene therapies. In \nfact, Americans spend more than 25 cents of every dollar on products \nregulated by the FDA.\n  And as science progresses, the challenges of regulation grow. For \ninstance, the FDA regulates a host of new products that blur the FDA's \ntraditional boundaries. Today, the FDA is charged with regulating drug-\ndelivery devices, such as coronary stents coated with drugs that \ncontribute to keeping arteries open. Then there are next- generation \northopedic implants with biologic products built into them to stimulate \ntissue growth.\n  All of these new innovations require a nimble and responsive agency \nto regulate them, and they require resources to match. Today, in fact, \nSenator Kennedy and I are introducing legislation to protect and \nstrengthen a critical user-fee program. This program provides FDA with \na stable stream of revenues to support the agency's mission to review \nand approve new medical devices. Without our action, that program would \nexpire at the end of this fiscal year.\n  I believe that is just one expression of bipartisan support for FDA. \nIs FDA perfect? Of course not. FDA is staffed by human beings, and from \ntime to time they make mistakes--as do we all.\n  But the FDA plays a critical role in our Nation's public health, and \nan important agency such as FDA needs to\n\n[[Page S8408]]\n\nhave a strong leader with the power vested in him by Presidential \nnomination and Senate confirmation.\n  So I urge my colleagues to accept the President's nominee, Dr. Lester \nCrawford, and to vote to confirm him as the next Commissioner of Food \nand Drugs.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield another minute? Am I right, we \nhave until a quarter of?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has a minute 20 \nseconds remaining, the Senator from Massachusetts has 2 minutes 40 \nseconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. May I ask the Senator for a minute?\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Seeing who is in the chair, does the Senator not agree \nwith me that one of the additional important responsibilities of the \nFDA is going to be bioterrorism? We are going to need a Commissioner at \nthe FDA to lead this important work to prepare us against a \nbioterrorist attack. That is going to be enormously important. The HELP \nCommittee has had our recent briefings on this issue, and bioterrorism \nis certainly an important area on which we will need the leadership of \nthe FDA. I know the Senator from Wyoming is concerned about this \nbioterrorism, and the BioShield legislation, to make sure we have the \nvaccines and other medical products on line to respond to the dangers \nof bioterrorism. Bioterrorism is a pressing area in which we are going \nto have to work, and we need a leader at FDA to help us.\n  Mr. ENZI. The Senator is absolutely correct. The Presiding Officer is \nchairing that subcommittee and holding extensive hearings on that and \nbringing together some great experts to help us resolve that.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield also for just a moment? We \nintroduced the bioshield II, the Lieberman-Hatch bill that has gone a \nlong way to resolving this matter, and I intend to work with the \nSenator from North Carolina and the distinguished chairman and ranking \nmember to see if we can bring this to a conclusion that works.\n  I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield any remaining time we have. I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second. The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent \nto the nomination of Lester M. Crawford, of Maryland, to be \nCommissioner of Food and Drugs, Department of Health and Human \nServices. On this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Oklahoma (Mr. Coburn), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. \nMcCain), and the Senator from Alaska (Ms. Murkowski).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nCorzine), the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd), and the Senator from \nArkansas (Mrs. Lincoln) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 78, nays 16, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 190 Ex.]\n\n                                YEAS--78\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McConnell\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--16\n\n     Baucus\n     Boxer\n     Cantwell\n     Clinton\n     Dayton\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Grassley\n     Lautenberg\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Obama\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Vitter\n\n                             NOT VOTING--6\n\n     Coburn\n     Corzine\n     Dodd\n     Lincoln\n     McCain\n     Murkowski\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in the Declaration of Independence, one \nreason our Founders decided for a revolution against King George was \n``He has made judges dependent on his will alone.''\n  That same year, the Delaware Declaration of Rights and Fundamental \nRules stated:\n\n       That the independence and uprightness of judges are \n     essential to the impartial administration of justice, and a \n     great security to the rights and liberties of the people.\n\n  In the Federalist Papers, explaining our great Constitution, \nAlexander Hamilton quoted Montesquieu to say:\n\n       There is no liberty, if the power of judging be not \n     separated from the legislative and executive powers.\n\n  It is the independence of the Supreme Court that is at stake in the \ncoming consideration of the Court's next nominee. Our Constitution \nembodies that independence of the Court in its separation of powers, in \nits checks and balances, and in its structure that provides of the \nPresident:\n\n       He shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent \n     of the Senate, shall appoint . . . judges of the Supreme \n     Court.\n\n  The Senate's active advice and consent role in the confirmation of a \nSupreme Court Justice helps to ensure that nominees have the support of \na broad political consensus. The Senate's role helps to ensure that the \nPresident cannot appoint extreme nominees. The Senate's role helps to \nensure that Justices are more independent from the President.\n  Time and time again the history of our Supreme Court has demonstrated \nthe importance of that independence. Time and time again, it has \nmattered that the Supreme Court had brave men and brave women who were \nwilling to rule against the interests of the President. Time and time \nagain, it has mattered that the President had to appoint independent \nthinkers that would withstand the tough scrutiny of the Senate.\n  It mattered that we had an independent court when our Nation was \nyoung, in 1803, when the Supreme Court decided the case of Marbury v. \nMadison. It mattered that we had an independent court so that Chief \nJustice Marshall could write for the Court:\n\n       It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial \n     department [that is the judiciary] to say what the law is. . \n     . . If two laws conflict with each other, the courts must \n     decide on the operation of each. . . . That is the very \n     essence of judicial duty.\n\n  Today, most take for granted this bedrock principle of judicial \nreview set forth in Marbury v. Madison. But recall the plaintiff in \nthat case, William Marbury, challenged President Thomas Jefferson's \nadministration. If the President, Thomas Jefferson, had been able to \nappoint Justices without an effective check by the Senate, then perhaps \nthe President would have been able to appoint Justices who believed as \nhe did--as Jefferson did--when he wrote, in 1820, a letter saying:\n\n       It is a very dangerous doctrine to consider the judges as \n     ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions.\n\n  Just think for a second what that means. President Thomas Jefferson, \nback in 1820, wrote that it was unfortunate and dangerous doctrine to \nconsider judges as the ultimate arbiters of constitutional questions. \nIf it wasn't he, who would it be? Clearly, Thomas Jefferson thought it \nwould be he, the President, not the Supreme Court.\n  Without concern for the Senate's advice and consent, a more recent \nPresident might have appointed a Justice who believed as did former \nAttorney General Edwin Meese, 20 years ago, when Meese argued that the \nSupreme Court's interpretations of the Constitution, in his words, did \nnot establish a ``supreme law of the land.'' That is Edwin Meese, who \nwas U.S. Attorney General 20 years ago. And recall that Attorney \nGeneral Meese asserted that the Reagan administration was free to rely \non its own views on the meaning of the law.\n  That is revolutionary, and I don't use that word unadvisedly. It is a \nlong-established principle that the Constitution is what the Supreme \nCourt says it is. It has to be. The Constitution is not what the \nPresident says it is, it is what the Supreme Court says it is. The \njudiciary is a free, independent, third branch of Government.\n  It also mattered that we had an independent Supreme Court in 1952, \nwhen the Court decided Youngstown Sheet & Tube Company v. Sawyer, \notherwise known as the ``steel seizure case.''\n\n  It was the time of the Korean War, and we faced a steel strike. \nPresident Truman tried to seize the steel companies in order to avert a \nstrike. It mattered that we had an independent Supreme Court so that \nthe Court could rule against President Truman--an independent arbiter \nsaying: No, Mr.\n\n[[Page S8410]]\n\nPresident, that is not proper; the Constitution doesn't permit that.\n  It mattered that Justice Hugo Black was independent enough to write \nfor the majority when he wrote:\n\n       The Constitution limits his [that is, the President's] \n     functions in the lawmaking process to the recommending of \n     laws he thinks wise and the vetoing of laws he thinks bad. \n     And the Constitution is neither silent nor equivocal about \n     who shall make laws which the President is to execute.\n\n  That is very clear. The Supreme Court stood up to the President and \nsaid, Mr. President, that is unconstitutional.\n  It mattered that we had an independent Supreme Court in 1974, when \nthe Court heard U.S. v. Nixon, otherwise known as the Watergate tapes \ncase. Let's go back and review those facts.\n  President Nixon fought against Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski's \nsubpoena to get the Watergate tapes. It mattered that we had an \nindependent Supreme Court, so that the Court could rule against \nPresident Nixon's claim of executive privilege. The President thought \nhe had that privilege. If he had his way, he would determine the rule \nof law in the United States. But, no, we had an independent third \nbranch, the Supreme Court, which ruled that the President in his \ninterpretation of the Constitution was incorrect. In effect, the \nConstitution was standing up for all of us as Americans, protecting our \nrights against Presidents who want to have their way, which Presidents \nwant to do after they are in power after several years.\n  It mattered that Chief Justice Warren Burger was independent enough \nto write for the majority in that case:\n\n       Neither the doctrine of the separation of powers, nor the \n     need for confidentiality of high level communications, \n     without more, can sustain an absolute, unqualified \n     Presidential privilege of immunity from judicial process \n     under all circumstances.\n\n  That, in effect, is what President Nixon was asking for. The Supreme \nCourt stood up for our rights against a President.\n  Earlier, in 1969, on appointing Justice Burger as Chief Justice of \nthe Supreme Court, President Nixon had said:\n\n       Our Chief Justices have probably had more profound and \n     lasting influence on their times and on the direction of the \n     Nation than most Presidents.\n\n  Well, in the time of President Nixon, it certainly mattered that we \nhad an independent Supreme Court.\n  It mattered that we had an independent Supreme Court in 1963. In that \nyear, the Supreme Court decided Gideon v. Wainwright, which upheld the \nright of counsel in State courts for people who could not afford a \nlawyer. A President might not want lawyers questioning the Government's \nprosecutors. Most Presidents don't. It mattered that an independent \nSupreme Court ensured that they can.\n  It mattered that we had an independent Supreme Court in 1964, when \nthat Court decided New York Times v. Sullivan. That case has a standard \nthat public officials, including Presidents, would have to meet to sue \nthose who criticize them for the conduct of their office.\n  It mattered that we had an independent Supreme Court so that the \nCourt could establish a rule against the interest of public officials, \nsomething public officials don't like. That is a standard that we don't \nlike in this body. We don't particularly like it, but people can use \nit. It is the right decision. It makes it uncomfortable at times. The \nCourt could rule that the first amendment protects the publication of \nstatements about public officials, except when made with actual \nmalice--that is, with knowledge that they are false or in reckless \ndisregard of whether or not they are false. That was an independent \nSupreme Court. So it mattered that Justice William Brennan was \nindependent enough to write the majority in that opinion, and he said:\n\n       We hold today that the Constitution delimits a State's \n     power to award damages for libel in actions brought by public \n     officials against critics of their official contact.\n\n  I imagine most Presidents don't like that if the Supreme Court says \nit is necessary in interpreting the Constitution to protect American \nrights.\n  It mattered when we had an independent Supreme Court in 1954 when the \nCourt decided Brown v. Board of Education. A Court that was dependent \non the President might have wanted to skirt that issue of segregation, \nto duck the injustice of racial segregation in our schools.\n  Why do I say that? Because Jim Newton, a Los Angeles Times editor and \nbiographer of Chief Justice Earl Warren, has written that President \nEisenhower, who appointed Chief Justice Warren, tried to influence the \nChief Justice on that landmark case. Newton reports that during the \nperiod when the Court was considering Brown v. Board of Education, \nPresident Eisenhower invited Chief Justice Warren to join him at dinner \nwith a number of guests. That was while that case was pending.\n  It turned out that President Eisenhower had also invited one of the \nlawyers for the Southern States in the Brown case.\n  As the President and Chief Justice stood up from the table--this was \ndinner, remember, with one of the lawyers for the Southern States \nthere, a private dinner, Chief Justice Warren was there, and President \nEisenhower, who appointed Chief Justice Warren, was there--as they \nstood up from the table, the President took the Chief Justice by the \narm. The President motioned to others in the room and then whispered \ninto the Chief Justice's ear: ``These are not bad people.''\n  The President told the Chief Justice that they were only concerned \nabout their ``sweet little girls'' having to sit in school beside \nAfrican-American children.\n  That is what President Eisenhower said at that dinner to Chief \nJustice Warren when Brown v. Board of Education was pending. So it \nmattered that we had a Chief Justice who was independent enough not to \nlisten to the President who appointed him.\n  It mattered that Chief Justice Warren was independent enough to write \nfor the majority:\n\n       We conclude that in the field of public education the \n     doctrine of ``separate but equal'' has no place. Separate \n     educational facilities are inherently unequal.\n\n  On that point, I don't know if it is true or not, but there are many \nscholars who say that the current Chief Justice wrote a memo to his \njudge he was working with when he was a clerk advocating separate but \nequal. That memo did not come out until after the Chief Justice was \nappointed and confirmed by the Senate.\n  We here today can be justifiably proud that America has the oldest \nliving written Constitution. When our Nation's Government was born, our \nConstitution was a novelty. Our Constitution created, in the words \nengraved over the west doorway of this Chamber, ``novus ordo \nseclorum''--``a new order of ages.''\n  As we examine the great variety of governments in the world today, \nAmericans can still have pride that few nations possess such a charter. \nFew nations fervently protect their rights--very few, when you stop to \nthink about it. It is astounding, it is amazing, and we do take it for \ngranted. Few nations so preserve an independent supreme court.\n  Our Constitution is our foundation. It sets forth our basic rights. \nIt preserves our liberties against the eternal danger of the power of \nthe Executive, sometimes against the power of the Congress but many \ntimes against the power of the Executive.\n  Our Constitution preserves precious rights that must be protected, \nand that is why we must act zealously to ensure that the men and women \nwe entrust to guard that valued heritage is truly independent. That is \nwhy we must remember, as Justice Charles Evans Hughes said in 1907:\n\n       [T]he judiciary is the safeguard of our liberty and of our \n     property under the Constitution.\n\n  Our Constitution helps to preserve those rights through an ingenious \nsystem of checks and balances. Time and time again, our Constitution \nsets up structures that require two separate, coequal branches of \nGovernment to work together and agree before the Government can act. \nThese structures were deeply rooted in the spirit of the times, back \nwhen the Constitution was written, that when two work together, one \nwould propose and the other could veto.\n  You can see that spirit in the original clause where the House can \npropose revenue measures, but the Senate can amend them. You can see \nthat spirit in the presentation clause where the Congress can propose \nlegislation but the President can veto it. And you can see\n\n[[Page S8411]]\n\nthat spirit in the nomination clause where the President can nominate \njudges but the Senate can block them. That was the ingenious \ndevelopment in the late 1700s to forge consensus; somebody can propose \nbut the other can oppose. It forces cooperation, it forces consensus, \nit forces a better government.\n  Thus, when the Senate decides whether to confirm a Supreme Court \nnominee, it is not beholden to the concerns of the President but to the \ndeepest concerns and needs of the people. This is particularly true \ngiven lifetime tenure of a Supreme Court Justice and the need for \nJustices to staunchly defend the people's rights and liberties.\n  My colleagues should recall that in the history of our Supreme Court, \n13 Justices have served for more than 30 years. Justice Douglas served \non the Court for more than 36 years, and the Justices appointed since \n1970 have served for an average of 25 years. That is a long time. \nTherefore, it matters that we get good judges. It really matters.\n  Over the years, this has been one of the issues of greatest \nimportance to me as a Senator, and that is why I worked to set up a \nmerit selection system in my State of Montana that is truly apolitical, \ntruly independent, to select the judges for whom I would then recommend \nto the bench.\n  It is very important to me. I said to the people helping me out: I \ndon't care if they are Republicans or Democrats. I don't care if you \nrecommend liberals or conservatives. You just give me the names of \nthree of the very best people in our State who can then serve on the \nFederal bench because they are going to be there a long time, and they \nare so important.\n  I am very proud--twice this happened, and each time the group I put \ntogether, which was totally balanced, came up with three very good \nnames. It was difficult for me in sitting down with each of the three \nto decide who was the best of the three because they were all so good. \nI did the best I could, and I felt the process worked out very well and \nwas of great value to the people of Montana and to the country.\n\n  So it matters that we have an independent judiciary. To ensure we \nhave an independent judiciary, it thus matters that Senators exercise \ntheir independent judgment in the nomination process. Senators should \nnot act as rubberstamps for the President's choice. That would be a \ncomplete abrogation of senatorial responsibility--complete, total.\n  It is our Founders' dream of an independent Supreme Court, helping to \nexercise the Constitution's intricate systems of checks and balances, \nthat is at stake in this nomination process. The Senate's active \ninvolvement in the confirmation of Justices helps to ensure that the \nSupreme Court can lead that independent branch of Government. And in \ncase after case, that independence of the Supreme Court, in turn, has \nensured our personal rights and our liberties. We cannot take that for \ngranted.\n  The Senate can honor that independence by taking its constitutional \nresponsibility to advise and consent very seriously. The Senate can \nhonor that independence by withholding judgment on a nominee until the \nJudiciary Committee has conducted full and fair hearings. And the \nPresident can honor that independence by putting forth a nominee who \nmeets three basic criteria: professional competence, personal \nintegrity, and a view of important issues that is within the mainstream \nof the contemporary judicial thought. And the Senate can honor the \nindependence of the Supreme Court by holding a nominee to each of these \ncriteria before voting on whether to confirm.\n  Let me review those three criteria.\n  First, professional competency: The Supreme Court must not be the \ntesting ground for the development of a jurist's basic values. He \ncannot learn on the job, nor should a Justice require further training. \nThe stakes are simply too high. He must be very professionally \ncompetent on day one.\n  Second, personal integrity: Nominees to our Nation's highest Court \nmust be of the highest caliber.\n  And, third, the nominee should fall within the mainstream of \ncontemporary judicial thought. The next Justice must possess the \nrequisite judicial philosophy to be entrusted with the Court's sweeping \nconstitutional powers.\n  A Senator should not oppose a nominee just because a nominee does not \nshare that Senator's particular judicial philosophy. But the Senate \nmust determine whether a nominee is within the broad mainstream of \njudicial thought--not an idealogue of the far left, not an idealogue of \nthe far right but mainstream.\n  Why? Because that is where America is. Also, we need a Judge who can \nexercise good judgment during the entire time he or she is on the \nCourt. The average tenure since 1970 is 25 years. Times have changed. \nWe don't want an idealogue who has one view or tends to have one view \nbut, rather, somebody who is wise, above the fray, has perspective, \nlistens, has good judgment, deeply understands the history of our \ncountry, especially its beginnings when our Constitution was written.\n  The Senate must determine whether a nominee is committed to the \nprotection of the basic constitutional values of the American people.\n  So what are some of those values? One is the separation of powers of \nour Federal Government, including the independence of the Court itself.\n  Another is freedom of speech. Boy, is that important, stronger in \nthis country than any other on the face of this Earth. It is so \nimportant--so important. It helps make America what it is.\n  Another is freedom of religion, the other side of the establishment \nclause. Freedom of religion, both direct and indirect, so people are \nfree to worship whomever they choose and in whatever manner they wish.\n  Equal opportunity, enshrined in the 14th amendment, is the basic \nbedrock American principle. Again, this is what made this country \ngreat. We are great for a lot of reasons, but one is because people \nwant to come to this country and live. We don't see very many Americans \nheading for the door to get out of America. Americans want to stay in \nAmerica, and other people want to come to America. Why is that? I \nsubmit largely it is opportunity, it is the freedom of opportunity, and \nno discrimination. Anybody who wants to make something out of himself \nor herself in America can. There are some practical limitations \nsometimes, but by and large, if you have the stuff in America, you are \ngoing to get there. It is freedom of opportunity.\n  Another value is personal autonomy, the right to be left alone. That \nis very basic in America when we talk about freedoms in America. They \nare so important. Another freedom is the right to be left alone.\n  Another is an understanding of the basic powers of the Congress to \npass important laws, such as those providing for the protection of the \nenvironment. We are one country. General laws, especially under the \ncommerce clause, are so important so that all of America can share in \nmatters, not just the equal protection clause, but the commerce clause, \nsharing and protecting the environment. It is very important. We are \none country. That is becoming more and more important each passing day.\n  Why? Because of integration and large advances in communication \ntechnologies, all kinds of technologies. We are all so much of the same \ncountry together.\n  Mainstream philosophy matters because some on the extreme would \nargue, as Justice Thomas did last month, that the Constitution's \nestablishment clause in the Bill of Rights does not even apply to the \nStates. Think of that for a moment. Justice Thomas said the \nConstitution's establishment clause in the Bill of Rights--that is the \nfirst amendment--does not even apply to the States.\n  What does that mean? That means States can set up their own laws \nrespecting the establishment of religion. I thought we were one \ncountry. I thought that issue was decided long ago. I thought most of \nthe provisions of the Bill of Rights that applied to the Federal \nGovernment also applied to States. I thought that. I thought we were \nAmerican.\n  To even contemplate the thought of going backward, to even \ncontemplate\n\n[[Page S8412]]\n\nthe thought that the establishment clause does not apply to States in \nand of itself sends shivers, I am sure, down the spines of virtually \nevery American, let alone to advocate it as Justice Thomas has, and my \nrecollection is not once but I think twice.\n  Mainstream philosophy matters because some on the extreme would seek \nto abolish the right to privacy that the Court recognized 40 years ago \nin that famous case of Griswold v. Connecticut. There is an inherent \nright to privacy in the Constitution.\n  Mainstream philosophy matters because some on the extreme would argue \nthat the Congress cannot pass laws such as the Endangered Species Act \nor the Clean Water Act pursuant to the Constitution's commerce clause. \nThey say the commerce clause prevents the Clean Water Act; the commerce \nclause prevents Congress from passing the Endangered Species Act. Think \nfor a moment what that means and how far that could go.\n  Many of us are concerned that this Court is a couple or three steps \naway from if not virtually eliminating the commerce clause and \ntherefore Congress's ability to enact statutes, but going so far in \nthat direction it is going to create havoc in this country. We will \nhave more States doing separate sets of statutes because the commerce \nclause does not apply.\n  Now, come on. Stop and think a second. That is revolutionary. Yet \nthere are many who advocate that in this country, I am sure hoping the \nPresident appoints a nominee with just that view. I will bet dollars to \ndonuts there are many pushing that view upon the President right now.\n  These are extreme views. They are not mainstream. And the stakes are \nhigh. The Senate has a duty to ensure that the nominee will defend \nAmerica's mainstream constitutional values. We have that duty. It is \nour responsibility as Senators.\n  It is only fitting that the Senate set a very high standard. It is \nonly fitting that the Senate distinguish Supreme Court nominations from \nother nominations, especially those for administrative positions. \nAdministrative positions, that is the President's team, in deference to \nthe President having his own people. We are not talking about the \njudicial branch. There is no deference to have your own people because \nwe have established we want independent people. We want one's own \npeople. We do not want the President's own people. We do not want the \nCongress's own people. We want independent people who are in and of \nthemselves their own people.\n  It is so important the Senate act with very high standards. Because \nof the importance of an independent Supreme Court, the President is not \nentitled to have the Senate confirm his nominee. There is no \nentitlement there.\n  With some sadness, I have noted over the last several years that that \ntrend is developing. It is becoming almost assumed that the Senate must \nconfirm the President's nominee, that the President has that right. \nThere is no right. The right is for the American people to stand up \nunder the Constitution and do what is right for their people. And, yes, \nsupport a nominee who is truly independent, has personal integrity and \nis competent but, no, not support a nominee for the Supreme Court who \ndoes not have those requisite criteria. That is what is right. The \nSenate must set a very high standard.\n  The next Supreme Court Justice will affect all of us and our \nchildren. This Justice will exercise extraordinary power. We must \nensure that Justice's independence.\n  The independence of the Supreme Court is a doctrine with deep roots \nin the history of our Nation. In 1765, the great British legal jurist, \nSir William Blackstone, published his Commentaries, a book that was \nwell read by our Founders. Every law student in America knows about \nBlackstone. Blackstone wrote:\n\n       In this distinct and separate existence of the judicial \n     power, in a . . . body of men, nominated indeed, but not \n     removable at pleasure, by the crown, consists one main \n     preservative of public liberty; which cannot subsist long \n     in any state, unless the administration of common justice \n     be in some degree separated both from the legislative and \n     also from the executive power.\n\n  In explaining our newly minted Constitution, Alexander Hamilton wrote \nin Federalist No. 78:\n\n       [T]he judiciary is beyond comparison the weakest of the \n     three departments of power. . . .[T]hough individual \n     oppression may now and then proceed from the courts of \n     justice, the general liberty of the people can never be \n     endangered from that quarter; I mean so long as the judiciary \n     remains truly distinct from both the legislature and the \n     Executive. For I agree, that ``there is no liberty, if the \n     power of judging be not separated from the legislative and \n     executive powers.''\n\n  That says we in Congress cannot have our people on the Court. It also \nsays the President cannot have his person on the Court. Rather a \nprocess so that the judge is his person on the Court, his own person.\n  Hamilton continued:\n\n       [L]iberty can have nothing to fear from the judiciary \n     alone, but would have everything to fear from its union with \n     either of the other departments. . . .\n\n  That is pretty profound. And Hamilton warned:\n\n       [F]rom the natural feebleness of the judiciary, it is in \n     continual jeopardy of being overpowered, awed, or influenced \n     by its co-ordinate branches. . . .\n\n  Marbury v. Madison years later helped establish the independence of \nthe judiciary, saying the Constitution is what the Court says it says, \nand that has helped. But we all know Presidents have tried to change \nthe Court in their own ways because they did not like what the Court \nwas doing. FDR tried his court-packing plan. He did not like what the \nSupreme Court was deciding so he tried to influence the Court with \ncourt packing, and that did not work. Presidents have all kinds of ways \nto influence the Court. As I mentioned earlier, President Eisenhower \nvery much tried to influence Justice Warren in Brown v. Board of \nEducation. Fortunately, Justice Warren, who was appointed by President \nEisenhower, stood up and said, no, separate but equal is not the law of \nthe land. Rather, we should integrate.\n  Hamilton then concluded:\n\n       The complete independence of the courts of justice is \n     peculiarly essential in a limited Constitution. By a limited \n     Constitution, I understand one which contains certain \n     specified exceptions to the legislative authority; such, for \n     instance, as that it shall pass no bills of attainder, no ex-\n     post-facto laws, and the like. Limitations of this kind can \n     be preserved in practice no other way than through the medium \n     of courts of justice, whose duty it must be to declare all \n     acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the Constitution void. \n     Without this, all the reservations of particular rights or \n     privileges would amount to nothing.\n\n  So I call on the President, I call on my colleagues to defend that \n``main preservative of . . . liberty.'' I call on the President, I call \non my colleagues to defend the independence of the courts. I call on my \ncolleagues in this Senate to actively exercise their constitutional \nduties of advice and consent.\n  There are not many times in our lives as Senators when rising up and \nexercising our responsibilities is as important as this, not be a \nrubberstamp, but not vote no just because we have a different view of \nthat person's judicial philosophy but, rather, doing the right thing, \nand the right thing is to make sure we have nominees of utmost personal \nintegrity who are clearly professionally competent and who are in the \nmainstream and will not cater to extreme views of either the right or \nthe left but stand above it all and decide cases in the right way.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/18/senate-section/article/S8409-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8409-S8412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       INDEPENDENT SUPREME COURT\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in the Declaration of Independence, one \nreason our Founders decided for a revolution against King George was \n``He has made judges dependent on his will alone.''\n  That same year, the Delaware Declaration of Rights and Fundamental \nRules stated:\n\n       That the independence and uprightness of judges are \n     essential to the impartial administration of justice, and a \n     great security to the rights and liberties of the people.\n\n  In the Federalist Papers, explaining our great Constitution, \nAlexander Hamilton quoted Montesquieu to say:\n\n       There is no liberty, if the power of judging be not \n     separated from the legislative and executive powers.\n\n  It is the independence of the Supreme Court that is at stake in the \ncoming consideration of the Court's next nominee. Our Constitution \nembodies that independence of the Court in its separation of powers, in \nits checks and balances, and in its structure that provides of the \nPresident:\n\n       He shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent \n     of the Senate, shall appoint . . . judges of the Supreme \n     Court.\n\n  The Senate's active advice and consent role in the confirmation of a \nSupreme Court Justice helps to ensure that nominees have the support of \na broad political consensus. The Senate's role helps to ensure that the \nPresident cannot appoint extreme nominees. The Senate's role helps to \nensure that Justices are more independent from the President.\n  Time and time again the history of our Supreme Court has demonstrated \nthe importance of that independence. Time and time again, it has \nmattered that the Supreme Court had brave men and brave women who were \nwilling to rule against the interests of the President. Time and time \nagain, it has mattered that the President had to appoint independent \nthinkers that would withstand the tough scrutiny of the Senate.\n  It mattered that we had an independent court when our Nation was \nyoung, in 1803, when the Supreme Court decided the case of Marbury v. \nMadison. It mattered that we had an independent court so that Chief \nJustice Marshall could write for the Court:\n\n       It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial \n     department [that is the judiciary] to say what the law is. . \n     . . If two laws conflict with each other, the courts must \n     decide on the operation of each. . . . That is the very \n     essence of judicial duty.\n\n  Today, most take for granted this bedrock principle of judicial \nreview set forth in Marbury v. Madison. But recall the plaintiff in \nthat case, William Marbury, challenged President Thomas Jefferson's \nadministration. If the President, Thomas Jefferson, had been able to \nappoint Justices without an effective check by the Senate, then perhaps \nthe President would have been able to appoint Justices who believed as \nhe did--as Jefferson did--when he wrote, in 1820, a letter saying:\n\n       It is a very dangerous doctrine to consider the judges as \n     ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions.\n\n  Just think for a second what that means. President Thomas Jefferson, \nback in 1820, wrote that it was unfortunate and dangerous doctrine to \nconsider judges as the ultimate arbiters of constitutional questions. \nIf it wasn't he, who would it be? Clearly, Thomas Jefferson thought it \nwould be he, the President, not the Supreme Court.\n  Without concern for the Senate's advice and consent, a more recent \nPresident might have appointed a Justice who believed as did former \nAttorney General Edwin Meese, 20 years ago, when Meese argued that the \nSupreme Court's interpretations of the Constitution, in his words, did \nnot establish a ``supreme law of the land.'' That is Edwin Meese, who \nwas U.S. Attorney General 20 years ago. And recall that Attorney \nGeneral Meese asserted that the Reagan administration was free to rely \non its own views on the meaning of the law.\n  That is revolutionary, and I don't use that word unadvisedly. It is a \nlong-established principle that the Constitution is what the Supreme \nCourt says it is. It has to be. The Constitution is not what the \nPresident says it is, it is what the Supreme Court says it is. The \njudiciary is a free, independent, third branch of Government.\n  It also mattered that we had an independent Supreme Court in 1952, \nwhen the Court decided Youngstown Sheet & Tube Company v. Sawyer, \notherwise known as the ``steel seizure case.''\n\n  It was the time of the Korean War, and we faced a steel strike. \nPresident Truman tried to seize the steel companies in order to avert a \nstrike. It mattered that we had an independent Supreme Court so that \nthe Court could rule against President Truman--an independent arbiter \nsaying: No, Mr.\n\n[[Page S8410]]\n\nPresident, that is not proper; the Constitution doesn't permit that.\n  It mattered that Justice Hugo Black was independent enough to write \nfor the majority when he wrote:\n\n       The Constitution limits his [that is, the President's] \n     functions in the lawmaking process to the recommending of \n     laws he thinks wise and the vetoing of laws he thinks bad. \n     And the Constitution is neither silent nor equivocal about \n     who shall make laws which the President is to execute.\n\n  That is very clear. The Supreme Court stood up to the President and \nsaid, Mr. President, that is unconstitutional.\n  It mattered that we had an independent Supreme Court in 1974, when \nthe Court heard U.S. v. Nixon, otherwise known as the Watergate tapes \ncase. Let's go back and review those facts.\n  President Nixon fought against Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski's \nsubpoena to get the Watergate tapes. It mattered that we had an \nindependent Supreme Court, so that the Court could rule against \nPresident Nixon's claim of executive privilege. The President thought \nhe had that privilege. If he had his way, he would determine the rule \nof law in the United States. But, no, we had an independent third \nbranch, the Supreme Court, which ruled that the President in his \ninterpretation of the Constitution was incorrect. In effect, the \nConstitution was standing up for all of us as Americans, protecting our \nrights against Presidents who want to have their way, which Presidents \nwant to do after they are in power after several years.\n  It mattered that Chief Justice Warren Burger was independent enough \nto write for the majority in that case:\n\n       Neither the doctrine of the separation of powers, nor the \n     need for confidentiality of high level communications, \n     without more, can sustain an absolute, unqualified \n     Presidential privilege of immunity from judicial process \n     under all circumstances.\n\n  That, in effect, is what President Nixon was asking for. The Supreme \nCourt stood up for our rights against a President.\n  Earlier, in 1969, on appointing Justice Burger as Chief Justice of \nthe Supreme Court, President Nixon had said:\n\n       Our Chief Justices have probably had more profound and \n     lasting influence on their times and on the direction of the \n     Nation than most Presidents.\n\n  Well, in the time of President Nixon, it certainly mattered that we \nhad an independent Supreme Court.\n  It mattered that we had an independent Supreme Court in 1963. In that \nyear, the Supreme Court decided Gideon v. Wainwright, which upheld the \nright of counsel in State courts for people who could not afford a \nlawyer. A President might not want lawyers questioning the Government's \nprosecutors. Most Presidents don't. It mattered that an independent \nSupreme Court ensured that they can.\n  It mattered that we had an independent Supreme Court in 1964, when \nthat Court decided New York Times v. Sullivan. That case has a standard \nthat public officials, including Presidents, would have to meet to sue \nthose who criticize them for the conduct of their office.\n  It mattered that we had an independent Supreme Court so that the \nCourt could establish a rule against the interest of public officials, \nsomething public officials don't like. That is a standard that we don't \nlike in this body. We don't particularly like it, but people can use \nit. It is the right decision. It makes it uncomfortable at times. The \nCourt could rule that the first amendment protects the publication of \nstatements about public officials, except when made with actual \nmalice--that is, with knowledge that they are false or in reckless \ndisregard of whether or not they are false. That was an independent \nSupreme Court. So it mattered that Justice William Brennan was \nindependent enough to write the majority in that opinion, and he said:\n\n       We hold today that the Constitution delimits a State's \n     power to award damages for libel in actions brought by public \n     officials against critics of their official contact.\n\n  I imagine most Presidents don't like that if the Supreme Court says \nit is necessary in interpreting the Constitution to protect American \nrights.\n  It mattered when we had an independent Supreme Court in 1954 when the \nCourt decided Brown v. Board of Education. A Court that was dependent \non the President might have wanted to skirt that issue of segregation, \nto duck the injustice of racial segregation in our schools.\n  Why do I say that? Because Jim Newton, a Los Angeles Times editor and \nbiographer of Chief Justice Earl Warren, has written that President \nEisenhower, who appointed Chief Justice Warren, tried to influence the \nChief Justice on that landmark case. Newton reports that during the \nperiod when the Court was considering Brown v. Board of Education, \nPresident Eisenhower invited Chief Justice Warren to join him at dinner \nwith a number of guests. That was while that case was pending.\n  It turned out that President Eisenhower had also invited one of the \nlawyers for the Southern States in the Brown case.\n  As the President and Chief Justice stood up from the table--this was \ndinner, remember, with one of the lawyers for the Southern States \nthere, a private dinner, Chief Justice Warren was there, and President \nEisenhower, who appointed Chief Justice Warren, was there--as they \nstood up from the table, the President took the Chief Justice by the \narm. The President motioned to others in the room and then whispered \ninto the Chief Justice's ear: ``These are not bad people.''\n  The President told the Chief Justice that they were only concerned \nabout their ``sweet little girls'' having to sit in school beside \nAfrican-American children.\n  That is what President Eisenhower said at that dinner to Chief \nJustice Warren when Brown v. Board of Education was pending. So it \nmattered that we had a Chief Justice who was independent enough not to \nlisten to the President who appointed him.\n  It mattered that Chief Justice Warren was independent enough to write \nfor the majority:\n\n       We conclude that in the field of public education the \n     doctrine of ``separate but equal'' has no place. Separate \n     educational facilities are inherently unequal.\n\n  On that point, I don't know if it is true or not, but there are many \nscholars who say that the current Chief Justice wrote a memo to his \njudge he was working with when he was a clerk advocating separate but \nequal. That memo did not come out until after the Chief Justice was \nappointed and confirmed by the Senate.\n  We here today can be justifiably proud that America has the oldest \nliving written Constitution. When our Nation's Government was born, our \nConstitution was a novelty. Our Constitution created, in the words \nengraved over the west doorway of this Chamber, ``novus ordo \nseclorum''--``a new order of ages.''\n  As we examine the great variety of governments in the world today, \nAmericans can still have pride that few nations possess such a charter. \nFew nations fervently protect their rights--very few, when you stop to \nthink about it. It is astounding, it is amazing, and we do take it for \ngranted. Few nations so preserve an independent supreme court.\n  Our Constitution is our foundation. It sets forth our basic rights. \nIt preserves our liberties against the eternal danger of the power of \nthe Executive, sometimes against the power of the Congress but many \ntimes against the power of the Executive.\n  Our Constitution preserves precious rights that must be protected, \nand that is why we must act zealously to ensure that the men and women \nwe entrust to guard that valued heritage is truly independent. That is \nwhy we must remember, as Justice Charles Evans Hughes said in 1907:\n\n       [T]he judiciary is the safeguard of our liberty and of our \n     property under the Constitution.\n\n  Our Constitution helps to preserve those rights through an ingenious \nsystem of checks and balances. Time and time again, our Constitution \nsets up structures that require two separate, coequal branches of \nGovernment to work together and agree before the Government can act. \nThese structures were deeply rooted in the spirit of the times, back \nwhen the Constitution was written, that when two work together, one \nwould propose and the other could veto.\n  You can see that spirit in the original clause where the House can \npropose revenue measures, but the Senate can amend them. You can see \nthat spirit in the presentation clause where the Congress can propose \nlegislation but the President can veto it. And you can see\n\n[[Page S8411]]\n\nthat spirit in the nomination clause where the President can nominate \njudges but the Senate can block them. That was the ingenious \ndevelopment in the late 1700s to forge consensus; somebody can propose \nbut the other can oppose. It forces cooperation, it forces consensus, \nit forces a better government.\n  Thus, when the Senate decides whether to confirm a Supreme Court \nnominee, it is not beholden to the concerns of the President but to the \ndeepest concerns and needs of the people. This is particularly true \ngiven lifetime tenure of a Supreme Court Justice and the need for \nJustices to staunchly defend the people's rights and liberties.\n  My colleagues should recall that in the history of our Supreme Court, \n13 Justices have served for more than 30 years. Justice Douglas served \non the Court for more than 36 years, and the Justices appointed since \n1970 have served for an average of 25 years. That is a long time. \nTherefore, it matters that we get good judges. It really matters.\n  Over the years, this has been one of the issues of greatest \nimportance to me as a Senator, and that is why I worked to set up a \nmerit selection system in my State of Montana that is truly apolitical, \ntruly independent, to select the judges for whom I would then recommend \nto the bench.\n  It is very important to me. I said to the people helping me out: I \ndon't care if they are Republicans or Democrats. I don't care if you \nrecommend liberals or conservatives. You just give me the names of \nthree of the very best people in our State who can then serve on the \nFederal bench because they are going to be there a long time, and they \nare so important.\n  I am very proud--twice this happened, and each time the group I put \ntogether, which was totally balanced, came up with three very good \nnames. It was difficult for me in sitting down with each of the three \nto decide who was the best of the three because they were all so good. \nI did the best I could, and I felt the process worked out very well and \nwas of great value to the people of Montana and to the country.\n\n  So it matters that we have an independent judiciary. To ensure we \nhave an independent judiciary, it thus matters that Senators exercise \ntheir independent judgment in the nomination process. Senators should \nnot act as rubberstamps for the President's choice. That would be a \ncomplete abrogation of senatorial responsibility--complete, total.\n  It is our Founders' dream of an independent Supreme Court, helping to \nexercise the Constitution's intricate systems of checks and balances, \nthat is at stake in this nomination process. The Senate's active \ninvolvement in the confirmation of Justices helps to ensure that the \nSupreme Court can lead that independent branch of Government. And in \ncase after case, that independence of the Supreme Court, in turn, has \nensured our personal rights and our liberties. We cannot take that for \ngranted.\n  The Senate can honor that independence by taking its constitutional \nresponsibility to advise and consent very seriously. The Senate can \nhonor that independence by withholding judgment on a nominee until the \nJudiciary Committee has conducted full and fair hearings. And the \nPresident can honor that independence by putting forth a nominee who \nmeets three basic criteria: professional competence, personal \nintegrity, and a view of important issues that is within the mainstream \nof the contemporary judicial thought. And the Senate can honor the \nindependence of the Supreme Court by holding a nominee to each of these \ncriteria before voting on whether to confirm.\n  Let me review those three criteria.\n  First, professional competency: The Supreme Court must not be the \ntesting ground for the development of a jurist's basic values. He \ncannot learn on the job, nor should a Justice require further training. \nThe stakes are simply too high. He must be very professionally \ncompetent on day one.\n  Second, personal integrity: Nominees to our Nation's highest Court \nmust be of the highest caliber.\n  And, third, the nominee should fall within the mainstream of \ncontemporary judicial thought. The next Justice must possess the \nrequisite judicial philosophy to be entrusted with the Court's sweeping \nconstitutional powers.\n  A Senator should not oppose a nominee just because a nominee does not \nshare that Senator's particular judicial philosophy. But the Senate \nmust determine whether a nominee is within the broad mainstream of \njudicial thought--not an idealogue of the far left, not an idealogue of \nthe far right but mainstream.\n  Why? Because that is where America is. Also, we need a Judge who can \nexercise good judgment during the entire time he or she is on the \nCourt. The average tenure since 1970 is 25 years. Times have changed. \nWe don't want an idealogue who has one view or tends to have one view \nbut, rather, somebody who is wise, above the fray, has perspective, \nlistens, has good judgment, deeply understands the history of our \ncountry, especially its beginnings when our Constitution was written.\n  The Senate must determine whether a nominee is committed to the \nprotection of the basic constitutional values of the American people.\n  So what are some of those values? One is the separation of powers of \nour Federal Government, including the independence of the Court itself.\n  Another is freedom of speech. Boy, is that important, stronger in \nthis country than any other on the face of this Earth. It is so \nimportant--so important. It helps make America what it is.\n  Another is freedom of religion, the other side of the establishment \nclause. Freedom of religion, both direct and indirect, so people are \nfree to worship whomever they choose and in whatever manner they wish.\n  Equal opportunity, enshrined in the 14th amendment, is the basic \nbedrock American principle. Again, this is what made this country \ngreat. We are great for a lot of reasons, but one is because people \nwant to come to this country and live. We don't see very many Americans \nheading for the door to get out of America. Americans want to stay in \nAmerica, and other people want to come to America. Why is that? I \nsubmit largely it is opportunity, it is the freedom of opportunity, and \nno discrimination. Anybody who wants to make something out of himself \nor herself in America can. There are some practical limitations \nsometimes, but by and large, if you have the stuff in America, you are \ngoing to get there. It is freedom of opportunity.\n  Another value is personal autonomy, the right to be left alone. That \nis very basic in America when we talk about freedoms in America. They \nare so important. Another freedom is the right to be left alone.\n  Another is an understanding of the basic powers of the Congress to \npass important laws, such as those providing for the protection of the \nenvironment. We are one country. General laws, especially under the \ncommerce clause, are so important so that all of America can share in \nmatters, not just the equal protection clause, but the commerce clause, \nsharing and protecting the environment. It is very important. We are \none country. That is becoming more and more important each passing day.\n  Why? Because of integration and large advances in communication \ntechnologies, all kinds of technologies. We are all so much of the same \ncountry together.\n  Mainstream philosophy matters because some on the extreme would \nargue, as Justice Thomas did last month, that the Constitution's \nestablishment clause in the Bill of Rights does not even apply to the \nStates. Think of that for a moment. Justice Thomas said the \nConstitution's establishment clause in the Bill of Rights--that is the \nfirst amendment--does not even apply to the States.\n  What does that mean? That means States can set up their own laws \nrespecting the establishment of religion. I thought we were one \ncountry. I thought that issue was decided long ago. I thought most of \nthe provisions of the Bill of Rights that applied to the Federal \nGovernment also applied to States. I thought that. I thought we were \nAmerican.\n  To even contemplate the thought of going backward, to even \ncontemplate\n\n[[Page S8412]]\n\nthe thought that the establishment clause does not apply to States in \nand of itself sends shivers, I am sure, down the spines of virtually \nevery American, let alone to advocate it as Justice Thomas has, and my \nrecollection is not once but I think twice.\n  Mainstream philosophy matters because some on the extreme would seek \nto abolish the right to privacy that the Court recognized 40 years ago \nin that famous case of Griswold v. Connecticut. There is an inherent \nright to privacy in the Constitution.\n  Mainstream philosophy matters because some on the extreme would argue \nthat the Congress cannot pass laws such as the Endangered Species Act \nor the Clean Water Act pursuant to the Constitution's commerce clause. \nThey say the commerce clause prevents the Clean Water Act; the commerce \nclause prevents Congress from passing the Endangered Species Act. Think \nfor a moment what that means and how far that could go.\n  Many of us are concerned that this Court is a couple or three steps \naway from if not virtually eliminating the commerce clause and \ntherefore Congress's ability to enact statutes, but going so far in \nthat direction it is going to create havoc in this country. We will \nhave more States doing separate sets of statutes because the commerce \nclause does not apply.\n  Now, come on. Stop and think a second. That is revolutionary. Yet \nthere are many who advocate that in this country, I am sure hoping the \nPresident appoints a nominee with just that view. I will bet dollars to \ndonuts there are many pushing that view upon the President right now.\n  These are extreme views. They are not mainstream. And the stakes are \nhigh. The Senate has a duty to ensure that the nominee will defend \nAmerica's mainstream constitutional values. We have that duty. It is \nour responsibility as Senators.\n  It is only fitting that the Senate set a very high standard. It is \nonly fitting that the Senate distinguish Supreme Court nominations from \nother nominations, especially those for administrative positions. \nAdministrative positions, that is the President's team, in deference to \nthe President having his own people. We are not talking about the \njudicial branch. There is no deference to have your own people because \nwe have established we want independent people. We want one's own \npeople. We do not want the President's own people. We do not want the \nCongress's own people. We want independent people who are in and of \nthemselves their own people.\n  It is so important the Senate act with very high standards. Because \nof the importance of an independent Supreme Court, the President is not \nentitled to have the Senate confirm his nominee. There is no \nentitlement there.\n  With some sadness, I have noted over the last several years that that \ntrend is developing. It is becoming almost assumed that the Senate must \nconfirm the President's nominee, that the President has that right. \nThere is no right. The right is for the American people to stand up \nunder the Constitution and do what is right for their people. And, yes, \nsupport a nominee who is truly independent, has personal integrity and \nis competent but, no, not support a nominee for the Supreme Court who \ndoes not have those requisite criteria. That is what is right. The \nSenate must set a very high standard.\n  The next Supreme Court Justice will affect all of us and our \nchildren. This Justice will exercise extraordinary power. We must \nensure that Justice's independence.\n  The independence of the Supreme Court is a doctrine with deep roots \nin the history of our Nation. In 1765, the great British legal jurist, \nSir William Blackstone, published his Commentaries, a book that was \nwell read by our Founders. Every law student in America knows about \nBlackstone. Blackstone wrote:\n\n       In this distinct and separate existence of the judicial \n     power, in a . . . body of men, nominated indeed, but not \n     removable at pleasure, by the crown, consists one main \n     preservative of public liberty; which cannot subsist long \n     in any state, unless the administration of common justice \n     be in some degree separated both from the legislative and \n     also from the executive power.\n\n  In explaining our newly minted Constitution, Alexander Hamilton wrote \nin Federalist No. 78:\n\n       [T]he judiciary is beyond comparison the weakest of the \n     three departments of power. . . .[T]hough individual \n     oppression may now and then proceed from the courts of \n     justice, the general liberty of the people can never be \n     endangered from that quarter; I mean so long as the judiciary \n     remains truly distinct from both the legislature and the \n     Executive. For I agree, that ``there is no liberty, if the \n     power of judging be not separated from the legislative and \n     executive powers.''\n\n  That says we in Congress cannot have our people on the Court. It also \nsays the President cannot have his person on the Court. Rather a \nprocess so that the judge is his person on the Court, his own person.\n  Hamilton continued:\n\n       [L]iberty can have nothing to fear from the judiciary \n     alone, but would have everything to fear from its union with \n     either of the other departments. . . .\n\n  That is pretty profound. And Hamilton warned:\n\n       [F]rom the natural feebleness of the judiciary, it is in \n     continual jeopardy of being overpowered, awed, or influenced \n     by its co-ordinate branches. . . .\n\n  Marbury v. Madison years later helped establish the independence of \nthe judiciary, saying the Constitution is what the Court says it says, \nand that has helped. But we all know Presidents have tried to change \nthe Court in their own ways because they did not like what the Court \nwas doing. FDR tried his court-packing plan. He did not like what the \nSupreme Court was deciding so he tried to influence the Court with \ncourt packing, and that did not work. Presidents have all kinds of ways \nto influence the Court. As I mentioned earlier, President Eisenhower \nvery much tried to influence Justice Warren in Brown v. Board of \nEducation. Fortunately, Justice Warren, who was appointed by President \nEisenhower, stood up and said, no, separate but equal is not the law of \nthe land. Rather, we should integrate.\n  Hamilton then concluded:\n\n       The complete independence of the courts of justice is \n     peculiarly essential in a limited Constitution. By a limited \n     Constitution, I understand one which contains certain \n     specified exceptions to the legislative authority; such, for \n     instance, as that it shall pass no bills of attainder, no ex-\n     post-facto laws, and the like. Limitations of this kind can \n     be preserved in practice no other way than through the medium \n     of courts of justice, whose duty it must be to declare all \n     acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the Constitution void. \n     Without this, all the reservations of particular rights or \n     privileges would amount to nothing.\n\n  So I call on the President, I call on my colleagues to defend that \n``main preservative of . . . liberty.'' I call on the President, I call \non my colleagues to defend the independence of the courts. I call on my \ncolleagues in this Senate to actively exercise their constitutional \nduties of advice and consent.\n  There are not many times in our lives as Senators when rising up and \nexercising our responsibilities is as important as this, not be a \nrubberstamp, but not vote no just because we have a different view of \nthat person's judicial philosophy but, rather, doing the right thing, \nand the right thing is to make sure we have nominees of utmost personal \nintegrity who are clearly professionally competent and who are in the \nmainstream and will not cater to extreme views of either the right or \nthe left but stand above it all and decide cases in the right way.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in sadness to pay tribute \nto a man who served the State of Louisiana well for over 22 years, our \nlate Secretary of State Fox McKeithen, who passed away over the weekend \nat his home, lovingly surrounded by friends, family, and admirers.\n  Walter Fox McKeithen was born on September 8, 1946. He was a young \nman when he died this weekend. He was the second of six children in a \nsmall northern town of Louisiana called Columbia. He was the son of a \nvery well-respected governor whom we fondly called ``Big John'' \nMcKeithen. He served in the 1960s and is accredited with leading our \nState of Louisiana at a very tough and tumultuous time in a very \nprogressive and positive direction. Fox McKeithen, the oldest child, \ntook after his father's political skills from an early age. He \ndemonstrated those leadership skills as senior class president at \nCaldwell Parish High School, and after graduating from Louisiana Tech, \nhe worked as a high school civics teacher and coach.\n  With his desire to serve the people of Louisiana in a greater role, \nhe was elected to the House of Representatives in 1983. I had the \ndistinct pleasure of working with Fox as a State representative. He \nwent on then to run statewide and was elected Secretary of State. I \nwent on at that same time as State treasurer, and we continued our \nstrong partnership and relationship.\n  As Secretary of State, however, Fox took his very colorful \npersonality and spirited dedication to make great improvements to an \noffice that was in need of improvement. He modernized the way the State \narchived its records. He made it easier for businesses to register and \nget assistance from the Secretary of State's office. Most importantly, \nhe was a friend to local clerks who work diligently in our State to \nprocess elections, make sure they are run fairly and openly. He had a \nvery strong view, as Secretary of State and our chief election \ncommission officer, that registered voters should have a chance to \nvote. Not a radical notion, but in this day and age not something that \nalways happens. So he worked overtime to make sure the machines were \nthere on time and people were well trained. If the clerks had problems, \nhe himself would step in and give personal attention. So we all owe him \na debt of gratitude for his dedication and commitment. In fact, once \nthere was a problem--voting machines were arriving late. He jumped in \nhis own pickup truck and went down to one of our parishes to bring them \nvoting machines.\n  Perhaps his greatest legacy was the renovation of our old State \ncapitol, a building that sat on the banks of the Mississippi River in \ndecay and abandonment for many years. But with his vision and his \nleadership, he restored that building to its former grandeur, and now \nit is a place that is used by many different organizations and \nappreciated and admired by all the people of our State. When he started \nthis project, people said it could not be done, there was not enough \nmoney to do it. But because of his tenaciousness and his hard work and \nleadership ability, he led a group of leaders both in the public sector \nand in the private sector to restore our own State capitol and enhanced \none of the great communities on the banks of the Mississippi River, \nright there in our capital city, reminding us of our rich and colorful \npast.\n  It was truly an honor for me and many people in Louisiana to serve in \npublic office with Fox McKeithen. He loved Louisiana and he loved \nserving all of her people. He shared his father's famous campaign \nslogan, ``Won't you h'ep me?'' as if it were a question that the people \nof Louisiana were asking of him. It didn't matter if you were a \nDemocrat or a Republican, rich or poor, from north or south of I-10 or \nnorth or south of I-20, he was always there to help you if he could.\n  A dedicated public servant who gave everything he had to serving our \nState, Fox McKeithen will be dearly missed. The people of our State owe \na great debt of gratitude to Fox and the entire McKeithen family for a \nlegacy of leadership, compassion, and vision for our State. His eldest \ndaughter Marjorie follows in her father's and grandfather's footsteps \nthrough her practice of law and effective advocacy for many important \nprograms and initiatives in our State. She is truly carrying on the \ngreat McKeithen legacy of service.\n  So I come to the floor today saddened by the fact but gladdened by \nthe life this man led and certain of his legacy that he left with the \npeople of our State and the many contributions he made over a long and \ndedicated career.\n  On behalf of the people of Louisiana, I say our thoughts and prayers \nare with him and his family at this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/18/senate-section/article/S8413-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CHANGE OF VOTE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Staff Sergeant Jameson was killed by an \nexplosion after stopping to treat wounded Marines on July 14 near \nTrebil in western Iraq. She was 34 years old.\n  Staff Sergeant Jameson grew up in St. Paul, NE, before moving to \nOmaha as a teenager. She graduated from Millard South High School in \n1989 and attended Central Community College at Columbus, NE, from 1990-\n91. She spent the last 10 years in the military, working the last 5 \nyears as a health care specialist at the Nebraska Air National Guard \nbase clinic in Lincoln, NE. Staff Sergeant Jameson was a member of the \n313th Medical Company of Lincoln and was mobilized to duty in Iraq less \nthan a month ago. Staff Sergeant Jameson volunteered for the \nassignment. She was not a regular member of the group but a replacement \nfor another soldier. Staff Sergeant Jameson will be remembered as a \nloyal soldier who had a strong sense of duty, honor, and love of \ncountry. Thousands of brave Americans like Staff Sergeant Jameson are \ncurrently serving in Iraq.\n  Staff Sergeant Jameson was preceded in death by her father, Robert \nJameson. She is survived by her mother Patricia Marsh of Omaha: \nbrother, Rob Jameson of Omaha; grandmothers Kathryn Jameson of Weeping \nWater, NE, and Annamae Donahue of Omaha; and fiance Mike Coldewey of \nOmaha. Our thoughts and prayers are with them at this difficult time. \nAmerica is proud of Staff Sergeant Jameson's heroic service and mourns \nher loss.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring SSG \nTricia L.

Mr. President, I rise to honor the memory of Deputy Jerry \nOrtiz, a 15-year veteran of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's \nDepartment, who was tragically killed in the line of duty on June 24, \n2005.\n  As a young child growing up in Southern California, Jerry Ortiz knew \nthat he wanted to dedicate his life to protecting his fellow citizens. \nSo it came as no surprise when he enlisted in the U.S. Army shortly \nafter his graduation from El Monte High School in\n\n[[Page S8414]]\n\n1988. Only 2 years later, he fulfilled his dream of becoming a police \nofficer when he joined the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. \nDeputy Ortiz's strict work ethic and dedication quickly made him a \nwell-respected member of the Department and earned him a position with \nthe elite antigang unit at the Lakewood Station. Although this was a \nformidable task with great responsibilities, he knew that in this \ncapacity he could truly make a difference in the community and help at-\nrisk youth. Deputy Ortiz did just that.\n  Jerry Ortiz was an important part of the Sheriff's Department family. \nHe was well known for his sense of humor, positive attitude, and \nathleticism on the Department boxing team. Over his 15-year career, he \nbecame an integral part of the fight against gang crime in the area and \nwent above and beyond to protect the innocent citizens caught in the \nunfortunate gang violence in their communities. Days before his tragic \nmurder, Deputy Ortiz received word that he was being promoted to \ndetective.\n  All who knew him said that he loved his job but that he was first and \nforemost a family man. Ortiz spent most of his free time with his two \nsons, Jeremy, 16, and Jacob, 6. He was a sports fan and enjoyed sharing \nthis passion with his sons. Only three weeks before his death, Jerry \nOrtiz married his wife, Chela, and those close to him say he was \nhappier than ever.\n  I am truly saddened to lose this remarkable public servant. Deputy \nJerry Ortiz died doing what he loved--providing protection for his \ncommunity. He was a leader, an inspiring mentor, a hero, and a \nwonderful father and husband. We will always be grateful for Deputy \nOrtiz's heroic service to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department \nand the community that he so bravely served.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/18/senate-section/article/S8414-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  Last year, a man was arrested after he and another suspect yelled \nderogatory insults and hate speech toward a group of five lesbian women \nand one transgender man. While one of the men later fled the scene, the \nother continued harassing the group and subsequently physically \nattacked them. Some of the victims sustained injuries including a \nbroken nose, black eyes, and injuries around the head and face.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/18/senate-section/article/S8414-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8414-S8415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PERSONAL EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I regret that I was unable to be \npresent and cast votes the week of June 27. My mother, Marcia \nLieberman, passed away on June 27 and her funeral was June 28, and I \nobserved a period of mourning in Connecticut for the remainder of that \nweek. While, as I stated to Senator Reid, I would have returned to the \nCapitol and voted had my vote been determinative of the outcome, that \ndid not become an issue regarding votes that week. Before I address the \nvarious pieces of legislation that the Senate considered during my \nabsence, I would like to express my gratitude to my colleagues and \ntheir staffs for their acts of kindness and words of sympathy during \nthis difficult time for me and my family.\n  I have set forth below for the Record, for the information of my \nconstituents, my positions on the legislation and key amendments \nconsidered the week of June 27.\n  Had I been present for vote on H.R. 6, the Energy Policy Act of 2005, \nI would have voted yes.\n  The bill is far from perfect; indeed, it does next to nothing to \naddress the challenge of climate change and leaves us much work still \nto do in creating the kind of robust and diverse fuel mix for our cars \nand trucks needed to provide America with true energy security.\n  What the bill does do, however, to stimulate the development and use \nof technologies that can help us address these challenges--or at least \nto get a start--justifies supporting it.\n  I was disappointed that when Senator McCain and I offered the Climate \nStewardship and Innovation Act as an amendment to bill, the Senate \nturned down the opportunity to adopt a truly comprehensive program to \nreduce economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions using a market system. My \ndisappointment was tempered, however, when the Senate adopted a \nbipartisan resolution, which Senator McCain and I cosponsored with \nSenators Domenici and Bingaman and several others calling for a \nmandatory market-based emissions reduction program for greenhouse \ngases. I am hopeful that over time the Senate will come to see that the \nlegislation that Senator McCain and I have been pushing for provides \njust the right vehicle for producing the legislation called for in the \nresolution.\n  At the same time, I believe that the bill will help nudge our energy \nsystem towards a cleaner, more efficient future. In addition to \nincluding a renewable portfolio standard for electric utilities, the \nbill includes a range of incentives and other support for businesses \nand consumers to develop and use clean technologies and clean fuels in \ntheir businesses and homes and on our highways.\n  Finally, I appreciate the fact that the bill--for the most part--does \nnot include provisions that would weaken environmental protections for \nour air, water and land that, in the past, some have mistakenly \nbelieved to be necessary to advance energy policy.\n  On Thursday, June 29, the Senate voted on H.R. 2361, the Department \nof the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. \nBelow are comments on the amendments that were offered and the vote on \nfinal passage of the bill.\n  I would have voted ``nay'' on the motion to waive the Budget Act with \nregard to Senator Coburn's amendment No. 1019. Combating diabetes and \nalcohol and substance abuse in Indian country must continue to be a \npriority for Congress, the Department of the Interior, and the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. It is also important that we \ncontinue to support Federal land acquisition programs that preserve the \nenvironment in its natural state. I believe that the Appropriations \nCommittee has looked at these programs and made difficult but sound \ndecisions about the funding levels for both of them, and therefore \noppose the motion. I also note that I would have voted for Senator \nDorgan's subsequent amendment No. 1025.\n  I would have voted for Senator Coburn's amendment No. 1003 because \nthis amendment and similar sunshine laws would make it easier for \nAmericans to understand how and what the Federal Government does on \ntheir behalf. By requiring that all limitations, earmarks, and \ndirectives be explicitly stated in the conference report, this \namendment would have forced Congress to do a better job explaining to \nthe American people where their tax dollars are being spent.\n  While I preferred Senator Boxer's amendment No. 1023, I would have \nvoted for Senator Burns's amendment No. 1068 because it at least \nensures that the Environmental Protection Agency will undertake the \nspecific tasks of reviewing this very serious public health issue and \nreporting its findings to Congress. The amendment also confirms the \nEPA's rulemaking process, which I believe should be a \nnecessary prerequisite before any human pesticide testing should be \nallowed to continue. I look forward to reviewing the EPA's final \nrecommendations, and after doing so, will be able to make a decision as \nto whether any human pesticide testing should be allowed.\n\n  In the meantime, I strongly support the moratorium imposed by Senator \nBoxer's amendment on all pesticide testing involving humans and the use \nof such studies until the EPA conducts and completes what I expect to \nbe a thorough investigative and rulemaking process that ensures the \nsafety of all\n\n[[Page S8415]]\n\ninvolved. I believe the government should steer clear of even being \nperceived as sanctioning these types of tests until there is a complete \nreview of the risks involved. A moratorium like the one provided for in \nSenator Boxer's amendment is the prudent and reasonable course for us \nto take at this time.\n  As noted earlier, I would have supported Senator Dorgan's amendment \nNo. 1024 because it finds additional funding in an otherwise \nunnecessary account for health care on tribal lands. There is a need \nfor additional money to meet the increasing demands for mental heath \ncare and other health care programs designed to meet the unique \nconcerns of Indian Country. Though the motion to waive the \nCongressional Budget Act to make this amendment possible did not pass, \nI look forward to working with Senator Dorgan and my colleagues on this \nvery important issue.\n  I would have supported the efforts of Senators Sununu and Bingaman in \namendment No. 1026 to halt Federal subsidies for logging roads in the \nTongass National Forest.\n  I also support the efforts of Senators Murray and Santorum in \nproposing legislation that meets the critical and immediate needs of \nour veterans. Providing health care to our veterans is a promise we \nmake to our servicemen and servicewomen when they agree to protect our \ncountry. We must continue to fulfill that promise by fully funding the \nveterans health care system at a level that meets the medical needs of \nall of those who have so valiantly and bravely served our country in \nthe war on terror, in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and in all previous wars \nand conflicts.\n  I would like to thank the Appropriations Committee for their work on \nthis legislation and join my colleagues in supporting its final \npassage.\n  On Thursday, June 30, the Senate voted on S. 1307, the implementing \nbill of the Dominican Republic and Central American Free Trade \nAgreement, DR-CAFTA. Had I been in Washington on June 30, I would have \nvoted for the motion to proceed to consider and for the bill, because I \nbelieve that, as is the case with most free-trade agreements, DR-CAFTA \noverall is good for Connecticut and good for the country.\n  I must raise two concerns that affect not only this bill, but our \nfuture efforts to expand trade. My first concern is with the way in \nwhich this agreement addresses--or fails to address--labor and \nenvironmental standards. Second, we may need to adjust our priorities \nwhen it comes to trade in order to resolve certain key issues in our \nrelationship with China.\n  When NAFTA was negotiated in the early 1990s, labor and environmental \nissues were dealt with in a side agreement; the parties' treaty \nobligations were that they enforce their own labor standards. When, in \n2001, the Jordan Free Trade Agreement was adopted, the labor and \nenvironment provisions were included in the body of the agreement. As a \nresult, they were fully subject to sanctions through the agreement's \ndispute resolution process. This was the culmination of crucial \nprogress through the 1990s, not just for workers in Jordan who happened \nto benefit from the Jordan trade agreement, but also for import-\nsensitive industries in the U.S.--and for fostering broad bipartisan \nsupport for trade expansion. Unfortunately, the more recent trade \nagreements have retreated from the strong provisions in the Jordan Free \nTrade Agreement and I believe that in order to garner support of \nCongress, at a minimum, future trade agreements must include strong \nenforcement provisions that would prevent countries from backsliding or \nignoring labor and environmental standards.\n  As to my second concern, while we now focus on DR-CAFTA, our \nconstituents continue to be concerned about China. They are right to do \nso since China is a country with almost ten times the gross domestic \nproduct of the Dominican Republic and Central American countries \ncombined. Trade with, and support for, the democracies in Latin and \nCentral America is important. That said, we must focus on the growing \nneed to address trade pressures from China, including China's approach \nto manipulating its currency and subsidizing its manufacturing sector, \nas well as its failure to enact strong labor standards. The lack of a \ncomprehensive U.S. trade policy results in a reactive, muddled trade \nagenda, rather than a focus on issues that will grow our economy, lower \nthe trade deficit, and create jobs.\n  On Friday, July 1, the Senate voted on H.R. 2419, The Department of \nEnergy and Water Development Appropriations Act. Here are my positions \non the amendment that was offered and on the vote on final passage of \nthe bill.\n  I would have supported Senator Boxer's amendment No. 1085 because the \nadministration has failed to make the case for why the mission of this \npotential weapon can not be achieved by current weapon systems and \nAmerica's nuclear arsenal already serves as an effective deterrent. We \ndo not need to launch a new nuclear weapons program at this time.\n  I would have supported final passage of the bill, which includes \nsupport for some important programs in my State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/18/senate-section/article/S8414-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8414-S8415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PERSONAL EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Second, we may need to adjust our priorities \nwhen it comes to trade in order to resolve certain key issues in our \nrelationship with China.\n  When NAFTA was negotiated in the early 1990s, labor and environmental \nissues were dealt with in a side agreement; the parties' treaty \nobligations were that they enforce their own labor standards. When, in \n2001, the Jordan Free Trade Agreement was adopted, the labor and \nenvironment provisions were included in the body of the agreement. As a \nresult, they were fully subject to sanctions through the agreement's \ndispute resolution process. This was the culmination of crucial \nprogress through the 1990s, not just for workers in Jordan who happened \nto benefit from the Jordan trade agreement, but also for import-\nsensitive industries in the U.S.--and for fostering broad bipartisan \nsupport for trade expansion. Unfortunately, the more recent trade \nagreements have retreated from the strong provisions in the Jordan Free \nTrade Agreement and I believe that in order to garner support of \nCongress, at a minimum, future trade agreements must include strong \nenforcement provisions that would prevent countries from backsliding or \nignoring labor and environmental standards.\n  As to my second concern, while we now focus on DR-CAFTA, our \nconstituents continue to be concerned about China. They are right to do \nso since China is a country with almost ten times the gross domestic \nproduct of the Dominican Republic and Central American countries \ncombined. Trade with, and support for, the democracies in Latin and \nCentral America is important. That said, we must focus on the growing \nneed to address trade pressures from China, including China's approach \nto manipulating its currency and subsidizing its manufacturing sector, \nas well as its failure to enact strong labor standards. The lack of a \ncomprehensive U.S. trade policy results in a reactive, muddled trade \nagenda, rather than a focus on issues that will grow our economy, lower \nthe trade deficit, and create jobs.\n  On Friday, July 1, the Senate voted on H.R. 2419, The Department of \nEnergy and Water Development Appropriations Act. Here are my positions \non the amendment that was offered and on the vote on final passage of \nthe bill.\n  I would have supported Senator Boxer's amendment No. 1085 because the \nadministration has failed to make the case for why the mission of this \npotential weapon can not be achieved by current weapon systems and \nAmerica's nuclear arsenal already serves as an effective deterrent. We \ndo not need to launch a new nuclear weapons program at this time.\n  I would have supported final passage of the bill, which includes \nsupport for some important programs in my State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/18/senate-section/article/S8415-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8415-S8416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the fiscal year 2006 \nHomeland Security appropriations bill. The Senate passed this measure \nnearly unanimously and I voted in support of it.\n  I would like to begin by thanking the principal authors and managers \nof this legislation: Senator Gregg and Senator Byrd. It is no easy task \nto write a bill that provides for our domestic security needs. I \ncommend both of our colleagues and their staffs for the hard work they \nput into crafting this legislation.\n  The bill that passed the Senate funds our country's homeland security \nactivities at $31.9 billion for the upcoming fiscal year. These \nactivities include port security, rail security, truck security, \naviation security, emergency first responders, customs and border \npatrol, immigration, the Coast Guard, and counter-terrorism research. \nTaken together, these initiatives form the foundation upon which our \ncountry depends for its internal security.\n  In an age when terrorism continues to be a growing threat to our \nNation, one would think that the Congress of the United States would be \ndoing everything it could to shore up that foundation--to make it as \nimpregnable as possible against those who wish us harm. Yet, when we \nlook at the legislation passed by the Senate, I do not believe it does \nenough to protect our people from terrorism. We are simply not \ninvesting the resources that are required to make this Nation as safe \nas possible. Instead of filling in the gaps that continue to exist \nwithin our homeland security foundation, we are letting those gaps and \ncracks grow in several critical respects.\n  One does not have to look further than protecting our critical \ninfrastructure and funding our emergency first responders. These 2 \nareas arguably form the backbone of our efforts to prevent and \neffectively respond to terrorist attacks at home. They encompass \nprotecting our ports, our railroads, our transit systems and our \ncommercial vehicles. They encompass quickly and effectively responding \nto real or perceived threats in all parts of our country.\n  The bill that passed the Senate provides $3.9 billion to protect our \ncritical infrastructure, equip our first responders, and assist local \ngovernments in planning and coordinating their homeland security \nactivities. While this may seem like a large number to many Americans, \nit has been cited by numerous national security and public health \nexperts, along with first responders themselves, as being wholly \ninadequate to meet the homeland security demands of the twenty-first \ncentury. Furthermore, the number is actually less than what has been \nprovided in the past. It is approximately $500 million less than what \nwas provided last year and approximately $700 million less than 2 years \nago. Clearly, we are heading in the wrong direction--doing less to \nprotect our country adequately when we ought to be doing more.\n  As we have seen in Madrid last year, in London 2 weeks ago and in \nIraq almost every week, terrorists have become adept at exploiting weak \npoints in critical infrastructure, particularly transportation systems. \nI question what it will take for us to realize that we need to be \ninvesting more in our domestic critical infrastructure and in our first \nresponders.\n  Although we have taken steps to boost our homeland security since the\n\n[[Page S8416]]\n\nattacks on September 11th, our critical infrastructure remains largely \nexposed and our emergency first responders spread too thin. Today, less \nthan 5 percent of commercial cargo arriving at our seaports is screened \nfor threats; our rail systems and bus systems remain largely open and \nunsupervised. Meanwhile, our first responders lack both the staff and \nresources they need to protect lives and property. Hundreds of police \ndepartments--both large and small--have experienced alarming personnel \nshortages. A super majority of fire departments in this Nation does not \nhave the manpower required to meet the 21st century needs of their \ndistricts or municipalities.\n  As the Senate considered this legislation, I was pleased to lend my \nsupport to several amendments that sought to raise resources for \ncritical infrastructure protection and first responders. Among these \nmeasures were those to simplify homeland security grants, increase \nresources to local homeland security programs, enhance air cargo \nsecurity, increase truck security, ensure greater protection of our \nrail and transit systems and provide first responders with advanced \ncommunication systems. I also offered an amendment that would have \nincreased critical infrastructure security and first responder funding \nby $16 billion to a total of $20 billion. My amendment would have \ncodified a recommendation made 2 years ago by a task force chaired by \nour former colleague, Warren Rudman, along with a distinguished panel \nof national security, intelligence, military and public health \nofficials.\n  Regrettably, none of these measures was adopted. They were largely \nrejected because they exceeded the budget caps placed on the bill. \nMembers who spoke in opposition to these amendments argued that we \ncould not afford the extra cost. Instead of finding new resources, they \nsuggested using existing resources already in the bill to boost \ninfrastructure protection and first responders.\n  For this reason, I had to cast my vote against two amendments that \nwould have increased funding for first responder and border patrol \nsecurity by decreasing State homeland security grant and Coast Guard \nfunding. This kind of bureaucratic shell game is a wholly inadequate \nmeans to protect our critical infrastructure, our first responders and \nour borders. It entails investing in new resources to do what it is \nright to put our country on a more secure and sound footing.\n  Ironically, many of the Members who opposed these amendments have \nsupported permanent tax cuts for the most affluent of Americans--tax \ncuts that have been projected to cost $1 trillion over the next 15 \nyears. If we can afford to give such a generous tax break to the few \nthousand wealthiest Americans, then why can we not afford adequately to \nsafeguard 281 million Americans from terrorist attacks at a mere \nfraction of that cost?\n  We are living in extraordinary times. Never before in our history has \nthere been a period of time when the threat of harm to Americans on \ntheir own soil has been so high. While it has been almost 4 years since \nterrorists attacked the World Trade Center, the more recent attacks in \nMadrid and London tell us that we must remain vigilant about our \ndomestic security. They tell us that we must renew and redouble our \nefforts to prevent and respond to terrorism here at home.\n  I applaud Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff's decision earlier \nthis week to streamline his department's administrative bureaucracy. I \nbelieve that this will enable the Department to respond more \neffectively to the needs of our States and localities. At the same \ntime, I am deeply disturbed by the Secretary's comments yesterday which \nsuggested that transit security should be paid for entirely by States. \nI find this view to be dangerously outdated and incongruous with the \none needed to combat terrorism effectively. If the events of last week \ndid not remind us already, we no longer live in the 19th century but in \nthe 21st. Our very survival depends on planning and coordination that \ninvolves all levels of government. No one entity should bear the \nenormous financial burden of protecting Americans from terrorist \nattacks.\n  On balance, I voted for this legislation because the funding it \nappropriates is much better than nothing. However, I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues in the coming years to find and provide the \nnecessary resources that can make our Nation as safe and strong as it \ncan possibly be.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/18/senate-section/article/S8415-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8415-S8416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. DODD.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Oil and natural gas resources are strategic assets \n     critical to national security and the Nation's economic \n     prosperity.\n       (2) The National Security Strategy of the United States \n     approved by President George W. Bush on September 17, 2002, \n     concludes that the People's Republic of China remains \n     strongly committed to national one-party rule by the \n     Communist Party.\n       (3) On June 23, 2005, the China National Offshore Oil \n     Corporation Limited (CNOOC), announced its intent to acquire \n     Unocal Corporation, in the face of a competing bid for Unocal \n     Corporation from Chevron Corporation.\n       (4) The People's Republic of China owns approximately 70 \n     percent of CNOOC.\n       (5) A significant portion of the CNOOC acquisition is to be \n     financed and heavily subsidized by banks owned by the \n     People's Republic of China.\n       (6) Unocal Corporation is based in the United States, and \n     has approximately 1,750,000,000 barrels of oil equivalent, \n     with its core operating areas in Southeast Asia, Alaska, \n     Canada, and the lower 48 States.\n       (7) A CNOOC acquisition of Unocal Corporation would result \n     in the strategic assets of Unocal Corporation being \n     preferentially allocated to China by the Chinese Government.\n       (8) A Chinese Government acquisition of Unocal Corporation \n     would weaken the ability of the United States to influence \n     the oil and gas supplies of the Nation through companies that \n     must adhere to United States laws.\n       (9) As a de facto matter, the Chinese Government would not \n     allow the United States Government or United States investors \n     to acquire a controlling interest in a Chinese energy \n     company.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON SALE OF UNOCAL TO CNOOC.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the merger, \n     acquisition, or takeover of Unocal Corporation by CNOOC is \n     prohibited.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/18/senate-section/article/S8416-3", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8416-S8417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EDDIE ALBERT: IN MEMORIAM\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to honor an extraordinary actor, \nentertainer, and humanitarian. Upon his passing, Eddie Albert leaves a \nlegacy of talent, determination, and good will.\n  Eddie Albert Heimberger was born in Illinois on April 22, 1906, and \nmoved to Minneapolis as a child. It was there\n\n[[Page S8417]]\n\nthat Mr. Albert began his stage career, hosting magic shows and singing \nin small venues to put himself through drama school. After becoming a \ncrowd pleaser in Minnesota, he decided to pursue his creative passion \nin other cities and on the radio. After dropping his last name to avoid \nbeing mistakenly called Eddie Hamburger, he shifted his focus to \ncomedy. His success on the airwaves led to his 1935 Broadway debut in \nthe comedy ``O Evening Star.''\n  Mr. Albert went on to appear on Broadway several times before making \nit to Hollywood in 1937 as Bing Edwards in the film ``Brother Rat.'' \nHis fame grew, and in 1939 Mr. Albert started entertaining audiences as \nan aerialist and clown in a traveling Mexican circus. During his time \nthere, he began providing intelligence to the U.S. Government on \nJapanese and Nazi activity in Mexico. His career was put on hold when \nhe bravely served in the Marines during World War II. He was awarded \nthe Bronze Star for his courageous fighting in the Battle of Tarawa.\n  Upon returning from his service overseas, he started Eddie Albert \nProductions and worked behind the camera to make sex education films, a \nrarity in their time. One of his best known roles was in the 1960s \nsitcom ``Green Acres,'' in which he portrayed lawyer turned farmer \nOliver Wendell Douglas. Appearing in nearly 100 films, Mr. Albert \nearned two best supporting actor Academy Award nominations for his \nparts in ``Roman Holiday'' (1953) and ``The Heartbreak Kid'' (1972).\n  Throughout his lifetime, Mr. Albert traveled the world and became \ninterested in the fight against poverty and preserving the environment. \nIn the 1970s, he established the City Children's Farms and dedicated \nhis free time to publicly speaking about the importance of nutrition \nfor the world's children. He served as a special envoy for the \nphilanthropic mission ``Meals for Millions'' and as a consultant for \nthe World Hunger Conference. An avid outdoors man, Mr. Albert treasured \nthe beaches, trails, and wildlife near his home in Southern California. \nHe used his fame to bring much needed attention to the harmful effects \nof DDT and, on his birthday in 1970, Mr. Albert helped inaugurate the \nfirst Earth Day. Later that year, he and his wife opened a community \narts center in Los Angeles, which is still in operation today.\n  In 1945, Mr. Albert married actress Margo, nee Maria Marguerita \nGuadalupe Teresa Estela Bolado Castilla y O'Donnell. She preceded him \nin death in 1985. Eddie Albert died of pneumonia on May 26, 2005, at \nhis home in Pacific Palisades, CA. He is survived by his son, daughter, \nand two grandchildren. Whether as an entertainer or philanthropist, Mr. \nAlbert will be remembered for his passion and dedication to making \nothers smile. His talents and kindness will surely be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/18/senate-section/article/S8417-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/18/senate-section/article/S8417-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/18/senate-section/article/S8417-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/18/senate-section/article/S8417-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/18/senate-section/article/S8417-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/18/senate-section/article/S8417-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/18/senate-section/article/S8417-3", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:32 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2864.

A bill to enhance the adoption of a nationwide inter \noperable health information technology system and to improve the \nquality and reduce the costs of health care in the United States; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bipartisan bill \nto improve the quality and efficiency of health care by harnessing the \npotential of information technology. I am joined in this effort by \nSenators Kennedy, Frist and Clinton.\n  In recent weeks, Senator Kennedy and I introduced legislation to move \nour health care system into the electronic information age to serve \npatients better. Separately, Senators Frist and Clinton also introduced \na bill to spur the adoption of health information technology to improve \nhealth care quality.\n  Both of our bills were referred to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions, which I chair and on which we all \nserve. All of us put a lot of time and effort into crafting our bills, \nand we quickly realized that if we took the best of both of our bills \nand combined them into one, the whole would be much more than the sum \nof its parts.\n  All of us believe that if we move from a paper-based health care \nsystem to secure electronic medical records, we will reduce mistakes \nand save lives, time and money. And because we share this goal, we \nworked together to combine our bills into one piece of legislation that \nwill bring the government and the private sector together to make \nhealthcare better, safer and more efficient by accelerating the \nadoption of interoperable information technology across our healthcare \nsystem.\n  The sponsors of this bill span the political spectrum, but we still \nhave many things in common. One of our common bonds--in fact, one of \nthe things we have in common with all Americans--is that all of us are, \nor have been, or will someday be patients. And all of us either have \nstories to tell about frustrating experiences we've had, or that our \nfamily or friends have had, with navigating our health care system.\n  We have an outstanding health care system in the United States. \nThat's doesn't mean there isn't room for improvement, though. And one \nof the most important things we need to do in healthcare is to put \ninformation technology to work for patients, improving quality while \nreducing costs.\n  I want to thank Senators Kennedy, Frist and Clinton for working \ntogether in a spirit of bipartisan compromise to mold our separate \nbills into one measure that will advance our vision of the future of \nhealth care. We know President Bush shares our commitment, because he \nhas called for every American to have his or her own electronic health \nrecord by the middle of the next decade, and he has his Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services, Michael Leavitt, working assiduously toward \nthis objective.\n  So I look forward to working with Senators Kennedy, Frist, and \nClinton and the rest of my fellow Senators in the coming weeks and \nmonths to send this legislation to the President so that we can meet \nthe ambitious goals that we all share.\n\n[[Page S8421]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1418\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to enhance the adoption of a nationwide inter \noperable health information technology system and to improve the \nquality and reduce the costs of health care in the United States; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bipartisan bill \nto improve the quality and efficiency of health care by harnessing the \npotential of information technology. I am joined in this effort by \nSenators Kennedy, Frist and Clinton.\n  In recent weeks, Senator Kennedy and I introduced legislation to move \nour health care system into the electronic information age to serve \npatients better. Separately, Senators Frist and Clinton also introduced \na bill to spur the adoption of health information technology to improve \nhealth care quality.\n  Both of our bills were referred to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions, which I chair and on which we all \nserve. All of us put a lot of time and effort into crafting our bills, \nand we quickly realized that if we took the best of both of our bills \nand combined them into one, the whole would be much more than the sum \nof its parts.\n  All of us believe that if we move from a paper-based health care \nsystem to secure electronic medical records, we will reduce mistakes \nand save lives, time and money. And because we share this goal, we \nworked together to combine our bills into one piece of legislation that \nwill bring the government and the private sector together to make \nhealthcare better, safer and more efficient by accelerating the \nadoption of interoperable information technology across our healthcare \nsystem.\n  The sponsors of this bill span the political spectrum, but we still \nhave many things in common. One of our common bonds--in fact, one of \nthe things we have in common with all Americans--is that all of us are, \nor have been, or will someday be patients. And all of us either have \nstories to tell about frustrating experiences we've had, or that our \nfamily or friends have had, with navigating our health care system.\n  We have an outstanding health care system in the United States. \nThat's doesn't mean there isn't room for improvement, though. And one \nof the most important things we need to do in healthcare is to put \ninformation technology to work for patients, improving quality while \nreducing costs.\n  I want to thank Senators Kennedy, Frist and Clinton for working \ntogether in a spirit of bipartisan compromise to mold our separate \nbills into one measure that will advance our vision of the future of \nhealth care. We know President Bush shares our commitment, because he \nhas called for every American to have his or her own electronic health \nrecord by the middle of the next decade, and he has his Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services, Michael Leavitt, working assiduously toward \nthis objective.\n  So I look forward to working with Senators Kennedy, Frist, and \nClinton and the rest of my fellow Senators in the coming weeks and \nmonths to send this legislation to the President so that we can meet \nthe ambitious goals that we all share.\n\n[[Page S8421]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1418\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 198\n\n       Whereas, on May 9, 1945, Europe declared victory over the \n     oppression of the Nazi regime;\n       Whereas, Poland and other countries in Central, Eastern, \n     and Southern Europe soon fell under the oppressive control of \n     the Soviet Union;\n       Whereas for decades the people of Poland struggled \n     heroically for freedom and democracy against that oppression;\n       Whereas, in June 1979, Pope John Paul II, the former \n     Cardinal Karol Wojtyla, returned to Poland, his homeland, and \n     exhorted his countrymen to ``be not afraid'' of the Communist \n     regime;\n       Whereas, in 1980, the Solidarity Trade Union (known in \n     Poland as ``NSZZ Solidarnosc'') was formed in Poland under \n     the leadership of Lech Walesa and during the 1980s the \n     actions of its leadership and members sparked a great social \n     movement committed to promoting fundamental human rights, \n     democracy, and the independence of Poland from the Soviet \n     Union (known as the ``Solidarity Movement'');\n       Whereas, in July and August of 1980, workers in Poland in \n     the shipyards of Gdansk and Szczecin, led by Lech Walesa and \n     other leaders of the Solidarity Trade Union, went on strike \n     to demand greater political freedom;\n       Whereas that strike was carried out in a peaceful and \n     orderly manner;\n       Whereas, in August 1980, the Communist Government of Poland \n     yielded to the 21 demands of the striking workers, including \n     the release of all political prisoners, the broadcasting of \n     religious services on television and radio, and the right to \n     establish independent trade unions;\n       Whereas the Communist Government of Poland introduced \n     martial law in December 1981 in an attempt to block the \n     growing influence of the Solidarity Movement;\n       Whereas the support of the Polish-American community was \n     essential and crucial for the Solidarity Movement to survive \n     and remain active during that difficult time;\n       Whereas the people of the United States were greatly \n     supportive of the efforts of the people of Poland to rid \n     themselves of an oppressive government and people in the \n     United States lit candles in their homes on Christmas Eve \n     1981, to show their solidarity with the people of Poland who \n     were suffering under martial law;\n       Whereas Lech Walesa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in \n     1983 for continuing his struggle for freedom in Poland;\n       Whereas the Solidarity Movement persisted underground \n     during the period when martial law was imposed in Poland and \n     emerged in April 1989 as a powerful national movement;\n       Whereas, in February 1989, the Communist Government of \n     Poland agreed to conduct roundtable talks with leaders of the \n     Solidarity Movement;\n       Whereas such talks led to the holding of elections for the \n     National Assembly of Poland in June 1989 in which nearly all \n     open seats were won by candidates supported by the Solidarity \n     Movement, and led to the election of Poland's first Prime \n     Minister during the post-war era who was not a member of the \n     Communist party, Mr. Tadeusz Mazowiecki;\n       Whereas, the Solidarity Movement ended communism in Poland \n     without bloodshed and inspired Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and \n     other nations to do the same, and the activities of its \n     leaders and members were part of the historic series of \n     events that led to the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, \n     1989;\n       Whereas, on November 15, 1989, Lech Walesa's historic \n     speech before a joint session of Congress, beginning with the \n     words ``We the people'', stirred a standing ovation from the \n     Members of Congress;\n       Whereas, on December 9, 1989, Lech Walesa was elected \n     President of Poland; and\n       Whereas there is a bond of friendship between the United \n     States and Poland, which is a close and invaluable United \n     States ally, a contributing partner in the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization (NATO), a reliable partner in the war on \n     terrorism, and a key contributor to international efforts in \n     Iraq and Afghanistan: Now, therefore, let it be\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) declares August 31, 2005, to be Solidarity Day in the \n     United States to recognize the 25th anniversary of the \n     establishment in Poland of the Solidarity Trade Union (known \n     in Poland as the ``NSZZ Solidarnosc''), the first free and \n     independent trade union established in the Soviet-dominated \n     countries of Europe;\n       (2) honors the people of Poland who risked their lives to \n     restore liberty in Poland and to return Poland to the \n     democratic community of nations; and\n       (3) calls on the people of the United States to remember \n     the struggle and sacrifice of the people of Poland and that \n     the results of that struggle contributed to the fall of \n     communism and the ultimate end of the Cold War.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the birth of \none of the greatest democracy movements in the 20th century: the Polish \nSolidarity movement. I am proud to join my friend Senator Voinovich in \nsubmitting a sense of the Senate honoring the people of Poland on this \nspecial anniversary.\n  On August 31 of this year, Poland will celebrate the 25th anniversary \nof the 1980 shipyard strikes in Gdansk and the creation of the \nSolidarity Trade Union, the first independent union established behind \nthe Iron Curtain.\n  This date has a special meaning for me, and for the thousands of \nPolish Americans, who danced in the streets when Solidarity won freedom \nfor Poland after decades of war and oppression. The history of Poland \nhas, at times, been a melancholy one. Every king, kaiser, czar or \ncomrade who ever wanted to have a war in Europe always started by \ninvading Poland. But we know that while Poland was occupied, the heart \nand soul of the Polish nation has never been occupied. Poland has \nalways strived to be part of the West in terms of its values and its \norientation.\n  So in 1980, when an obscure electrician named Lech Walesa, working in \nthe Gdansk shipyard, jumped over a wall proclaiming the Solidarity \nmovement, he took the Polish people and the whole world with him, to \nbring down the Iron Curtain.\n  At first, we had reason to hope. The fledgling Solidarity movement \nwon a major victory in August 1980, forcing Poland's communist \ngovernment to accept a list of demands from the striking workers. The \ngovernment released political prisoners, promised to permit the \nbroadcast of religious services, and agreed to permit the activities of \nindependent trade unions.\n  But just before Christmas 1980, our hopes were dashed that Poland \nwould soon be free. The Soviets were worried\n\n[[Page S8427]]\n\nthat Solidarity's growing popularity threatened their tight grip on the \npeople of eastern Europe. Under pressure from Moscow, Poland's \ncommunist government declared martial law. Thousands of Solidarity \nleaders were arrested and imprisoned, including Lech Walesa. The \nborders were sealed, airports were closed and a curfew was imposed.\n  Through the dark days of martial law, Polish Americans stood by our \ncousins abroad, working to support the Solidarity movement. We found \nourselves troubled and fearful for our friends and relatives in Poland, \nbut we never doubted that Poland would one day regain its freedom. \nPolish peoples everywhere, whether we live here, as fully American \ncitizens, or in Poland, know that the heart and soul of Poland lie with \ndemocracy and lie with freedom.\n  Even though the Solidarity movement was driven underground, it \ncontinued to grow. Under Lech Walesa's leadership, and with the support \nof Poland's native son, Pope John Paul II, Solidarity grew from a trade \nunion into a national movement demanding freedom and independence for \nPoland.\n  In 1989, Solidarity won the right for the Polish people to hold \nelections for the National Assembly. They elected a majority in the \nAssembly supported by Solidarity and Poland's first non-communist Prime \nMinister in the post-war era.\n  Poland's peaceful march to freedom offered a beacon of hope to all \nthose in Europe suffering under communist rule. And in December 1989, \njust weeks after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Lech Walesa was elected \nPresident of Poland.\n  Today, the United States and Poland are close partners and good \nfriends. As Polish troops fight side-by-side with American troops in \nAfghanistan and Iraq, I hope our colleagues will join us in celebrating \nthe birth of the Solidarity movement and honoring the people of Poland, \nwhose heroic and peaceful resistance hastened the end of the Soviet \nUnion and the emergence of one Europe, whole and free.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of a \nresolution to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the Polish worker's \nstrike of 1980, an important day in history for Poland, Eastern Europe \nand for democracy world-wide.\n  In 1980, while Poland was still very much under the control of the \nformer Soviet Union, Lech Walesa formed the Solidarity Trade Union. In \nJuly and August of that year, he and other members of the Solidarity \nTrade Union led a worker's strike to demand greater political freedom \nin Poland.\n  That August, the Communist government in Poland yielded to the \ndemands of the workers. In doing so, Lech Walesa and the Solidarity \nTrade Union won the release of all political prisoners held by the \nPolish government, forced that government to broadcast religious \nservices on television and the radio, and won the right to establish \nother trade unions.\n  By late 1981, the Communist government, in an attempt to regain \nabsolute control, instituted martial law in order to drive Lech Walesa \nand the Solidarity Trade Union underground. However, the seeds of \nfreedom had already begun to grow in Poland, and throughout Eastern \nEurope.\n  On December 9, 1989, Lech Walesa was democratically elected President \nof Poland, signaling an end to Communist rule in Poland. Two years \nlater, that failed ideology was dead in the Soviet Union itself.\n  As a strong supporter of NATO expansion, I was proud to welcome \nPoland and two other former Warsaw Pact members into NATO in May of \n1999. I have long said that NATO expansion is the best way to guarantee \nthat freedom and democracy continue to thrive in Eastern Europe, \nSoutheastern Europe, and the Baltic states.

Res. 198\n\n       Whereas, on May 9, 1945, Europe declared victory over the \n     oppression of the Nazi regime;\n       Whereas, Poland and other countries in Central, Eastern, \n     and Southern Europe soon fell under the oppressive control of \n     the Soviet Union;\n       Whereas for decades the people of Poland struggled \n     heroically for freedom and democracy against that oppression;\n       Whereas, in June 1979, Pope John Paul II, the former \n     Cardinal Karol Wojtyla, returned to Poland, his homeland, and \n     exhorted his countrymen to ``be not afraid'' of the Communist \n     regime;\n       Whereas, in 1980, the Solidarity Trade Union (known in \n     Poland as ``NSZZ Solidarnosc'') was formed in Poland under \n     the leadership of Lech Walesa and during the 1980s the \n     actions of its leadership and members sparked a great social \n     movement committed to promoting fundamental human rights, \n     democracy, and the independence of Poland from the Soviet \n     Union (known as the ``Solidarity Movement'');\n       Whereas, in July and August of 1980, workers in Poland in \n     the shipyards of Gdansk and Szczecin, led by Lech Walesa and \n     other leaders of the Solidarity Trade Union, went on strike \n     to demand greater political freedom;\n       Whereas that strike was carried out in a peaceful and \n     orderly manner;\n       Whereas, in August 1980, the Communist Government of Poland \n     yielded to the 21 demands of the striking workers, including \n     the release of all political prisoners, the broadcasting of \n     religious services on television and radio, and the right to \n     establish independent trade unions;\n       Whereas the Communist Government of Poland introduced \n     martial law in December 1981 in an attempt to block the \n     growing influence of the Solidarity Movement;\n       Whereas the support of the Polish-American community was \n     essential and crucial for the Solidarity Movement to survive \n     and remain active during that difficult time;\n       Whereas the people of the United States were greatly \n     supportive of the efforts of the people of Poland to rid \n     themselves of an oppressive government and people in the \n     United States lit candles in their homes on Christmas Eve \n     1981, to show their solidarity with the people of Poland who \n     were suffering under martial law;\n       Whereas Lech Walesa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in \n     1983 for continuing his struggle for freedom in Poland;\n       Whereas the Solidarity Movement persisted underground \n     during the period when martial law was imposed in Poland and \n     emerged in April 1989 as a powerful national movement;\n       Whereas, in February 1989, the Communist Government of \n     Poland agreed to conduct roundtable talks with leaders of the \n     Solidarity Movement;\n       Whereas such talks led to the holding of elections for the \n     National Assembly of Poland in June 1989 in which nearly all \n     open seats were won by candidates supported by the Solidarity \n     Movement, and led to the election of Poland's first Prime \n     Minister during the post-war era who was not a member of the \n     Communist party, Mr. Tadeusz Mazowiecki;\n       Whereas, the Solidarity Movement ended communism in Poland \n     without bloodshed and inspired Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and \n     other nations to do the same, and the activities of its \n     leaders and members were part of the historic series of \n     events that led to the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, \n     1989;\n       Whereas, on November 15, 1989, Lech Walesa's historic \n     speech before a joint session of Congress, beginning with the \n     words ``We the people'', stirred a standing ovation from the \n     Members of Congress;\n       Whereas, on December 9, 1989, Lech Walesa was elected \n     President of Poland; and\n       Whereas there is a bond of friendship between the United \n     States and Poland, which is a close and invaluable United \n     States ally, a contributing partner in the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization (NATO), a reliable partner in the war on \n     terrorism, and a key contributor to international efforts in \n     Iraq and Afghanistan: Now, therefore, let it be\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) declares August 31, 2005, to be Solidarity Day in the \n     United States to recognize the 25th anniversary of the \n     establishment in Poland of the Solidarity Trade Union (known \n     in Poland as the ``NSZZ Solidarnosc''), the first free and \n     independent trade union established in the Soviet-dominated \n     countries of Europe;\n       (2) honors the people of Poland who risked their lives to \n     restore liberty in Poland and to return Poland to the \n     democratic community of nations; and\n       (3) calls on the people of the United States to remember \n     the struggle and sacrifice of the people of Poland and that \n     the results of that struggle contributed to the fall of \n     communism and the ultimate end of the Cold War.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the birth of \none of the greatest democracy movements in the 20th century: the Polish \nSolidarity movement. I am proud to join my friend Senator Voinovich in \nsubmitting a sense of the Senate honoring the people of Poland on this \nspecial anniversary.\n  On August 31 of this year, Poland will celebrate the 25th anniversary \nof the 1980 shipyard strikes in Gdansk and the creation of the \nSolidarity Trade Union, the first independent union established behind \nthe Iron Curtain.\n  This date has a special meaning for me, and for the thousands of \nPolish Americans, who danced in the streets when Solidarity won freedom \nfor Poland after decades of war and oppression. The history of Poland \nhas, at times, been a melancholy one. Every king, kaiser, czar or \ncomrade who ever wanted to have a war in Europe always started by \ninvading Poland. But we know that while Poland was occupied, the heart \nand soul of the Polish nation has never been occupied. Poland has \nalways strived to be part of the West in terms of its values and its \norientation.\n  So in 1980, when an obscure electrician named Lech Walesa, working in \nthe Gdansk shipyard, jumped over a wall proclaiming the Solidarity \nmovement, he took the Polish people and the whole world with him, to \nbring down the Iron Curtain.\n  At first, we had reason to hope. The fledgling Solidarity movement \nwon a major victory in August 1980, forcing Poland's communist \ngovernment to accept a list of demands from the striking workers. The \ngovernment released political prisoners, promised to permit the \nbroadcast of religious services, and agreed to permit the activities of \nindependent trade unions.\n  But just before Christmas 1980, our hopes were dashed that Poland \nwould soon be free. The Soviets were worried\n\n[[Page S8427]]\n\nthat Solidarity's growing popularity threatened their tight grip on the \npeople of eastern Europe. Under pressure from Moscow, Poland's \ncommunist government declared martial law. Thousands of Solidarity \nleaders were arrested and imprisoned, including Lech Walesa. The \nborders were sealed, airports were closed and a curfew was imposed.\n  Through the dark days of martial law, Polish Americans stood by our \ncousins abroad, working to support the Solidarity movement. We found \nourselves troubled and fearful for our friends and relatives in Poland, \nbut we never doubted that Poland would one day regain its freedom. \nPolish peoples everywhere, whether we live here, as fully American \ncitizens, or in Poland, know that the heart and soul of Poland lie with \ndemocracy and lie with freedom.\n  Even though the Solidarity movement was driven underground, it \ncontinued to grow. Under Lech Walesa's leadership, and with the support \nof Poland's native son, Pope John Paul II, Solidarity grew from a trade \nunion into a national movement demanding freedom and independence for \nPoland.\n  In 1989, Solidarity won the right for the Polish people to hold \nelections for the National Assembly. They elected a majority in the \nAssembly supported by Solidarity and Poland's first non-communist Prime \nMinister in the post-war era.\n  Poland's peaceful march to freedom offered a beacon of hope to all \nthose in Europe suffering under communist rule. And in December 1989, \njust weeks after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Lech Walesa was elected \nPresident of Poland.\n  Today, the United States and Poland are close partners and good \nfriends. As Polish troops fight side-by-side with American troops in \nAfghanistan and Iraq, I hope our colleagues will join us in celebrating \nthe birth of the Solidarity movement and honoring the people of Poland, \nwhose heroic and peaceful resistance hastened the end of the Soviet \nUnion and the emergence of one Europe, whole and free.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of a \nresolution to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the Polish worker's \nstrike of 1980, an important day in history for Poland, Eastern Europe \nand for democracy world-wide.\n  In 1980, while Poland was still very much under the control of the \nformer Soviet Union, Lech Walesa formed the Solidarity Trade Union. In \nJuly and August of that year, he and other members of the Solidarity \nTrade Union led a worker's strike to demand greater political freedom \nin Poland.\n  That August, the Communist government in Poland yielded to the \ndemands of the workers. In doing so, Lech Walesa and the Solidarity \nTrade Union won the release of all political prisoners held by the \nPolish government, forced that government to broadcast religious \nservices on television and the radio, and won the right to establish \nother trade unions.\n  By late 1981, the Communist government, in an attempt to regain \nabsolute control, instituted martial law in order to drive Lech Walesa \nand the Solidarity Trade Union underground. However, the seeds of \nfreedom had already begun to grow in Poland, and throughout Eastern \nEurope.\n  On December 9, 1989, Lech Walesa was democratically elected President \nof Poland, signaling an end to Communist rule in Poland. Two years \nlater, that failed ideology was dead in the Soviet Union itself.\n  As a strong supporter of NATO expansion, I was proud to welcome \nPoland and two other former Warsaw Pact members into NATO in May of \n1999. I have long said that NATO expansion is the best way to guarantee \nthat freedom and democracy continue to thrive in Eastern Europe, \nSoutheastern Europe, and the Baltic states. The acceptance of Poland \ninto the alliance, as well as the acceptance of eight other former \nEastern Bloc nations, may not have been possible were it not for the \nPolish worker's strike of 1980.\n  Now, twenty-five years after the historic strike, Poland has become a \nstaunch ally of the United States. Poland's contributions to the war on \nterror have been tremendous.\n  Today, we honor Lech Walesa and the people of Poland who risked their \nlives to restore liberty in Poland and to return Poland to the \ndemocratic community of nations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/18/senate-section/article/S8427-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 199--TO AUTHORIZE THE PRODUCTION OF RECORDS BY THE \n PERMANENT SUBCOMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATIONS OF THE COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND \n                   SECURITY AND GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. FRIST (for himself and Mr. Reid) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

(a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The plight of hundreds of thousands of child slaves \n     toiling in cocoa plantations in West Africa was reported in a \n     series by Knight Ridder newspapers in June 2001. (global)\n       (2) The report found that some of these children are sold \n     or tricked into slavery. Most of them are between the ages of \n     12 and 16 and some are as young as 9 years old.\n       (3) There are 1,500,000 farms in West Africa that produce \n     approximately 72 percent of the total global supply of cocoa, \n     with Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana producing about 62 percent and \n     22 percent, respectively, of the total cocoa production in \n     Africa. Other key producers are Indonesia, Nigeria, Cameroon, \n     and Brazil.\n       (4) United States consumers purchase over $13,000,000,000 \n     in chocolate products annually.\n       (5) On September 19, 2001, representatives of the chocolate \n     industry signed a voluntary Protocol for the Growing and \n     Processing of Cocoa Beans and their Derivative Products in a \n     Manner that Complies with ILO Convention 182 Concerning the \n     Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the \n     Worst Forms of Child Labor.\n       (6) The Protocol outlines 6 steps the industry formally \n     agreed to undertake to end abusive and forced child labor on \n     cocoa farms by July 2005.\n       (7) A vital step of the Protocol was the development and \n     implementation by the industry of a credible, transparent, \n     and publicly accountable industry-wide certification system \n     to ensure, by July 1, 2005, that cocoa beans and their \n     derivative products have not been grown or processed by \n     abusive child labor or slave labor.\n       (8) Since the Protocol was signed, some positive steps have \n     been taken to address the worst forms of child labor and \n     slave labor in cocoa growing, but the July 1, 2005, deadline \n     for creation and implementation of the certification system \n     was not fully met.\n\n[[Page S8430]]\n\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the cocoa industry is to be commended, as the Protocol \n     agreement is the first time that an industry has accepted \n     moral, social, and financial responsibility for the \n     production of raw materials, wherever they are produced;\n       (2) the Government of the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire and the \n     Government of the Republic of Ghana should be commended for \n     the tangible steps they have taken to address the situation \n     of child labor in the cocoa sector;\n       (3) even though the cocoa industry did not fully meet the \n     July 1, 2005, deadline for creation and implementation of the \n     labor certification system, it has agreed to redouble its \n     efforts to achieve a certification system that will cover 50 \n     percent of the cocoa growing regions of Cote d'Ivoire and \n     Ghana by July 1, 2008;\n       (4) the cocoa industry should make every effort to meet \n     this deadline in Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana and expand the \n     certification process to other West African nations and any \n     other country where abusive child labor and slave labor are \n     used in the growing and processing of cocoa;\n       (5) an independent oversight body should be designated and \n     supported to work with the chocolate industry, national \n     governments, and nongovernmental organizations on the \n     progress of the development and implementation of the \n     certification system by July 1, 2008, through a series of \n     public reports;\n       (6) the governments of West African nations that grow and \n     manufacture cocoa should consider child labor and forced \n     labor issues of top priorities;\n       (7) the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons \n     of the Department of State should include information on the \n     association between trafficking in persons and the cocoa \n     industries of Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, and other cocoa producing \n     regions in the annual report on trafficking in persons that \n     is submitted to Congress; and\n       (8) the Department of State should assist the Government of \n     Cote d'Ivoire and the Government of Ghana in preventing the \n     trafficking of persons into the cocoa fields and other \n     industries in West Africa.\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1240.

(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The 2004 Report to Congress of the United States-China \n     Economic and Security Review Commission states that--\n       (A) China's State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) lack adequate \n     disclosure standards, which creates the potential for United \n     States investors to unwittingly contribute to enterprises \n     that are involved in activities harmful to United States \n     security interests;\n       (B) United States influence and vital long-term interests \n     in Asia are being challenged by China's robust regional \n     economic engagement and diplomacy;\n       (C) the assistance of China and North Korea to global \n     ballistic missile proliferation is extensive and ongoing;\n       (D) China's transfers of technology and components for \n     weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their delivery systems \n     to countries of concern, including countries that support \n     acts of international terrorism, has helped create a new tier \n     of countries with the capability to produce WMD and ballistic \n     missiles;\n       (E) the removal of the European Union arms embargo against \n     China that is currently under consideration in the European \n     Union would accelerate weapons modernization and dramatically \n     enhance Chinese military capabilities;\n       (F) China's recent actions toward Taiwan call into question \n     China's commitments to a peaceful resolution;\n       (G) China is developing a leading-edge military with the \n     objective of intimidating Taiwan and deterring United States \n     involvement in the Strait, and China's qualitative and \n     quantitative military advancements have already resulted in a \n     dramatic shift in the cross-Strait military balance toward \n     China; and\n       (H) China's growing energy needs are driving China into \n     bilateral arrangements that undermine multilateral efforts to \n     stabilize oil supplies and prices, and in some cases may \n     involve dangerous weapons transfers.\n       (2) On March 14, 2005, the National People's Congress \n     approved a law that would authorize the use of force if \n     Taiwan formally declares independence.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--\n       (1) Plan.--The President is strongly urged to take \n     immediate steps to establish a plan to implement the \n     recommendations contained in the 2004 Report to Congress of \n     the United States-China Economic and Security Review \n     Commission in order to correct the negative implications that \n     a number of current trends in United States-China relations \n     have for United States long-term economic and national \n     security interests.\n       (2) Contents.--Such a plan should contain the following:\n       (A) Actions to address China's policy of undervaluing its \n     currency, including--\n       (i) encouraging China to provide for a substantial upward \n     revaluation of the Chinese yuan against the United States \n     dollar;\n       (ii) allowing the yuan to float against a trade-weighted \n     basket of currencies; and\n       (iii) concurrently encouraging United States trading \n     partners with similar interests to join in these efforts.\n       (B) Actions to make better use of the World Trade \n     Organization (WTO) dispute settlement mechanism and \n     applicable United States trade laws to redress China's unfair \n     trade practices, including China's exchange rate \n     manipulation, denial of trading and distribution rights, lack \n     of intellectual property rights protection, objectionable \n     labor standards, subsidization of exports, and forced \n     technology transfers as a condition of doing business. The \n     United States Trade Representative should consult with our \n     trading partners regarding any trade dispute with China.\n       (C) Actions to encourage United States diplomatic efforts \n     to identify and pursue initiatives to revitalize United \n     States engagement with China's Asian neighbors. The \n     initiatives should have a regional focus and complement \n     bilateral efforts. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation \n     forum (APEC) offers a ready mechanism for pursuit of such \n     initiatives.\n       (D) Actions by the administration to hold China accountable \n     for proliferation of prohibited technologies and to secure \n     China's agreement to renew efforts to curtail North Korea's \n     commercial export of ballistic missiles.\n       (E) Actions to encourage the creation of a new United \n     Nations framework for monitoring the proliferation of WMD and \n     their delivery systems in conformance with member nations' \n     obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the \n     Biological Weapons Convention, and the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention. The new monitoring body should be delegated \n     authority to apply sanctions to countries violating these \n     treaties in a timely manner, or, alternatively, should be \n     required to report all violations in a timely manner to the \n     Security Council for discussion and sanctions.\n       (F) Actions by the administration to conduct a fresh \n     assessment of the ``One China'' policy, given the changing \n     realities in China and Taiwan. This should include a review \n     of--\n       (i) the policy's successes, failures, and continued \n     viability;\n       (ii) whether changes may be needed in the way the United \n     States Government coordinates its defense assistance to \n     Taiwan, including the need for an enhanced operating \n     relationship between United States and Taiwan defense \n     officials and the establishment of a United States-Taiwan \n     hotline for dealing with crisis situations;\n       (iii) how United States policy can better support Taiwan's \n     breaking out of the international economic isolation that \n     China seeks to impose on it and whether this issue\n\n[[Page S8431]]\n\n     should be higher on the agenda in United States-China \n     relations; and\n       (iv) economic and trade policy measures that could help \n     ameliorate Taiwan's marginalization in the Asian regional \n     economy, including policy measures such as enhanced United \n     States-Taiwan bilateral trade arrangements that would include \n     protections for labor rights, the environment, and other \n     important United States interests.\n       (G) Actions by the Secretaries of State and Energy to \n     consult with the International Energy Agency with the \n     objective of upgrading the current loose experience-sharing \n     arrangement, whereby China engages in some limited exchanges \n     with the organization, to a more structured arrangement \n     whereby China would be obligated to develop a meaningful \n     strategic oil reserve, and coordinate release of stocks in \n     supply-disruption crises or speculator-driven price spikes.\n       (H) Actions by the administration to develop and publish a \n     coordinated, comprehensive national policy and strategy \n     designed to meet China's challenge to maintaining United \n     States scientific and technological leadership and \n     competitiveness in the same way the administration is \n     presently required to develop and publish a national security \n     strategy.\n       (I) Actions to revise the law governing the Committee on \n     Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), including \n     expanding the definition of national security to include the \n     potential impact on national economic security as a criterion \n     to be reviewed, and transferring the chairmanship of CFIUS \n     from the Secretary of the Treasury to a more appropriate \n     executive branch agency.\n       (J) Actions by the President and the Secretaries of State \n     and Defense to press strongly their European Union \n     counterparts to maintain the EU arms embargo on China.\n       (K) Actions by the administration to restrict foreign \n     defense contractors, who sell sensitive military use \n     technology or weapons systems to China, from participating in \n     United States defense-related cooperative research, \n     development, and production programs. Actions by the \n     administration may be targeted to cover only those technology \n     areas involved in the transfer of military use technology or \n     weapons systems to China. The administration should provide a \n     comprehensive annual report to the appropriate committees of \n     Congress on the nature and scope of foreign military sales to \n     China, particularly sales by Russia and Israel.\n       (L) Any additional actions outlined in the 2004 Report to \n     Congress of the United States-China Economic and Security \n     Review Commission that affect the economic or national \n     security of the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1244.

Bush on September 17, 2002, \n     concludes that the People's Republic of China remains \n     strongly committed to national one-party rule by the \n     Communist Party.\n       (3) On June 23, 2005, the China National Offshore Oil \n     Corporation Limited (CNOOC), announced its intent to acquire \n     Unocal Corporation, in the face of a competing bid for Unocal \n     Corporation from Chevron Corporation.\n       (4) The People's Republic of China owns approximately 70 \n     percent of CNOOC.\n       (5) A significant portion of the CNOOC acquisition is to be \n     financed and heavily subsidized by banks owned by the \n     People's Republic of China.\n       (6) Unocal Corporation is based in the United States, and \n     has approximately 1,750,000,000 barrels of oil equivalent, \n     with its core operating areas in Southeast Asia, Alaska, \n     Canada, and the lower 48 States.\n       (7) A CNOOC acquisition of Unocal Corporation would result \n     in the strategic assets of Unocal Corporation being \n     preferentially allocated to China by the Chinese Government.\n       (8) A Chinese Government acquisition of Unocal Corporation \n     would weaken the ability of the United States to influence \n     the oil and gas supplies of the Nation through companies that \n     must adhere to United States laws.\n       (9) As a de facto matter, the Chinese Government would not \n     allow the United States Government or United States investors \n     to acquire a controlling interest in a Chinese energy \n     company.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON SALE OF UNOCAL TO CNOOC.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the merger, \n     acquisition, or takeover of Unocal Corporation by CNOOC is \n     prohibited.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1257.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN submitted an amendment intended to be \nproposed by her to the bill H.R. 3057, making appropriations for \nforeign operations, export financing, and related programs for the \nfiscal year ending September 30, 2006, and for other purposes; which \nwas ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       On page 326, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n\n\n                    NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY\n\n       Sec. 6113. (a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, \n     done at Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, and \n     entered into force March 5, 1970 (in this section referred to \n     as the ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty''), codifies one of \n     the most important international security arrangements in the \n     history of arms control, the arrangement by which states \n     without nuclear weapons pledge not to acquire them, states \n     with nuclear weapons commit to eventually eliminate them, and \n     nonnuclear states are allowed to use for peaceful purposes \n     nuclear technology under strict and verifiable control.\n       (2) The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is one of the most \n     widely supported multilateral agreements, with 188 countries \n     adhering to the Treaty.\n       (3) The Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty has encouraged \n     many countries to officially abandon nuclear weapons or \n     nuclear weapons programs, including Argentina, Belarus, \n     Brazil, Kazakhstan, Libya, South Africa, South Korea, \n     Ukraine, and Taiwan.\n       (4) At the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference, the \n     states-parties agreed to extend the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \n     Treaty indefinitely, to reaffirm the principles and \n     objectives of the Treaty, to strengthen the Treaty review \n     process, and to implement further specific and practical \n     steps on non-proliferation and disarmament.\n       (5) At the 2000 NPT Review Conference, the states-parties \n     agreed to further practical steps on non-proliferation and \n     disarmament.\n       (6) President George W. Bush stated on March 7, 2005, that \n     ``the NPT represents a key legal barrier to nuclear weapons \n     proliferation and makes a critical contribution to \n     international security,'' and that ``the United States is \n     firmly committed to its obligations under the NPT''.\n       (7) The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is \n     responsible for monitoring compliance with safeguard \n     agreements pursuant to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty \n     and reporting safeguard violations to the United Nations \n     Security Council.\n       (8) Presidents George W. Bush and Vladimir Putin stated on \n     February 24, 2005, that ``[w]e bear a special responsibility \n     for the security of nuclear weapons and fissile material in \n     order to ensure that there is no possibility such weapons or \n     materials would fall into terrorist hands''.\n       (9) Article IV of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty \n     calls for the fullest possible exchange of equipment and \n     materials for peaceful nuclear endeavors and allows states to \n     acquire sensitive technologies to produce nuclear fuel for \n     energy purposes but also recognizes that such fuel could be \n     used to secretly produce fissile material for nuclear weapons \n     programs or quickly produce such material if the state were \n     to decide to withdraw from the Treaty.\n       (10) The Government of North Korea ejected international \n     inspectors from that country in 2002, announced its \n     withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003, \n     has recently declared its possession of nuclear weapons, and \n     is in possession of facilities capable of producing \n     additional nuclear weapons-usable material.\n       (11) The Government of Iran has pursued an undeclared \n     program to develop a uranium enrichment capacity, repeatedly \n     failed to\n\n[[Page S8434]]\n\n     fully comply with and provide full information to the IAEA \n     regarding its nuclear activities, and stated that it will not \n     permanently abandon its uranium enrichment program which it \n     has temporarily suspended through an agreement with the \n     European Union.\n       (12) The network of arms traffickers associated with A.Q. \n     Khan has facilitated black-market nuclear transfers involving \n     several countries, including Iran, Libya, and North Korea, \n     and represents a new and dangerous form of proliferation.\n       (13) Governments should cooperate to control exports of and \n     interdict illegal transfers of sensitive nuclear and missile-\n     related technologies to prevent their proliferation.\n       (14) The United Nations Secretary-General's High-Level \n     Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change concluded that \n     ``[a]lmost 60 States currently operate or are constructing \n     nuclear power or research reactors, and at least 40 possess \n     the industrial and scientific infrastructure which would \n     enable them, if they chose, to build nuclear weapons at \n     relatively short notice if the legal and normative \n     constraints of the Treaty regime no longer apply,'' and \n     warned that ``[w]e are approaching a point at which the \n     erosion of the non-proliferation regime could become \n     irreversible and result in a cascade of proliferation''.\n       (15) Stronger international support and cooperation to \n     achieve universal compliance with tighter nuclear non-\n     proliferation rules and standards constitute essential \n     elements of nuclear non-proliferation efforts.\n       (16) Sustained leadership by the United States Government \n     is essential to help implement existing legal and political \n     commitments established by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \n     Treaty and to realize a more robust and effective global \n     nuclear non-proliferation system.\n       (17) The governments of the United States and other \n     countries should pursue a comprehensive and balanced approach \n     to strengthen the global nuclear non-proliferation system.\n       (b) Congress--\n       (1) reaffirms its support for the objectives of the Nuclear \n     Non-Proliferation Treaty and expresses its support for all \n     appropriate measures to strengthen the Treaty and to attain \n     its objectives; and\n       (2) calls on all parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \n     Treaty--\n       (A) to insist on strict compliance with the non-\n     proliferation obligations of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \n     Treaty and to undertake effective enforcement measures \n     against states that are in violation of their Article I or \n     Article II obligations under the Treaty;\n       (B) to agree to establish more effective controls on \n     sensitive technologies that can be used to produce materials \n     for nuclear weapons;\n       (C) to expand the ability of the International Atomic \n     Energy Agency to inspect and monitor compliance with non-\n     proliferation rules and standards to which all states should \n     adhere through existing authority and the additional \n     protocols signed by the states party to the Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty;\n       (D) to demonstrate the international community's unified \n     opposition to a nuclear weapons program in Iran by--\n       (i) supporting the efforts of the United States and the \n     European Union to prevent the Government of Iran from \n     acquiring a nuclear weapons capability; and\n       (ii) using all appropriate diplomatic and other means at \n     their disposal to convince the Government of Iran to abandon \n     its uranium enrichment program;\n       (E) to strongly support the ongoing United States \n     diplomatic efforts in the context of the six-party talks that \n     seek the verifiable and incontrovertible dismantlement of \n     North Korea's nuclear weapons programs and to use all \n     appropriate diplomatic and other means to achieve this \n     result;\n       (F) to pursue diplomacy designed to address the underlying \n     regional security problems in Northeast Asia, South Asia, and \n     the Middle East, which would facilitate non-proliferation and \n     disarmament efforts in those regions;\n       (G) to accelerate programs to safeguard and eliminate \n     nuclear weapons-usable material to the highest standards to \n     prevent access by terrorists and governments;\n       (H) to halt the use of highly enriched uranium in civilian \n     reactors;\n       (I) to strengthen national and international export \n     controls and relevant security measures as required by United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 1540;\n       (J) to agree that no state may withdraw from the Nuclear \n     Non-Proliferation Treaty and escape responsibility for prior \n     violations of the Treaty or retain access to controlled \n     materials and equipment acquired for ``peaceful'' purposes;\n       (K) to accelerate implementation of disarmament obligations \n     and commitments under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty \n     for the purpose of reducing the world's stockpiles of nuclear \n     weapons and weapons-grade fissile material; and\n       (L) to strengthen and expand support for the Proliferation \n     Security Initiative.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1259.

(a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The plight of hundreds of thousands of child slaves \n     toiling in cocoa plantations in West Africa was reported in a \n     series by Knight Ridder newspapers in June 2001. (global)\n       (2) The report found that some of these children are sold \n     or tricked into slavery. Most of them are between the ages of \n     12 and 16 and some are as young as 9 years old.\n       (3) There are 1,500,000 farms in West Africa that produce \n     approximately 72 percent of the total global supply of cocoa, \n     with Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana producing about 62 percent and \n     22 percent, respectively, of the total cocoa production in \n     Africa. Other key producers are Indonesia, Nigeria, Cameroon, \n     and Brazil.\n       (4) United States consumers purchase over $13,000,000,000 \n     in chocolate products annually.\n       (5) On September 19, 2001, representatives of the chocolate \n     industry signed a voluntary Protocol for the Growing and \n     Processing of Cocoa Beans and their Derivative Products in a \n     Manner that Complies with ILO Convention 182 Concerning the \n     Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the \n     Worst Forms of Child Labor.\n       (6) The Protocol outlines 6 steps the industry formally \n     agreed to undertake to end abusive and forced child labor on \n     cocoa farms by July 2005.\n       (7) A vital step of the Protocol was the development and \n     implementation by the industry of a credible, transparent, \n     and publicly accountable industry-wide certification system \n     to ensure, by July 1, 2005, that cocoa beans and their \n     derivative products have not been grown or processed by \n     abusive child labor or slave labor.\n       (8) Since the Protocol was signed, some positive steps have \n     been taken to address the worst forms of child labor and \n     slave labor in cocoa growing, but the July 1, 2005, deadline \n     for creation and implementation of the certification system \n     was not fully met.\n\n[[Page S8430]]\n\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the cocoa industry is to be commended, as the Protocol \n     agreement is the first time that an industry has accepted \n     moral, social, and financial responsibility for the \n     production of raw materials, wherever they are produced;\n       (2) the Government of the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire and the \n     Government of the Republic of Ghana should be commended for \n     the tangible steps they have taken to address the situation \n     of child labor in the cocoa sector;\n       (3) even though the cocoa industry did not fully meet the \n     July 1, 2005, deadline for creation and implementation of the \n     labor certification system, it has agreed to redouble its \n     efforts to achieve a certification system that will cover 50 \n     percent of the cocoa growing regions of Cote d'Ivoire and \n     Ghana by July 1, 2008;\n       (4) the cocoa industry should make every effort to meet \n     this deadline in Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana and expand the \n     certification process to other West African nations and any \n     other country where abusive child labor and slave labor are \n     used in the growing and processing of cocoa;\n       (5) an independent oversight body should be designated and \n     supported to work with the chocolate industry, national \n     governments, and nongovernmental organizations on the \n     progress of the development and implementation of the \n     certification system by July 1, 2008, through a series of \n     public reports;\n       (6) the governments of West African nations that grow and \n     manufacture cocoa should consider child labor and forced \n     labor issues of top priorities;\n       (7) the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons \n     of the Department of State should include information on the \n     association between trafficking in persons and the cocoa \n     industries of Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, and other cocoa producing \n     regions in the annual report on trafficking in persons that \n     is submitted to Congress; and\n       (8) the Department of State should assist the Government of \n     Cote d'Ivoire and the Government of Ghana in preventing the \n     trafficking of persons into the cocoa fields and other \n     industries in West Africa.\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1240.

(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The 2004 Report to Congress of the United States-China \n     Economic and Security Review Commission states that--\n       (A) China's State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) lack adequate \n     disclosure standards, which creates the potential for United \n     States investors to unwittingly contribute to enterprises \n     that are involved in activities harmful to United States \n     security interests;\n       (B) United States influence and vital long-term interests \n     in Asia are being challenged by China's robust regional \n     economic engagement and diplomacy;\n       (C) the assistance of China and North Korea to global \n     ballistic missile proliferation is extensive and ongoing;\n       (D) China's transfers of technology and components for \n     weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their delivery systems \n     to countries of concern, including countries that support \n     acts of international terrorism, has helped create a new tier \n     of countries with the capability to produce WMD and ballistic \n     missiles;\n       (E) the removal of the European Union arms embargo against \n     China that is currently under consideration in the European \n     Union would accelerate weapons modernization and dramatically \n     enhance Chinese military capabilities;\n       (F) China's recent actions toward Taiwan call into question \n     China's commitments to a peaceful resolution;\n       (G) China is developing a leading-edge military with the \n     objective of intimidating Taiwan and deterring United States \n     involvement in the Strait, and China's qualitative and \n     quantitative military advancements have already resulted in a \n     dramatic shift in the cross-Strait military balance toward \n     China; and\n       (H) China's growing energy needs are driving China into \n     bilateral arrangements that undermine multilateral efforts to \n     stabilize oil supplies and prices, and in some cases may \n     involve dangerous weapons transfers.\n       (2) On March 14, 2005, the National People's Congress \n     approved a law that would authorize the use of force if \n     Taiwan formally declares independence.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--\n       (1) Plan.--The President is strongly urged to take \n     immediate steps to establish a plan to implement the \n     recommendations contained in the 2004 Report to Congress of \n     the United States-China Economic and Security Review \n     Commission in order to correct the negative implications that \n     a number of current trends in United States-China relations \n     have for United States long-term economic and national \n     security interests.\n       (2) Contents.--Such a plan should contain the following:\n       (A) Actions to address China's policy of undervaluing its \n     currency, including--\n       (i) encouraging China to provide for a substantial upward \n     revaluation of the Chinese yuan against the United States \n     dollar;\n       (ii) allowing the yuan to float against a trade-weighted \n     basket of currencies; and\n       (iii) concurrently encouraging United States trading \n     partners with similar interests to join in these efforts.\n       (B) Actions to make better use of the World Trade \n     Organization (WTO) dispute settlement mechanism and \n     applicable United States trade laws to redress China's unfair \n     trade practices, including China's exchange rate \n     manipulation, denial of trading and distribution rights, lack \n     of intellectual property rights protection, objectionable \n     labor standards, subsidization of exports, and forced \n     technology transfers as a condition of doing business. The \n     United States Trade Representative should consult with our \n     trading partners regarding any trade dispute with China.\n       (C) Actions to encourage United States diplomatic efforts \n     to identify and pursue initiatives to revitalize United \n     States engagement with China's Asian neighbors. The \n     initiatives should have a regional focus and complement \n     bilateral efforts. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation \n     forum (APEC) offers a ready mechanism for pursuit of such \n     initiatives.\n       (D) Actions by the administration to hold China accountable \n     for proliferation of prohibited technologies and to secure \n     China's agreement to renew efforts to curtail North Korea's \n     commercial export of ballistic missiles.\n       (E) Actions to encourage the creation of a new United \n     Nations framework for monitoring the proliferation of WMD and \n     their delivery systems in conformance with member nations' \n     obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the \n     Biological Weapons Convention, and the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention. The new monitoring body should be delegated \n     authority to apply sanctions to countries violating these \n     treaties in a timely manner, or, alternatively, should be \n     required to report all violations in a timely manner to the \n     Security Council for discussion and sanctions.\n       (F) Actions by the administration to conduct a fresh \n     assessment of the ``One China'' policy, given the changing \n     realities in China and Taiwan. This should include a review \n     of--\n       (i) the policy's successes, failures, and continued \n     viability;\n       (ii) whether changes may be needed in the way the United \n     States Government coordinates its defense assistance to \n     Taiwan, including the need for an enhanced operating \n     relationship between United States and Taiwan defense \n     officials and the establishment of a United States-Taiwan \n     hotline for dealing with crisis situations;\n       (iii) how United States policy can better support Taiwan's \n     breaking out of the international economic isolation that \n     China seeks to impose on it and whether this issue\n\n[[Page S8431]]\n\n     should be higher on the agenda in United States-China \n     relations; and\n       (iv) economic and trade policy measures that could help \n     ameliorate Taiwan's marginalization in the Asian regional \n     economy, including policy measures such as enhanced United \n     States-Taiwan bilateral trade arrangements that would include \n     protections for labor rights, the environment, and other \n     important United States interests.\n       (G) Actions by the Secretaries of State and Energy to \n     consult with the International Energy Agency with the \n     objective of upgrading the current loose experience-sharing \n     arrangement, whereby China engages in some limited exchanges \n     with the organization, to a more structured arrangement \n     whereby China would be obligated to develop a meaningful \n     strategic oil reserve, and coordinate release of stocks in \n     supply-disruption crises or speculator-driven price spikes.\n       (H) Actions by the administration to develop and publish a \n     coordinated, comprehensive national policy and strategy \n     designed to meet China's challenge to maintaining United \n     States scientific and technological leadership and \n     competitiveness in the same way the administration is \n     presently required to develop and publish a national security \n     strategy.\n       (I) Actions to revise the law governing the Committee on \n     Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), including \n     expanding the definition of national security to include the \n     potential impact on national economic security as a criterion \n     to be reviewed, and transferring the chairmanship of CFIUS \n     from the Secretary of the Treasury to a more appropriate \n     executive branch agency.\n       (J) Actions by the President and the Secretaries of State \n     and Defense to press strongly their European Union \n     counterparts to maintain the EU arms embargo on China.\n       (K) Actions by the administration to restrict foreign \n     defense contractors, who sell sensitive military use \n     technology or weapons systems to China, from participating in \n     United States defense-related cooperative research, \n     development, and production programs. Actions by the \n     administration may be targeted to cover only those technology \n     areas involved in the transfer of military use technology or \n     weapons systems to China. The administration should provide a \n     comprehensive annual report to the appropriate committees of \n     Congress on the nature and scope of foreign military sales to \n     China, particularly sales by Russia and Israel.\n       (L) Any additional actions outlined in the 2004 Report to \n     Congress of the United States-China Economic and Security \n     Review Commission that affect the economic or national \n     security of the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1244.

PROTECTION FROM SEXUAL EXPLOITATION AND ABUSE FOR \n                   INDIVIDUALS AFFECTED BY A HUMANITARIAN \n                   EMERGENCY.\n\n       (a) Not less than $10,000,000 of the amount made available \n     in title III under the heading ``Migration and Refugee \n     Assistance'' and $5,000,000 of the amount made available in \n     title III under the heading ``International Disaster and \n     Famine Assistance'' should be made available to provide \n     assistance for programs, projects, and activities--\n       (1) to promote the security, provide equal access to basic \n     services, and safeguard the legal and human rights of \n     civilians, especially women and children, who are affected by \n     a humanitarian emergency, including programs to build the \n     capacity of nongovernmental organizations to address the \n     special protection needs of vulnerable populations, \n     especially such women and children;\n       (2) to support local and international nongovernmental \n     initiatives to prevent, detect, and report exploitation of \n     children and sexual exploitation and abuse, including through \n     the provision of training humanitarian protection monitors \n     for refugees and internally displaced persons; and\n       (3) to conduct protection and security assessments for \n     refugees and internally displaced persons in camps or in \n     communities for the purpose of improving the design and \n     security of camps for refugees and internally displaced \n     persons, with special emphasis on the security of women and \n     children.\n       (b) None of the funds made available for foreign \n     operations, export financing, and related programs under the \n     headings ``Migration and Refugee Assistance'', ``United \n     States Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund'', \n     ``International Disaster and Famine Assistance'', or \n     ``Transition Initiatives'' may be obligated to an \n     organization that fails to adopt a code of conduct that \n     provides for the protection of beneficiaries of assistance \n     under any such heading from sexual exploitation and abuse in \n     humanitarian relief operations.\n       (c) The code of conduct referred to in subsection (b) \n     shall, to the maximum extent practicable, be consistent with \n     the following six core principles of the Inter-Agency \n     Standing Committee Task Force on Protection From Sexual \n     Exploitation and Abuse in Humanitarian Crises, as follows:\n       (1) Sexual exploitation and abuse by humanitarian workers \n     constitute acts of gross misconduct and are therefore grounds \n     for termination of employment.\n       (2) Sexual activity with children (persons under the age of \n     18) is prohibited regardless of the age of majority or age of \n     consent locally. Mistaken belief regarding the age of a child \n     is not a defense.\n       (3) Exchange of money, employment, goods, or services for \n     sex, including sexual favors or other forms of humiliating, \n     degrading or exploitative behavior, is prohibited. This \n     includes exchange of assistance that is due to beneficiaries.\n       (4) Sexual relationships between humanitarian workers and \n     beneficiaries are strongly discouraged since they are based \n     on inherently unequal power dynamics. Such relationships \n     undermine the credibility and integrity of humanitarian aid \n     work.\n       (5) Where a humanitarian worker develops concerns or \n     suspicions regarding sexual abuse or exploitation by a fellow \n     worker, whether in the same agency or not, the worker must \n     report such concerns via established agency reporting \n     mechanisms.\n       (6) Humanitarian agencies are obliged to create and \n     maintain an environment which prevents sexual exploitation \n     and abuse and promotes the implementation of their code of \n     conduct. Managers at all levels have particular \n     responsibilities to support and develop systems which \n     maintain this environment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1253.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Oil and natural gas resources are strategic assets \n     critical to national security and the Nation's economic \n     prosperity.\n       (2) The National Security Strategy of the United States \n     approved by President George W. Bush on September 17, 2002, \n     concludes that the People's Republic of China remains \n     strongly committed to national one-party rule by the \n     Communist Party.\n       (3) On June 23, 2005, the China National Offshore Oil \n     Corporation Limited (CNOOC), announced its intent to acquire \n     Unocal Corporation, in the face of a competing bid for Unocal \n     Corporation from Chevron Corporation.\n       (4) The People's Republic of China owns approximately 70 \n     percent of CNOOC.\n       (5) A significant portion of the CNOOC acquisition is to be \n     financed and heavily subsidized by banks owned by the \n     People's Republic of China.\n       (6) Unocal Corporation is based in the United States, and \n     has approximately 1,750,000,000 barrels of oil equivalent, \n     with its core operating areas in Southeast Asia, Alaska, \n     Canada, and the lower 48 States.\n       (7) A CNOOC acquisition of Unocal Corporation would result \n     in the strategic assets of Unocal Corporation being \n     preferentially allocated to China by the Chinese Government.\n       (8) A Chinese Government acquisition of Unocal Corporation \n     would weaken the ability of the United States to influence \n     the oil and gas supplies of the Nation through companies that \n     must adhere to United States laws.\n       (9) As a de facto matter, the Chinese Government would not \n     allow the United States Government or United States investors \n     to acquire a controlling interest in a Chinese energy \n     company.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON SALE OF UNOCAL TO CNOOC.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the merger, \n     acquisition, or takeover of Unocal Corporation by CNOOC is \n     prohibited.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1257.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN submitted an amendment intended to be \nproposed by her to the bill H.R. 3057, making appropriations for \nforeign operations, export financing, and related programs for the \nfiscal year ending September 30, 2006, and for other purposes; which \nwas ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       On page 326, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n\n\n                    NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY\n\n       Sec. 6113. (a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, \n     done at Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, and \n     entered into force March 5, 1970 (in this section referred to \n     as the ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty''), codifies one of \n     the most important international security arrangements in the \n     history of arms control, the arrangement by which states \n     without nuclear weapons pledge not to acquire them, states \n     with nuclear weapons commit to eventually eliminate them, and \n     nonnuclear states are allowed to use for peaceful purposes \n     nuclear technology under strict and verifiable control.\n       (2) The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is one of the most \n     widely supported multilateral agreements, with 188 countries \n     adhering to the Treaty.\n       (3) The Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty has encouraged \n     many countries to officially abandon nuclear weapons or \n     nuclear weapons programs, including Argentina, Belarus, \n     Brazil, Kazakhstan, Libya, South Africa, South Korea, \n     Ukraine, and Taiwan.\n       (4) At the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference, the \n     states-parties agreed to extend the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \n     Treaty indefinitely, to reaffirm the principles and \n     objectives of the Treaty, to strengthen the Treaty review \n     process, and to implement further specific and practical \n     steps on non-proliferation and disarmament.\n       (5) At the 2000 NPT Review Conference, the states-parties \n     agreed to further practical steps on non-proliferation and \n     disarmament.\n       (6) President George W. Bush stated on March 7, 2005, that \n     ``the NPT represents a key legal barrier to nuclear weapons \n     proliferation and makes a critical contribution to \n     international security,'' and that ``the United States is \n     firmly committed to its obligations under the NPT''.\n       (7) The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is \n     responsible for monitoring compliance with safeguard \n     agreements pursuant to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty \n     and reporting safeguard violations to the United Nations \n     Security Council.\n       (8) Presidents George W. Bush and Vladimir Putin stated on \n     February 24, 2005, that ``[w]e bear a special responsibility \n     for the security of nuclear weapons and fissile material in \n     order to ensure that there is no possibility such weapons or \n     materials would fall into terrorist hands''.\n       (9) Article IV of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty \n     calls for the fullest possible exchange of equipment and \n     materials for peaceful nuclear endeavors and allows states to \n     acquire sensitive technologies to produce nuclear fuel for \n     energy purposes but also recognizes that such fuel could be \n     used to secretly produce fissile material for nuclear weapons \n     programs or quickly produce such material if the state were \n     to decide to withdraw from the Treaty.\n       (10) The Government of North Korea ejected international \n     inspectors from that country in 2002, announced its \n     withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003, \n     has recently declared its possession of nuclear weapons, and \n     is in possession of facilities capable of producing \n     additional nuclear weapons-usable material.\n       (11) The Government of Iran has pursued an undeclared \n     program to develop a uranium enrichment capacity, repeatedly \n     failed to\n\n[[Page S8434]]\n\n     fully comply with and provide full information to the IAEA \n     regarding its nuclear activities, and stated that it will not \n     permanently abandon its uranium enrichment program which it \n     has temporarily suspended through an agreement with the \n     European Union.\n       (12) The network of arms traffickers associated with A.Q. \n     Khan has facilitated black-market nuclear transfers involving \n     several countries, including Iran, Libya, and North Korea, \n     and represents a new and dangerous form of proliferation.\n       (13) Governments should cooperate to control exports of and \n     interdict illegal transfers of sensitive nuclear and missile-\n     related technologies to prevent their proliferation.\n       (14) The United Nations Secretary-General's High-Level \n     Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change concluded that \n     ``[a]lmost 60 States currently operate or are constructing \n     nuclear power or research reactors, and at least 40 possess \n     the industrial and scientific infrastructure which would \n     enable them, if they chose, to build nuclear weapons at \n     relatively short notice if the legal and normative \n     constraints of the Treaty regime no longer apply,'' and \n     warned that ``[w]e are approaching a point at which the \n     erosion of the non-proliferation regime could become \n     irreversible and result in a cascade of proliferation''.\n       (15) Stronger international support and cooperation to \n     achieve universal compliance with tighter nuclear non-\n     proliferation rules and standards constitute essential \n     elements of nuclear non-proliferation efforts.\n       (16) Sustained leadership by the United States Government \n     is essential to help implement existing legal and political \n     commitments established by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \n     Treaty and to realize a more robust and effective global \n     nuclear non-proliferation system.\n       (17) The governments of the United States and other \n     countries should pursue a comprehensive and balanced approach \n     to strengthen the global nuclear non-proliferation system.\n       (b) Congress--\n       (1) reaffirms its support for the objectives of the Nuclear \n     Non-Proliferation Treaty and expresses its support for all \n     appropriate measures to strengthen the Treaty and to attain \n     its objectives; and\n       (2) calls on all parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \n     Treaty--\n       (A) to insist on strict compliance with the non-\n     proliferation obligations of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \n     Treaty and to undertake effective enforcement measures \n     against states that are in violation of their Article I or \n     Article II obligations under the Treaty;\n       (B) to agree to establish more effective controls on \n     sensitive technologies that can be used to produce materials \n     for nuclear weapons;\n       (C) to expand the ability of the International Atomic \n     Energy Agency to inspect and monitor compliance with non-\n     proliferation rules and standards to which all states should \n     adhere through existing authority and the additional \n     protocols signed by the states party to the Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty;\n       (D) to demonstrate the international community's unified \n     opposition to a nuclear weapons program in Iran by--\n       (i) supporting the efforts of the United States and the \n     European Union to prevent the Government of Iran from \n     acquiring a nuclear weapons capability; and\n       (ii) using all appropriate diplomatic and other means at \n     their disposal to convince the Government of Iran to abandon \n     its uranium enrichment program;\n       (E) to strongly support the ongoing United States \n     diplomatic efforts in the context of the six-party talks that \n     seek the verifiable and incontrovertible dismantlement of \n     North Korea's nuclear weapons programs and to use all \n     appropriate diplomatic and other means to achieve this \n     result;\n       (F) to pursue diplomacy designed to address the underlying \n     regional security problems in Northeast Asia, South Asia, and \n     the Middle East, which would facilitate non-proliferation and \n     disarmament efforts in those regions;\n       (G) to accelerate programs to safeguard and eliminate \n     nuclear weapons-usable material to the highest standards to \n     prevent access by terrorists and governments;\n       (H) to halt the use of highly enriched uranium in civilian \n     reactors;\n       (I) to strengthen national and international export \n     controls and relevant security measures as required by United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 1540;\n       (J) to agree that no state may withdraw from the Nuclear \n     Non-Proliferation Treaty and escape responsibility for prior \n     violations of the Treaty or retain access to controlled \n     materials and equipment acquired for ``peaceful'' purposes;\n       (K) to accelerate implementation of disarmament obligations \n     and commitments under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty \n     for the purpose of reducing the world's stockpiles of nuclear \n     weapons and weapons-grade fissile material;

CLAIR KILBY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 200, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 200) honoring the life of Nobel \n     Laureate Jack St. Clair Kilby, inventor of the integrated \n     circuit and innovative leader in the Information Age.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words about one \nof the greatest inventors--one of the most important innovators--in \nAmerican history.\n  One of America's greatest assets is the innovation and creativity of \nits inventors, scientists, and artists. Many of our most famous \ninventors have long been household names--well-known Americans such as \nThomas Jefferson, Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, and the Wright \nBrothers. These, and many other inventors, captured the imagination of \na public rooted in the Industrial Age, through ideas which produced the \ntelephone, the\n\n[[Page S8437]]\n\nautomobile, the airplane--all inventions we now consider indispensable \nitems.\n  We now find ourselves in the initial stages of a new revolution--the \nInformation Age. The rapid growth and development of information \ntechnology literally changes our lives by the second. This is an \nexciting time, and we have only just seen the beginning of this age.\n  However, the pioneers of today don't roll off the tongue like those \nfrom years past. While some high-profile corporate leaders such as Bill \nGates, Michael Dell, and other technology entrepreneurs come to mind, \nthere are many unsung heroes without whom we may never have known the \nmodern computer, the cell phone, or high-definition TV.\n  One of these unsung heroes is Jack St. Clair Kilby, who passed away \nJune 20, 2005, at 81 years of age. You see, a little less than 50 years \nago, Mr. Kilby invented something called the integrated circuit. Today, \nwe would refer to it as the microchip. The integrated circuit, or early \nmicrochip, spawned the Information Age and has made so much of the \nmodern world as we know it today possible.\n  Prior to Kilby's breakthrough, engineers were grappling with how to \nbuild better electronic circuits. At the time, transistors had replaced \nvacuum tubes--a major advancement--but electronic devices were still \ncomposed of hundreds or thousands of discrete components which were \nconnected to thousands of wires. The challenge was to find a cost-\neffective, reliable way of producing the components and connecting \nthem.\n  Kilby approached the problem in a completely novel way, making all \nthe components of a single material. The device consisted of a single \ntransistor and a few other components combined on a slice of germanium \nsmaller than a paper clip. For context, today an integrated circuit \nsmaller than a penny can hold 125 million transistors.\n  From this first simple circuit has grown a worldwide integrated \ncircuit market whose sales in 2004 totaled $179 billion. These \ncomponents supported a 2004 worldwide electronic end-equipment market \nof $1.186 trillion. This technology has affected every known industry \nin the world in some form or fashion--healthcare, education, \ntransportation, manufacturing, entertainment--and has made IT products \nmore accessible and more affordable for the common man.\n  Jack Kilby enjoyed the admiration and respect of his colleagues and \nothers throughout the industry. Texas Instruments Chairman Tom Engibous \nsaid of Kilby:\n\n       In my opinion, there are only a handful of people whose \n     works have truly transformed the world and the way we live in \n     it--Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, the Wright Brothers and Jack \n     Kilby. If there was ever a seminal invention that transformed \n     not only our industry but our world, it was Jack's invention \n     of the first integrated circuit.\n\n  Jack St. Clair Kilby was born November 8, 1923, in Jefferson City, \nMO, and moved as a young child to Great Bend, KS, where he was raised \nand which he considered his hometown. His interest in electronics, \nradio technology in particular, was inspired by an experience in high \nschool when an ice storm knocked down most of the telephone and power \nlines in a wide area in rural Kansas. His father, who ran a small \nelectric company, worked with amateur radio operators to locate the \nareas that had been hit and to coordinate the provision of electrical \nservice.\n  Kilby served his country in the U.S. Army during World War II, where \nhe was assigned to a radio repair shop at an outpost on a tea \nplantation in northeast India and later performed similar work in the \nfield. He studied electrical engineering at the University of Illinois \nboth before and after the war, earning a bachelor's degree in 1947. \nLike many of his generation, Mr. Kilby put his personal life on hold to \nserve his country.\n  After working obtaining a masters degree from the University of \nWisconsin in 1950, Kilby joined Texas Instruments in Dallas in 1958 \nwhere he developed the first monolithic integrated circuit. He \npresented this invention to colleagues and tested it on September 12, \n1958, and within 4 years, TI won the first major integrated circuit \ncontract to design and build special circuits for the Minuteman missile \nproject.\n  Kilby enjoyed a productive career at TI, where he held several \nmanagement positions, including assistant vice president and director \nof engineering and technology for the Components Group. But more \nimportantly, he created or helped to create some 60 patentable items, \nincluding the invention of the first hand-held calculator, which, in \nconjunction with his microchip design, initiated the early development \nof computers and was one of the first public introductions to digital \nelectronics.\n  Kilby was widely recognized for his work. Most notably, he was \nawarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2000. In addition, he won the \nNational Medal of Science and the National Medal of Technology. \nFinally, a prestigious international award, the Kilby International \nAwards, bears his name.\n  He passed away on June 20, 2005, at the age of 81 after a brief \nbattle with cancer. His wife and sister preceded him in death. He is \nsurvived by two daughters, five granddaughters, and a son-in-law. \nLikewise, he leaves behind countless friends, colleagues, and admirers.\n  In addition to his enormous contribution to science and technology, \nMr. Kilby was known as a gentle and humble man who was tirelessly \ndedicated to his family and passionate about finding practical \nsolutions to real problems. He loved to work with young students and \nengineers. He served as distinguished professor of electrical \nengineering from 1978 to 1984 at Texas A University, where he was \nable to share his experience, insight, and passion for research with \nstudents. He took an active interest in and consistently was available \nto young engineers, even young high school and grade school students \nwho asked to interview him about his work. Certainly he hoped to \ninspire these young people.\n  His contributions to science as well as his generosity and \nthoughtfulness were lessons for us all.\n  Mr. President, I introduce a senate resolution honoring the life of \nNobel Laureate Jack St. Clair Kilby, inventor of the integrated circuit \nand long-time engineer for Texas Instruments, to commend his work and \ntremendous contribution to the electronics industry and to the \ntransformation of the global economy to the Information Age. I ask that \nmy colleagues join me in supporting this resolution.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid on the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 200) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 200\n\n       Whereas in July 1958, Mr. Kilby, as a young engineer, \n     resolved a long-standing engineering problem, known as the \n     ``tyranny of numbers'', which prevented engineers from simply \n     and reliably interconnecting electronic components to form \n     circuits by developing the first working integrated circuit;\n       Whereas on September 12, 1958, Mr. Kilby demonstrated the \n     first working integrated circuit for his colleagues at Texas \n     Instruments, Inc. in Dallas, Texas;\n       Whereas the resulting integrated circuit contributed to \n     national defense by facilitating the development of the \n     Minuteman Missile and other programs;\n       Whereas the integrated circuit was central to creating the \n     modern computer and communications industries;\n       Whereas the creation of the integrated circuit has \n     benefitted the people of Texas by spurring the economy of the \n     State with strong semiconductor and communications sectors \n     and has enabled the integrated circuit industry to enjoy \n     phenomenal growth from $29,000,000,000 annually in 1961 to \n     nearly $1,150,000,000,000 in 2005;\n       Whereas on October 10, 2000, 42 years after demonstrating \n     the first integrated circuit, Mr. Kilby shared the 2000 Nobel \n     Prize in Physics for his part in the invention of the \n     integrated circuit;\n       Whereas the integrated circuit, known today as the \n     microchip, was the first chip of its kind, drove the \n     technological growth of the Information Age, permitted both \n     the rapid evolution and the miniaturization of technological \n     products, and provided a foundation for important advances in \n     science and medicine that are saving and enriching lives \n     around the world;\n       Whereas Mr. Kilby further advanced technological progress \n     by inventing more than 60 additional patented items, \n     including the hand-held calculator and the thermal printer;\n       Whereas Mr. Kilby retired from Texas Instruments, Inc. \n     after 25 years of dedicated\n\n[[Page S8438]]\n\n     service but maintained his presence at the company as a \n     source of inspiration to generations of young engineers until \n     his death on June 20, 2005;\n       Whereas Mr. Kilby committed himself to education, serving \n     as a Distinguished Professor of Electrical Engineering at \n     Texas A University from 1978 to 1984, sharing with students \n     the breadth of his knowledge and expertise;\n       Whereas Mr. Kilby is 1 of only 13 individuals to receive \n     both the National Medal of Science and National Medal of \n     Technology, the most prestigious awards of the Federal \n     Government for technical achievement;\n       Whereas the National Academy of Engineering, an independent \n     nonprofit institution that advises the Federal Government on \n     engineering and technology issues, awarded Mr. Kilby the 1989 \n     Charles Stark Draper Prize, 1 of the preeminent awards for \n     engineering achievement in the world;\n       Whereas the Inamori Foundation, a charitable institution in \n     Japan dedicated to promoting international understanding by \n     honoring individuals who have contributed to scientific \n     progress, culture, and human betterment, bestowed upon Mr. \n     Kilby the 1993 Kyoto Prize in Advanced Technology to \n     recognize his contributions to humanity and society;\n       Whereas Mr. Kilby inspired the creation of the awards named \n     after him, the Kilby International Awards, which honor unsung \n     heroes and heroines who make significant contributions to \n     society through science, technology, innovation, invention, \n     and education;\n       Whereas Mr. Kilby was inducted into the National Inventors \n     Hall of Fame, established in 1973 by the Patent and Trademark \n     Office of the Department of Commerce and the National Council \n     of Intellectual Property Associations, alongside other great \n     inventors in United States history;\n       Whereas Mr. Kilby, a member of the ``Greatest Generation'', \n     served the United States in World War II as a member of the \n     United States Army;\n       Whereas Mr. Kilby will be remembered not only as a great \n     technological innovator, but also as a loving husband, \n     dedicated father, and devoted grandfather; and\n       Whereas Mr. Kilby's invention of the integrated circuit \n     revolutionized nearly all aspects of modern life, has made \n     technology more affordable and more accessible to the world, \n     and will continue to exert tremendous influence on the \n     development of technology in the 21st century: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) has heard with profound sorrow and deep regret the \n     announcement of the death of Nobel Laureate Jack St. Clair \n     Kilby;\n       (2) commends Mr. Kilby for his pioneering work in the \n     fields of engineering and electronics, which laid the \n     foundation for the technological advances of the 20th and \n     21st centuries; and\n       (3) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit 1 \n     enrolled copy of this resolution to Mr. Kilby's family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/18/senate-section/article/S8438-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, JULY 19, 2005\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
