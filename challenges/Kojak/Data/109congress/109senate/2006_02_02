Madam President, this morning we will resume debate on \nthe House-passed tax reconciliation bill. I would like to observe that \nyesterday and today, up until the time we pass the tax reconciliation \nbill, we are actually engaging in an utterly futile activity that \nshould have been avoided by the simple act of granting consent. In \neffect, the minority, in apparently a display of pique, wants to make \nthe Senate, in effect, do again a bill it already did in December.\n  I am not opposed to dilatory tactics when they are not pointless. I \nhave been in the minority in this body and have been a proud guardian \nof gridlock from time to time when there was a point to it, when we \nwere actually trying to defeat a measure. But it seems to me to some \nextent it demeans the institution and grates on the nerves of everyone \nwhen common courtesy of granting consent is not offered.\n  Nevertheless, yesterday and today, we will plod through a bill that \nwe did about 5 weeks ago one more time; at the end, with the same \nresult.\n  Let me report that at this point there are 7 hours remaining for that \ndebate, although we do not believe all of that time will be necessary. \nAt some point early this afternoon, we expect on this side to yield \nback time, and we would begin voting. The so-called vote-arama will be \na series of consecutive votes on amendments to the bill which will \neventually lead to passage. We hope it is not a lengthy voting series \nbecause that will simply inconvenience all Members on both sides of the \naisle. However, that is up to the Members of\n\n[[Page S466]]\n\nthis body as to how many amendments they choose to offer.\n  In any event, the majority leader has stated that we will stay on the \nbill until we complete it this week. I encourage Senators to stay close \nto the Chamber once the voting sequence begins because, as we all \nrecall, there is not much time between those votes.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/02/senate-section/article/S466-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, through the Chair to the distinguished \nSenator from Kentucky, and to anyone within the sound of my voice, if \nthere were ever a grating of nerves, it is the nerves of the American \npeople by what this piece of legislation does to them. This legislation \nwas named by the majority in conjunction with the President. It is \ncalled the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. If there were ever Orwellian \ndoublespeak, it is that.\n  Using the numbers the majority placed in this bill, the budget \nDeficit Reduction Act of 2005--we are in 2006, but it was named and \ncompleted in 2005--it increases the deficit by $50 billion. The Deficit \nReduction Act of 2005 increases the deficit by $50 billion using their \nnumbers. So let's not talk about grating the nerves. If there were ever \na grating of nerves, it should be the American people who are so \nconcerned about what has happened to the economy of this country.\n  In just a few days we are going to be asked to increase the debt \nceiling from $8.2 trillion to whatever figure they pick, $9 trillion; \n``they'' meaning the majority. Talk about grating the nerves. We, the \nminority, need not be lectured on common courtesies as expressed by the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky. There is no one in the Senate who \nis more bipartisan than the distinguished senior Senator from Montana \nwho is the floor manager of this legislation. We are doing nothing but \nfollowing procedure.\n  Frankly, what happened yesterday didn't extend common courtesy. We \nwere not allowed to offer a single amendment. If this is how we want to \nstart the year, by pointing fingers, we can point fingers just as well \nas the majority. We chose not to do that yesterday. There wasn't a \nspeech given yesterday about how we had been prevented from offering \namendments, but the Senator from Kentucky comes out here this morning \nand lectures us on common courtesy and grating nerves. Any time that \ndebate needs to take place, we will be involved.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority whip.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I certainly don't intend to engage in \na prolonged debate this morning. Let me repeat that we passed this bill \nabout 5 weeks ago. A number of Democrats voted for it on final passage. \nThe reason they voted for it is they know it is the only way to prevent \na tax increase on many middle-class people who are counting on the tax \nrelief that was passed several years back and hope that it will \ncontinue. My only point is, I say to my good friend from Nevada--and he \nis my good friend--we have been there and done that on this bill. To \nsimply redo the same measure is arguably a waste of the Senate's time. \nNevertheless, that is where we are. At some point this week we will \ncomplete, once again, the passage of this Tax Increase Prevention Act \nwhich will be to the substantial benefit of the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/02/senate-section/article/S466-3", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S466-S502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TAX RELIEF EXTENSION RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2005\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of H.R. 4297, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4297) to provide for reconciliation pursuant \n     to section 201(b) of the concurrent resolution on the budget \n     for fiscal year 2006.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, we have a few hours left on this side. I \nbelieve the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, is on her way to the \nChamber and will be here momentarily. Until that moment arrives, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I may yield \nto the distinguished Senator from Michigan such time as she may require \nand that I may be recognized at the close of her remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia for his kindness this morning.\n  I rise in support of Senator Baucus's amendment. At a time when \nmiddle-class families are struggling to pay their bills, the House tax \nbill would actually increase taxes by more than $30 billion on those \nfamilies--$30 billion.\n  This is a very difficult time for Michigan families. Every day we \nhear news about another plant closing or a company entering into \nbankruptcy. Michigan has lost 111,000 manufacturing jobs, and that \ndoesn't include the recent announcement by Ford to cut another 30,000 \njobs.\n  Michigan families are worried about their jobs. They are also worried \nabout losing the pension that they have worked hard for and paid into \nfor the 30 years that they have worked. They see their health care \npremiums continue to skyrocket, and they are struggling to fill gas \ntanks and pay home heating bills. The average price of gasoline in \nMichigan last month was $2.35 a gallon. Now middle-class families are \nfacing home heating bills that are as much as 35 percent more expensive \nthan last year. And their salaries and their pay stubs don't show a 35-\npercent increase. If anything, they are going down in terms of income.\n  What does the House bill propose to do to help middle-class families? \nRaise their taxes. This was quite stunning to me when I reviewed the \nbill that came over from the House of Representatives. We are talking \nabout a bill that actually raises taxes on middle-income families. That \nis not acceptable. We can do better than that. Our middle-class way of \nlife is in danger. I believe very strongly that in Michigan and places \nall across this country we are fighting for a way of life. Will we have \nthe standard of living that we have had? Will we have the ability to \nsend our kids to college and be able to buy a home and be able to dream \nthe American dream and be successful? At every turn, we are seeing \naction taken here that takes our way of life and our opportunities \naway. Before Christmas, it was a bill that is part of this whole \npackage, cutting over $12 billion in opportunities for people to go to \ncollege, by cutting student loans.\n  So this is another one of those cases where people are working hard, \nexpecting us to do the right thing and, in fact, the House bill would \nraise taxes on middle-income people, while lowering taxes for those who \nare already very blessed, earning millions of dollars a year. We need \nto be passing legislation that lowers health care costs, which is \nhurting American manufacturers. We need legislation that will protect \npeople's pensions. This ought to be a basic premise and principle that \nwe abide by in this country. When you work hard all your life and you \npay into a pension, you should know that that will be there for you and \nyour family.\n  We must also enforce our trade laws and insist that countries such as \nChina and Japan play by the rules and stop manipulating their currency \nand that we don't see counterfeit products coming into this country \nillegally, or other countries stealing our ideas and patents.\n  That is the debate we should be having. These are actions we should \nbe taking. I was deeply concerned the other night to hear the President \ntalk about those of us who want to enforce trade laws, essentially \nsaying we are\n\n[[Page S467]]\n\nprotectionists if we don't stand back and say that in a global economy, \nwhatever happens happens, that those of us who care about the rules and \nwant trade to be fair are somehow protectionists. I profoundly disagree \nwith that.\n  It is our job to fight for American businesses and American workers. \nThat is what I do every day, and I know that many colleagues feel the \nsame way. The debate we need to be having on the floor of the Senate is \nhow to save our middle class, save our way of life. But at a minimum, \nwe should not be passing a tax increase on middle-class families.\n  Michigan is the heart and soul of the middle class. There are 52,000 \nfamilies in jeopardy of facing a tax increase if we do not address the \nalternative minimum tax. The alternative minimum tax ceiling needs to \nbe raised, as we know. Fundamentally, while there has been agreement in \nthis Chamber to do that, if that does not come out of conference \ncommittee between the House and the Senate, we will see 19 million \nfamilies getting a tax increase as a result of actions of the Congress.\n  For instance, a family with five children would be hit with this \nceiling if their income exceeds $54,000. They would, under the current \nsystem, pay more taxes. But without children, their income could exceed \n$76,000 before they pay more taxes. Think about that. Why is that fair? \nIf you have five children, five mouths to feed, five children to buy \nclothes for, five children whom you are worried about going to college, \nyou are going to pay higher taxes than somebody without children. That \nmakes no sense. That is a $20,000 difference, a $20,000 penalty for \nhaving children. That makes absolutely no sense. What is American about \nthat?\n  Sadly, under the current system on taxes with the AMT, the larger \nyour family, the larger taxes you pay. To add insult to injury, the \nHouse bill extends the capital gains and dividend tax rates to provide \n$50 billion in tax breaks to our wealthiest Americans--$50 billion in \ntax breaks to our wealthy Americans--while a family with five children, \nearning $54,000 a year, will pay more taxes.\n  The majority of Americans are looking at this and asking, what is \ngoing on here? Where are our priorities, our values? This is backward. \nEven more egregious is the fact that these tax breaks that are given \nunder the House bill are not set to expire until 2008. So the current \ntax cuts being given to the wealthiest Americans don't even expire \nuntil 2008, but the current problem for middle-income families happens \nright away; the current tax increase happens right away.\n  This bill is money to ensure that the wealthiest 3 percent of \nAmericans are given tax breaks way out until 2010. Meanwhile, right \nnow, middle- and low-income families are facing lower wages, mounting \nhealth care costs, trying to pay the gas bill, trying to pay the home \nheating bill, trying to send the kids to college, while we cut student \nloans. I did not support that. And now we are going to say, \npotentially, if the House bill were to become reality, by the way, you \nare going to pay more in taxes. This makes absolutely no sense.\n  I commend my colleague, Senator Baucus, and I commend the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, as well, for working together to fix this, \ngetting the Senate to work together to fix this. We need to fix this--\nand not only in the Senate because we have agreed that is not right--\nthis needs to be fixed when the bill ends up going to the President's \ndesk. That is when we will know whether 19 million American families \nwill have a tax increase. My vote is ``no'' on that one, and it is \n``yes'' on making sure we fight for that which will keep our way of \nlife in this country.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I thank the Senator from West \nVirginia again for allowing me to use this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, several on our side wish to make \nstatements before we get to offer amendments and vote. It is my \nunderstanding that it will begin at about 2:15. There will be a series \nof amendments then offered which, obviously, we will vote on. There are \na good number on this side and a few on the other side of the aisle. I \nencourage Senators to quickly firm up those amendments so we can line \nthings up as expeditiously as we possibly can.\n  In the meantime, I remind the Senate where we are. We are on the \nHouse deficit reduction bill. Later today, I expect that the majority \nleader will offer a substitute amendment. That will be the Senate \namendment; that is a Senate-passed bill to the House bill. The Senate-\npassed bill will include a perfecting amendment. The perfecting \namendment will modify the Senate-passed bill that previously passed in \nthe Senate by extending the so-called tax extenders, R tax credit, \nthe WOTC tax credit, tuition reduction, and savers' credit, for an \nadditional year. Those provisions expired at the end of 2005. The \nSenate bill extended all those provisions, so-called extenders, for 1 \nmore year, until the end of 2006.\n  The perfecting amendment that will be offered will then add another \nyear to all those, so that those provisions, if that amendment passes, \nwill not expire; they will have 2 more years of life. That is the major \nchange that will be in the perfecting amendment to the Senate \nsubstitute, which the majority leader, I assume fairly quickly, will \noffer.\n  To remind Senators, the main difference between the House and Senate \nbill is this: The House bill includes the extension of the lower \ntaxes--the dividend tax and capital gains taxes--for 2 more years. \nCurrently, taxation on dividends and income taxation on capital gains \nenjoys a lower rate that was put into effect several years ago. That \nprovision or lower rate is in current law and will extend under current \nlaw for 2 more years, until the end of 2008, December 31. The House-\npassed bill extends that provision 2 more years, so it would be in \neffect for not only 2006, 2007, and 2008, but the House bill would be \n2009 and 2010, the full calendar years.\n  The House-passed bill doesn't, however, include any relief for \nalternative minimum taxes, which about 17 million Americans will have \nto pay this year, 2006. Actually, it is about 20 million because 3 \nmillion taxpayers had to pay for 2005, and 17 million more taxpayers \nwill have to pay an additional tax under the so-called stealth tax, the \nalternative minimum tax in 2006. So the House bill extends provisions \nthat need not be extended because the law doesn't change, but it does \nnot reduce taxes for people who are going to pay more for taxes in \n2006. Contrast that with the Senate-passed bill, which would be the \nsubstitute for the House bill. If it passes, it will send that back \nover to the House. They, presumably, will disagree with the Senate and \nask for a conference. We will appoint conferees and begin a conference \non the two separate bills. That will happen next week probably.\n  Again, the Senate bill doesn't extend dividend reduction, capital \ngains taxation reduction, for 2 more years. It maintains current law, \nwhich provides the current low rate in existence for not only this year \nbut also next year and also the following year, through December 31, \n2008. We did, however, in the Senate bill, say, OK, those 17 million \npeople--Americans who are going to have to pay AMT--that is additional \ntax for 2006--should not have to pay that additional tax. We, in the \nSenate bill, said we are going to extend the provisions, the so-called \nAMT patch, so those Americans will not have to pay additional tax under \nthe alternative minimum tax.\n  That is a major difference between the House and Senate bill. I hope \nthat we in Senate can do what I think most Americans want. Most \nAmericans would say, OK, 17 million Americans--let's not raise their \ntaxes; let's make sure those taxes are not raised. And then we will \nworry about 2009 and 2010, when we may or may not want to extend more \nfavorable tax treatment on capital gains income and on dividend \nincome. We can cross that bridge when we get there. Because the budget \nresolution says we cannot lower taxes by more than $7 billion over 5 \nyears, we just can't do it all. We have to make choices. If you add up \nall the provisions that people want--the tax extenders and other \nextensions of tax breaks--it is forcing us in the Congress to begin to \nmake a choice as to what is more important: prevent the additional\n\n[[Page S468]]\n\ntaxes people have to pay next year under the AMT, or is it more \nimportant that they should pay those taxes but, more for the sake of \nprinciple than anything else, extend that dividend and capital gains \npreferential treatment for years 2009 and 2010.\n\n  Again, the House bill only addresses 2009 and 2010. Why? Because \nunder current law, capital gains income and dividend income enjoy \nfavorable tax treatment.\n  That is the basic posture we are in here. It should not take too \nlong. After various amendments are brought up and Senators vote on \nthem, we will send the bill over to the House. The House will probably \ndisagree and request a conference. We will have a conference when we \ncome back next week and finally work out passage of this bill.\n  I see the Senator from West Virginia is on the floor. I turn to the \nSenator from West Virginia and yield to him whatever time he desires.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank my distinguished friend. He can go \nahead with whatever remarks he has. I would love to wait 2 or 3 more \nminutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, if I may ask the Senator from \nCalifornia, how much time does she desire?\n  Mrs. BOXER. If I can have 20 minutes following Senator Byrd, which we \nthink will be used by other Senators on the same topic.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I will do this. Why don't I yield to the Senator from \nMichigan 5 minutes and then the Senator from West Virginia. Is that all \nright with the Senator from California?\n  Mrs. BOXER. If I can be in that line.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes. I think the Senator from West Virginia would like to \ndefer to the Senator from Michigan at this point.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I appreciate the Senator speaking on short notice. Madam \nPresident, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, after speaking in support of the Boxer \namendment, which I think is extremely important, I wanted to take a \nmoment in the middle of this very important debate, a very important \nbill, and rise to speak to another important event that is occurring \nthis weekend.\n  I rise today to cheer not for the Pittsburgh Steelers or the Seattle \nSeahawks but for the city of Detroit and the State of Michigan, which \nis the host of the Super Bowl XL this weekend. We are very excited \nabout this important event. It is a spotlight shining on Detroit, MI, \nand I am confident the city and my home State are ready for their \ncloseup this weekend.\n  The State of Michigan and the city of Detroit are honored to play \nhost to the most watched sporting event in our country. I am sure \nDetroit will shine, as it has before when it has hosted the Stanley Cup \nfinals, the World Series, and the Major League Baseball All-Star Game, \nwhich was just held this last summer.\n  Ford Field is a beautiful stadium which will be an ideal setting for \nthe Seahawks and Steelers, and Cobo Hall will play host to the NFL \nExperience, a football ``theme park'' where children and their parents \ncan enjoy over 50 interactive football theme games and displays.\n  We are expecting over 100,000 visitors to downtown Detroit. I was \nthere last week and saw that a lot of people have gotten there early to \nenjoy what our city offers. We are so pleased to welcome them. Not only \nwill visitors have a chance to experience Detroit's restaurants and \nnightlife, but they can go to the Henry Ford Museum and see the bus on \nwhich Rosa Parks made her historic stand and visit the African-American \nMuseum. This weekend's visitors will see all the wonderful things \nDetroit and the State of Michigan have to offer.\n  I must say that we have over 10,000 volunteers who are ready and are \nworking to make sure everyone enjoys every minute of their stay, and I \nthank those volunteers for their hard work in being a part of helping \nDetroit shine.\n  Detroit is the home of Motown, and I am thrilled that Stevie Wonder \nwill perform before the game and that Aretha Franklin will sing the \nNational Anthem. On Saturday, Motown's music heritage will be on \ndisplay when the Four Tops, the Miracles, the Contours, the Dramatics, \nthe former ladies of the Supremes, Freda Payne, Brenda Holloway, Martha \nReeves and the Vandellas, the Velvelettes, and Paul Hill play at the \nMasonic Temple. That will be an amazing event to participate in and \nlisten to.\n  On Friday and Saturday night, Kid Rock plays at the Joe Lewis Arena \nbefore a sold-out house, proving that Detroit is the Rock City.\n  This weekend, Detroit will welcome home two of its native sons--\nJerome Bettis and Larry Foote, both members of the Pittsburgh Steelers. \nLarry Foote, a graduate of Pershing High, is at the beginning of a \npromising NFL career, while Jerome Bettis is near the end of a Hall of \nFame career where he has displayed the character and toughness of a \nDetroit native. Bettis graduated from MacKenzie High in the late \neighties, entered the NFL in 1993, and has since been mowing down \ndefenses on his way to ranking fifth on the NFL's alltime rushing list.\n\n  The Super Bowl will give Detroit and the State of Michigan and the \nregion an economic boost, but it will also provide a more important \nopportunity for the people I represent to shine, as I know they will. I \nam proud of Michigan's history and excited about our future. I am sure \nthat on Sunday night, those who have visited Detroit, those who have \nwatched the game will be excited as well. We say welcome to all of \nthem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the very distinguished occupant of the chair, who \npresides over this august Chamber with a dignity that is so rare as a \nday in June and a loveliness that permeates the Chamber. I thank the \nChair.\n\n\n                              Mine Safety\n\n  Madam President, yesterday, two more coal miners died in West \nVirginia--two more, two more coal miners died yesterday in West \nVirginia--one at Long Branch Energy's No. 18 tunnel mine in Boone \nCounty and the other at the Black Castle Surface Mine, which is also in \nBoone County, WV. That is a total of 16 coal miner deaths this year, \nand the year is only 33 days old. This situation is deplorable--ghastly \ndeplorable.\n  The Governor of West Virginia, the Honorable Joseph Manchin, \nannounced last night that he has asked the coal operators of West \nVirginia to cease production immediately and to go into a mine safety \nstanddown. He has asked that miners be removed from mines in order to \nreview safety procedures and asked that each new shift also review \nsafety procedures before entering the mine.\n  The Governor has called for expedited inspections of the State's \nmines, and he has asked that the U.S. Labor Department send additional \nFederal inspectors and personnel to the State.\n  The Mine Safety and Health Administration of the U.S. Department of \nLabor announced last night that it would expand the mine safety \nstanddown to mines across the Nation on Monday, February 6.\n  This is a very noble action on the part of our Governor, Joe Manchin. \nI have talked with Governor Manchin, and I compliment him.\n  I have to say that shutting down the mines for 1 hour is not a \nserious solution. It may be a timeout for safety, but it is not time \nenough for meaningful safety. Mine safety officials are displaying \nincreasing concern about this rash of mining fatalities.\n  Those who consider the tragedies at the Sago and Alma mines to be \nrandom occurrences are now taking a second look. They are asking this \nmorning: When will these mine tragedies stop? When? The answer to that \nquestion is unsettling, isn't it? It is possible that these accidents \nare not going to stop. God only knows. Life and death are in God's \nhands.\n  It is possible that mine safety protections have eroded so much in \nrecent years that these actions are going to continue. Who would have \nthought that these mine deaths would occur as they have and in one \nState? It is possible that these accidents are going to continue to \nhappen again and again unless new action--dramatic action--is taken by \nthe Federal Government to curb these mining hazards.\n  The danger to our coal miners is real--very real. Yes, very, very \nreal.\n\n[[Page S469]]\n\nThe dangers to our miners is very real. There are too many needs, from \nemergency communications and breathing equipment to a rapid \nnotification and response system to penalizing the reckless disregard \nof Federal safety standards. Real. Too many needs, I say, are not being \naddressed by the Labor Department and the Mine Safety and Health \nAdministration and require swift action by the Congress.\n\n  The longer we wait to act in Congress, the more likely another \nfatality and then another fatality and then another may occur. The \nlonger we wait to act, the greater the threat to our energy \ninfrastructure. If these tragedies continue, mines could be closed and \ncoal and energy production could falter. The consequences could ripple \nthroughout the national economy. We cannot delay. We cannot delay in \nresponding.\n  I spoke with the distinguished majority leader yesterday. Of course, \nI have already spoken with our distinguished minority leader, who has \njoined in supporting the need for action on the bill that I have \nintroduced, along with Senator Rockefeller and along with the \ndelegation in the House, a bipartisan delegation. I spoke with the \nmajority leader yesterday, and I have asked mine safety legislation be \nconsidered quickly, and I publicly renew that request.\n  I have come to the Senate floor hoping to see the majority leader \nagain this morning, but he is needed elsewhere, and for good reason, at \nthe moment. But I publicly renew that request, and upon his arrival I \nshall discuss this matter with him. I have discussed it already with \nthe assistant leader, Mr. McConnell. I urge that this legislation be \nscheduled as soon as possible, that there be scheduled time as soon as \npossible on mine safety legislation.\n  The bill the West Virginia delegation introduced yesterday will help \nto protect the lives of our miners. It will help to keep West Virginia \nmines open. It will help to keep the coal coming. It will help to keep \nthe coal fueling the energy demands of our national economy. But we \nmust act quickly. We must ensure the safety of our coal miners.\n  Hear me. Listen. We must ensure the safety of our coal miners in \norder to ensure the security of the Nation. The security of the Nation \ndepends on the safety of our coal miners. We have delayed too long \nalready, and every additional day we wait puts another miner's life at \nrisk.\n\n       O Death, where is thy sting?\n       O grave, where is thy victory?\n\n  Senators, listen: For whom does the bell toll? Who knows who will be \nnext?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I yield 20 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask my colleague to make sure Senator Lautenberg knows \nmy colleagues are willing to yield him 10 minutes upon my completion; \nis that correct?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I will then subsequently yield to the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, will the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask so that I might thank her again for delaying her \nspeech until I could make these few remarks. I thank her from the \nbottom of my heart. She is so considerate always, so courteous: ``And \nwhat is so rare as a day in June?'' The beauty of the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Oh, that is so nice.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend and colleague, and really, in so many \nways, our leader in the Senate, and say to him before he leaves the \nfloor how much we stand with him on these mine safety questions.\n  We Americans are just facing so many tragedies. My colleague reports \non yet more deaths in the mines, deaths that are preventable if we do \nthe right thing by our workers. We are mourning together today five \nmore American soldiers killed in Iraq. We had an incident, a workplace \nkilling in Santa Barbara where five or six people lay dead. It is tough \ntimes. But I want my good friend to know that we will stand with him on \nthis mine safety question.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, if I might just take 1 minute, I deeply \nthank--as they say in the other body--the gentlelady from California, \nfor her noble comments and for her support. The West Virginia \ndelegation in the House and the Senate is pleased at her expressions of \nsupport. We are glad to have that support. West Virginia is proud of \nthe California delegation, the delegation that stands with us in this \nhour of sorrow.\n  I thank the Senator from California for yielding and for her support.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I rise now to discuss an amendment on \nbehalf of myself and Senators Kerry and Lautenberg, which expresses the \nsense of the Senate that the White House should provide the public with \na thorough account of the meetings that the President, his staff, and \nsenior executive branch officials held with Jack Abramoff. The public's \nconfidence in the Government has been rocked, rocked by the widespread \nreports of public corruption involving Jack Abramoff.\n  On January 3, Mr. Abramoff pleaded guilty to conspiracy, fraud, tax \nevasion charges, charges that carry up to a 30-year sentence. He agreed \nto cooperate with prosecutors in their investigation of a number of \npublic officials, and we don't know where all this will lead. I urge \nthe Justice Department to continue its investigation into any bribery \nand corruption.\n  The damage to the public trust from the Abramoff scandal, combined \nwith the recent prosecution of Congressman Randy Cunningham, and the \nindictment of Congressman Tom Delay is massive. The investigation by \nthe Department of Justice has really just begun. But right now, sadly, \nthere is a very low opinion of politicians, and trust must be restored \nwith the American people. We cannot govern effectively without the \nsupport and confidence of the people. We are supposed to be their \nrepresentatives. We owe them everything, and we must start with \nhonesty, with ethics, so we can regain their trust.\n  If the people have lost confidence, we have to win it back. Every \nSenator I know has searched his or her records for contributions from \nJack Abramoff, from his associates and the tribes he represented. Each \nof us has responded in our own way. But to my knowledge, we have all \nmade our actions public. We have told our constituents what the \nsituation is and whether we plan to do something about it.\n  In the State of the Union Address the President said:\n\n       Each of us has made a pledge to be worthy of public \n     responsibility--and that is a pledge we must never forget, \n     never dismiss, and never betray.\n\n  Those are noble sentiments, very noble sentiments, and I challenge \nthe President to live up to them. Where there is an appearance of \nimpropriety, it is the responsibility of public officials to be open \nwith the public and to clear up any questions that might exist. I know \nin my long career in elected life, and it is now more than 30 years of \nelected life, I have had to return contributions from time to time. I \nhave tried to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. I have \neven recused myself on three occasions because I believed that was the \nright thing to do. But no matter what each of us does there will still \nbe those who doubt us. It is the system. It is a system that is based \non private financing, so it is very difficult, with that system, to \ngain the trust of the people.\n  But it starts with openness. It starts with transparency. We should \neach try to be as open as we can and make sure that, whatever we decide \nto do, the public is informed. It doesn't help to be secretive. It \ndoesn't help to say: I don't have to do this; it is my right not to \ntell the public anything. It may be your right, but it does not make it \nright.\n  According to the press secretary of the President, Scott McClellan, \nthe President does not know and doesn't remember ever meeting Jack \nAbramoff, and despite repeated requests the White House has failed to \nprovide details of meetings between Jack Abramoff and the President and \nhis staff. The problem is, more and more details keep coming out about \nthe relationship between Mr. Abramoff and the President.\n  Starting in 1997, Mr. Abramoff claimed credit for procuring a letter\n\n[[Page S470]]\n\nfrom then-Governor Bush that praised the then-Northern Marianas Island \nEducation Plan. In 2000, Jack Abramoff joined the Bush-Cheney \ntransition team. Several colleagues of Mr. Abramoff ended up being \nappointed to key positions in the Department of Interior, the agency \nthat regulates Indian gaming issues, central to Mr. Abramoff's lobbying \nbusiness.\n  According to the Associated Press, Jack Abramoff and his lobbying \nteam had nearly 200 contacts with the Bush administration in the first \n10 months they were in office--200 contacts in less than a year, and \nnobody remembers anything? I mean it doesn't pass the smell test, to be \ncrude about it.\n  By 2001, Mr. Abramoff appears to have been selling his clients access \nto the President. On May 9, 2001, the White House arranged an event on \nbehalf of the group Americans for Tax Reform. That group is a very \nstrong ally of President Bush. The event was attended by the President \nand a number of legislators. There is a trail of documents that shows \nthat Mr. Abramoff asked some of his clients for $25,000 to go to that \nevent, with the funds going to this Americans for Tax Reform.\n  I want to show you some e-mails because I think that tells the story \nbetter than anything. So here is what Mr. Abramoff asked in an e-mail \nto a representative of one of his tribal clients. These are Mr. \nAbramoff's words from an e-mail.\n\n       Americans for Tax Reform is bringing together the speakers \n     of all Republican-led legislatures for a meeting with Bush \n     and the congressional leadership. They have requested \n     sponsorship ($25 K) from only four groups. Two of them will \n     be major corporations and one will be Choctaw. Chief Martin \n     will be coming to the event I expect. I told them that I \n     would ask you guys to participate. The exposure would be \n     incredible and would be very helpful. One of the things we \n     need to do is get the leaders of the tribe (ideally the \n     chief) in front of the President as much as possible. Please \n     let me know as soon as you can. Thanks.\n\n  That is Mr. Abramoff to the representative of one of the tribes.\n  Let us see what that particular individual wrote to her tribe after \nshe received Mr. Abramoff's e-mail. She wrote:\n\n       Attached is an e-mail from Jack Abramoff with the firm of \n     Greenberg & Traurig. The chairman has agreed for the tribe to \n     be one of the four sponsors of and participate in a White \n     House event on behalf of the Americans for Tax Reform which \n     is being held on May, 9, 2001 in D.C. Please immediately \n     prepare a check made payable to Americans for Tax Reform in \n     the amount of $25,000 and forward it to my office by Federal \n     Express. Then Fed/Ex the check to Mr. Abramoff.\n\n  Just to finish this story, here we have a copy of the check Mr. \nAbramoff received from the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana in the amount \nof $25,000--selling the President of the United States and using \nFederal property.\n  The meeting was held in the Old Executive Office Building. In all, it \nappears that four or more of Abramoff's clients attended the event, and \nat least two claimed they paid the $25,000 requested. They paid that to \nget close to the President on Federal property. Jack Abramoff, as I \nsaid, delivered the President of the United States in exchange for his \nclients' contribution to the President's supporters. How many more \nAbramoff clients attended is not clear, and who paid money to attend \nthe White House event is not clear. The White House claims it has no \nrecord of Mr. Abramoff attending, but Time magazine claims there is a \nphoto of the President standing with Abramoff and one of Abramoff's \nclients.\n  This event alone warrants the President providing full disclosure of \nmeetings with White House officials and Jack Abramoff.\n  But this was not a one-time event. The following year, Mr. Abramoff \nsolicited money from his clients for another White House event in \nbehalf of Americans for Tax Reform.\n  The public has more and more questions about the relationship between \nJack Abramoff, the President, and his staff, but no answers are \nforthcoming. The President's refusal to provide additional information \nabout these meetings has increased the public's distrust in the \nadministration and our Government at large.\n  The President said some very noble words at the State of the Union \nAddress. He said it was important for us to bring trust back. Yet we \nsee no movement for transparency and openness.\n  The public has a right to know whom Mr. Abramoff met with, what they \ndiscussed, and whether improprieties existed. According to a Washington \nPost/ABC News poll, 76 percent said Bush should disclose his contacts \nwith his aides and Mr. Abramoff. Two of three Republicans favored \ndisclosure. Let me say that again. In the poll, two of three \nRepublicans favored disclosure.\n  In fact, members of the President's own party in the Senate and in \nthe House have urged the President to provide information to the public \nabout this administration's dealings with Mr. Abramoff. I agree with \nthem. All Government officials who serve the public must take all steps \nnecessary to maintain their trust and confidence.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this important amendment which I \nplan to offer on behalf of Senator Kerry and Senator Lautenberg. It \nsimply calls on the White House to immediately and publicly disclose \neach visit and meeting between Jack Abramoff and the President, White \nHouse staff, or senior executive branch officials.\n  Much is made about how Senators get an opportunity to fight for funds \nfor their State. Senator McCain has derided this action. Senator McCain \nsaid earmarks right on their face are wrong. If you look at the number \nof earmarks Members of the Senate are involved in for our States--I \nknow my colleague and I sit on the Public Works Committee. I don't need \nany lobbyist to tell me that I need a road in my urban area when one is \nbroken down. I don't need a lobbyist to tell me that I need an HOV lane \nor a new water system or a new sewer system or a new school or a new \nsenior center. It is my job to know that. Senator McCain thinks that is \nall terrible. But the bottom line is the number of earmarks pales in \ncomparison with the amount of funds that are distributed by this \nadministration and any subsequent or prior administration. They \ndistribute most of the funds.\n  It is very important, as we all look at our campaign contributions, \nto sort out in any of them which are in any way tainted by Mr. Abramoff \nand that the White House comes to the table and is as open as we have \nbeen. I believe it is very important. This isn't a partisan issue. \nRepublicans have been calling for the White House to come clean on \nthis, and Democrats are doing the same.\n  If we are going to restore confidence in our Government, it starts \nwith simple openness, not saying: Oh, this is privileged, this is \nsecret. I will tell you right now, we all learned it from our moms and \ndads. When somebody says, this is secret, watch out. Our Government is \nsupposed to be open, not secret.\n  I hope there will be strong support for this particular amendment. I \nbelieve its timing is crucial. We can't let any more time elapse.\n  There are calls for--and I am joining them--a special prosecutor in \nthis particular case. But even before that debate begins, let us have \neveryone come clean on these meetings, contributions, and the like.\n  I thank my colleague from Montana, the ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee, for his generosity of spirit in allowing me to discuss this \nissue. Technically, of course, it isn't a matter of the Finance \nCommittee jurisdiction, but I believe the timing is so important that \nwe should have a vote on this.\n  Thank you very much. I yield back whatever time remains.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I very much thank the Senator from \nCalifornia for her terrific service to her State and to the Nation.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Montana. I \nalso congratulate our colleague, the Senator from California, for her \ndiligence in pursuing this issue. Senator Boxer has an interest in \nfairness and equity at all times, and open government. I am so pleased \nthat we can rely on her and her staff to research this matter and to \nbring it to the public's attention.\n  Everyone knows there is a cloud over Washington these days. It is a \ncloud of corruption that challenges the fundamental concept of \ndemocracy in our\n\n[[Page S471]]\n\ngreat country, one that says the President, under the guise of an act \nof patriotism, can spy on people, innocent people, invade their privacy \ntotally, and yet withhold records that are vital to the public's \nconfidence in government, withhold data that is required in this \nscandal we are now witnessing which hangs over Washington.\n  This deep-seated corruption was exposed as part of an investigation \ninto the activities of the lobbyist Jack Abramoff. We now know that he \ncommitted despicable acts against his own clients and that he conspired \nat the same time with certain Members of Congress. His contacts with \nthe White House and his friends are still very much a mystery. Imagine \nthat--contacts with the President of the United States hidden from the \npublic. It is incomprehensible. President Bush refuses to disclose his \ncontacts with Mr. Abramoff for reasons that are unclear. If there is no \nwrongdoing, there should be nothing to hide.\n  I wish to quote President Bush from a statement he made when running \nfor President in 2000. He said, and I quote him:\n\n       Americans are tired of investigations, scandals, and the \n     best way to get rid of them is to elect a new President--\n\n  We are talking about 2000.\n\n     --who will bring a new administration, who will restore honor \n     and dignity to the White House.\n\n  What an empty statement that has proven to be. President Bush pledged \nto run an ethical White House. Now, as we see, those words seem almost \nhypocritical. At the very least, in order to keep this pledge, \nPresident Bush must release information on contacts between him, his \nstaff, and Mr. Abramoff. What is he ashamed of? Whether he is ashamed \nof it or not, he ought to release it to clear the air. The public wants \nthese contacts disclosed. The President needs to help the truth come \nout, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. And he should be \nassisting us in this investigation.\n  White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan says President Bush does \nnot know Mr. Abramoff. But there is stark evidence to the contrary. \nAccording to Washingtonian magazine, Abramoff said that not only did he \nknow the President but that the President knew the names of Abramoff's \nchildren and asked about them during their meeting.\n  There appears to be a long trail of contacts between Mr. Abramoff and \nthe Bush White House. For starters, President Bush put Mr. Abramoff on \nhis 2000 Presidential transition team--a pretty important job. Mr. \nAbramoff was then able to get his allies appointed to key positions at \nthe Department of the Interior. Why the Department of the Interior? \nBecause it regulates Indian gaming issues that were central to Mr. \nAbramoff's lobbying business.\n  He was also one of President Bush's top campaign fundraisers, a so-\ncalled Pioneer. He raised over $100,000 for President Bush's 2004 \nreelection campaign. That was the definition of ``Pioneer''--big-time \nmoney.\n  According to Time and Newsweek magazines, Mr. Abramoff also sold \naccess to the White House through payments sent to Grover Norquist's \nfront organization, Americans for Tax Reform. Senator Boxer displayed a \ncheck which was made out to Indian tribes which paid upwards of $25,000 \nto Norquist for access to President Bush and his top adviser, Karl \nRove. Mr. Abramoff bragged to one his clients, Tyco, that he talked to \nKarl Rove about their issues. And David Safavian, a White House \nofficial now under indictment, funneled confidential information to \nAbramoff to help Tyco.\n  Mr. Abramoff's own billing records show that his office had almost \n200 contacts with the Bush administration in only its first 10 months. \nThe officials listed as contacts included the then-Attorney General \nJohn Ashcroft and Vice President Cheney's top advisers.\n  As far back as 1997, there is evidence of contacts between then-\nGovernor Bush and Mr. Abramoff. Abramoff charged his client at the \ntime, the Northern Mariana Islands, to get Governor George W. Bush to \nwrite a letter praising the island's education plan. Governor Bush did \nwrite such a letter to the island government on July 18, 1997, with a \n``cc'' to one of Mr. Abramoff's deputies.\n  The bottom line is that this amendment--once again, I salute my \ncolleague from California for bringing this up, and I intend to support \nit vigorously--the bottom line is that this amendment urges the \nPresident to clear the air. The American people want to know whether \nthe Bush White House was complicit with Mr. Abramoff's schemes. Maybe \nMr. Abramoff was exaggerating his contacts with the White House. That \nis possible. But there is only one way to find out--release the \nrecords. We are seeing withholding of information by the White House. I \nsit on the Committee on Government Accountability. The Republican \nchairman, Susan Collins, has asked the White House for information \nrelated to the Federal Government's response to Hurricane Katrina. We \ncannot get that. There has been a public display of the requests for \nthat information.\n\n  Does this suggest this White House is committed to keeping the \ninformation--information that belongs to the public--private, within \ntheir confines so they can do anything they want and not be challenged \nwith their conduct related to this issue? It looks like a constant \npattern.\n  I urge my colleagues to support honest and open government and to \nvote for the Boxer amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). Without objection, it is so \nordered. \n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased that later today we will be \noffering a modification to the Senate amendment to provide a 2-year \nextension and enhancement to the research and development tax credit. \nOf course, I have filed legislation with my friend, Senator Hatch, to \nmake a permanent commitment to research-intensive businesses in the \nUnited States.\n  This legislation is bipartisan and bicameral. But 2-years is \ncertainly much better than the usual yearly extender. I am already \nstarting to hear from business taxpayers how important a commitment to \nlonger term research projects are, and I agree with them.\n  I am hopeful that we can prevail upon our House conferees to retain \nthis 2-year incentive.\n  You know, just the other night, the President spoke of the importance \nof the R credit to maintaining America's competitive edge. He is \nright, and that is why I have been a strong supporter of legislation to \nmake the credit permanent for the last few Congresses.\n  Every morning we hear news of some new product or discovery that \npromises to make our jobs easier or our lives better. Many of these \ninnovations started with a business decision to hire needed researchers \nand finance the expensive and long process of research and \nexperimentation.\n  Since 1981, when the R tax credit was first enacted, the Federal \nGovernment was a partner in that business endeavor because of the \npotential spillover benefits to society overall from additional \nresearch spending.\n  But the credit has been hobbled over the years because of its \ntemporary nature. As stated in an analysis last year by the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, ``Perhaps the greatest criticism of the R \ncredit among taxpayers regards its temporary nature.''\n  Joint Tax went on to say, ``A credit of longer duration may more \nsuccessfully induce additional research than would a temporary credit, \neven if the temporary credit is periodically renewed.''\n  I think we should heed the advice of the experts at Joint Tax and \nrenew this credit for as long as we can. That is why I will support a \nmodified Senate proposal later today for a 2-year extension.\n  Research has shown that a tax credit is a cost-effective way to \npromote R The General Accounting Office, the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics, the National Bureau of Economic Research, and others have \nall found significant evidence that a tax credit stimulates additional \ndomestic R spending by U.S. companies.\n  A report by the Congressional Research Service, CRS, indicates that\n\n[[Page S472]]\n\neconomists generally agree that, without Government support, firm \ninvestment in R would fall short of the socially optimal amount, and \nthus  CRS advocates Government policies to boost private sector R\n  R is linked to broader economic and labor benefits. R lays the \nfoundation for technological innovation, which, in turn, is an \nimportant driving force in long-term economic growth--mainly through \nits impact on the productivity of capital and labor. We have many times \nheard testimony from economists, including Federal Reserve Board \nChairman Alan Greenspan, that the reason our economy grew at such \nbreakneck speed during the 1990s stemmed from the productivity growth \nwe realized thanks to technological innovations.\n  There has been a belief that companies would continue to increase \ntheir research spending and that the benefits of these investments on \nthe economy and labor markets would continue without end. \nUnfortunately, that is not the case.\n  According to Battelle's 2005 funding forecast, industrial R \nspending will increase only 1.9 percent above last year, to an \nestimated $191 billion, which is less than the expected rate of \ninflation of 2.5 percent. For the fifth year in a row, industrial R \nspending growth has been essentially flat.\n  It is also important to recognize that many of our foreign \ncompetitors are offering permanent and generous incentives to firms \nthat attract research dollars to those countries.\n  A 2001 study by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment, OECD, ranked the United States ninth behind other nations \nin terms of its incentives for business R spending. Countries that \nprovide more generous R incentives include Spain, Canada, Portugal, \nAustria, Australia, Netherlands, France, and Korea.\n  The United Kingdom was added to this list in 2002 when it further \nexpanded its existing R incentives program. The continued absence of \na long-term U.S. Government R policy that encourages U.S.-based R \nwill undermine the ability of American companies to remain competitive \nin U.S. and foreign markets. This disparity could limit U.S. \ncompetitiveness relative to its trading partners in the long run.\n  Also, U.S. workers who are engaged in R activities currently \nbenefit from some of the most intellectually stimulating, high-paying, \nhigh-skilled jobs in the economy.\n  My own State of Montana is an excellent example of this economic \nactivity. During the 1990s, about 400 establishments provided high-\ntechnology services, at an average wage of about $35,000 per year. \nThese jobs paid nearly 80 percent more than the average private sector \nwage of less than $20,000 per year during the same year.\n  Many of these jobs would never have been created without the \nassistance of the R credit.\n  While there may not be an immediate rush to move all projects and \njobs offshore, there has been movement at the margins on those projects \nthat are most cost-sensitive. Once those projects and jobs are gone, it \nwill be many years before companies will have any incentive to bring \nthem back to the United States.\n  We continue to grapple with the need to stimulate economic growth and \nadvance policies that represent solid long-term investments that will \nreap benefits for many years to come. I repeatedly have pointed to the \nR tax credit as a measure that gives us a good ``bang for our buck.'' \nI hope my colleagues will join me in supporting a 2-year extension. It \nis good for American businesses and workers, and we need it to maintain \nour global competitive edge.\n  Mr. President, I take a few moments to talk about the schedule for \nthe rest of the day. The majority leader will be coming to the floor \nmomentarily. Obviously, he will give a better idea of the schedule.\n  I expect sometime before 11 o'clock this morning the majority leader \nwill come to the floor to offer the Senate substitute in a Grassley-\nBaucus perfecting amendment. I understand the majority then will fill \nthe amendment tree--that is, offer amendments to fill up the tree--\npreventing the offering of amendments this morning. However, Senators \non this side of the aisle will be able to offer their amendments. It is \njust a question of when they can offer amendments.\n  Later in the day Members can offer amendments. It is the managers' \nexpectation Senators will have used or yielded all time back on the \nbill at 2:15 and we will begin a series of votes that regularly follow \ndebate time on the reconciliation bill; that is, the so-called vote-\narama. Roughly at 2:15 we begin the vote-arama. As Senators offer the \namendments, at that point we will vote on the amendments. I am hopeful \nwe will have a couple minutes' time for an explanation as to what the \namendments actually are. That is the procedure.\n  I discussed the order of amendments to be offered with the Democrat \nleader, and I have discussed the order with the chairman of the \nCommittee on Finance. Shortly, I will announce the plans for the first \n10 amendments the Democrat Senators will offer.\n  Those first 10 amendments in this order are as follows: an amendment \nby Senator Bingaman on prescription drug implementation; next is an \namendment by Senator Menendez, AMT dividends and capital gains, which \nis germane; third, a Rockefeller amendment on mine safety; fourth, an \namendment by Senator Conrad, he will offer the substitute amendment \nwhich is fully offset; fifth, an amendment by Senator Kennedy which \nessentially is the R extension for 3 years, and that will be germane; \nsixth, an amendment by Senator Obama with respect to Katrina child tax \ncredit; next, seventh, an amendment by Senator Cantwell dealing with \nenergy taxes; and No. 8, an amendment by Senator Schumer which is a \nsense of the Senate on AMT; ninth, an amendment by Senator Harkin with \nrespect to so-called PEP and Pease provisions and dependent care \ncredit; and tenth is an amendment by Senator Landrieu for expansion of \nthe low-income housing tax credit. She wants to expand the tax credit.\n  There will be other amendments later. I am hopeful the additional \nDemocrat amendments can be 10, 12, 14, but I am not sure. I don't want \nto prejudge that. These are the first 10. We will indicate what the \nothers will be.\n  This is our intention of how to proceed. My expectation is the other \nside of the aisle will offer amendments. We will work with the chairman \nof the committee and go back and forth at the appropriate time.\n  That is the general procedure we have in mind. It is not locked in, \nbut that is the general procedure in consultation with the chairman of \nthe committee that we would like to work out. Senators from the other \nside of the aisle will want to offer their amendments. It will be the \nmanagers' intention to alternate between both sides of the aisle. We \nwill seek to obtain copies of amendments and announce information on \nthem as soon as possible.\n  Obviously, if Senators get information on the amendments to us \nquickly, the more likely we get the amendments up earlier rather than \nlater.\n  With those caveats, those are the first 10 amendments we expect to be \noffered. Pending that, the majority leader is in the Senate. I am sure \nhe wants to make a statement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I have been talking to the ranking member \nbefore coming to the floor. I think he explained generally what will \ntake place. I will comment on it after completion of procedural \nrequests.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2707\n\n              (Purpose: To provide a substitute amendment)\n\n  Mr. President, I send a substitute amendment to the desk, and I ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Frist], for Mr. Grassley \n     and Mr. Baucus, proposes an amendment numbered 2707.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. I now ask that notwithstanding the Budget Act, it be in \norder\n\n[[Page S473]]\n\nfor me to send additional amendments and motions to the desk with all \nthe statutory debate time on each amendment or motion still reserved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2708 to Amendment No. 2707\n\n              (Purpose: To provide a substitute amendment)\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

I now send a second-degree amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Frist] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2709 to amendment No. 2708.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment add the following:\n       ``This section shall become effective 1 day after \n     enactment.''\n\n\n                            Motion to Commit\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I move to commit the pending bill, and I send the motion \nto the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Frist] moves to commit the \n     pending bill to the Committee on Finance, with instructions \n     to report back forthwith, with an amendment.\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Frist], for Mr. Talent, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2711 to amendment No. 2710.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To repeal the sunset of the provisions in EGTRRA relating to \n                         the child tax credit)\n\n       At the end of the amendment add the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. PERMANENT EXTENSION OF EGTRRA PROVISIONS RELATING \n                   TO CHILD TAX CREDIT.\n\n       Section 901 of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief \n     Reconciliation Act of 2001 (relating to sunset provisions) \n     shall not apply to the amendments made by section 201 of such \n     Act.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as a continuation of the explanation, it \nhas not been my preference to file these amendments, but we have tried \nover the last couple of days to bring a semblance of order so we can \ncomplete the activity that is in the Senate. It was November when we \nfirst passed this bill. The House passed a bill. Under the usual \ncircumstances, with unanimous consent, we marry the two bills and it \ngoes to conference.\n  We are spending these 20 hours, and we have had good debate over the \ncourse of yesterday and this morning. But we have been unable to get \nunanimous consent to have a list of these amendments with language \nwhich would allow our chairman and ranking member to begin voting on \nthose amendments. Thus, what will happen today is, as the ranking \nmember explained, time will expire sometime around 2:15 today. I don't \nknow the exact time. After that, there will be a series of rollcall \nvotes. The rollcall votes begin with the Talent amendment, which is the \npending amendment. After that, others will have the opportunity to \noffer amendments, and they would be voted on accordingly.\n  I do encourage all of our colleagues to work with the chairman and \nranking member, the managers of the bill, so we can have an orderly \nprocess and we can stick with amendments that are pertinent and \nrelative to the underlying bill. It means if we work aggressively but \nwork collaboratively over the course of the day we will start voting \nearly this afternoon. We will be voting until we finish this particular \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am sorry to have been late. Are we going \nto finish these votes today, tonight?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, through the Chair, in response, I certainly \nhope so. I believe we are in a position to do so, but it depends on how \nmany amendments we have. Once we start voting, we will keep the \namendments very tight. Both the Democrat leader and I said we hoped it \nwould not come to this point to have a vote-arama, but that is what it \nwill be. I believe we can finish it tonight. The only hesitation is how \nmuch cooperation we get from our side of the aisle and your side of the \naisle. If we do not finish tonight, we will continue tomorrow until we \ncomplete the legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, if it is helpful to all Senators, \nespecially the Senator from Tennessee and the Senator from Nevada, we \nhave a total of about 20 amendments on this side. I don't know how many \nare on the other side, but I guess maybe we could finish by around 7 \no'clock or 8 o'clock tonight. That is a rough estimate. Maybe earlier.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the positive tone of voice of \nmy distinguished friend from Montana, but if we have 20 votes--and that \nis on our side--and there are second-degree amendments to those, and \namendments offered on the other side, we are talking about a long \nnight. The best we can do, no matter how hard we try, is three, three \nand a half amendments an hour. So we are talking about, if we start at \n2 o'clock, a lot of hours.\n  I appreciate everyone being confident we will do this. And we will \ncertainly cooperate any way we can. And, as happens, there may be \nMembers who decide not to offer their amendments. That is always a \npossibility. We will do the best we can. It may be necessary to alert \nSenators that there may be work tomorrow. The distinguished majority \nleader is in the Senate, but it is very likely we may not be able to \nfinish all these votes--well, maybe not ``very likely''--but it is \ncertainly possible we may not be able to finish the votes tonight.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I have made it clear from the outset we \nneed to finish this legislation this week. Friday is a working day, as \nwe all know. If we have to be here, we will do that. On the other hand, \nonce people understand where we are and that we do not actually have to \nbe doing this, people will step back and be reasonable in terms of the \nnumber of amendments, making sure they are amendments relative to the \nunderlying bill.\n  The managers will do this later, but Members need to be clear these \nare 10-minute votes, as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I don't see any Member wishing to speak at \nthis moment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S474]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to make an opposite point of view \nand critical comments on a statement that was made yesterday by the \nSenator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan. Once again, he made a very \nimpassioned case, and everybody who hears him knows he presents his \ncase very well. He made an impassioned case for American workers whose \njobs have been lost when plants move overseas.\n  We have all witnessed this heart-wrenching event. I know even in my \nhome State of Iowa we have had plant closings for that reason. Some of \nthose operations have been moved out of the United States. But as far \nas Iowans are concerned, let me remind you this has been a phenomenon \nof plants moving from Iowa to other places for a long time, before we \never heard the word ``outsourcing.''\n  I remind my colleagues I was a member of the International \nAssociation of Machinists at a sheet metal factory, the Waterloo \nRegister in the town of Cedar Falls, IA. We made furnace registers. I \nstarted working there in 1961, when I was a young member of the Iowa \nLegislature, to supplement the income of a citizen legislator, and also \nto supplement the income of a young farmer getting started at that time \nbecause I was only farming 80 acres at that time. Even in 1961, you \ncould not make a living farming 80 areas. You could not make a living \ngetting $3,000 every other year being an Iowa legislator. So I became a \nfactory worker.\n  At about 1971, the people who owned our company decided people in \nTexas would work for less money than people in Waterloo, IA, so they \nmoved the plant to Texas. Our job was shut down. Our job was lost. The \noutsourcing was not to China, it was to Texas. I presume that 25 years \nlater there were jobs that moved from Iowa to Texas that eventually \nmoved to Mexico, and then it was not long Mexico was losing jobs from \nMexico to China. Now we hear about jobs moving from China to someplace \nelse, where somebody is going to work someplace else for a lower wage. \nI guess when you have a planet of 6.5 billion people, and people want \nto eat, they want jobs, somebody is going to seek that work and do it. \nSo I believe I have been a victim of outsourcing not to China but to \nTexas. But it is still a problem today, and it is one for which we have \nto have sympathy.\n  Senator Dorgan, obviously, presents a great case for those people. \nBut I want people to know I have lived through that and know what it is \nlike when I am commenting because I do not want people to think I am \nunsympathetic to outsourcing. But I think we have to recognize the \neconomic facts of life, whether it is my job at the Waterloo Register \nin Cedar Falls, IA, or whether it was 250 years ago when manufacturing \njobs left Great Britain to come to the Colonies in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Now, I want to say, unfortunately, Senator Dorgan's amendment--if it \nis the same one we saw in 2004. And you can tell from the debate that \nwe just had that we do not have the language on these amendments, and \nwe are begging for them. Anybody who believes in transparency of \nGovernment ought to get these amendments out here. There is no reason \nto be secretive about the people's business because everybody is \nwatching us right here on television. We are not trying to hide \nanything. So we need to see those amendments.\n  But the point is, if it is like the amendment in 2004, that amendment \nwill not do one thing to bring jobs back to America. In fact, it could \nvery well cost even more U.S. jobs. I would like to explain, then, why \nI come to this conclusion.\n  This amendment, if it is similar, repeals deferral for property \nimported into the United States by a foreign subsidiary of a U.S. \ncompany, without regard to whether that property was ever previously \nproduced, manufactured, or grown in the United States.\n  This means the amendment by Senator Dorgan fails to focus on their \nprimary complaint that U.S. companies are shutting their plants, moving \nproduction offshore, and selling back into the United States. The bill \ndoes not focus on this scenario. Instead, it overshoots the mark by \nhitting all goods sold into America by U.S. companies, even if it is \nimpossible for those goods to be produced in America.\n  For example, if a produce company sets up a banana farm in Costa Rica \nto import bananas into the United States and around the world, the \nincome from sales to the United States is not eligible for deferral. I \nmay be mistaken on this point, but I am not aware of too many banana \nfarms in Texas or Florida, so I do not see how allowing a banana farm \nin Costa Rica is going to cost U.S. jobs.\n  Similarly, if a U.S. company wanted to start a mining operation in \nsome faraway land to extract a new and exotic mineral that is not found \nat home, they could see that anywhere in the world, but they cannot \nimport that back into the United States without triggering the impact \nof this amendment.\n\n  Or let's look at coffee. We have a lot of coffee shops on our streets \nthese days. If they set up their own coffee plantation in Brazil, they \nwould be hit by the Dorgan amendment. I think we only raise coffee in \none State in the United States, and maybe they do not do that in Hawaii \nanymore. But there is not much coffee raised in the United States. We \nsure do not raise it in my State of Iowa.\n  Our friends from New York and New Jersey ought to consider the \neffects of this amendment on Puerto Rican residents who work in plants \nowned by subsidiaries of U.S. companies. Many of the U.S. \nmultinationals have manufacturing subsidiaries in Puerto Rico that \nimport products into the U.S. market. Since our Tax Code treats Puerto \nRican corporations like foreign corporations, this amendment would hit \nthose companies very hard. But it would not hit their foreign-owned \ncompetitors who sell into the United States.\n  It seems Senator Dorgan's amendment would allow a U.S. company to \nsell a foreign-produced good to anyone in the world except Americans, \nbut it would allow a foreign-based company to sell those same goods to \nAmericans. When you stop to think about looking out for the benefit of \nAmericans, this does not make any sense.\n  I have described how the bill would operate, but I do not think this \nis the intent of the legislation. What I believe is intended is that \ndeferral should be denied if a company closes a U.S. plant, produces \nthe goods offshore, and then imports the goods back into the United \nStates.\n  This does not actually happen very often. We have had this debate \nbefore. The last time I spoke on this issue was when we were debating \nthe JOBS bill back in 2004. I do not think much has changed since then.\n  At that time, the latest Department of Commerce data on U.S. \nmultinationals showed that only 7 percent of foreign subsidiary sales \nwere into the United States--only 7 percent.\n  Nevertheless, this amendment insists that the rule of ``deferral'' in \nour tax law is somehow a ``tax benefit'' that moves jobs offshore and \nallows you to not pay taxes on foreign income. This is not true, of \ncourse. Deferral has nothing to do with moving jobs, and it never \nforgives taxes that are owed on foreign profits of U.S. companies.\n  Many U.S. companies, however, choose to reinvest their foreign \nearnings in foreign markets, and so the U.S. tax on those earnings is, \nthen, indefinitely deferred.\n  As Senator Dorgan noted, the JOBS bill, that we call the American \nJobs Creation Act of 2004, did contain a provision that provided U.S. \nmultinationals a temporary ability to receive dividends from their \nforeign subsidiaries at a reduced tax rate. Now, it is important to \nnote that companies could only avail themselves of this reduced rate on \nan amount of earnings they identified in SEC filings as ``permanently \nreinvested.'' That is a legal term, which means they had no intention \nof bringing that money back to the United States.\n  Senator Dorgan's characterization of that provision is misleading, \nand I would say in two ways. First, Senator Dorgan calls the \nrepatriation provision a tax cut of over $100 billion. To arrive at \nthat huge number, the Senator's calculation must assume these companies \nwould have brought close to $340 billion of their foreign earnings home \nin the absence of the repatriation provision of the JOBS bill.\n\n[[Page S475]]\n\n  Now, the fact is--and I get this from scoring by the nonpartisan \nJoint Committee on Taxation--this provision has a cost to the Treasury \nof not $100 billion but $1.9 billion over 5 years and $3.3 billion over \n10 years; and it actually scored as a revenue raiser in the first year \nof $2.8 billion.\n  Now, I plan on looking at the actual results of this repatriation \nprovision when all the facts are in, after the fact. You are kind of \nguessing before you pass a bill. But after it has operated for a couple \nyears, then you get a chance to get a real look at it. So we are going \nto look at this repatriation provision. But the Joint Committee on \nTaxation must have scored this provision as a raiser in year 1, and a \nrelatively small cost over 5 and 10 years, because 5.25 percent of a \nlarge amount that was repatriated is a lot more than 35 percent of a \nmuch smaller amount that would have been repatriated otherwise.\n  In other words, it is not as much money coming back into this \ncountry, and if it does not come back here, it is not taxed.\n  I am not here to defend the repatriation provision or those companies \nthat laid off workers or took advantage of the repatriation provision. \nI am just as troubled by those announcements as Senator Dorgan. I am \nsimply pointing out that Senator Dorgan's characterization of that \nprovision as a $100 billion tax cut is extremely misleading.\n  Second, Senator Dorgan talks as if the repatriation provision was the \ncornerstone of the American Jobs Creation Act, and it was kind of an \nappendage. In fact, the repatriation provision was a very small part of \nthe bill. One of the key pieces of the JOBS bill was the manufacturing \ndeduction which does actually give a tax break for companies that \nmanufacture, leaving jobs here or creating jobs here. The Joint \nCommittee on Taxation scored this provision as a cost to the Treasury \nof $76 billion over a 10-year period. That is, in fact, a tax cut, and \nit is a tax cut that will maintain jobs in America and will create jobs \nbecause one of the problems for American corporations compared to \ninternational competition is the high tax rate that we have on \ncorporations compared to a lot of other countries. Those other \ncountries are waking up. Just look at Ireland, look at Europe, what we \nare talking about doing now--sometimes through the European Union, \nsometimes through individual countries. They are seeing great advantage \nby reducing the corporate tax rate in their respective countries.\n  Two years ago, we thought we had moved ahead of them. Now they are \nfollowing suit. We may have to go back and look at our corporate tax to \nfind out if we are going to continue to be noncompetitive.\n  I would like to go back to the deferral issue. The rule of deferral \nexists to keep U.S. companies competitive in the global marketplace. \nDeferral is not something new. It has been in our tax laws since 1918. \nWe have debated the rule of deferral on several occasions, and we will \nno doubt continue to do so when we debate tax reform proposals.\n  Opponents of deferral too often make wild accusations about how this \nrule, which has been in place since 1918, spells doom for the American \nworker. Of course, none of this is true. In fact, just the opposite is \ntrue because we must always be vigilant about enhancing international \ncompetitiveness for our U.S. companies. Hence, deferral ensures an \never-growing base of opportunity for U.S. companies and, more \nimportantly, their employees at home and abroad.\n  U.S. multinationals are a critical component of our economy. These \ncompanies operate in virtually every industry and, the last time I \nchecked, have investments of more than $13 trillion in facilities \nlocated within the United States. As employers, they provided 23.5 \nmillion jobs for Americans in the year 2001. That was nearly 18 percent \nof the payroll jobs in the United States. They had a payroll of $1.1 \ntrillion. When you go back to this debate we had in the year 2004, I \nnoted at that time that the U.S. multinationals created more than 53 \npercent of the manufacturing jobs in America and employed more than two \nU.S. employees for every foreign worker. Those were the latest years \nfor which I had figures, but I have no reason to believe it is \ndifferent today.\n  During the 10 years from 1991 to 2001, U.S. multinationals increased \ndomestic employment at a faster rate than the overall economy. A recent \nstudy confirms that U.S. multinationals are significant job creators, \nand those jobs are not created through ``exporting'' jobs to foreign \nnations with low-labor and low-tax costs, as Senator Dorgan contends. \nThe Department of Commerce data shows that the bulk of the U.S. \ninvestment abroad occurs in high-income, high-wage countries.\n  Again, referring to the year 2001, 79 percent of foreign assets and \n67 percent of foreign employment of U.S. multinationals were located in \nhigh-income, developed nations such as Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, \nJapan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, and the countries of the \nEuropean Union. We have to remember a very simple maxim for why \ncompanies go into foreign markets: 4 percent of the people in the world \nlive in the United States. If you want to create jobs in America and \nyou just want to sell to that 4 percent, you are going to have a very \nlimited market. Whether you are in agriculture, like I and my son and \ngrandson are, selling corn and soybeans overseas, or whether you are \nmanufacturing John Deere tractors, whatever you are manufacturing, if \nyou want prosperity, you go where the market is. That is the 96 percent \nof the people who don't live in the United States.\n  Again, referring to that debate on the JOBS bill in 2004, fully 95 \npercent of the world's population and 80 percent of its purchasing \npower--so the only new thing I am giving is not that 96 percent of the \npeople live outside of the United States, but 80 percent of its \npurchasing power--is located outside the United States. Foreign sales \ngrowth has outstripped domestic sales growth. So our companies are \ntaking advantage of selling to the rest of the world. This increased \ngrowth requires increased employment wherever you can find it. The good \nnews is that foreign growth also results in U.S. job growth.\n  A recent study confirmed that during the 10 years from 1991 through \n2001, for every one job that U.S. multinationals created abroad, they \ncreated nearly two U.S. jobs in their parent corporations. That is why \nit is critical to our economy that U.S. companies remain competitive in \nthe international marketplace.\n\n  I would like to review a more rational explanation of deferral and \nhow it works to keep our U.S. companies competitive. The United States \ntaxes all of the worldwide income of its citizens and corporations. The \nU.S. income tax applies to all domestic and foreign earnings of U.S. \ncompanies. The United States fully taxes income earned overseas by \nforeign subsidiaries of U.S. companies. However, many foreign countries \ntax their companies on a territorial basis, meaning that they only tax \nincome earned within their country's borders and don't impose tax on \nthe earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Major countries using this \nterritorial system of corporate taxation are Australia, Belgium, \nCanada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, \nNetherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland. A company from one of these \ncountries that uses the territorial tax system has great advantage over \nU.S. companies.\n  For example, a U.S. company with a Singapore subsidiary will pay U.S. \ntax and Singapore tax on the subsidiary's income. A French company with \na Singapore subsidiary will pay Singapore tax but no French tax. This \nmeans that a U.S. company in Singapore has a higher tax burden than a \nFrench company in Singapore. Two basic tax rules answer this problem \nand seek to put U.S. companies on a level playing field with foreign \ncompetitors from territorial countries. The first rule says that when \nforeign income is brought home, the U.S. allows a reduction against \nU.S. tax for any foreign taxes paid on that income. The foreign tax \ncredit prevents the U.S. from double-taxing foreign earnings which \nwould make our companies noncompetitive in the international \nmarketplace. And like deferral, this has been in the tax law since \n1918.\n  The foreign tax credit, however, is limited. It may only offset the \nU.S. tax on that income which is currently imposed at a 35-percent \nrate. If the foreign tax rate is higher, the credit stops at 35 \npercent. If the credit is lower, say 10 percent, then additional U.S. \ntaxes\n\n[[Page S476]]\n\nwill be owed up to the full 35 percent. In this example, an additional \n25 percent of the taxes would be owed to the United States, which is \nthe difference between the 10 percent and 35 percent of the U.S. rate.\n  The second basic tax rule is that U.S. companies are allowed to defer \nU.S. tax on income from the active business operation of a foreign \nsubsidiary until that income is brought back into this country, usually \nin the form of dividends paid to the U.S. parent. This is referred to \nas the rule of deferral, meaning that the U.S. tax is deferred until \nthe earnings are brought back. This is the rule the Dorgan amendment \nattacks.\n  It is important to note that deferral is not the forgiveness of tax. \nIt simply means that we impose the full U.S. tax when foreign earnings \nare repatriated to the United States instead of doing it the very day \nof earning. The reason that we defer tax on active business operations \nis so that U.S. companies can remain competitive with foreign companies \nthat have a different system of taxation than what we have. I am \nreferring to what I called the territorial tax. We don't defer tax on \npassive activities like setting up an offshore bank account or other \npassive investments. We tax passive activities yearly. But active \noperations are subject to competitive disadvantage.\n  For example, if we impose U.S. tax today on the profits of a \nSingapore subsidiary, then the U.S. company will pay a 35-percent tax \nin the United States, net of any Singapore taxes, but that French \ncompetitor located right next door in Singapore will pay only the \nSingapore tax. If the Singapore tax rate is less than 35 percent, which \nis the U.S. tax rate, then the French competitor will have a tax \nadvantage. Who wants to give any advantage to a French competitor? This \nis because the United States allows a foreign tax credit to offset the \nU.S. income tax imposed on those foreign earnings but only up to the 35 \npercent U.S. corporate rate.\n  If the foreign rate is less than the U.S. 35 percent rate, then \nresidual U.S. taxes are owed on the difference between the U.S. tax \nrate and the foreign rate. For example, if a Singapore tax is 15 \npercent and the U.S. tax is 35 percent, then the United States will \nimpose an additional 20 percent on those Singapore earnings. The French \ncompany, however, would only pay the 15 percent Singapore tax. If we \ndid not allow deferral on that additional 20 percent of tax, then the \nU.S. company today would have a 20-percent tax disadvantage compared to \nthe French company.\n  The question on repealing deferral is whether we want to hand over \nthe world market to companies from France and Germany and other \ncountries that have a different system of taxation than we have, called \nthe territorial system. Repealing deferral means that we export our \nhigh U.S. tax rates to U.S. corporations around the globe. The United \nStates has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world. There \nare few countries with rates higher than the United States. This means \nthat without deferral, U.S. companies will be at a continual worldwide \ndisadvantage compared to their foreign competitors.\n  That is why we defer U.S. tax on active business operations, so that \nU.S. companies can be competitive in the global marketplace.\n  Some Senators have proposed repealing deferral or cutting back on it, \nas Senator Dorgan's amendment would do. These proposals would export \nthe high U.S. tax rate to U.S. operations around the world. That would \nbe fine if all companies around the world were paying the high U.S. tax \nrate, but, as I have said so many times, they are not. We have one of \nthe highest corporate tax rates in the world. Companies of foreign \ncountries are not subject to our tax laws and are usually taxed at \nlower rates. This all brings us back to the implications of Senator \nDorgan's proposal. It would enhance the competitive advantage of \nforeign-owned multinationals over U.S. multinationals.\n  Our focus in considering this amendment must be on the ability of \nAmerican companies to compete within the United States as well as in \nforeign markets if we want to maintain and create jobs in America. The \nissue is not whether we tax foreign earnings currently but whether we \ncede the U.S. market to foreign competition.\n  The Dorgan amendment will increase taxes on U.S. companies, but their \nforeign competitors in the U.S. will not face a similar tax increase. \nThis can lead to a loss of domestic market share, or even if market \nshare is maintained, losses may be incurred on domestic sales because \nof pricing pressures and uncompetitive margins created by the \nadditional tax burden.\n  No one is happy when companies move abroad to a tax haven to avoid \nU.S. tax. But let me tell you another side effect of the proposal to \neliminate and cut back on deferrals. In the American Jobs Creation Act \nof 2004--that bill I always referred to as the JOBS bill--we enacted a \nprovision that prevents corporate inversion, where a company would \npretend to move its corporate headquarters to Bermuda, to a simple post \noffice box there, and do it not because they are going to do anything \nproductive there but for the sole purpose of avoiding U.S. taxes. Many \nU.S. multinationals complained that inversions were necessitated by an \ninability to compete with foreign-owned multinationals that aren't \nsubject to the higher U.S. tax rate.\n  We should be proud, then, that we shut down those inversions, those \nshell corporations, those postal box corporations which do nothing over \nthere except go there to avoid tax and then make the situation even \nworse for honest corporate taxpayers in America that are paying the tax \ninto the Federal Treasury. But in the process of doing that, we didn't \ndo it at the expense of repealing deferral. Now that we have shut down \ninversions, if we repeal deferrals, or significantly cut back on them, \nthe only other alternative that would be available to U.S. \nmultinationals would be to sell themselves to foreign companies or to \nbe taken over by a foreign company in a possible hostile takeover. If \nwe prevent U.S. companies from deferring their foreign profits, we will \nsee more and more U.S. multinationals being bought out by foreign-owned \nmultinationals. Tax changes have consequences.\n  Increasing taxes on U.S. multinationals will not bring jobs back to \nAmerica. You only pay taxes if the company is profitable, and you only \nstay profitable as long as you remain competitive. But in the United \nStates, taxes are 35 percent cost-to-profit, and that is where a \ncompetitiveness disadvantage can occur when a U.S. company is competing \nagainst foreign companies that will not incur this tax increase.\n  Senator Baucus and I held hearings a couple years ago regarding the \neffects of the international competition within the United States, so \nwe as leaders of the Finance Committee are very familiar with the \neffects of these kinds of rate differentials.\n  I think a quote by Joseph Guttentag, international tax counsel of the \nClinton administration, during testimony before the Finance Committee \nin July of 1995 is a very good place to end this debate. So I end with \nthis quote:\n\n       Current U.S. tax policy generally strikes a reasonable \n     balance between deferral and current taxation in order to \n     ensure that our tax laws do not interfere with the ability of \n     our companies to be competitive with their foreign-based \n     counterparts.\n\n  Now, if that position just expressed by Joseph Guttentag, \ninternational tax counsel in the Clinton administration, the last \nDemocratic administration, testifying before a Republican Congress, \nisn't good enough evidence that the route Senator Dorgan wants to go is \nthe wrong route and a route contrary to previous leaders of his own \nparty, then I don't know what will be evidence that this position is \ngoing to make American companies uncompetitive, not go to the \nmarketplace of the other 96 percent of the consumers around the world \noutside the United States, and consequently creating jobs in the United \nStates, and I don't know what it takes to convince him that position is \na wrong position for the United States and is so different than what we \nhave traditionally had for the Tax Code since 1918. When I say 1918, \nthat goes back almost to the beginning of the income tax in the United \nStates.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, it is sort of with mixed emotions that I \nam\n\n[[Page S477]]\n\nhere on the floor to talk about this tax bill. In one sense, I am very \nhappy we are moving forward with the Tax Increase Protection Act. At \nthe same time, I am at somewhat of a loss as to why we are spending 2, \n3, and maybe more days of the Senate's time for something that is \ntraditionally done when there is comity and cooperativeness in the \nSenate by unanimous consent, putting in a substitute Senate-passed bill \nfor the House bill and go to conference. That is something we do \nroutinely here, almost daily. We have disagreements with the House, and \nwe simply go through the procedure of moving to conference and having \nthose differences worked out.\n  Unfortunately, we are at a time here where even routine things become \nweeklong labors to accomplish them. That does not reflect well on the \nSenate. I don't believe it accomplishes anything other than to delay \nother matters that are to come before the Senate.\n  We have a very important bill dealing with an issue that is of vital \nimportance to my State--many manufacturing jobs in my State--and that \nis the asbestos debacle going on throughout the courts in this country \nwhere over half of the money paid out by corporations in asbestos \nclaims has gone to lawyers. There are many people in the Commonwealth \nof Pennsylvania who are literally getting pennies--people who are sick \nand some are dying and some have died, and they have received literally \npennies for their exposure to asbestos and their subsequent disease \nbecause of the horrific environment of litigation on asbestos, where \nlawyers are profiting and patients--those who are sick or are survivors \nof those who have gotten ill and died--get virtually nothing. This is \nsomething we have to address.\n  Instead of addressing that, which is what we should be doing right \nnow, we are holding up the Senate on a procedural matter. It is truly \nsad that we can no longer just cooperate on the normal business. \nEverything is obstruction and slowdown and political potshots and \nmaking points. I think that is unfortunate for this body. It sets a \nvery dangerous precedent that we are going to conduct business like \nthis in the future. Whether it is in the next election or elections in \nthe future, at some point in time, the tables will turn. I believe what \nwe are establishing today is not something that will be beneficial for \nthe long term in our ability to get things done in the Senate.\n  While the chairman is still on the Senate floor, I thank him again. I \nam repeating this because we are doing the same bill. I thank him for \nall the hard work he has put into this bill. The fact that he was able \nto get a bipartisan bill through the Senate is a testament to him, and \nI know it is very difficult and trying, negotiating within our own \nconference as well as negotiating with Members on the other side of the \naisle. He was able to, as he has done on many occasions, cut through \nall of the difficulty and partisanship and the angst some Members have \nabout various provisions and find a good middle ground, and well over \n60 Members of the Senate supported the Senate bill that passed in \nNovember. I thank him for his good work and for the work he has done \nwith me, in particular, on the issue of helping the nonprofit sector in \nour society meet the needs of those.\n  We were at the prayer breakfast this morning, and Senator Grassley \nwas there. We heard Bono and the President talk about taking care of \nthe least of our brothers and sisters. The President says it so well. I \nhave been advocating so long that nobody really does it better than our \nfaith-based communities and our community nonprofits. They are the ones \non the front line. We talked about it at the prayer breakfast--whether \nit is responding to a natural disaster or, more often and less \nprominently, responding to a person in need in our communities across \nAmerica, rich as well as poor, people in need who are suffering.\n  It is important that we recognize that portion of this bill has to be \na net plus for our charitable community. There are provisions in there \nthat I have expressed concerns about which would do damage to those \nnonprofits' ability to be able to provide the needed services and to do \nthe good works in our communities that make America stronger.\n  We have some good charitable-giving incentives, which are a big plus, \nbut we also have charitable reforms on which I worked with the \nchairman. I think that maybe we are 90 percent of the way there, making \nsure we weed out some bad practices and making sure there isn't abuse \nwithin the charitable field, but at the same time not saddling our \ncharities with a Sarbanes-Oxley type of oversight and regulations that \nwould drive a lot of our small volunteer-oriented nonprofits out of \nexistence and leave a big hole in our communities across America.\n  I am hopeful that when we get to the House and into conference, \nChairman Thomas will work with us and we will be able to get a bill \nthat will be not only a net plus but a big plus for the armies of \ncompassion, the foot soldiers across America who are helping men and \nwomen in need and children in need in our society.\n  A big part of this bill, obviously, is the tax relief. It is not \nexactly what I had hoped for. It is one of those compromises we had to \nmake along the way. I thought the House bill actually had some better \nprovisions when it comes to some of the tax provisions. It continues on \na policy that has resulted in a lot of positive economic news over the \npast several years since 2003. We have seen that by these changes in \nthe Tax Code and reducing marginal rates and capital gains taxes and \ndividends, it has incentivized the entrepreneurial spirit and \nincentivized business investment; it has created an explosion of growth \nin this country, which has also resulted in millions of people getting \njobs--net new jobs across America.\n  I have a chart that shows, since the Jobs and Growth Act of May of \n2003, and looking at the real GDP growth in America, there is a \ndramatic tilting upward since these provisions were passed. That has \nresulted in a dramatic increase, as we have seen on some other charts, \nin Federal revenues.\n  There is a constant complaint, a drumbeat on the other side of the \naisle, and from a few on this side of the aisle, that somehow we cannot \nafford these tax reductions.\n  It is interesting; if you think of tax reductions, that leaves the \nquestion, What is a tax reduction? What is a tax reduction? Is a tax \nreduction a reduction in the taxes paid; or is it a reduction in the \nrate of the tax paid? What is a tax reduction?\n  Depending on how you view a tax reduction--and the answer is \ndifferent based on what we did--if you look at, Did we reduce taxes, \nthe answer is, with respect to rates, yes, we reduced taxes; we reduced \nthe capital gains dividend rates, the marginal tax rates. We reduced \nthe rates on the taxation of married couples and in several other \nareas. So, yes, we reduced the rate of tax.\n  The question is, Did we reduce the collection of taxes? What should \nCongress be more concerned about? Should we be more concerned about the \nrates of taxes or should we be more concerned about the collection of \ntax revenues?\n  I would think most people, when we have cut taxes, would say we \nreduced the collection of taxes in America. That is not what happened. \nWhen we reduced the rate of taxes, when we cut taxes, we actually \ndidn't cut taxes. We actually increased the flow of revenue to the \nFederal Government.\n  So if we are looking at it from the standpoint of the budgeteers, the \nfolks who are responsible for managing the receipts and distributions \nof Government, then the actions taken by the Congress in 2001 and 2003 \nresulted in increased taxes paid to the Federal Government through a \npolicy that believes in the innovation and the energy of the people, \nthat if you unshackle them from higher tax rates, they will produce \nmore, they will create more jobs--and job growth has been terrific, \nover 2 million jobs, and the unemployment rate has been under 5 \npercent--and we end up with a better quality of life, more revenue to \nthe Federal Government, and higher growth rates overall in our economy.\n  That is a pretty good picture. So why the complaints? Why are people \nso upset that we actually put a program in place that has resulted in \nmore revenues coming to the Federal Government? Why the complaints? Why \nthe gnashing of teeth that somehow this is a policy that is harmful to \nthe budget deficit? Revenues were up 14 percent last year. How is that \nharmful to the budget deficit?\n\n[[Page S478]]\n\n  They say: That would have happened; in fact, we would have gotten \nmore money had we not reduced taxes. Is that true? Let's look at the \ncapital gains issue.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2003 that we would \ncollect roughly $125 billion in the year 2004 and 2005 in capital gains \ntaxes. We went ahead and reduced the capital gains tax rate. Many of us \nstood on the floor and said, by reducing that rate, we will actually \nget more revenues. The Congressional Budget Office said ``no,'' \neverybody on the other side said ``no,'' and, in fact, everybody on the \nother side still said ``no'' and still says we shouldn't keep those \nrates low, we have to increase those rates because we need the money.\n  How did it work out? What happened when we reduced those rates? Did \nwe get, as the Congressional Budget Office suggested, $26 billion less \nmoney? And that is what they projected. They projected in 2004 and 2005 \nthat the amount of money coming into the Treasury in capital gains \ntaxes paid would go down by $26 billion. What happened? Now we know. \nThe amount of revenue collected in capital gains taxes went up $27 \nbillion.\n  I was talking to a reporter the other day. I said: Lo and behold, I \nvoted for a tax increase and didn't even know it. I voted for a \nprovision that actually increased taxes to the Federal Government, and \nthe folks who paid those taxes were very happy to pay them, by the way, \nbecause they were investing in America and America's values were \nincreasing. Stock in America, real estate in America, the things that \nmade wealth in America were increasing because of a growing economy \nbecause of what we did on the floor of the Senate, and they were very \nhappy to have paid those taxes. And we got more Federal revenues.\n  What does the other side want to do? They want to have that rate go \nback up. One might suggest that if the rate goes back up, revenues \ncould do down. What could be their motivation? What is the motivation \nof trying to increase a tax to get less revenue? Think about it. What \ncould be the possible motivation of coming to the floor of the Senate \nand saying we need to increase taxes, even though by doing so we are \ngoing to get less money. Why would you do that? From a public policy \nperspective, why would you want to do that?\n  I can tell you that the argument is given that we need it to balance \nthe budget. Wait a minute. We are going to get less money, so why would \nyou do it? Could it be something of the whole politics of envy, the \npolitics of pointing the finger at those who are successful, get a \npaycheck, and invest in America and say we need to tax them more; that \nis the fairness issue? We hear that a lot on the floor of the Senate: \nIt is about fairness. That is what it is about? Stick it to those who \nsucceeded, invested, purchased real estate, purchased stocks and bonds; \nwe are going to take a bigger chunk of their money because that is \nfair. We may get less revenue, we may get slower economic growth, fewer \njobs will be created, but we will feel better.\n\n  That is not sound public policy. That is not in the best interest of \nthe American people. We did not get in the Senate bill a reduction of \ncapital gains tax rate extension for 2 more years, but I will tell you \nthat we will work very hard in the conference to make sure that \nhappens. It is important for the economic growth of our country, for \nthe job creation in our country, and for Federal revenues that we get \nthat extension in law.\n  There are a lot of games being played on the floor of the Senate when \nit comes to tax policy and the politics of envy. What we should be \nfocused on is how does this Senate, how does this Government create the \nbest environment for growth opportunity and job creation and how do we \ndo it in a way that is fiscally responsible. Those are the two things \non which we should be focusing.\n  I would make the argument that the bill before us, which prevents an \nincrease in taxes--these are tax policies that are in place right now; \nthere is no new policy or, I should say, very minor, little new policy \nchanges, such as the charitable giving incentives, but very small \npolicy changes, a very small percentage of the money. The overall bill \ndeals with provisions such as the alternative minimum tax, which is \nvitally important and the small saver's credit, which is important. \nAbout a quarter of a million people in my State strongly support that \nprovision, in fact, would strongly support increased incentives for \nlow-income individuals to save and, in fact, put forth a bill with \nformer Senator Corzine to do that. So I am looking for another new \ncosponsor if anybody wants to join. It is called a kid's account to \ngive every child in America a nest egg to begin to save at their birth.\n  I am big on giving people the opportunity to save, invest, build \nwealth, and feel connected to the economy of this country. We need to \ndo more of that. But we have a little piece of that here, which is \nimportant to the people in my State. Mr. President, 150,000 families \nand students in my State will lose their deduction for college tuition \nif we don't extend that provision. With regard to the teacher tax \ncredit provision Senator Collins championed, 142,000 teachers in \nPennsylvania will not be able to deduct that. We can go on and on.\n  These are preventions of tax increases, a tax reduction that caused \nthe kind of economic growth we have seen. It is important for us to \nhave these provisions stay in law.\n  Finally, I want to talk about an issue that has been brought up--and \nit is an important issue--and that is the issue of mine safety. I know \nSenator Rockefeller has put forth an idea that I think deserves some \nconsideration because it has merit. It provides mining companies with \nincentives to make available newer technology that will enhance safety.\n  We have seen over the last month in West Virginia and we saw, I \nguess, 3 years ago in Pennsylvania, mine disasters occur where human \nlife was lost, in the cases of West Virginia, and certainly a major \ndisaster was diverted in Quecreek in Pennsylvania.\n  This is a serious issue, one I care deeply about. My grandfather was \na coal miner in a deep mine for 30 years, so this is very close to home \nfor me. This is one issue we need to do something about, to improve the \nsafety for those who literally risk their lives every day to provide \nfor their families, to build strong communities, and to provide energy \nfor all of us so these lights will work in the Chamber. We need to do \nall we can to improve enforcement as well as to create incentives for \nthe mining community to improve safety at the workplace.\n  There is another provision in the Rockefeller bill that has to do \nwith training for rescue teams. Because of the way it is written, I \nhave some concerns about it. I heard from a lot of our small mining \noperations, family-run operations, that this provision would not \nbenefit them at all.\n  As we know, a large percentage--at least in my State--a large \npercentage of the mine operations in my State are not big corporate \nmining operations. They are small, in some cases small corporations, \nfamily-run operations. So while I certainly strongly support the first \nprovision and support the concept behind the second provision, I have \nserious concerns about the way that provision will tilt to the benefit \nof the larger mining operations.\n  While I support it and will support this amendment, I hope it is \nincluded and that we can work on something in conference to include \nimprovement of mine safety, I am putting my marker down here that we \nwill do so not to discriminate against small mines versus larger mining \noperations. If anything--if anything--we should be concerned about, as \nwe do on a lot of issues in the Senate, helping the little guy, as \nopposed to helping the big guy because the big guys already have the \nresources to spend to provide for a safer workplace.\n  What we should be doing is focusing on how we can make smaller mining \noperations safer. That is not what this amendment that Senator \nRockefeller puts forward does. As a result of that, while I support it \nand will support the provision to be included in the conference, I put \nthe marker down that we are going to work diligently to make sure it \nuniformly impacts across the industry and, if anything, it benefits the \nsmaller mine operator as opposed to the bigger one. That is not the way \nit is currently drafted.\n  I completely understand. I don't think Senator Rockefeller--at least \nI\n\n[[Page S479]]\n\nhope he didn't go in there with the idea that we are going to favor one \nsegment of the mining industry over the other. I hope that is not his \nintention. Whether it is his intention, I will certainly work with him \nto make sure it is a much more balanced provision when it comes out of \nconference.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank the chairman for yielding the time \nto speak on this important bill. I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. My friend from Iowa came to the floor to speak a bit this \nmorning on a couple of subjects I spoke about yesterday. Let me again \nsay I have very high regard for Senator Grassley. We worked together on \na good number of issues. I enjoy working with him. But there are times \nwhen you have disagreements on policy, and we certainly have that on an \nissue I am going to talk about. It is an issue he talked about this \nmorning as well. Actually, there are a couple of tax issues.\n  Before I do, however, I want to just make a slight correction to the \nremarks that were made by the Senator from Pennsylvania a few minutes \nago. I heard him say the Democrats were holding up this bill on, I \nguess--I think he said a technicality. I think he said it was a \ntechnicality. I think that was the impression he intended to leave, \nobstruct or holding this up on a technicality.\n  I guess the technicality is our interest in offering amendments. I \nknow to some that is not a pleasant thing around here, to have people \noffer amendments and actually debate them and vote on them, but that is \nthe way the system works. The reason there are not amendments offered--\nand I would try to offer one right now, but I would be unable to offer \none--is because the majority party has done something that is called \nfilling the tree. It is a parliamentary procedure to make sure every \nbranch of this legislative tree is filled so that no one is allowed to \noffer an amendment.\n  For example, while this bill is on the floor, under the rules of the \nSenate, I should be able to offer an amendment. The majority party \ndecided to fill the tree, as it is called, so no one on this side may \noffer an amendment. So when my colleague from Pennsylvania said the \nDemocratic side of the aisle is using a technicality--whatever, I \nforget his term exactly--to hold this up, I am sorry that is not what \nis happening at all.\n  He made a point that I share. I think it would be great to work \ntogether. I think there ought to be less rancid partisanship and we \nought to find ways to work together to do the Nation's business. We, \nafter all, represent the same interests. We represent the interests of \nthis country. I hope we represent the interests of the American people. \nI would like to find areas where we can work together.\n  In this case, however, let me just say there is no obstruction going \non here. The only obstruction is we are obstructed from being able to \noffer an amendment which in ordinary circumstances the rules of the \nSenate would permit. I regret that. I wish the majority party would \nhave allowed me. I would have offered the amendment yesterday, in fact, \nand I would offer it right now. I have an amendment to offer. I guess \nwe will vote on it later because you will have to have a circumstance \nwhere we can offer the amendment. I suppose the purpose is to allow \namendments to be offered when all time is expired so there is no debate \nthat is allowed. I guess that is probably the purpose. But I did want \nto disabuse anyone of the notion left by my colleague from Pennsylvania \nthat somehow it is this side that is hanging all of this up.\n  It may be inconvenient to have people offer amendments in the Senate, \nbut there are a couple of hundred years of tradition of this \ninconvenience. The inconvenience is to be able to offer ideas, debate \nthe ideas in the form of an amendment, and then have a vote, and the \nvote determines whether the idea that is offered represents public \npolicy that the full Senate will accept.\n  Let me just respond to a couple of things my distinguished colleague \nfrom Iowa has said. Yesterday, I gave a presentation talking about \nsomething called deferral. I know most of these things sound like \nforeign language around here. Deferral of income tax obligations is \nwhat it is. If a company does business overseas, an American company \ndoes business overseas and earns income overseas, at some point when it \nbrings those profits, that income back to our country, they will be \nrequired to pay an income tax to our country for the income they have \nearned. They will get a credit, actually, against taxes they paid to a \nforeign country so they will not be double-taxed. But when they \nrepatriate that income, as it is called, they have to pay a tax.\n  My colleagues in the Congress, a sufficient number of colleagues who \nrepresent the majority, decided that they wanted to have a kind of \nlittle sweetheart deal for companies that would repatriate their \nearnings because many companies park their earnings for a long while \noverseas and don't bring them back. When they bring them back they have \nto pay the full tax rate. My colleagues said: Let's create new jobs in \nAmerica by allowing these companies to bring their income back, and we \nwill give them a special superdeal.\n  You have heard of blue light specials; this is the blue light special \nof all specials. It says you bring that money back from overseas, you \nget to pay not 35 percent, not 30 percent, not 25 percent, not 15 \npercent or 10 percent--which is the lowest income tax rate that is paid \nby the lowest income earner who has to pay income taxes--you get to pay \na 5.25-income-tax rate. Who is the ``you''? The biggest companies in \nour country: Ford Motor, for one thing. I mention that because when \nthey announced they are going to lay off 30,000, they also said: By the \nway, we picked up a quarter of a billion dollars of tax refunds under \nthe Jobs Creation Act. Isn't that interesting? Ford Motor said in the \nsame press release: We are going to lay off 30,000 workers in this \ncountry and, by the way, we were able to get a quarter of a billion \ndollars, a $250 million benefit from the jobs creation tax rate special \nbenefit of 5.25 percent.\n\n  The whole purpose was to create jobs in our country and, at least in \nthe most recent job announcement of 30,000 jobs lost, the very company \nthat announces 30,000 jobs gone points out they got a quarter of \nbillion dollars under this provision.\n  My colleagues seem to suggest the provision really does work, it is \nhelpful. No, it doesn't work. It didn't work. By my calculation, the \nincome that was parked overseas and at some point would have had to \nhave been repatriated to this country, that income would have borne a \ntax that is about $104 billion more than what was paid under the 5.25 \npercent.\n  Is anybody going to have to answer to that? I don't know. Maybe not. \nMaybe nobody cares--$104 billion. You could reduce the Federal debt, \nreduce the annual budget deficit. You could probably provide some \nhealth care to people who do not have it, perhaps help some kids who \nare hungry, perhaps provide health care for kids who are sick, improve \nsome classrooms in schools that need improvement--maybe there is a lot \nof things you could do. But $104 billion, that is a tax break given to \nthe biggest corporations in this country who brought income back to our \ncountry and would have had to pay normal income tax rates but were told \nby this Congress that we are going to give you a superspecial deal that \nno other American taxpayer has: 5.25 income tax rate.\n  Wouldn't every American love to pay a 5.25 income tax rate? But they \ncan't. That deal is just reserved by the Congress for some bigger \ninterests.\n  I didn't vote for that. I didn't support it. I strongly opposed it. \nMy colleague who sat in this chair right here, Senator Fritz Hollings, \nwho is now retired, offered the amendment to strip that out, but we \nwere not successful. So this blue light special, 5.25 percent special \nincome tax rate for big interests who were bringing money back from \noverseas--it got done and $104 billion, as I calculate it, was saved by \nthose who otherwise would have had to pay regular income tax rates.\n  I wanted to respond to that because I still think that was one of the \ngoofiest ideas in the world for this Congress to embrace, saying let's \nprovide a 5.25 tax rate because we think it will create jobs. The \nevidence is all around us. It didn't create jobs. In fact, I have \ncharts saying the largest companies that got some of the biggest \nbenefits--one company got a $14.5 million benefit and laid off 14,500 \npeople--almost complete\n\n[[Page S480]]\n\nand perfect symmetry, wasn't it? Except they were supposed to have \nhired people if they got this kind of special tax rate. They just \nforgot and laid them off, I guess.\n  Let me go to the other point which is what persuaded my colleague to \ncome to the floor and engage on this issue, and that was the point I \nmade yesterday. We have a provision in our Tax Code that says to \nsomeone in Iowa or North Dakota or Colorado or Pennsylvania, if you \nhave a manufacturing plant and you are across the street from your \ncompetitor and your competitor has a manufacturing plant and you \nproduce exactly the same products but you do something different, you \nmove your jobs to China and manufacture your widgets in China, your \ncompetitor across the street stays home and manufactures them here in \nthis country--one thing has happened as a result of that move. We have \nembedded in this Tax Code a perverse incentive that says: By the way, \nwe will give you a break. You move those jobs to China, close your \nplant door, get rid of your workers, produce in China, and we will give \nyou a tax break. You are not going to pay as much in income taxes as \nyour competitor across the street who stayed in this country.\n  I think that is wrong. Going all the way back to 1961 with John F. \nKennedy, proposals have existed to change it. Going back to 1987, the \nHouse actually passed legislation to change it. But we can't change it \nany longer because now, of course, the big economic interests that \nbenefit a lot from that--and we have a lot of companies getting rid of \nAmerican workers, padlocking their doors and shipping the jobs to \nChina. I have spoken about many of them on the floor of the Senate. We \nhave a lot of companies that like this tax break. Why? They like to \nhire people for 33 cents an hour, produce the product in China, sell it \nin Cincinnati or Toledo or Pittsburgh, and then run their income \nthrough the Grand Cayman Islands, through the Ugland House on Church \nStreet on the island of Grand Cayman, that houses 12,748. It is just an \naddress, of course, but the purpose is to reduce the tax burden.\n  My point is on four occasions when I offered amendments on the floor \nof the Senate so we ought to at least decide as a country that we will \nnot provide financial incentives in the Tax Code for those who decide \nto move their jobs overseas--that ought to be the least we ought to do. \nThat ought to be the baby step in the right direction--but four times \nwe have voted and on four occasions those big interests that really \nlike this and have benefits from it have been able to persuade a \nmajority of the Senate to oppose closing that loophole.\n  I indicated yesterday I would once again offer that legislation. I \nwould offer it right this moment except I am prevented because the \nmajority has done what is called filled the tree and prevented anybody \nfrom offering any amendments. My colleague from Iowa came down this \nmorning and offered what I believe is called the Banana defense. That \nis what he called it the last time he offered it. It had to do \nsomething with bananas.\n  I don't know, maybe we could debate apricots or tailpipes or bananas. \nIt doesn't matter to me what the product is. We could have a long \ndebate about it. I will just call this the banana debate then. But \nwhatever the product or circumstances, the question remains: Do you \nbelieve that our Tax Code ought to provide financial benefits and \nrewards to companies that have decided to move their jobs overseas? \nShould Huffy bicycle have gotten a reward for firing all their workers \nand producing Huffy bicycles in China? Should Radio Flyer little red \nwagon have gotten a benefit from moving all their jobs overseas? Fruit \nof the Loom, should they have gotten the benefit?\n  I could go on at some length. Fig Newton cookies, when they went to \nMonterrey, Mexico, should they get a benefit? If you think yes, then \ngood for you, and I suppose the benefit will continue to exist in our \nTax Code, but we are going to continue to vote on it. I am not \ndeterred. As far as I am concerned we can vote 10 times on it. At some \npoint there will be enough people filling the seats in this Chamber to \nunderstand that at a time that we have a crisis, and it is a crisis \nwith substantial numbers of jobs moving outside of this country in \nsearch of lower labor costs to produce products to ship back into this \ncountry, at a time when we have that kind of crisis and the American \npeople are facing downward pressure on wages, they are facing the \nstripping away of their pensions, the loss of their health care--at a \ntime when we have that kind of crisis, the question is: Will there be \nenough people filling the seats in this Chamber to stand up and say \nlet's take the first baby step in addressing it?\n  The first baby step is to say: Let's not provide incentives in the \nTax Code for companies to move those jobs overseas. If we can't do \nthat, we can't solve this problem. But we will have plenty of chances. \nWe will have one more chance now. We had four chances previously.\n  I respect everybody's ability and interest to vote however they \nchoose in this Chamber. I don't demean their reputation nor diminish \ntheir capability. I only say that I feel very strongly that if they \nsupport this provision, they are wrong. They are wrong for this \ncountry. The right public policy position is at least to have some \nbasic neutrality on the question of whether we want to export jobs and \nwhether we want to have the financial incentives for exporting jobs in \nour Tax Code.\n  I regret that we don't have a back and forth. I would love to have a \nreal debate about this because I know there are those who benefit \nhandsomely from this who want to continue it and want it to remain in \nthe Tax Code. But I feel strongly that this provision that is known as \ndeferral--and, incidentally, my repeal of deferral does not go to the \nJohn F. Kennedy proposal on repealing deferral. My repeal on deferral \nis rather narrow. It is those companies that leave this country and \nship back into this country.\n  I think it is a perfectly appropriate thing, especially now given the \ncrisis we face with jobs and opportunities in this country, for us to \ndo that.\n  I have a right, under the procedures of the Senate, to offer this \namendment. I should have the right to offer it at the moment but I am \nnot because there is--I guess the word ``obstruction'' is to be used--\nobstruction at the moment is the tree is filled so that no one can \noffer an amendment. So we are going into some process that is a vote-\narama, and I will offer the amendment, and we will have a vote.\n  Let me finally say it again.\n  There is not one Member of the Senate that puts on a dark suit every \nmorning and comes to work here that has ever been threatened to have \ntheir job outsourced--not one. There is not a person here that is ever \ngoing to have their job outsourced. Maybe they do not think much about \nit. I don't know. We have all of these people in blue suits who come \nhere every day and we talk and we talk, and mostly we talk. We are good \nat talking.\n  But the question for most Americans who worry about their jobs and \nwho see their neighbors' jobs moved overseas is, Will their jobs be \nmoved? The question for them is, Will Congress do something about it?\n  I mentioned a few moments ago the Ugland House in the Grand Cayman \nIslands, which is a slightly different approach than the Tax Code I \nhave been describing.\n  I wanted to mention that there is a man from Bloomberg News named \nDavid Evans who has done some reporting on this Ugland House. The \nUgland House is a house on Church Street in the Cayman Islands. It was, \naccording to news reports, dug out by David Evans, who has done the \nresearch. This is a five-story white building that houses 12,748 \ncompanies. It doesn't really house 12,748 companies--it is an address. \nThis is a five-story white house address on Church Street in the Cayman \nIslands. Why would 12,000 companies congregate to have an address in \nthis five-story building? There is only one reason. And, by the way, \nevery one of them are represented by the same law firm. Why? So they \ndon't have to pay taxes, that is why.\n  They want to access cheap labor in Asia, sell in America, and run it \nthrough the Cayman Islands so they don't pay taxes.\n  That is what this is all about.\n  Because we have a tax bill on the floor of the Senate, I have another \namendment that I will not be offering now for those companies that want \nto congregate at an address in a tax-haven country, the Cayman Islands. \nBut if you are creating an address to\n\n[[Page S481]]\n\nhave a tax haven and avoid taxes, you shall be treated for tax purposes \nas if you have never left our country. You don't get to claim that you \nnow have an address in the Ugland House, and, therefore, you are \nrunning your income through that house. My legislation would say you \nare going to be treated as if you never left for business purposes.\n  We can shut that down like that, if Members of Congress have the \ninterest and the will.\n  Does anybody believe this is anything other than a huge scam, by \nhaving a little five-story house with 12,000 businesses congregate \nthere under the umbrella of a law firm that runs their mail through \nthat place in order to avoid paying U.S. taxes?\n  Thanks to David Evans for the work he has done. But in many ways, I \nthink this is the tip of the iceberg. There is substantial tax \navoidance going on. Some of it is legal. The first description I made \ntoday was the description of the avoidance of what I think is about \n$104 billion in taxes under the 5.25-percent special tax deal.\n  The other one I mentioned, deferral for those who move their jobs \noverseas, that is in law. I am not criticizing companies for following \nthe law. I am criticizing the Congress for not changing the law and \ndoing what we should do--stand up for American jobs.\n  I was thinking I had actually done plenty yesterday to either aid or \ninjure my cause, however one views these issues. But when I heard my \ncolleague from Iowa come to the floor today, I at least wanted to \nrespond to that. As I was coming over, I heard my colleague from \nPennsylvania say someone else was obstructing, I guess, the work of the \nCongress over what I think is a technicality, and the technicality was \nwe wanted to offer amendments.\n  I say to my colleague, there is never a technicality when someone \nwants to offer an amendment. If the rules allow us to offer amendments, \njust have the amendments, have a little debate, vote regular order, and \nlet it go. When it is done and the dust is settled, we decide what we \ndecide, and everybody is responsible for the vote they cast.\n  My colleague from Pennsylvania said he wished we would be a little \nless partisan. So do I. I think we need to find ways to make this a \nlittle less partisan. A good step in that direction would be, for \nexample, for somebody to right now come out and say: We have a bill on \nthe floor, let us have regular order. If amendments are, by the way, \nallowed, let us go ahead and offer them. Will you give us a time \nagreement? Sure. Vote, act the way legislators should act, and at the \nend of the day, we will all feel better about that.\n  That is what the Senate ought to be about when we call this the \ngreatest deliberative body in the world. It has slipped a bit. We can \nregain that status if we only decide amendments are good and not bad \nthings. Debate is good--not bad. The noise of democracy coming from the \nSenate is welcome noise for the American people, if we are engaged in \nconstructive debate about issues that matter.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today, in recognition of the \nbeginning of Black History Month, in support of a bill to posthumously \naward a congressional gold medal to Constance Baker Motley, an American \nhero who, sadly, passed away on September 28, 2005, after having lived \nan extraordinary and exemplary life. I am pleased to introduce this \nbill along with my colleague from New York, Senator Clinton.\n  Constance Baker Motley was the first African-American woman, and only \nthe fifth woman, to serve on the Federal judiciary. Before becoming a \njudge, she was a renowned civil rights lawyer, public servant, and \ntrailblazer. Her remarkable career reads like a civil rights history \nbook.\n  After earning her bachelor of arts degree in Economics from New York \nUniversity and her law degree from Columbia University, Judge Motley \njoined Thurgood Marshall at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational \nFund. For two decades, Judge Motley worked closely with Marshall and \nother leading civil rights lawyers to dismantle desegregation \nthroughout the country.\n  As a Black woman practicing law in the South, Judge Motley endured \ngawking and physical threats. But she was not deterred.\n  She won cases that ended segregation in Memphis restaurants and at \nWhites-only lunch counters in Birmingham, AL. She fought for Dr. Martin \nLuther King, Jr.'s right to march in Albany, GA, and visited him in \njail whenever he was arrested.\n  Judge Motley was the only woman on the legal team that won the \nlandmark desegregation case, Brown v. Board of Education. She went on \nto argue 10 major civil rights cases before the Supreme Court, winning \nall but one of them, including James Meredith's fight to gain admission \nto the University of Mississippi.\n  Before she died, Judge Motley would grin when she told people that \nshe actually won 20 years later the only Supreme Court case that she \nlost, when the Court eventually agreed with her position and adopted \nher reasoning in holding that it was a violation of equal protection \nfor prosecutors to use their peremptory challenges to strike Blacks \nfrom a jury because of their race.\n  In 1964, Judge Motley became the first African-American woman elected \nto the New York State Senate, and in 1965, she became the first \nAfrican-American woman, and first woman, to serve as a city borough \npresident. During this time, Judge Motley worked tirelessly to \nrevitalize the inner city and improve urban housing and public schools.\n  In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Judge Motley to the \nSouthern District of New York. She was confirmed 9 months later, over \nthe strong opposition of Southern Senators. As a judge, Motley \ncontinued her commitment to social justice.\n  She rose to the position of Chief Judge in 1982, and assumed senior \nstatus 4 years later. Judge Motley served with distinction for nearly \nfour decades, until she passed away last fall, at the age of 84. At \nthat time, I was pleased to introduce a Senate resolution, which passed \nby unanimous consent with 27 Democrat and Republican cosponsors, to \nhonor her life and achievements.\n  Since then, our country has lost two other great civil rights heroes, \nRosa Parks and Coretta Scott King. Both of these remarkable women were \nawarded congressional gold medals for their leadership and \ncontributions to American society while they were alive. I deeply \nregret that Judge Motley was not. But it is not too late for us to show \nour national appreciation to her friends and family. Congressional gold \nmedals are reserved expressly for that purpose, and Judge Motley's \nlifelong commitment to the advancement of civil rights and social \njustice, and her lengthy career in public service, is worthy of just \nthat.\n  The Senate Banking Committee requires 67 cosponsors before it will \nconsider legislation to award a congressional gold medal. I am pleased \nto introduce this bill with 16 other original cosponsors from both \nsides of the aisle. I now call on all of my Senate colleagues to join \nus this Black History Month to give thanks on behalf of the country to \none of our greatest civil rights leaders and public servants, Judge \nConstance Baker Motley.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  I will make some additional points on the Dorgan tax haven included \nin the Conrad substitute. I share Senator Conrad's concerns about the \nability of large corporations to manipulate the Tax Code, to shift \nlarge amounts of profit offshore, but this provision is not the right \nway to address those concerns. It is very overbroad and inadequate. It \nis overbroad because it harms the competitiveness of United States \nmultinationals, repealing deferral for holding company structures\n\n[[Page S482]]\n\nthat allow them to efficiently allocate active foreign generated \nresources among their foreign operations without incurring U.S. tax on \nentirely foreign transactions.\n  It is inadequate because it applies only to the subsidiaries in \nblack-listed countries. Companies that use tax savings for abusive \npurposes could easily avoid this rule by locating in a low-tax country \nthat is not on the list.\n  Ireland would be a perfect example of that, where we read press \nreports that companies such as Microsoft are shifting huge profits. \nTreasury would have authority to add countries to the list, but does \nanyone think Ireland, with whom we already have a tax treaty, would be \nadded to that black list? The way to deal with those cases is through \neffective transfer pricing policy and enforcement, not by curtailing \ndeferrals.\n  Another issue that is going to be soon before us is the Democratic \nsubstitute of revenue raisers that are in our bill. I am flattered by \nthe tax relief side of Senator Conrad's substitute amendment since it \nincludes extension of the same widely applicable tax relief provisions \nin the underlying bill.\n  I should also be flattered, and I am, by some of the pay-fors in that \namendment--in particular, the provisions regarding the so-called SILO \ntransactions. It is a fact that we shut down the abusive tax shelters \nthat involve U.S. corporations claiming tax benefits on foreign subways \nand sewer systems in 2004. So these deals can no longer be done. The \nunderlying bill would repeal a generous grandfather provision for \ncertain domestic deals and would deny benefits for foreign deals \nentered into before the effective date of the JOBS Creation Act of \n2004.\n  We have introduced a fully offset tax relief bill in the past. Most \nrecently, that act of 2004 produced $82 billion of tax relief that was \ncompletely offset. The underlying bill, in fact, contains almost $20 \nbillion of offsets while providing $90 billion in broad-based tax \nrelief. We do not need any more offsets to pay for the lost AMT revenue \nthat we never intended to collect and for other provisions, such as the \nR credit, for example, that are broadly supported as good for the \neconomy.\n  We all know tax receipts are on the rise. In 2005, we had $274 \nbillion more coming in over the taxes that came in in 2004 under the \nsame tax policy, and we exceeded the CBO baseline by--can you believe \nit--$97 billion. It is a very vibrant economy which produces that kind \nof revenue. That amount, whether it is the $274 billion in 2005 over \n2004 or the $97 billion above the CBO baseline, that amount exceeds the \n$70 billion of reconciled tax relief over 5 years provided in the \nbudget resolution.\n  So I hope we will be able to take these points I have just made about \nthe inadequacies of the amendments we are going to be dealing with when \nwe vote on these amendments.\n  I would now, Mr. President, speak on the issue of an amendment I am \ngoing to place before the Senate this afternoon. In fact, I will submit \nthis amendment at this point.\n  I wish to take just a few minutes, in offering this amendment, to \nspeak about amendments that are also offered by Senator Bingaman and \nSenator Nelson regarding the Medicare prescription drug program. I \nthank the Senators for their amendments. I know their intentions are \ngood and their hearts are in the right place. But having said that, I \nam forced to oppose the amendments, and my reasons follow.\n  Opponents of the benefit are trying to make it look as if Republicans \nare indifferent to the problems of the implementing part of the \nMedicare program. Such is not the case because everyone has to be \nconcerned about the issues faced by some beneficiaries in getting their \nprescription drugs, even if that might be a very small percentage of \nthe people who are involved. Whoever needs these prescriptions, we have \nto do everything we can to get them to them.\n  Like everybody else, I am concerned about the drug benefit \nimplementation issues. It is not acceptable that some of the most \nvulnerable and frail seniors are experiencing problems. But my \nopposition to the amendments is rooted in the goal of not just taking \nsome action, but that we need to take the right action when we act. \nThere is no question that Congress meddling could just make things \nworse.\n  With that in mind, I want to share with you the following quote as to \nanother new program that was getting underway:\n\n       As the program gets under way the danger is that the \n     strains on it will generate pressures for unsound change. \n     They will come from those who will be disappointed because \n     they have been led to expect too much as well as from those \n     who see failure in every shortcoming. Changes will come in \n     time, but they should be made on the basis of the program's \n     own experience. This program must be given ample time to get \n     over its growing pains.\n\n  Now, that is not about the prescription drug bill that is just now \ngoing into effect. That is a quote from the July 1, 1966, edition of \nthe New York Times, and it is about the implementation of the original \nunderlying Medicare Program passed by Congress a year before this July \n1 edition of the New York Times.\n\n  Now, when I read that quote of 1966 just now, it said ``the program'' \ninstead of ``Medicare'' because I did not want to give it away. The \npoint of this editorial is that those words are extremely relevant \ntoday.\n  I am not trying to make excuses or minimize the difficulties some are \nhaving. Those problems need to be fixed, and fixed fast. By all \naccounts, everyone is working hard to get them resolved. But in my \nopinion--echoed by the New York Times nearly 40 years ago--rushing to \n``fix'' things through legislation could do more harm than good.\n  Just last week, the Finance Committee, in a bipartisan setting--with \nalmost every member of the Finance Committee there--had a meeting with \nSecretary Leavitt and CMS Administrator Mark McClellan. We had a candid \ndiscussion about the unfortunate glitches, and we heard about steps \ntaken by the agency to address them. We had a very constructive dialog. \nThat dialog covered a range of issues the Agency had identified and the \nadministration's actions already taken to address them.\n  It is clear to me legislation is not needed at this time. Secretary \nLeavitt has the authority. Current law allows him to have a smooth \ntransition. And administrative actions will work faster than if we pass \nthis legislation. That is because changes in law have to be followed by \nmore administrative actions. This is very much going to slow things \ndown. That is not what we want. We want, need, and will get quick \naction.\n  The issues that have surfaced do not lend themselves to legislative \nfixes. For example, we talked about problems in the data files. The \ndata files have not always identified the plan where a dual eligible is \nenrolled. Obviously, that is a problem. But can Congress write a law to \ndictate exactly how to fix computer system data files? That is not \nsomething I would want to do. There is an opportunity for getting \nsomething wrong, if I ever saw an opportunity for Congress to do \nsomething wrong.\n  But more importantly, these amendments are unnecessary. Senator \nBingaman's amendment gets at issues that have already been addressed \nadministratively. CMS has the authority to address these that way. And \nit will get fixed faster than if we pass additional legislation.\n  So I am going to offer a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. That \nresolution expresses our concerns about these problems, and it \nexpresses the Senate's support for the Agency's efforts to fix them.\n  For example, prescription drug plans must have a first-fill policy. \nThe first-fill policy already requires at least 30 days of coverage for \nthe first prescriptions filled, even if the drugs are not on the plan's \nformulary. And just yesterday, Secretary Leavitt announced that the \nfirst-fill policy is being extended further. It is now going to be in \nplace for 60 or 90 days as a first-fill policy. The Bingaman amendment \nrequires only a 30-day policy. So it is already out of date. The \nadministrative actions are much faster. Changes in law are not needed \nto address the issue.\n  Now, here is another one. The Bingaman amendment says that dual-\neligible beneficiaries, whom we call dual eligibles, should be \npresumptively eligible. But the dual eligibles are already \nautomatically eligible under the law, and they are automatically \nassigned to a plan. So again, no change in law is required.\n  Another example. The Bingaman amendment says it would require plans \nto reimburse enrollees for cost-sharing\n\n[[Page S483]]\n\nproblems. Here again, plans are already responsible for the costs to \ncover drugs. They are responsible for reimbursing beneficiaries for any \ncost-sharing charged in error. No change in law is required.\n  Let me give you another one. Some States have stepped up to fill \nclaims during the transition. The Bingaman amendment requires States to \nbe reimbursed for their costs. This is already happening. Last week, \nSecretary Leavitt announced that the Federal Government will reimburse \nStates for costs they have incurred during the transition period. We \nwere told that that day we met with Secretary Leavitt. I do not know \nexactly when Senator Bingaman was there, but he was there for that \nmeeting. Not every Senator stayed for every minute of the meeting, but \nSecretary Leavitt made this very clear. So again, legislation is not \nneeded because administrative action is being taken, with the legal \nauthority of the Secretary to do it. So no additional legislation is \nneeded.\n  Senator Nelson's amendment would extend the enrollment period through \nthe end of the year and permit beneficiaries to change once before the \nend of the year. We have discussed this amendment before. The Senate \nhas already voted twice, and we voted it down twice. And changing the \nenrollment period does nothing to address any of the issues experienced \nby beneficiaries just this last month.\n  We are well into the enrollment period. Enrollment is exceeding \nexpectations. Twenty-four million beneficiaries out of 44 million, \npotentially, have prescription drug coverage. Every day, nearly 90,000 \nbeneficiaries are enrolling in the program, and about 1 million \nprescriptions are being filled daily. So again, legislation is not \nneeded.\n  There are a number of resources for beneficiaries to help them choose \na plan. There is the Medicare call center. It is available 24 hours a \nday, and the Medicare Web site. Every State has counselors available to \nassist beneficiaries through the State Health Insurance Information \nProgram. That is the whole point of that program--the SHIIP program, it \nis called for short--to help beneficiaries understand their Medicare \nbenefits. The prescription drug plans based their proposals to serve \nMedicare beneficiaries on the enrollment period specified in the law.\n  In addition, there are already rules in place under which a \nbeneficiary can change their enrollment outside of the open enrollment \nperiod. A beneficiary can seek what is called a special election period \nif that is needed for that individual--for example, if a plan fails to \nprovide a beneficiary with information about the plan's benefits on a \ntimely basis, or if it fails to provide benefits in line with quality \nstandards, or if the plan, its agent, or plan provider materially \nmisrepresents the plan in marketing that plan. So in all of these \ninstances, there can be a special enrollment period or an opportunity \nto change.\n  So again, we do not need legislation. These are issues already \ncovered in the law today.\n  I want to make another point about what is going on with these \namendments. There was a time when opponents of this benefit were \nconcerned that there wouldn't be enough choice. Now their concern is \nthat there is too much choice. When we were in conference with the \nHouse on this 2 years ago, we were fearful there might not be a choice \nfor people. So we provided if there wasn't a choice, the Secretary set \nup a subsidized choice so that every individual could at least choose \nfrom two. We wanted people to have choice. We followed the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefit Plan where people have the choice of many \nplans to choose from, and they get to change once a year. We wanted to \nmake sure we didn't cram anything down any senior citizen's throat. If \nthey didn't want to participate, if they were satisfied with Medicare \nthe way it was, they didn't have to. But if they wanted to participate, \nthey elected.\n  You don't write one plan for 44 million seniors because everybody has \ndifferent benefits. And one-third of the people already had some \nprescription drug coverage. We didn't want to screw up their plans. So \nwe subsidized those plans so that those people who had something they \nwanted would be able to keep it. I don't know when you satisfy people. \nI didn't think there would be enough choice. Now we are hearing \ncomplaints about too many choices. There are 44 million Americans; \nthere are 44 million different personal needs of those people. We, \nsitting on the floor of the Senate, are not going to figure out what \nthose 44 million needs are and pass a one-size-fits-all plan that is \ngoing to satisfy the needs of everybody.\n  The point is, the opponents of this new benefit will complain and \nfight it no matter what happens. I hope everyone remembers that. I also \nfind it ironic that folks think that legislation is the answer. These \nare the same people who are concerned about confusion. Now they are \nproposing legislative changes in a bill that has only been in operation \nfor 1 month, on top of administrative actions that the agency has \nalready taken. They want to screw that up with legislation on the floor \nof the Senate with changes that will have no impact on any of the \nproblems encountered this last month, legislation that would have to be \nfollowed by yet more administrative action, a snowball rolling down the \nhill, just getting more complicated as it rolls on.\n  I ask whether this is going to help these perceived problems. Well, \nnot just perceived problems; I admitted there are problems out there. I \nadmitted when you put something like this into place, there are growing \npains, just like I quoted that New York Times article from 1966 about \nthe growing pains that we were going to have with Medicare when it was \nfirst put in place. Do you think these things are going to smooth the \ntransition? I don't think so. Talk about opportunity for confusion \namong beneficiaries, pharmacists, and plans. This is not going to \nreduce the confusion.\n  Passing legislation now runs the very real risk of undermining and \ncomplicating things. It can undermine the progress already made. It \nwill interrupt actions taken by the administration. It will create more \nproblems, not fewer problems. I, for one, have a steadfast commitment \nto gaining a full understanding of the problems and pursuing the most \nappropriate and timely course of action.\n  When the Secretary came before my committee and everybody turned out \nto make their complaints known, and the Secretary announced at that \ntime seven problems and he announced at that time seven solutions to \nthose problems and took full responsibility for them, I had a feeling \npeople left that meeting fairly satisfied that nobody was going to \nblame somebody else and they had a grasp of the problems and solving \nproblems, with some accountability that some changes had already taken \nplace for the better.\n  So then when you come out of an environment of a committee meeting \nlike that, you wonder what planet they have been on when these \namendments are being offered--amendments that, if they were passed, \nwould not get to the President for another 30 days--to solve problems \nthat were evident 30 days ago that the Secretary has already identified \nand taken action to overcome.\n  Senator Baucus and I are working together to get to the bottom of \nthis issue. That is how we do it in our committee. We do it in a \nbipartisan way so that we are going to also be able to work together if \nit turns out that legislation is needed. But I asked the Secretary at \nthat very committee meeting: Do you need any legislative changes to \ntake care of these problems that we have all identified, particularly \nthe seven that he identified? He said: No, he had ample legislative \nauthority to do it.\n  An important part of Senator Baucus's and my work in this regard is \ngoing to be brought up at next week's Finance Committee hearing, an \nopen hearing. We will hear from Dr. McClellan. We will hear from \nrepresentatives of the plans. We will hear from pharmacies. We are, \nmost importantly, going to hear from the people involved in educating \nand enrolling beneficiaries into the plan. More than once I have heard \nMembers take issue with attempts to bypass the committee process. The \namendments before us are just that.\n  Senator Bingaman's amendment has not gone through the Finance \nCommittee. It is clear that this amendment falls within the \njurisdiction of the Finance Committee, and the Senator from New Mexico \nis a member of that committee. I ask him to work within\n\n[[Page S484]]\n\nthe committee. If the Senate proceeds on legislation that the full \ncommittee has not considered, then nothing would prevent the Senate \nfrom legislating on other Finance Committee issues without the benefit \nof hearings or committee action.\n  Next week's hearing is very important. We need to gather more \ninformation about what is happening. This is needed to inform all of us \nof any necessary response. In the absence of such information \ngathering, it is dangerously premature to consider any amendments \nrelated to the prescription drug program. We all know that this whole \nissue of Medicare prescription drug coverage has long been a political \nissue. With the amendments offered today, I can't help but think that \nis very unfortunate. It is also unfortunate that is probably not going \nto change during the 109th Congress.\n  On the other hand, I hope that is not the case. But here we are, just \n1 month into the prescription drug program, already we see a lineup of \namendments to perhaps the most inappropriate vehicle there could ever \npossibly be to deal with Medicare. In other words, these amendments are \non a tax bill. But more importantly than just the process, these \namendments are unnecessary because of administrative actions taken to \ndate or to be taken tomorrow, if a new problem comes up.\n  When these amendments that I have discussed--the Bingaman and Nelson \namendments--come up for a vote, I hope my colleagues will trust what we \nlearned in the committee: that the Secretary of HHS doesn't need any \nnew legislative authority, consequently bringing any more uncertainty \ninto this process by voting for these amendments. Vote them down.\n  I said that I had an amendment I wanted to have considered when we \nvote this afternoon. I send the amendment to the desk and ask for it to \nbe printed.\n  I yield the floor. And since nobody else is desiring to speak, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I came to the floor this afternoon to \nspend a few minutes speaking in support of the Bingaman-Rockefeller-\nMurray Medicare drug REPAIR amendment that we will be seeing this \nafternoon. I came to the floor to urge my colleagues to support this \namendment so we can address the immediate crisis facing our most \nvulnerable citizens.\n  I wish we were here debating a real fix to the Medicare Modernization \nAct, but unfortunately the Senate leadership has placed a lot higher \npriority on tax cuts than on providing reliable access to prescription \ndrugs for low-income seniors and the disabled, so we are here today \ndebating that. I know the chairman of the Finance Committee was on the \nfloor earlier talking about the relevance of this amendment, the \nBingaman-Rockefeller-Murray Medicare drug REPAIR amendment, but this is \nthe first piece of legislation that we have had on the floor since the \nrollout of the Medicare prescription drug bill. Offering this amendment \non this tax bill is our only option.\n  What this amendment does is ensure that our low-income seniors and \nour disabled--who are often technically referred to as duals--are at \nleast ensured of a 30-day supply of lifesaving drugs, regardless of any \ncommunication or data exchange problem. It simply ensures that States \nand pharmacies and beneficiaries who have had to provide coverage to \nthose who have fallen through the cracks in this rolling out of the \nMedicare prescription drug bill receive just and fair reimbursement.\n  Finally, it will end the confusion facing any of our duals. And for \nany of my colleagues who have not been out in their States since \nJanuary 1, I will tell you there is tremendous confusion and conflict \nand people are falling through the cracks and we need to end that \nconfusion so they know whether, in fact, they qualify for assistance.\n  Because of the tremendous data and outreach problems, many of these \nso-called duals have been told they have to meet a $250 deductible \nbefore their plan is going to cover their prescription drugs. If they \nare eligible today for Medicare and Medicaid, they are assumed eligible \nat the drugstore.\n  I have listened to Secretary Leavitt and CMS Administrator McClellan \nreassure all of us that they are acting to fix these problems. I am \nhere today to applaud their attention and their commitment and their \nrecognition of the tremendous challenges out there, particularly for \nour duals, as this prescription drug rollout bill is occurring. I only \nwish they had listened last November when I offered an amendment to \nprovide a 6-month transition and predicted the dire straits that we are \nnow in before this was rolled out.\n  I will say they have been responsive since January 1. But all of the \nsteps that have been implemented are worthless if there is no education \nof our pharmacists and our seniors, or if there is no aggressive \noversight and enforcement. Saying that they are just going to work to \nensure the plans honor their commitment is not the same as saying plans \nwill be required by law to honor that commitment. It doesn't do a \nsenior any good to be told we are going to hold plans accountable, and \nthey still do not have any access.\n  There are a number of problems with this flawed structure, but I \nthink it is critical that we address the immediate crisis for those \npeople who have very few options. If anyone on this floor today thinks \nthis is fixed, or these problems are going to go away, I want them to \nknow they are sadly mistaken. I have traveled around my home State of \nWashington since August. I am not hearing that things are getting any \nbetter. I have people come to forums that I am holding where I try to \ngive them information, and every forum I have had, time after time, \nthere are new problems, new challenges: pharmacists are falling through \nthe cracks, doctors who don't know how to deal with their patients, \nlong-term care facilities that are at their wits' end, and certainly \nthe mental health advocates who are telling us we have people who could \nbe in serious crisis very soon if we don't address these problems.\n\n  There is a lot of frustration. There is a tremendous amount of panic \nfor these dual eligibles that they are being denied access to \nlifesaving drugs, and to low-income seniors, especially those in group \nhomes, who can't afford the added burden of copayments. It is wrong for \nus to sit here and say this is going to get worked out. I think it is \nour responsibility to stand up today, at our very first opportunity, \nand make sure we fix this Medicare prescription drug plan.\n  This week, my Governor, as many Governors who have been facing this \nat home on the ground, joined with me in urging the Federal Government \nto fix this mess. I want to quote her. She said:\n\n       All we are asking is don't make these people worse off than \n     they were.\n\n  Our Governor's office, as many Governors' offices, has been flooded \nwith calls about this prescription drug plan. She says some of these \npeople are telling her they would rather take their own life than deal \nwith the situation.\n  I have sat in forums in my State where people have said that to me, \nto my face, as well. These are people with mental health problems, they \nare elderly, they are having trouble working through the system. It is \ntoo much for them. They cannot deal with the copayments for the first \ntime--and that is not what our country should be about. It does not \nsound to me like things are getting better and the kinks are getting \nworked out.\n  Congress promised in 2005, they promised to people in this country \naccess to affordable prescription drug coverage. It is clear they are \nnot getting that today. We know these problems cannot be fixed through \nsome kind of administrative action alone. We here in Congress have an \nobligation to act and not follow CMS.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and send a message to \nthose who are living, literally, in fear today that Congress is not \ngoing to wait and we are going to do the right thing.\n  I do not agree that this is not the bill to deal with this issue. I \nwish we had another bill in front of us. I wish we had an actual fix in \nfront of us. But we cannot wait to work through the next several weeks \nand then the budget\n\n[[Page S485]]\n\nprocess and everything else coming down the pike to deal with this \nissue. We are talking about real individuals in real communities who \nare not getting access to their prescription drugs because of the \nchallenges that CMS is facing as this plan is rolled out, and we have \nan obligation to act.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Bingaman-Rockefeller-Murray drug \nREPAIR amendment and get a fix in place so people's lives are not in \ncrisis. We have an obligation to do this, and I urge my colleagues to \nvote for this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I rise for a moment to speak in favor of \namendment No. 2711, which is at the desk. It is my amendment regarding \nthe child tax credit offered by the majority leader. I will discuss \nbriefly that amendment.\n  I originally hoped I could offer an amendment making the child tax \ncredit permanent, which would help millions of workers and families \naround the country. I wanted to offer a straight-out extension. The \nSenate rules preclude that from being offered today. Instead, I will \nput the Senate on record that this Senator supports a permanent \nextension of the child tax credit.\n  In 2001, the Congress set in motion legislation which extended that \ncredit to $1,000 per child, but in 2011, unless Congress acts \nbeforehand, the clock will turn back and taxes will go up effectively \n50 percent on the workers and families who qualified for the child tax \ncredit. This additional money has made a big difference to families \naround the country and in Missouri. People like Beth Davis, who is a \nhairdresser in Kansas City, a single mother of three children, use this \nmoney to help pay for necessities for their children.\n  The most recent Treasury Department data shows that 543,000 married \ncouples and single parents in Missouri benefit from the child tax \ncredit enacted in 2001. I believe this child tax credit is supported \nvery strongly in the Senate. I expect the sense-of-the-Senate will be \napproved. I certainly hope it will so that, at the minimum, we can go \non record to support making this projob, progrowth, prochild tax credit \npermanent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we had a meeting and thought the votes would \nstart immediately, and Members were advised that.\n  It is my understanding, Senator Baucus, the voting will not start for \nat least a half hour. Everyone should understand the votes will not \nstart now but within the next half hour, 45 minutes probably.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is my understanding we could start early if Senators \nhave amendments. We do not have to wait a full half hour.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have half an hour remaining. If there are \nSenators who wish to speak on their amendments, they should get over \nhere immediately. If they do not come within a reasonable period of \ntime, I am confident Senator Baucus will yield back the time on this \nside, as he should. If there is no one here who desires to speak, we \ncan move to the votes more quickly. That is left up to Senator Baucus. \nIf Members want to talk, now is the time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will speak up to 5 minutes on an \namendment that is not in the first package of amendments we will vote \non, but since we will have no opportunity in the second and third \npackage of amendments, I will speak to it now.\n  I have an amendment that is fashioned to deal with the 9/11 \nCommission Report that came out less than 2 months ago, on December 5, \n2005. It was the so-called report card where this prestigious \nbipartisan Commission, led by former Republican Governor Tom Kean and \nformer Democratic Congressman Lee Hamilton, took a look at what we have \ndone based on what they recommended in the 9/11 Report. It tells how \nlittle we have learned and how little we have done to actually make the \nhomeland safer.\n  Most Americans, at least in my State, believe at least the most \nobvious steps have been taken to close the gaps in our homeland \ndefense. They believe, at the very least, we have a plan, that we have \nset priorities, and we know what the next step will be.\n  Let me quote from the Commission's report, which is only 6 or 7 weeks \nold, on what we have done to assess the risks and vulnerabilities of \nour critical infrastructure--transportation, communications, industrial \nassets. Here is what they say:\n\n       No risk and vulnerability assessments actually made; no \n     national priorities established; no recommendations have been \n     made on allocation of scarce resources. All key decisions [on \n     homeland security] are at least a year away.\n\n  We all remember September 11 when we discovered that local police, \nfire, and rescue units could not communicate with each other, could not \ncommunicate with Federal agencies. There was no way to coordinate the \naction, no way to share information. Things are no better today.\n  It gets worse. Airline passenger screening, the one place most \nAmericans think we have done pretty well, the 9/11 Commission gives \nthat effort a grade of ``F.''\n  Regarding airline baggage screening, to check for explosives, from \nthe report on December 5, 2005:\n\n       Improvements have not been made a priority by Congress or \n     the Administration.\n\n  This is unacceptable. This administration tries to fill in the most \nobvious gaps in our homeland defense, but they have not done it. We \nhave not done it. We simply have not done it.\n  This amendment is designed to fill in the most obvious gaps. It \nbegins with those areas where the Commission graded us and the \nPresident as ``F'' and ``D'' in the Commission Report. It addresses \nother issues such as the utter lack of a systematic program for rail \nsecurity, passenger freight, stations, tunnels, rail yards, bridges.\n  Every dime in this amendment is fully paid for by closing corporate \ntax loopholes. Frankly, this is a modest list. There is much more to be \ndone. We will need more resources to make us safer. Wiretapping, even \nif it is legal, is not the sole homeland defense. This amendment \nfocuses on the most glaring and dangerous shortcomings in our homeland \ndefense. By closing these loopholes, this amendment actually returns \n$23 billion to the Treasury to improve our fiscal security and reduce \nour dependence on borrowing from other countries.\n  I have been joined in this amendment--and I did not have time to \nnotify her because I did not know until 2 minutes ago--by Senator \nStabenow of the State of Michigan, who has worked tirelessly on dealing \nwith this issue.\n  It is pretty basic. We have done nothing much to deal with the \nproblems most Americans know relate to homeland security. We are safer \nbut not nearly safe enough.\n  The bipartisan commission that got great grades from everybody in the \nNation felt compelled on their own dime, with their own money, their \nown resources, not funded by the Government, to continue to issue \nreports and to hold hearings. And they issued a report on December 5 \nthat is, quite frankly, embarrassing and dangerous.\n  So our amendment is designed to fill some of the loopholes, not all \nof them, that, in fact, have been left by the President's failure to \nsecure our national interest, our homeland defense, as well as by our \nfailure as a Congress to step to the ball.\n\n[[Page S486]]\n\n  We can and we have to marshal all our country's resources in this \nstruggle. I will bet you $100, if you asked anybody in the public, from \ncorporate CEOs to the average American out there, Would you rather us \nspend this money on securing our ports, our nuclear plants, our \nrailroads, our cities, or would you rather us give it back in a tax \nbreak, I think it is just like the COPS bill years ago, given the \nchoice, the American people said let's make our streets safer. I am \nconfident they think we should make the country safer.\n  This amendment will be voted on not in this first tranche of \namendments but the second, but I am not going to get a chance to speak \nto it at the later date. There was a little opening in time, and I \nthank the staff for letting me know this time was available.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise, as we are waiting for the votes \nas well, to join with Senator Biden and to thank him for his continued \nleadership. We have come to this floor on numerous occasions to speak \nabout this issue over and over again, ever since 9/11, and we still do \nnot have this fixed.\n  So I am pleased to be joining with Senator Biden to offer this \namendment. It is time we act. It is past time. As Senator Biden said, \nit should be an embarrassment to all of us, the failing grades we \nreceived from the 9/11 Commission, a bipartisan commission, whose sole \nfocus is on giving us information about whether we are safe today and \nwhat it will take to keep us safe, what it will take in the future to \nmake sure Americans are safe.\n  We received, collectively--the administration, the Congress--failing \ngrades in area after area. One of my main focuses has been on whether \nthe radios work; it is stunning to me we are still talking about this. \nIt is very unfortunate that after 9/11--because we did not connect all \nof the radios to be able to work to communicate with each other--that \nwe saw the same kinds of failings that had firefighters and police \nofficers running into buildings in New York instead of running out, as \nthey should have been, because they did not know what was happening--\nthat the same kinds of things, then, happened in the gulf, in New \nOrleans.\n  I will never forget, going down right after the hurricanes with the \nbipartisan leadership, sitting outside of the New Orleans Convention \nCenter with someone from Michigan who was with the Army National Guard, \nsomeone from the Michigan Coast Guard, talking with these folks who had \nnot slept for several days, who were down doing their part, trying to \nsave lives, getting people off of rooftops, doing what was necessary.\n  I asked the gentleman from the Army National Guard: ``Do you have \nradios?'' ``Yeah.'' I asked the individual from the Coast Guard: ``Do \nyou have radios?'' ``Yeah, of course.'' Then I asked: ``Can you talk to \neach other?'' ``No.'' I asked: ``Well, how are you talking to each \nother?'' ``Well, when we're out in the boats, we use hand signals.'' \nThis was, at the time, 2005 in the United States of America, and they \nare using hand signals to tell whether they have found somebody, \nwhether they are OK, and so on, because the radios did not work.\n  When are we going to get this right? People expect us to get this \nright. They do not understand why this has not already happened. This \namendment basically puts our priorities in place by saying it does not \nmatter what your income level is, if there is another attack, you are \ngoing to want the radios to work. It does not matter where you live in \nAmerica. It does not matter if you are a CEO or if you are a person \ngoing in and punching a timeclock every day or if your kids are playing \nin a school yard. You expect that your Government is doing everything \nhumanly possible to keep you safe.\n  We have heard from the 9/11 Commission. They have overwhelmingly told \nus that is currently not true. So I hope and pray we take action, that \nwe would create the priorities that Americans are asking us to create, \nwhich is by starting with security, starting with security, making sure \nwe are putting that at the top of the list, that we are providing \npolice officers and firefighters with what they need in dealing with \nports and nuclear plants and chemical plants and all of the other \nissues, such as with Amtrak, making sure people are safe as they \ntravel, as well as airlines.\n  We can do that by setting the right priorities. And that is what this \namendment does. I urge my colleagues to join us in adopting this \namendment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I support the pending substitute \namendment. I encourage my colleagues to support it as well.\n  I almost need a flow chart to explain how we got here. But because of \nseveral events, there is now more room for tax cuts. Yes, you heard \nright: more tax cuts.\n  We should tread carefully, though, rather than dive in. We have an \nopportunity to show responsibility. And I think that this substitute \ndoes just that.\n  Let me first explain how we got here. As my colleagues will recall, \nthe tax reconciliation bill that we passed last November included much-\nneeded relief for the Gulf States affected by Hurricane Katrina. \nCongress passed and enacted those incentives separately in December.\n  Further, our tax bill allocation was limited by the fact that the \nspending reconciliation bill had not been enacted. The House is \nexpected to pass that bill today, clearing it for the President.\n  The bottom line is that this bill can accommodate $18 billion more in \ntax cuts.\n  We have an opportunity here to show some responsibility. And the \nresponsible thing to do is to pass another year of extenders. \nOtherwise, we will be right back here in a few months to pass those \nextenders. Or since it is an election year, we will be back during a \nlame duck session considering the same set of expiring provisions.\n  These are very popular, bipartisan tax cuts we extend year after \nyear. But we never have the resources in any given year to make them \npermanent.\n  This list of annual extenders includes several proven tax incentives. \nBusinesses are encouraged to do more U.S.-based research and create \nhigh-paying jobs. Long-term welfare recipients and others who are hard \nto employ are given job opportunities through an employer credit. And \nteachers who reach into their pockets to pay for classroom supplies can \nget a small deduction for their expenses.\n  These tax incentives were all part of the original Senate \nreconciliation bill. But in that bill, they were limited to one year. \nNow, Chairman Grassley and I are pleased to offer this amended version \ntoday to extend these provisions through the end of next year. We will \nthus provide certainty to businesses, workers, and teachers.\n  We know we will all vote to extend these provisions, if pressed at \nthe end of the year to do so. We should take this opportunity now to \nprovide these tax incentives through the end of 2007. It is the \nresponsible thing to do. Individual and business taxpayers will be \nthankful.\n  Mr. President, before us now are a series of amendments. I have a \nlist of 21 Democratic amendments. I have a list of eight Republican \namendments, with promises of more amendments on that side of the aisle, \ndepending upon the course we take today.\n  Pending a few moments ago, first was an amendment by the majority \nleader to permanently extend the child tax credit. That is a very \npopular amendment. I support--I think most of my colleagues do--\nextending the child tax credit. I daresay that most Senators on both \nsides of the aisle would probably strongly support extension of the \nchild tax credit. Senator Talent, the author, however, has expressed \nhis will to convert his amendment to a sense of the Senate. The \nmajority promises to offer the full version later.\n  Because of the Nation's record on budget deficits, I would prefer \nthat we paid for the pending amendment. But because of the procedural \nposture in which we find ourselves, we will not have that choice. So we \nwill be faced with an unattractive choice of voting for an appealing \ntax cut without paying for it or voting against an appealing tax cut.\n  After this amendment from the other side, we have been promised \nsimilar votes on measures to extend marriage penalty relief, estate tax \nrelief, Social Security tax relief, 10 percent tax bracket relief, and \nso on. At the end of\n\n[[Page S487]]\n\nthe day, this could become a fiscally very irresponsible exercise.\n  I wish to propose a different path. I propose that we address a \nlimited number of amendments--just six--and then go to third reading. I \npropose that these six amendments be Senator Talent's sense of the \nSenate on the child tax credit, Senator Bingaman's prescription drug \nbenefit, a Republican alternative to the prescription drug amendment, a \nmodified Schumer-Menendez-Grassley sense of the Senate on AMT relief, a \nmodified Rockefeller-Santorum mine safety amendment, and a paid-for \nsubstitute by Senator Conrad, and then go to third reading.\n  The Republican manager has conveyed to me that he would find this \nprocedure acceptable. This procedure would require, obviously, many \nSenators to forgo their opportunity to offer amendments. That is clear. \nIt would have that consequence. But this procedure would also do the \nmost to maintain fiscal responsibility. This procedure would also allow \nSenators to get back to their States and their constituents in much \nshorter order.\n  I implore my colleagues, let us choose the path of reason. Let us \nchoose the path of moderation. Let us end this bill this afternoon.\n  I have given deep thought to this issue. I know there are many on \nboth sides of the aisle who have conflicting emotions and views on this \nbasic prospect we find ourselves facing. It is my considered judgment \nthat the path I am outlining is probably the best course for the Senate \nand, more importantly, the best course for the Nation. After all, we \nare here representing our constituents. We should go the extra mile to \ndo whatever we possibly can to represent the people back in our home \nStates as well as we possibly can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ISAKSON). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we are here at a moment that people have \nto think very soberly about what the possible consequences of our \nactions might be. The Senator from Montana has outlined one possible \nscenario. Far be it for me to judge which amendments would be in order \nand which would not. Let me just say what consequences could flow from \na failure to reach agreement.\n  I have just had a consultation with the Parliamentarian. He informs \nme that if we were to waive on any one of the amendments that have been \ntalked about on the other side, if we were to waive all budget points \nof order through conference committee, that would open up to the \nconference committee the opportunity to come back with legislation that \nwould cost far in excess of the $70 billion limit we currently face as \na result of the budget resolution.\n  I know this is complicated, but I urge my colleagues to think very \ncarefully about the potential consequences. Let me give four.\n  If all points of order were waived through conference committee on \nthe child credit, that could open up the conference committee to $185 \nbillion of additional tax cuts, not offset. If the estate and gift tax \nchanges that have been proposed by some were adopted and all points of \norder waived through the conference committee, that could add $358 \nbillion that the conference committee could come back with with no \npoints of order prevailing or possible.\n  On the expanded 10 percent bracket, that would open up an additional \n$262 billion for the conference committee to come back to this Chamber \nwith no points of order pending. An income tax raise of 25, 28, 33, and \n35 percent, if all points of order were waived through the conference \ncommittee, we could come back here and open up this Chamber to an \nadditional $385 billion of tax reduction with no point of order \npending.\n  I do not pretend to know what the package is that could be agreed on \nto resolve this. I do know that the Senator from Montana has made an \nimpassioned plea to our colleagues to think twice before we get into \nthis destruction derby. Believe me, the potential is, at the end of the \nday, we would find ourselves in the circumstance very easily in which \nyou could have a trillion dollars of additional tax cuts pending on the \nfloor of the Senate, with no point of order available.\n  I notice the leader is in the Chamber. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think what we have here is a case being \nmade for how bad this reconciliation plan is that we have. We have a \nnumber of amendments that Senators in good faith have tried to offer. \nThere will be votes on these amendments. Ours doesn't break the bank, \nas indicated by the Senator from North Dakota. All the amendments he is \ntalking about that are going to cost all this money come from the other \nside. With rare exception, our amendments are offset. We don't expect \nto ask to waive points of order through conference on our amendments. \nThat is why Members should not vote to waive through conference.\n  Also, I hope the country is watching what is going on here today. \nFirst of all, as I said earlier today, we are working on something that \nhas been named by the majority the ``Deficit Reduction Act of 2005.'' \nUsing the numbers given us by the majority, it increases the deficit by \n$50 billion. Today, as I was walking to lunch, a reporter says: Are you \naware that we are going to get a supplemental next week for $90 \nbillion? The budget gimmicks of this administration are unbelievable. \nEveryone knows the cost of the war is ongoing. We are in our fourth \nyear of war. The President doesn't include it in his budget because it \nwould show the American people how deeply in the red we are. Rather \nthan do that, he comes back later with all these supplementals. But I \nunderstand, having managed a few bills in my day, how the distinguished \nSenator from Montana and I will feel about it.\n  We want to get the bill out of here and move on to other things with \nas little damage as possible. But, Mr. President, damage has been done \nby having this reconciliation bill in the manner that we got it in the \nfirst place. Having been given this bill, we are $50 billion in the \nhole to begin with, using the numbers of the majority.\n  Now, people in good faith on our side offered amendments, or soon \nwill offer them. Some have been debated. Our amendments take, for \nexample, the amendment of the Senator from New York. She wants to have \nthis Senate on record as to whether the Senate will stand for an \nindependent bipartisan commission to study what went wrong with \nKatrina. We have been stymied every step of the way to do that. Rather \nthan have a 9/11-type commission to find out what went wrong in the \nmost significant natural disaster in the history of this country, we \nare being stonewalled. That is an amendment the majority doesn't want \nto vote on.\n  I wish there were an easy way out of this, but there is not. I say to \nmy friends who are offering this amendment on the child tax credit, if \nit is offered, a lot of Senators over here on this side are going to \nvote for it. Someday maybe this administration will recognize what they \nhave done to this country economically. We are going to be asked in a \nfew days to increase the debt ceiling from $8.2 trillion to whatever \nthe majority wants--$8.2 trillion is not enough. So my suggestion is, \nlet's just start voting.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the motion to commit be \nwithdrawn. I further ask consent that amendment No. 2709 be withdrawn \nand further that the yeas and nays be vitiated on amendment No. 2708; \nfurther, that the amendment be agreed to; provided further that the \nonly remaining amendments in order be the following, and further, when \na motion to waive occurs, it be in order for each leader to offer up to \ntwo amendments to each motion to waive.\n  The amendments are:\n  Talent, child tax credit; Nelson, prescription drugs; Republican \nalternative to Nelson, relevant; Byrd-Rockefeller-Santorum, mine \nsafety; Conrad, substitute; Dodd, veterans health; Republican \nalternative to Dodd, relevant; Reed, America's military; Republican\n\n[[Page S488]]\n\nalternative to Reed, relevant; Clinton, Katrina commission; Republican \nalternative to Clinton, relevant; Menendez, AMT; Grassley, AMT; Reid, \nrelevant to any amendment on the list; Frist, relevant to any amendment \non the list.\n  I further ask consent that at the conclusion of this unanimous \nconsent, all time be yielded back and the Senate proceed to votes in \nrelation to the following amendments; that all votes in the sequence be \nlimited to 10 minutes each; that following the reporting of each \namendment, the amendment be considered as read and there be 2 minutes \nequally divided prior to the vote in relation to the amendment; \nfinally, that following disposition of amendments, the substitute be \nagreed to, the bill be read the third time, and the Senate proceed to a \nvote on passage of the bill, with no intervening action or debate. The \namendments will be considered in the order sent to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2727\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Talent, I would like \nto call up his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Frist], for Mr. Talent, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2727.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the permanent \n    extension of the amendments to the child tax credit made by the \nEconomic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs \n           and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___.

Mr. President, I believe we have 1 minute each. I yield 1 \nminute to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I simply want to thank the chairman \nof the Finance Committee, and I thank the ranking member for working \nthis out and having everybody in it together. I welcome working with \nSenator Santorum. It is a good thing to do. It is dark days in \nAppalachia now, and this will help a lot. Thank you.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. Presient, on behalf of Senator Santorum, we yield back \nthe remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2728) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the next amendment on the list is to be \noffered by the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad. He should be here \nat any moment now. Until he is here, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, is this an appropriate time to offer my \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2729 to Amendment No. 2707\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I send my amendment to the desk, and I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad], for himself and \n     Mr. Bingaman, proposes an amendment numbered 2729 to \n     amendment 2707.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the chairman and ranking member have done \nan excellent job in putting together this package that is in the \ninterest of the American people. I have all of the same tax relief \nprovisions that are in their package. The only difference is that I \nhave paid for it over the 10 years. I have done it by adopting the same \noffsets as in the managers' package: closing the tax gap by shutting \ndown abusive tax shelters and other reforms, raising some $34 billion, \nincluding revoking tax benefits for leasing foreign subway and sewer \nsystems; second, ending a loophole for big oil that lets them avoid \ntaxes on foreign operations, raising $9 billion; requiring tax \nwithholding on Government payments to contractors such as Halliburton, \nraising $7 billion; renewing the Superfund tax so that polluting \ncompanies pay for cleaning up toxic waste sites, raising $17 billion; \nand closing additional loopholes, raising $22 billion.\n  This is the package that has all of the tax relief in the managers' \npackage. It just has additional pay-fors, so we cover the costs. We \nhave exploding deficits, exploding debt. Let's pay for these tax cuts \nwe are offering.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I disagree with the proposal in two \nimportant parts.\n  First, the proposal does not extend to 2009 several provisions that \nare very important to both sides, bipartisan--specifically, the section \n179 expensing, which encourages the growth of small business in our \ncountry, and the college tuition deduction, which will give parents \nmore certainty in the planning of their children's education, and the \nlow-income savers' credit, which assists families who make less than \n$50,000 in saving for their retirement.\n  The second point I have----\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, would the Senator yield on this point?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I only have 1 minute.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Can I grant you some additional time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We don't have that time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds on \nthis point, if I could.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Then I will take 30 seconds, too.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is more than fair.\n  I say to my colleague that the statement he made is just not true. I \nhave precisely the same tax relief in my package as in yours. Every one \nof the items the chairman just mentioned is in my package for exactly \nthe same period of time as is in yours.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. All I can say in my 30 seconds on my point is that the \nSenator may be entirely correct, but that is one of the things that \nhappens when we have 2 days of debate and these amendments are not put \nbefore the Senate to study until the last minute.\n  The second concern I have about the proposal is the inclusion of \noffsets which we have not had an opportunity to fully consider or with \nrespect to which we have some policy concerns. An example of that is \nthe revival of the environmental excise tax offered, referred to as the \n``Superfund tax.'' As you might expect, I believe the bill passed by a \nbipartisan majority with 64 votes in the Senate in November, which we \nare not going through again, represents a more balanced bill, one that \nprovides longer-term benefits, including increased certainty and \nreduced complexity for planning.\n  In addition, I raise a point of order that the budget does not meet \nreconciliation instructions to the Senate. It is an issue of \ngermaneness, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act, I move to waive the applicable sections of \nthe act for the purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.

Mr. President, the amendment expresses the sense of the \nSenate about the concerns regarding the problems encountered in \nimplementing the new drug benefit. It expresses the Senate's support \nfor the administration's efforts to fix them. These efforts have proven \nto be much speedier in getting the problems fixed, and fixed fast, than \nany legislation can do. To that point, one amendment offered yesterday \nhas provisions that are completely unnecessary because administrative \nactions have already taken care of it. I see no point in legislating \nfor the sake of legislating.\n\n  Moreover, legislative action on top of administration action will \nundermine and complicate progress to date.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this sense-of-the-Senate amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa will please send the \namendment to the desk.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2731 to Amendment No. 2707\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2731 to amendment No. 2707.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the Medicare \n                   part D prescription drug program)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE MEDICARE PART D \n                   PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) It is not acceptable that startup issues under the new \n     Medicare prescription drug program have resulted in some of \n     our Nation's most vulnerable citizens having difficulties \n     getting their prescription drugs covered under the program, \n     and these issues must be addressed and resolved.\n       (2) The Department of Health and Human Services and the \n     Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services are working \n     tirelessly to address these startup issues and have taken \n     numerous steps to smooth the transition process.\n       (3) All prescription drug plans under part D of title XVIII \n     of the Social Security Act and MA-PD plans under part C of \n     such title (in this section referred to as ``Medicare \n     prescription drug plans'') already have a ``first fill'' \n     policy in place that provides a new enrollee with coverage \n     for prescription drugs during at least the first 30 days of \n     enrollment regardless of whether the particular prescription \n     drug is on the plan's formulary, and the Centers for Medicare \n     & Medicaid Services is enforcing this requirement.\n       (4) Under current law, full-benefit dual eligible \n     individuals (as defined in section 1935(c)(6) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395u-5(c)(6)) are already \n     automatically enrolled into Medicare prescription drug \n     coverage so no change in law is necessary.\n       (5) Medicare prescription drug plans are already \n     responsible for covering the cost of covered prescriptions \n     filled for enrollees, including short term transition \n     prescriptions.\n       (6) Medicare prescription drug plans are already \n     responsible for reimbursing any enrollee, including full-\n     benefit dual eligible individuals, for any out-of-pocket \n     costs incurred by the enrollee that should have been covered \n     by the plan.\n       (7) The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is already \n     reimbursing States for the reasonable administrative costs \n     incurred by States that have temporarily covered some claims \n     for prescription drug coverage during the transition period.\n       (8) Enrollment is exceeding projections, with at least \n     24,000,000 Medicare beneficiaries who now have drug coverage \n     and another 90,000 are enrolling each day in the Medicare \n     prescription drug program;\n       (9) In addition, the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     has taken many other actions to smooth the implementation of \n     the Medicare prescription drug program, including the \n     following:\n       (A) Establishing processes to ensure that full-benefit dual \n     eligible individuals are not overcharged for their \n     prescriptions and to require Medicare prescription drug plans \n     to refund overcharges to such individuals.\n       (B) Establishing a reconciliation process to ensure that \n     Medicare prescription drug plans reimburse pharmacies for \n     costs incurred by pharmacies that are payable by such plans.\n       (C) Conducting extensive and continuing outreach to \n     pharmacies and pharmacy associations on the implementation of \n     the Medicare prescription drug benefit, particularly with \n     respect to full-benefit dual eligible individuals, as well as \n     establishing a special pharmacy telephone help line.\n       (D) Requiring Medicare prescription drug plans to have \n     comprehensive formularies and procedures for enrollees to \n     rapidly secure an exception to the limitation of coverage of \n     a prescription drug when medical necessity is demonstrated.\n       (E) Permitting full-benefit dual eligible individuals to \n     switch Medicare prescription drug plan under the Medicare \n     prescription drug benefit at any time, for any reason, and \n     improving data flows and communication with plans to ensure \n     that plan switches by such individuals become fully effective \n     as quickly as possible.\n       (F) Partnering with national, State, and local groups that \n     work with full-benefit dual eligible individuals to educate \n     such individuals about the Medicare prescription drug \n     program, and assisting in their transition to, and enrollment \n     under, such program.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Secretary of Health and Human Services is making \n     significant progress in smoothing the implementation of the \n     new Medicare prescription drug program, legislation changing \n     the program is not needed at this time, and legislation at \n     this time would also likely complicate implementation of the \n     program and confuse beneficiaries;\n       (2) each of the implementation problems identified under \n     the Medicare prescription drug program will be resolved more \n     quickly through administrative actions, which the\n\n[[Page S491]]\n\n     Secretary of Health and Human Services already has the \n     authority to take under current law, rather than through \n     Congressional action followed by administrative action;\n       (3) the Senate fully supports the efforts of the Secretary \n     of Health and Human Services, Medicare prescription drug \n     plans, pharmacists, and others to implement the Medicare \n     prescription drug program and to resolve problems that have \n     occurred during the implementation of the program; and\n       (4) the pace of enrollment in the Medicare prescription \n     drug benefit indicates that extending the six-month \n     enrollment period is not warranted at this time, and, by \n     contrast, such an action could exacerbate implementation \n     issues under the program.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute allocated to my side to \nthe Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, Senators had better look at \nthis sense-of-the-Senate amendment because it indicates that \n``extending the 6-month enrollment period is not warranted.''\n  That is a direct quote. You know what you have been hearing from your \nsenior citizens and how confused they are. This sense of the Senate \nsays it shouldn't be extended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from North Carolina (Mr. Burr), the Senator from New Mexico \n(Mr. Domenici), and the Senator from Wyoming (Mr. Thomas).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. \nBingaman) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2730.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Nelson], for himself and Mr. \n     Bingaman, proposes an amendment numbered 2730.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. On the vote Members just rejected, the thought \nwas that extending the 6-month enrollment period was not warranted \nbecause, in fact, you have been hearing from your senior citizens. So \nwe will give you an opportunity now.\n  This amendment expands the 6-month enrollment period for the entire \nyear of 2006 and allows beneficiaries, one time, to change plans in \nthat year when they make a mistake. We are also going to make all those \nfolks, those seniors who are out of pocket, the pharmacies that are out \nof pocket, the States that are out of pocket because of the Federal \nbungling, we will reimburse them in the implementation where individual \nsenior citizens have had to eat the cost when they find their drugs \nthat are essential to their health, that they cannot get them because \nthey are not eligible under the new plan under Medicare.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I object to this amendment. Remember, \nall but two of our members of the Committee on Finance, Republican and \nDemocrat, joined with Secretary Leavitt to go over the problems 2 weeks \nago that this program is having. Secretary Leavitt took responsibility \nfor those problems. He laid out seven problems. He laid out seven \nsolutions to those problems that he has already inputted.\n  I asked him if he needed additional legislative authority to solve \nthese problems. He did not need any additional legislative authority. \nHe had plenty. We are going to pass legislation now that not only will \ntake a while to get passed, but we will also have a period of time \nafterwards of having regulations to administer that legislation.\n  The problem goes on and on. The problem is being solved by the \nSecretary right now. Let's not screw up what the Secretary is trying to \ndo, something that is working very well. There are problems, yes, but \nthose problems are identified, and they can work.\n  I raise a point of germaneness on this amendment. I raise a point of \norder under section 310 of the Budget Act, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Pursuant to 904 of the Congressional Budget \nAct, I move to waive the applicable sections of that act for \nconsideration of this amendment.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, this amendment would establish a Katrina \ncommission modeled after the 9/11 Commission, made up of experts on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  We are seeing the administration withholding documents, testimony, \nand information from the ongoing investigations by the House and \nSenate.\n  I commend our colleagues, Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman, for \ntheir efforts to obtain the information that is needed. But we must \nestablish this commission to get at what the truth is about what \nactually happened in order to take steps that will fix the problems so \nthey do not happen anywhere else in our country.\n  A vote against this commission is a vote for continued stonewalling, \nsweeping problems under the rug, and ignoring the problems that we know \nexist today.

Mr. President, the problem with the Dodd amendment is \nthat it doesn't even do what the author says it does. He says it is \npaid for by using capital gains, but capital gains offsets don't even \ncome into play until the year 2009. The author is leading us to believe \nthat the military assistance is coming now. But it is not, if it is \ntied to an offset that won't come due until 2009. Our alternative now \nbefore the Senate will do the same thing as the Dodd amendment, but we \ndon't tie it up with an offset that is way down the road 3 years. That \nis not truth in budgeting. I urge support for my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield the 1 minute allocated to our side \nto the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, with all due respect to my good friend from \nIowa, for the Dodd amendment, the offsets begin next year, 2007, on the \ncapital gains and dividends tax breaks. The Grassley amendment I will \nsupport. I hope the Senator from Iowa will support my amendment. The \ndistinction between the two amendments is whether you pay for it. I am \ngrateful that the Senator from Iowa has taken my language on veterans \nresources going to veterans hospitals, things such as the Intrepid \nFallen Heroes Fund facility at Fort Sam Houston in Texas, and others, \nso that we can provide for the 103,000 veterans who come out of Iraq \nand Afghanistan, where there is a shortfall today. If you take my \namendment, we actually pay for it by asking one-fifth of 1 percent of \nthose people who in the year 2007 and 2008 would be beneficiaries as a \nresult of capital gains and dividends tax reductions; 99.8 percent of \nall the beneficiaries under the capital gains and dividends tax \nreductions would not be touched by the Dodd amendment.\n  This is a simple distinction here. If you think we ought to do \nsomething on behalf of our veterans, then we ought to have the courage \nto pay for it. You have to make choices. A modest reduction in the \ncapital gains and dividends tax reduction for 2 years, coming from less \nthan one-fifth of 1 percent of the population making over $1 million a \nyear is very little to ask for.\n  I ask for the adoption of the Grassley amendment. I also urge you to \nadopt our amendment. I don't want to see this amendment drop before it \ngets to the Ohio clock, and I know that is what is going to happen if \nwe don't pay for the amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I raise a budget point of order on my \namendment, and I also move to waive all provisions of the Budget Act \nand budget resolution necessary for the consideration of the pending \namendment to this bill and for the inclusion of the language of the \npending amendment in the consideration of amendments between the House \nand conference report on the bill.\n  Mr. DODD.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this just makes clear that we would not be \ndoing something tonight the Senate has never done before: allow direct \nspending on a bill such as this without the chance of it being \nconsidered in conference and coming back here without any points of \norder prevailing.\n  I apologize to colleagues for taking this time, but we cannot be \nengaging in a process never before done in the Senate to spend tens of \nbillions of dollars without the ability to review it when it comes back \nfrom conference. I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2732.\n  The amendment (No. 2732) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of a number \nof colleagues: Senators Kennedy, Kerry, Lautenberg, Boxer, Mikulski, \nAkaka, and Reed.\n  First, I thank the American Legion. I ask unanimous consent that a \nletter from the American Legion endorsing the Dodd amendment be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          The American Legion,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 2, 2006.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Gentlemen: On behalf of the 2.8 million members of The \n     American Legion, I would like to offer our support of the \n     proposed amendment to the Tax Relief Extension Reconciliation \n     Act of 2005 that would provide for the unbudgeted costs of \n     health care for veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan.\n       The amounts offered by this amendment would be in addition \n     to any other amounts provided for medical care under other \n     statutory provisions and would help to avoid funding \n     shortfalls, such as what took place last year, or other \n     problems that arise due to the discretionary funding model \n     currently in place for VA health care. This amendment would \n     also establish a ``Veterans Hospital Improvement Fund'' to \n     provide for improvements in health care facilities treating \n     veterans, including military medical treatment facilities, VA \n     facilities and other facilities (state, local and private) \n     that provide medical care and services to veterans.\n       Again, we appreciate your efforts on behalf of our nation's \n     veterans. Your amendment acknowledges the need for adequate \n     funding to ensure our nation's veterans receive the \n     healthcare and other benefits to which they are entitled.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Steven Robertson,\n                        Director, National Legislative Commission.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the distinction between this amendment and \nwhat we just voted on is, of course, paying for this. This amendment \nwould provide at least around $18 billion, $19 billion in needed funds \nto serve returning veterans from theater of conflict.\n  We know last year that over 100,000 Iraqi veterans returned home. Yet \nthe administration's fiscal year 2006 budget for the VA was only \nprepared to handle 23,000 veterans. There are shortfalls in every State \nacross the country. There are shortfalls in private facilities as well \nas public ones. This amendment is for us finally to say let's do \nsomething for these people.\n  Last year, we were promised it would be accommodated in the \nappropriations process. It had to be done as almost an afterthought. I \ndon't like offering this amendment on this bill. I understand the \nproblems associated with it. But if we don't finally do something, \nthese veterans will lose the support they deserve. That is why the \nAmerican Legion is so strongly supporting this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in seeing to it we have the resources \nto pay for this. If we don't pay for it, this amendment will not make \nit past the Ohio Clock. It will be dropped, and, once again, veterans \nwill suffer. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today with my friends, Senators \nKennedy and Dodd, to offer an amendment to address the costs of \nproviding health care and improved benefits to troops serving in Iraq \nand Afghanistan.\n  This amendment we offer today allows VA to provide care for returning \ntroops--without displacing those veterans currently using the system. \nLet us never forget the budget disaster last year. Early in the year, \nwe knew VA was not making ends meet. The administration, however, took \nmonths to come to that realization. And just last week, the President \nsigned a declaration of emergency funding for $1.2 billion for fiscal \nyear 2006.\n  We cannot repeat last year's budget scenario. This amendment provides \nmore cushion for this fiscal year and future years.\n  Early warnings are that this will not be enough to cover expected \nshortfalls for this fiscal year. And VA will surely not have enough \nfunding to open the system up to all veterans. In 2003, this \nadministration closed the doors to all middle-income veterans who had \nnot enrolled prior to that time. To date, more than 250,000 veterans \nwho have tried to enroll for VA health care have been rejected. In \nHawaii alone, 710 veterans were turned away at the door. We have no \nidea how many middle-income veterans never even try to enroll.\n  This amendment also sends a message that the Senate wishes to ensure \nthat our veterans are appropriately compensated. For many of our \nseverely injured veterans, disability compensation is their only \nincome--the only way for them to provide for their families. This \namendment ensures that our wounded warriors receive the compensation \nthey have earned.\n  This amendment establishes a fund for infrastructure improvements. \nVA's infrastructure has suffered greatly over the past 5 years. Major \nconstruction projects were held up for some time while we waited for \nVA's own construction study. And while that process still awaits \nconclusion, VA has been trying to catch up with the projects that have \nbeen stuck in the queue for years. At the same time, the Department has \nfaced consistent funding shortfalls that have paralyzed its ability to \ncarry out these projects. Its no secret that when the health care \naccount is strained, funds are then diverted from ``nonessential'' \nareas--such as maintenance and construction--to be spent on direct \nhealth care costs.\n  Meanwhile, smaller scale projects are put in jeopardy. In my home \nState of Hawaii, we have a need for $6.9 million to build a new VA \nmental health facility in Honolulu.\n  The costs of the war we are fighting today will continue to add up \nlong after the final shot is fired, mainly in the form of veterans \nhealth care and benefits.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in this effort to see that they are \nprovided the care they are currently earning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n[[Page S495]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first, since we adopted the previous \namendment, we obviously don't need this amendment.

Just not to confuse anybody, we are kind of going \nthrough the same thing we did on the previous two amendments, so be \nalerted.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senate will please \ncome to order.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2736\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I call up amendment No. 2736.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley], proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2736.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To strengthen America's military and for other purposes)\n\n               TITLE IV--STRENGTHENING AMERICA'S MILITARY\n\n     SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Strengthening America's \n     Military Act''.\n\n                      Subtitle A--Military Funding\n\n     SEC. 402. FUNDING FOR MILITARY OPERATIONS.\n\n       There is appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury \n     which is not otherwise appropriated, for the fiscal years \n     2006 through 2010, the following amounts, to be used for \n     resetting and recapitalizing equipment being used in theaters \n     of operations:\n       (1) $16,900,000,000 for operations and maintenance of the \n     Army.\n       (2) $1,800,000,000 for aircraft for the Army.\n       (3) $6,300,000,000 for other Army procurement.\n       (4) $10,000,000,000 for wheeled and tracked combat vehicles \n     for the Army.\n       (5) $467,000,000 for the Army working capital fund.\n       (6) $6,000,000 for missiles for the Department of Defense.\n       (7) $100,000,000 for defense wide procurement for the \n     Department of Defense.\n       (8) $4,500,000,000 for Marine Corps procurement.\n       (9) $4,500,000,000 for operations and maintenance of the \n     Marine Corps.\n       (10) $2,700,000,000 for Navy aircraft procurement.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The same arguments that I made on the previous \namendments apply here as well. My amendment will do the same as the \nReed amendment but doesn't raise taxes to pay for it, so it will \nprovide more equipment for our troops without increasing taxes. I urge \nsupport of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the amendment proposed by the Senator from \nIowa is my amendment. It would meet the supreme need of the military to \nreset, recapitalize, and rehabilitate $43 billion or more of equipment. \nThe one big difference is that my amendment will pay for it. It will \ntake the responsible step of actually paying to help our military. What \nI will use is dividend offsets. I will offer that later. But we have \nthe responsibility to be responsible, not only give the troops what \nthey need but pay for it so we do not increase the deficit. I hope we \nrespond by supporting my amendment which takes care of the troops but \ndoes so in a responsible way by providing the resources to pay for this \nnecessary equipment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, again I raise a budget point of order. I \nask unanimous consent it be exactly the same as the previous one on the \nlast two bills. I ask unanimous consent to waive all provisions of the \nBudget Act and budget resolutions necessary for the consideration of \nthe pending amendment to this bill and for the inclusion of the \nlanguage of the pending amendment in the consideration of one amendment \nbetween the Houses--an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2736) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2737\n\n(Purpose: To strengthen America's military, to repeal the extension of \n tax rates for capital gains and dividends, to reduce the deficit, and \n                          for other purposes)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island and the \nProvidence Plantation.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed], for himself, Ms. \n     Stabenow, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Kerry, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2737.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \namendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, our Army and Marines face a critical \nproblem: $47 billion worth of equipment which they have used in Iraq \nand Afghanistan needs to be repaired and reconditioned. They call it \nreset recapitalization. We have to do this. This equipment is not new \nequipment, it is not transformational, it is the equipment they need. I \ncommanded a paratrooper company in the 82nd Airborne Division. I can \ntell you the worst thing for morale is to have soldiers with poor and \ninadequate equipment. We owe it to them.\n  My amendment would be the responsible way to do it, pay for it, by \ntaking capital gains cuts that are proposed, dividend cuts and others \nthat are proposed, and other loopholes. It is essentially very simple. \nAre we going to give a dividend to the wealthiest citizens or are we \ngoing to give a dividend to our troops, our soldiers, and marines? And \nthat dividend is equipment that will work, not only today but in the \nfuture.\n  This is particularly important for the National Guard. Every one of \nyour National Guard units has equipment they have left overseas or has \nbeen run into the ground. If we do not act responsibly--not just act \nbut act responsibly, then we will not be able to assure our soldiers \nand marines that the equipment they have is the best equipment, that it \nworks, and it will be reconditioned and refit and work in the future.\n\n[[Page S496]]\n\n  I urge passage of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Again, I raise a budget point of order on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I move to waive all provisions of the Budget Act and budget \nresolutions necessary for the consideration of the pending amendment to \nthis bill and for the inclusion of the language of the pending \namendment in the consideration of an amendment between the Houses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak to this \nissue for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REED. Reserving my right to object, if the Senator has 2 minutes, \ncan I have an additional 2 minutes?\n  Mr. GREGG. I just want to explain the parliamentary situation for the \nrecord.\n  Mr. President, these last two amendments are totally outside the \ntraditional process of reconciliation. But the practical effects of the \nmotion to waive, which the Senator from Iowa has made on his \namendments, is that neither amendment can survive conference. I think \nit is important to understand that reconciliation cannot include \nspending under this bill, and that we would be doing fundamental damage \nto the process were either of these amendments to survive conference. \nAnd, therefore, I support the motion on this point of order and hope we \nproceed the same way we have with the other points of order.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senator from Rhode Island and the Providence Plantation \nis accorded the floor.\n  Mr. REED. I have great respect for the procedures and rules of the \nSenate, but we have come too many times to issues--I can recall back \nwhen we were talking about armored humvees when the objection was made \nthis is not the right legislative vehicle to do this. I think we have \nan obligation to our soldiers and marines to help them now and pay for \nit now. This might be the only occasion we can do both.\n  I urge passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request to waive the \nBudget Act?\n  Mr. REED. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

It is my understanding that the Menendez \namendment has been changed to a sense of the Senate, so that means the \namendment I was going to offer on AMT will not be offered. \nConsequently, I am hoping we can get this amendment agreed to on a \nvoice vote.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Menendez told Members he wants a \nrollcall vote.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2705\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I call up amendment numbered 2705.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Menendez], for himself, \n     Mr. Schumer, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n     Lautenberg, and Ms. Stabenow, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2705.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that protecting middle-\n  class families from the alternative minimum tax should be a higher \n priority for Congress in 2006 than extending a tax cut that does not \n                     expire until the end of 2008)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING PROTECTING MIDDLE-\n                   CLASS FAMILIES FROM THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM \n                   TAX.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the alternative minimum tax was originally enacted in \n     1969 as a supplemental tax on wealthy tax evaders, but has \n     evolved into a tax on millions of middle-class working \n     families, particularly families in which both parents work, \n     and families with 2 or more children;\n       (2) by the end of the decade, the alternative minimum tax \n     will ensnare more than 30,000,000 taxpayers, the majority of \n     which will have adjusted gross incomes below $100,000, and \n     the National Taxpayer Advocate has thus identified it as the \n     most serious problem facing individual taxpayers;\n       (3) the alternative minimum tax is often portrayed as a tax \n     that is most problematic for residents of States such as New \n     York, California, Massachusetts, and New Jersey, but the \n     truth is that many other States have a significant percentage \n     of taxpayers affected by the alternative minimum tax, \n     including Oregon, Maryland, Virginia, Minnesota, Ohio, Maine, \n     Georgia, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, so the problem is \n     of national importance;\n       (4) a family with 2 children will become subject to the \n     alternative minimum tax at about $67,500 of income in 2006, \n     and a family with 5 children will start owing the alternative \n     minimum tax at about $54,000 of income, if Congress fails to \n     act;\n       (5) the year 2006 is the ``tipping point'' for the \n     alternative minimum tax, as the number of taxpayers affected \n     nationally will explode from 3,600,000 to 19,000,000 if \n     Congress fails to act;\n       (6) in 2004, only 6.2 percent of families earning $100,000 \n     to $200,000 a year were subject to the alternative minimum \n     tax, and that number will explode to nearly 50 percent if \n     Congress fails to act;\n       (7) if alternative minimum tax relief is extended through \n     2006, about two-thirds of the benefits will be realized by \n     families earning under $200,000, with more than half of the \n     total benefits going to families with incomes between \n     $100,000 and $200,000;\n       (8) starting in 2008, the average married couple with 2 \n     children earning $75,000 or more will find that more than \n     half of the tax cuts they have been expecting from the \n     various laws passed since 2001 will be ``taken back'' via the \n     alternative minimum tax; and\n       (9) the temporary relief from the alternative minimum tax \n     (provided in 2001 and extended twice in 2003 and 2004) \n     expired at the end of 2005, but the tax reductions on \n     dividends and capital gains do not expire until the end of \n     2008, making immediate action on those provisions a less \n     urgent matter.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that protecting middle-class families from the alternative \n     minimum tax should be a higher priority for Congress in 2006 \n     than extending a tax cut that does not expire until the end \n     of 2008.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, this amendment, which is a sense of the \nSenate, which I am offering with Senators Schumer, Kerry, Feinstein, \nClinton, Lautenberg, and Stabenow, is simply a sense of the Senate to \ntry\n\n[[Page S497]]\n\nto ensure that 17 million middle-class families do not see a tax \nincrease next year through the alternative minimum tax. This tax was \nnever intended to raise the taxes of average Americans but, in fact, it \nhas--millions of Americans.\n  Some think this is more problematic for residents of States such as \nNew York, California, or my home State of New Jersey. But the truth is \na whole host of other States have a significant percentage of tax \nfailures affected by the alternative minimum tax, including Oregon, \nMaryland, Virginia, Minnesota, Ohio, Maine, Georgia, North Carolina, \nand Pennsylvania. It is a problem of national importance. This is a \nquestion of whether the Senate values work and the work of honest and \nhard-working families who are going to be subjected to a tax not \nbecause they made more income but simply because of the way the tax is \nstructured.\n  Ultimately, I urge my colleagues to support the sense of the Senate.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I dispute the presumption we have to choose between AMT \nhold harmless and not extending capital gains and dividends. We can do \nboth. The presumption in this bill is that we can and we are going to \nbe able to do that in the conference committee.\n  Since the amendment reflects the position of what we in the Senate \npreviously had anticipated doing anyway, Members ought to vote for the \namendment. I will vote for it.\n  Yesterday afternoon, I took time to respond to Senator Harkin's \nstatement that we have an AMT problem to a significant degree because \nof what the Finance Committee did in the 2001 tax bill. Importantly, he \nfails to recognize that we have addressed the problem for 2001 to 2005. \nAnd, now, we are trying to do the same thing for 2006--to make sure \nthat the AMT problem is not worsened.\n  To the extent that Senator Harkin suggests, like others who have \nlooked at this issue, that the Bush tax cuts are responsible for the \nAMT problem, I respond in this way. Most who have reached that \nconclusion have done so by misusing data provided by the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, JCT, to distort the record on this issue. \nAdditional analysis will demonstrate that conclusion to be erroneous. \nTo the contrary, the analysis suggests an alternative explanation for \nthe AMT problem--Congress's failure to index the AMT for inflation over \nthe past 35 years.\n  Senator Harkin suggests that the Bush tax cuts are responsible for \nthe AMT problem. The conclusion is reached in error because it is based \non faulty logic. Those who have done similar analyses have based their \nconclusions on the mistaken assumption that a reduction in Federal \nreceipts should be interpreted as percentage causation of the AMT \nproblem. JCT was asked to project Federal AMT revenue if the Bush tax \ncuts were extended, but the current-law hold-harmless provision was not \nextended--$1.139 trillion--and Federal AMT revenue if neither the Bush \ntax cuts nor the hold-harmless provision is extended--$400 billion. \nFrom that data, some erroneously concluded and publicly represented \nthat the Bush tax cuts are responsible for 65 percent of the AMT \nproblem--$1.139 trillion minus $400 billion divided by $1.139 \ntrillion--and conversely, that the Bush tax cuts tripled the size of \nthe AMT problem--$1.139 trillion divided by $400 billion.\n  The logic used to reach that conclusion is flawed. That is because \nthe many variables affecting the AMT have overlapping results, and the \norder in which one analyzes those overlapping variables will directly \nimpact the outcome of the analysis.\n  In that way, we can use the same JCT data in the analysis above to \nsuggest that failure to index is actually the dominant cause of the AMT \nproblem. If one were to first index the current tax system for \ninflation by permanently extending an indexed version of the current \nhold-harmless provision, Federal AMT revenue would be reduced from \n$1.139 trillion to $472 billion over the 10-year period. Thus, \nextending and indexing the current hold-harmless provision for future \ninflation would reduce AMT revenues by 59 percent over the same period, \nreferred to in a JCT letter dated October 3, 2005, as ``percentage of \nAMT effect attributable to failure to extend and index hold-harmless \nprovision''. A copy of the entire letter is attached. If we then assume \nthat the Bush tax cuts are repealed, AMT revenue falls by an additional \n$302.3 billion, from $472 billion to $169.7 billion. That second drop, \nattributable to the repeal of the Bush tax cuts, reduces Federal \nrevenues by only 27 percent. Thus, one could argue that failure to \nindex is the greater cause of the AMT problem--59 percent vs. 27 \npercent. Using logic similar to that undertaken above would also cause \nus to conclude that failure to index is responsible for 59 percent of \nthe AMT problem--$1.139 trillion minus $472 billion divided by $1.139 \ntrillion--or alternatively, that failure to index also nearly tripled \nthe size of the AMT problem, $1.139 trillion divided by $472 billion.\n  But simple logic suggests that the Bush tax cuts cannot be \nresponsible for 65 percent of the AMT problem and failure to index \nresponsible for 59 percent of the problem. The anomaly arises because \nthere is overlap between the variables being analyzed. Although the \nanalysis fairly demonstrates the amount of AMT revenue saved by making \na particular change to the Federal tax system, it is inappropriate to \nrepresent that such analysis accurately isolates causation of the AMT. \nBecause there is overlap in the variables being analyzed--in these \nexamples, indexing and the Bush tax cuts--the order of analysis of \nthose variables is crucial to the outcome. JCT acknowledges this point \nto us in a letter dated October 3, stating: ``There is, however, \ninteraction between these two contributing factors to the AMT effect. \nIn order to avoid double counting of interactions, a stacking order is \nimposed. The apportionment of effects to each contributing factor will \nvary depending on the stacking order, even though the total effect \nremains constant.''\n  To this point in time, I have not seen anything that accurately \nsuggests that the 2001 tax cuts have worsened the AMT problem to date. \nIt is my intention to ensure that we continue to honor that commitment \nand that is an important part of this tax reconciliation legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a memorandum be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     To: Mark Prater and Christy Mistr\n     From: George Yin\n     Subject: AMT Effects\n       This memorandum responds to your request of September 29, \n     2005, for an analysis of the portion of the AMT effect (AMT \n     liability plus credits lost due to the AMT) which can be \n     attributed to the failure to adjust the AMT exemption amount \n     to inflation, assuming alternatively that the EGTRRA and \n     JGTRRA tax cuts (``tax cuts'') are either permanently \n     extended or repealed. We also explain how this information \n     compares to information previously provided to you on August \n     31, 2005 and September 16, 2005.\n       For the purpose of this analysis, we have first assumed \n     that the tax cuts are repealed. The first set of figures in \n     Table 1 compares the AMT effect under this assumption if, \n     alternatively, (1) the AMT exemption amount hold-harmless \n     provision is not extended beyond 2005; (2) such provision is \n     extended permanently; and (3) such provision is extended \n     permanently and indexed after 2005, The second set of figures \n     presents the same comparison under the assumption that the \n     tax cuts are permanently extended. All of the information \n     provided in this table was previously provided to you in our \n     September 16, 2005 memo, except in a different format.\n                                  ____\n\n     To: Mark Prater and Christy Mistr\n     Subject: AMT Effects\n\n                                TABLE 1.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                             AMT effect\n                           Item                             (billions of\n                                                              dollars)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTax Cuts Repealed:\n    (1) Hold-harmless provision not extended..............         399.9\n    (2) Hold-harmless provision extended permanently......         212.0\n    (3) Percentage of AMT effect attributable to failure             47%\n     to extend hold-harmless provision (((1)-(2))/(1))....\n    (4) Hold-harmless provision extended permanently and           169.7\n     indexed..............................................\n    (5) Percentage of AMT effect attributable to failure             58%\n     to extend and index hold-harmless provision (((1)-\n     (4))/(1))............................................\nTax Cuts Extended Permanently:\n    (6) Hold-harmless provision not extended..............       1,139.1\n    (7) Hold-harmless provision extended permanently......         628.5\n    (8) Percentage of AMT effect attributable to failure             45%\n     to extend hold-harmless provision (((6)-(7))/(6))....\n    (9) Hold-harmless provision extended permanently and           472.0\n     indexed..............................................\n\n[[Page S498]]\n\n \n    (10) Percentage of AMT effect attributable to failure            59%\n     to extend and index hold-harmless provision (((6)-\n     (9))/(6))............................................\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                                                            \n                                  ____\n     To: Mark Prater and Christy Mistr\n     Subject: AMT Effects\n       In the information provided to you on August 31, 2005 and \n     September 16, 2005, we analyzed the portion of the AMT effect \n     attributable to the tax cuts. In the analysis described \n     above, we identify the portion of the AMT effect attributable \n     to failure to adjust the AMT exemption amount to inflation. \n     There is, however, interaction between these two contributing \n     factors to the AMT effect. In order to avoid double counting \n     of interactions, a stacking order is imposed. The \n     apportionment of effects to each contributing factor will \n     vary depending on the stacking order, even though the total \n     effect remains constant.\n       This phenomenon is illustrated by Tables 2 and 3 below. The \n     first two columns of Table 2 show the portion of the AMT \n     effect attributable to the tax cuts, consistent with the \n     information provided on August 31, 2005 and September 16, \n     2005. The second two columns of Table 2 show the portion of \n     the AMT effect attributable to the failure to extend and \n     index the hold-harmless provision, consistent with the \n     information provided in Table 1 above. Note that if these two \n     contributing factors were completely independent of one \n     another, the information in Table 2 would suggest that the \n     two factors together contribute to more than 100 percent of \n     the AMT effect. In fact, as shown in Table 3, the two factors \n     together contribute to only 85 percent of the AMT effect. \n     Thus, there is substantial overlap between these two factors.\n\n                                                    TABLE 2.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   AMT Effect                                        AMT Effect\n                      Item                        (billions of                 Item                 (billions of\n                                                    dollars)                                          dollars)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBaseline........................................       1,139.1  Baseline..........................       1,139.1\nRepeal tax cuts.................................         399.9  Extend and index AMT hold-harmless         472.0\n                                                                 provision.\nDifference......................................         739.2  Difference........................         667.1\nPercentage of baseline..........................           65%  Percentage of baseline............           59%\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                                                                                                    \n                                  ____\n     To: Mark Prater and Christy Mistr\n     Subject: AMT Effects\n\n                                TABLE 3.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                             AMT Effect\n                           Item                             (billions of\n                                                              dollars)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBaseline..................................................       1,139.1\nRepeal tax cuts and extend and index AMT hold-harmless             169.7\n provision................................................\nDifference................................................         969.4\nPercentage of baseline....................................           85%\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will have a few announcements to make, \nbut, first, I ask unanimous consent that following the vote on passage \nof H.R. 4297, the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. \n4659, the PATRIOT Act extension. I further ask consent that there then \nbe 10 minutes of debate, equally divided, and that following the use or \nyielding back of time, the bill be read a third time and the Senate \nproceed to a vote on passage, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \napologize, were you referring to 10 minutes for debate on the PATRIOT \nAct?\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, for the information of colleagues, we do \nhave two remaining votes this evening. The next vote will be on passage \nof the Tax Relief Act. And following that vote, we will have 10 minutes \nof debate and a vote on passage of the PATRIOT Act extension. That will \nbe the last vote. So, Mr. President, two more votes.\n  We will be in session tomorrow, but there will be no votes tomorrow. \nThe next piece of legislation we will be considering is the asbestos \nlegislation, and it will be necessary to file cloture on the motion to \nproceed to that bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what we would be willing to do, if we are \nnot in session tomorrow, we would be willing to allow the----\n  Mr. FRIST. If there are no votes tomorrow.\n  Mr. REID. Either no votes or not in session.\n  Mr. FRIST. All right.\n  Mr. REID. We would be willing to agree procedurally on a motion to \nproceed to the asbestos bill. You could file whatever papers necessary \ntonight to do that so we could have a Tuesday cloture vote.\n  Mr. FRIST. All right. Mr. President, we will work out on filing the \nmotion to proceed here, and I will have an announcement. We will have \nno votes tomorrow. By the end of tonight, we will have Tuesday worked \nout. We will be debating the asbestos bill on Monday. The next vote \nwill be on that cloture motion, and we will talk about when that would \noccur Tuesday. In all likelihood, if we have a vote Tuesday, it would \nbe around 6 o'clock at night. There are a number of Members who will \nwant to attend the funeral of Coretta Scott King, and, as I understand \nit, that will be at noon on Tuesday. Therefore, the next vote that we \nwill have will be at approximately 6 o'clock on Tuesday night.\n\n\n                          Conflict of Interest\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would like to call the chairman's \nattention to a serious situation facing a Federal district judge in my \nState of Pennsylvania, who recently contacted me on this matter. He has \nan immediate problem that could be solved with an amendment to this \nbill. This judge was assigned as the transferee judge responsible for \nhandling all pretrial matters in very large multidistrict litigation \ninvolving antitrust claims in the\n\n[[Page S499]]\n\ncorrugated paper industry from all around the United States. He has \nbeen working on the case since 1999.\n  Late in this last year, a company in which the judge inherited stock \nover 30 years ago merged into another company which happens to be one \nof the plaintiffs in the case. Because of the judge's stock holdings in \nthis company, the judge may now have to recuse himself from the case. \nMost of the parties would like the judge to remain on the case because \nof his years of experience and expertise on this case. In order to \nremain as the transferee judge, this judge would have to sell his \nholdings, which would give him a capital gain this year well into six \nfigures.\n  Last March and again this past November, Ralph Mecham, as Secretary \nof the Judicial Conference of the United States, transmitted on behalf \nof the Conference a legislative proposal to you and to Senator Baucus \nthat would resolve this judge's problem and similar problems for \ncountless other Federal judges throughout the United States. It would \npermit a judge who must sell financial holdings in order to avoid a \nconflict of interest to reinvest that money in another holding and \ndefer paying the capital gains tax until the substitute financial \ninterest is liquidated. The taxes are not forgiven, but deferred and \npayable at the later date, as I just said.\n  This same solution to conflicts of interest is already available to \nexecutive branch officials. The proposal by the Judicial conference \nwould simply extend it to Federal judges, as well, bringing parity to \nthese two branches of the Federal Government.\n  I understand that it is too late at this time to offer the Judicial \nConference proposal as an amendment. However, I would like to know if \nthe chairman would consider taking this matter up during the conference \nwith the House on this bill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator bringing this \nmatter to my attention and regret that it is too late to amend the bill \ntoday on the floor. I will agree with the Senator, however, to review \nthis proposal further with the intent of taking it up in conference.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, budget reconciliation is a process \nadopted by Congress nearly three decades ago to facilitate the passage \nof legislation to reduce the deficit and to help bring the Federal \nbudget into balance. But in recent years, under the Republican \nmajority, that process has been repeatedly abused to enact more and \nmore tax cuts for the wealthy that make the budget deficit even larger.\n  Now, they are trying to do it again, in spite of the urgent problems \nfacing the Nation, from the ongoing war in Iraq to the devastating \nhurricane damage along the gulf coast. The Republicans have brought \nbefore the Senate two reconciliation bills, one now passed, that would \nproduce a net increase in the budget deficit by billions of dollars \nover the next 5 years.\n  It sounds like deficit reduction, until you look at the tax \nreconciliation bill, which will cut taxes by far more than the savings \nin spending--$70 billion. The net result will be a substantial increase \nin the budget deficit--exactly the opposite of what the reconciliation \nprocess is supposed to accomplish. Billions of dollars will go from \nprograms that assist low income families and senior citizens into the \npockets of the already wealthy. It takes from the least and gives to \nthe most. It is a breathtaking Republican scam on the Nation that can \nonly further discredit this Congress in the eyes of the people.\n  From day one, the Republican plan has been to use this reconciliation \nprocess to push through a cut in the tax rate on capital gains and \ndividend income. These are tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit the \nrichest Americans. Over half the tax benefits will go to millionaires. \nThese tax breaks were in the original mark proposed by Chairman \nGrassley, and they are in the bill already passed by the Republican \nmajority in the House of Representatives. While they are not in the \ncurrent Senate bill, we all know these capital gains and dividend tax \ncuts will reappear in the conference report. Leading Republicans have \nmade that clear. The GOP is intent on delivering those tax breaks to \ntheir wealthy supporters. They will be included in the final bill.\n  What is the real cost of these capital gains and dividend tax cuts? \nThe Republicans claim the cost of these provisions is $20 billion, the \nreal cost of extending the lower rates for another 2 years is $50 \nbillion. This tax break is particularly unfair, because over 75 percent \nof the tax benefits will go to taxpayers with incomes over $200,000 a \nyear. Over half the benefits--53 percent--will go to taxpayers with \nincomes over $1 million a year. The average millionaire will save over \n$35,000 a year from these tax breaks for capital gains and dividends.\n  As a result of this shameful Republican let-them-eat-cake proposal, \nmillions of working families would pay a substantially higher tax rate \non their wages than wealthy taxpayers pay on their investment income. \nWhat could be more unfair? Republicans are penalizing hard work, not \nrewarding it. They are giving a preference to unearned income over \nearned income.\n  The Republicans cynically claim that capital gains and dividend \nincome deserve special treatment because they will stimulate \ninvestment. The facts do not substantiate that claim. The stock market \ngrew much more rapidly in the early and mid-1990s when investors' \nincome was taxed at the same rate as employers' wages than since the \nrates on capital gains and dividend income were cut. The overall health \nof the economy has much more to do with financial stability than \nspecial tax breaks for the rich. More tax cuts that America cannot \nafford will hurt the economy, not help it.\n  There are some provisions in the Senate bill that we do need to \naddress. The alternative minimum tax was never intended to apply to \nmiddle-class families, and they deserve tax relief. In a truly \noutrageous move, the House Republicans took AMT relief for the middle \nclass out of their reconciliation bill so they could fit in more tax \nbreaks for the rich. The research and development tax credit is \nimportant to our international competitiveness and should be retained. \nHowever, those worthwhile tax cuts should be paid for by rolling back \nsome of the extravagant tax breaks that this Republican Congress has \nalready given to the Nation's wealthiest taxpayers. We simply cannot \nafford more tax cuts at a time when we are facing record deficits.\n  The financial mismanagement of the Bush administration has weakened \nour economy and placed our children's financial well-being in peril. \nThe national debt has risen to an all time high of $8 trillion. Under \nPresident Bush, our country has borrowed more from foreign governments \nand foreign financial institutions than in the prior 200 years \ncombined. We are losing control of our Nation's future, and all the \nRepublicans offer is more of the same. More and more tax breaks further \nenriching the already wealthy, while working families are left to \nstruggle on their own in an increasingly harsh economy.\n  If we are honest about reducing the deficit and strengthening the \neconomy, we need to stop lavishing tax breaks on the rich and start \ninvesting in the health and well-being of all families. These families \nare being squeezed unmercifully between stagnant wages and ever-\nincreasing costs for the basic necessities of life. The cost of health \ninsurance is up 59 percent in the last 5 years. Gasoline is up 74 \npercent. College tuition is up 45 percent. Housing is up 44 percent. \nThe list goes on and on, up and up--and paychecks are buying less each \nyear. The dollars that go to pay for more tax breaks for the rich are \ndollars that could be used to help these families. Instead, this \nRepublican budget plan turns a blind eye to their problems.\n  The economic trends are very disturbing for any who are willing to \nlook at them objectively. The gap between rich and poor has been \nwidening in recent years. Thirty-seven million Americans now live in \npoverty, up 19 percent during the Bush administration. One in five \nAmerican children lives in poverty. Fourteen million children go to bed \nhungry each night. Wages remain stagnant while inflation drags more and \nmore families below the poverty line. Two-point-eight million \nmanufacturing jobs have been lost. Long-term unemployment is at \nhistoric highs.\n  In his second inaugural address, President Lincoln reminded us of the \nsolemn obligation that we have to those who fight our Nation's wars. He \nsaid ``let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the \nNation's\n\n[[Page S500]]\n\nwounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle [and for his \nwidow and his orphan.]''\n  Over 550,000 brave men and women have served in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nA majority of them have served multiple tours fighting under dangerous \nconditions, and battling an unseen foe. We owe it to them to care for \ntheir injuries incurred in service of our Nation.\n  As of today, over 16,000 of our troops have been injured in battle. \nOf those, over 7,500 were so seriously injured that they could not \nreturn to duty. We have seen the ravages of war in the wards of Walter \nReed and Bethesda. While body armor saves lives, many soldiers and \nMarines have lost their limbs.\n  Others will survive with major injuries to their spine or brain \ndamage. This summer, the Surgeon General of the Army reported that 30 \npercent of U.S. troops have developed mental health problems within a \nfew months of their return from Iraq. Twenty percent of the troops \ninjured in Iraq have suffered head and brain injuries that require a \nlifetime of continual care that could cost as much as $5 million.\n  A recent study by the New England Journal of Medicine found that 15 \nto 17 percent of Iraqi vets showed signs of ``major depression, \ngeneralized anxiety, or [Post Traumatic Stress Disorder].'' But of \nthose, only 23 to 40 percent are seeking help. Many of them will wind \nup homeless with no other options for their health care than the VA. \nAfter their service to our country, we should not leave them out on the \nstreet.\n  The increased use of the Guard and Reserve in this conflict has \ncreated an entirely new category of people who may now make use of the \nVA. The Guard and Reserve make up approximately 40 percent of the \ntroops on the ground, and approximately 90,000 have sought care at VA \nhospitals.\n  Unfortunately, our current budgets do not reflect this reality. A \nrecent study by Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz and \nHarvard professor Linda Bilmes found that the costs of paying for the \ninjured from these wars has not yet been budgeted. To our dismay, we \nlearned that the Veterans' Administration needed an additional $2.7 \nbillion for this fiscal year to care for the veterans returning from \nthe war.\n  Stiglitz and Bilmes found that, ``the military values the cost of \nthose injured by what their medical treatment cost and disability pay; \nand current accounting only reflects current payments in disability'' \nnot future payments.\n  Based on their calculations, it could cost as much as $24.1 billion \nto pay for these costs over the next 5 years. Of this amount, $9.4 \nbillion for medical care and $14.7 billion for increased disability \npayments.\n  This amendment Senator Dodd and I have introduced would rectify that \nshortfall and keep faith with our men and women in uniform. It would be \npaid for by elimination of the capital gains and dividends tax breaks \nfor taxpayers with over $1 million in annual income.\n  We owe it to soldiers like Sergeant Peter Damon, a son of \nMassachusetts who lost his arms in Iraq.\n  I also express my support for the amendment offered by Senator \nRockefeller that would provide strong tax incentives for mining \ncompanies to adopt safer practices and up-to-date safety equipment.\n  The recent tragedies at Sago Mine and Alma Mine in West Virginia \nremind us that the safety of the Nation's workers is paramount. This \nyear, 21 miners have already been killed on the job. In early January, \n12 miners died when they were trapped after an explosion at the Sago \nMine. Just 2\\1/2\\ weeks later, two more miners died in a mine fire at \nthe Alma mine. And tragically, yesterday, there were three more mine \naccidents in West Virginia, killing two more men. One miner died in an \nunderground mine in Boone County when a wall support came loose. A \nsecond miner died when a bulldozer struck a gas line, causing a deadly \nfire. Miners have also died this year in Kentucky and Utah.\n  Our entire Nation joins the families and the communities in mourning \nthese fallen miners. We have a continuing obligation to do everything \nwe can to protect the safety of America's workers. It is obvious that \nwe are not meeting that obligation.\n  Two weeks ago, I traveled with Senator Rockefeller, Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Enzi, and Subcommittee \nChairman Isakson to meet with the family members of the miners who were \nkilled at Sago Mine, and with coalminers, company representatives, and \nhealth and safety experts. Each of us committed to improving the \nNation's mine safety laws.\n  A critical part of that commitment is to ensure that all of our \nNation's miners have the best safety equipment available. This \namendment will encourage companies to adopt up-to-date mine safety \nequipment by providing accelerated deductions for companies that invest \nin these technologies.\n  It encourages mines to adopt emergency communications technology and \ntracking devices to locate miners underground. It will also encourage \ncoal mines to ensure that workers have access to additional stores of \nemergency oxygen, which will give them extra time to exit a mine or to \nwait for rescue. Finally, the amendment acknowledges the vital need for \nexperienced mine rescuers who are familiar with the underground \ngeography of a mine. By providing a tax credit to encourage the \nformation of mine rescue teams, we hope to ensure that mines have well-\ntrained rescuers onsite, saving precious minutes in any rescue attempt.\n  These are all safety measures that could have made a difference in \nthe terrible tragedies that occurred this year at Sago and Alma Mines. \nBy passing this amendment, we take the first step toward preventing \nfuture such tragedies from occurring.\n  I have joined separately in sponsoring legislation introduced by \nSenator Byrd and Senator Rockefeller to require the Mine Safety and \nHealth Administration to quickly adopt needed safety standards. Both of \nthese measures are critical to improving safety conditions in America's \nmines. Our Nation's miners deserve no less, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment and the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of \n2006.\n  Instead of helping hard-pressed families, the budget reconciliation \nprocess is being misused to cut the programs and eliminate the services \nthat these families need most, while granting the wealthy even more tax \nbreaks. It is yet another opportunity squandered--another chance that \nthis Republican Congress had to make things better. But once again, \nthis Congress has chosen to make them worse instead. The American \npeople deserve better.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the tax \nreconciliation bill being debated today. I have listened to the \ncomments of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle with much \ninterest. Because we have heard a great deal about the wisdom or folly \nof extending the lower tax rate on dividends and capital gains, I would \nlike to take this opportunity to offer a few words in defense of the \nextension.\n  It is interesting to me that so many of my colleagues have juxtaposed \nthe capital gains and dividends provision against the provision to \nrelieve temporarily the individual alternative minimum tax. Listening \nto some of my colleagues, it seems they believe that we either must \ninclude the alternative minimum tax fix or extend the capital gains and \ndividends provision, but not both. My strong belief is that we can--and \nmust--do both.\n  The reduced rate of tax on dividends and capital gains has been \nattacked repeatedly as being a costly sop to the rich and not much \nelse, with little recognition given to its beneficial impact on the \neconomy. The simple fact is that the data and basic economics tell us \nthe cost of the lower tax rates on dividends and capital gains has been \nminor, and the benefits immense.\n  There is ample evidence that clearly shows the lower tax rates on \ncapital income have stimulated saving. Alicia Munnell, an economist at \nBoston College and a former official in the Clinton Treasury \nDepartment, finds that working age households saved significantly more \nin 2003, the year the tax reductions on capital gains and dividends \npassed the Congress, than they did in 2002. Incidentally, Munnell's \nwork also shows that the recently announced savings rate of zero is \nmisleading--she reports that working families, and by that I mean \nfamilies with breadwinners who have yet to reach retirement age, are \nindeed putting\n\n[[Page S501]]\n\nmoney aside. However, looking at our broad, economy-wide measure of net \nsaving, the dissaving done by retired households obscures this fact.\n  There are other benefits from a lower tax rate on investment income \nbesides increased saving. With lower tax rates, capital becomes more \nfluid, making it easier for it to flow to projects with higher rates of \nreturn. Families lock in much less capital for fear of the taxman. The \nGovernment gets a lower percentage of each sale of stock, but it gets \nmore opportunities to tax the money.\n  And, Uncle Sam is getting more cracks at it. The amount of capital \ngains realized in 2005 was twice that in 2002. The stock market's value \nhas not doubled since then, and we are not twice as wealthy as we were \nthen--people are just responding to incentives and they are holding \ntheir assets for a bit less time. There is nothing necessarily wrong \nwith that. If capital is used more wisely, this ultimately benefits not \njust the investors but also the workers, who see their productivity \nincrease. When productivity goes up, wages must follow.\n  The amount of revenue collected from taxes on capital gains and \ndividends has increased significantly since the reduction in tax rates \npassed. In 2005, capital gains tax revenues amounted to $80 billion, 60 \npercent higher than in 2002.\n  Now, I am not about to claim that this or any other tax cut ``pays \nfor itself,'' but the revenue lost from the lower rates on capital \ngains and dividends is relatively minor precisely because of the \nincreased economic activity the lower taxes generate. The jump in \nrevenues collected from the two taxes is manifest proof of this.\n  The beneficiaries of lower taxes on investment income are not just \nthose who own stocks and bonds either, and I would like to point out \nthat it is not just the rich who have investments. I hear from retired \nUtahns who are living modestly on a Social Security check, a small \npension, and their savings. They might not have a lot of money \ninvested, and their dividends are not going to buy them a new car or \nluxury condominium, but every little bit helps, they tell me.\n  In reality, everyone benefits from lower taxes on dividends and \ncapital gains--even those with little or no savings. The primary reason \nfor lower tax rates on investment income is that it stimulates the \neconomy. This is not a radical idea by any means--Nobel Prize-winning \neconomists Robert Lucas and Ed Prescott have argued vehemently in favor \nof this. The logic is simple: Low taxes on the income we receive from \nour savings means we will save more. That ends up making more capital \navailable for firms to invest in new plant and equipment, increasing \nproductivity as well as wages.\n  The strong economic conditions of the 1990s are owed to a number of \nfactors, but the most important factor was undoubtedly the resumption \nof high productivity growth in the middle of the decade. It was in the \nlatter years of the expansion, when unemployment dropped below 5 \npercent, that we finally saw the elusive gains in income of low-skilled \nworkers. I believe that the low tax rate on capital gains and dividends \nis an essential ingredient in creating more new jobs and maintaining \nhealthy economic growth.\n  Some of my colleagues may say they agree that the benefits of lower \nrates are real and ought to be continued, but they do not see the need \nto renew a provision that does not expire until 2008. The simple answer \nis that we need to create some degree of certainty and stability for \ninvestors. Investors in 2006 care about what the tax rate on a long-\nterm investment is going to be in 3 years. If they believe that \nCongress will allow tax rates on dividends and capital gains to \nincrease to their previously higher rates, they will be less inclined \nto make those investments. That money will go instead to less \nproductive, shorter term investments or will simply not be saved at \nall. The end result is that we'll have less capital available and lower \neconomic growth.\n  We must acknowledge that the budget deficit is a problem--it is \nobvious we need to get our economic house in order soon. The baby boom \ngeneration is starting to retire and making our budget mess a lot \nworse. However, increasing the taxes on dividends and capital gains is \nnot the answer to our budget morass, either in the short or the long \nrun. We need every single bit of economic growth we can get for the \nnext decade to help fund our obligations, and allowing the tax rates on \ndividends and capital gains to go back up would be a tax increase that \nwould reduce growth.\n  When we seek to raise revenue by taxing the accumulation of wealth, \nwe are essentially punishing a virtuous activity, namely saving. We \nshould be doing all we can to encourage families to set aside money, to \ninvest, to patiently prepare for the future. Allowing the low tax rate \non dividends and capital gains to expire would do more than reduce \nproductivity and economic growth; it would send a signal that we do not \nvalue savings in this country. At this point in time, we can afford \nneither.\n  Some of my colleagues believe that low tax rates on dividends and \ncapital gains benefit solely the rich and no one else and feel that \nthey cannot countenance a continuation of the low rates at the expense \nof programs more targeted to low-income households. I do not fault my \ncolleagues for their concern, but I believe that the lower rates helps \neveryone in our country. It costs us relatively little in terms of lost \ntax revenue, since the lower rates have resulted in higher dividends, \nhigher stock prices, and more sales of stock, with more revenue created \nby each activity. At the same time, every single working family in this \ncountry benefits from the higher savings engendered by the lower tax \nrates via the improved productivity, wages, economic growth, and the \nnumber of jobs available. High growth and economic prosperity are not \nthe cure to every problem that ails the country, but it can make any \nsolution much more attainable. Supporting low tax rates on dividends \nand capital gains is the right thing to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport H.R. 4659.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4659) to amend the USA PATRIOT Act to extend \n     the sunset of certain provisions of such Act.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 10 minutes equally divided for \ndebate. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Republican leadership of the House and \nthe Senate has proposed a second extension of the PATRIOT Act to last \nanother 5 weeks until March 10. I support that. I support it because it \nis basically what Senator Sununu and I proposed in December in the \nbipartisan S. 2082, cosponsored by 47 Senators from both sides of the \naisle. I hope this will allow us to make the final improvements \nnecessary so that the final PATRIOT Act can be passed.\n  I support H.R. 4659, a bill by Chairman Sensenbrenner. I hope all \nSenators from both sides of the aisle will. I say this because--\nnotwithstanding the fact that the Senate doesn't even have a modicum of \norder, I would note, I am prepared to yield back the rest of my time if \nthe place would just hush a tiny bit--it is a vital debate. The \nterrorist threat to American security is very real. It is vital that we \nhave the tools to protect American security. That is why I coauthored \nthe PATRIOT Act 5 years ago. That is why it passed with broad \nbipartisan support. I didn't believe it was a perfect piece of \nlegislation, but I thought it was a good piece of legislation.\n  And then the Republican leader in the House, Dick Armey, and I put \ncertain sunset provisions in it so that we would actually look at this \nagain. I think we have done that. We are close to having a final \nproduct. After all, our Nation is a democracy. It is based on the \nprinciples of a balanced government, which requires something that we \nhave not seen enough of lately--checks and balances. We can do that in \nthis act.\n  I noted earlier this week that I was concerned that the Republican \ncongressional leadership had not even proposed to the Senate Democratic \nleadership or to that of the Judiciary Committee that action be taken \nto ensure that certain sunsetting provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act not \nbe allowed simply to expire at the end of this week. Thereafter, action \nwas finally considered. Yesterday the House passed a bill to extend the \nsunsetting provisions until March 10, 2006. I support H.R. 4659, \nChairman Sensenbrenner's bill.\n  Those of us working constructively and in a bipartisan way to extend \nthe USA PATRIOT Act with improvements have repeatedly offered to meet \nto work out the remaining differences. Regrettably, the Senate \nleadership has not made the effort to work through the remaining \nconcerns or to bring us together. I was concerned because as recently \nas last week leading Republicans were indicating that they opposed \nanother short-term extension that could be used to work out \nimprovements that can lead to longer term Senate reauthorization.\n  I was concerned that the demagoguery we had witnessed from the White \nHouse and House Republicans would be repeated, but that this time it \nwould have real consequences. Last December, even though a majority of \nSenators--Republicans and Democrats, those who voted against cloture on \nthe conference report that failed to pass the Senate and those who \nvoted for it urged the Republican leader to act on a short-term, 3-\nmonth extension before the end of the last session. At that time the \nPresident had said that he would not approve a short-term extension, \nand House Republicans had said that they would not allow a short-term \nextension. Those who threatened to let it expire were playing a \ndangerous political game. Fortunately, common sense prevailed, and in \nthe waning days of the last session, just before adjournment for \nChristmas, the House approved a short-term extension until February 3, \nand the President reversed his earlier position and signed it into law.\n  Now the Republican leadership of the House and Senate is proposing a \nsecond extension that will last for another 5 weeks, until March 10. \nThat is in line with the initial bipartisan proposal that Senator \nSununu and I made in S. 2082, back on December 12, that came to be \ncosponsored by 47 Senators. It is my hope that this will allow us the \nopportunity to work out improvements to the reauthorization legislation \nto better protect the liberties and rights of ordinary Americans. We \nshould do our best to get it right for all Americans.\n  I have continued meeting and talking with interested Republican and \nDemocratic Senators. Senate staff has finally gotten together this week \nin a bipartisan meeting. I have joined in a bipartisan request to the \nmajority leader that he bring together key interested Senators to work \nout a bipartisan compromise that improves the failed conference report.\n  Contrary to the false claims and misrepresentations by some, there \nwas no effort on either side of the aisle to do away with the PATRIOT \nAct. That is simply and profoundly not true. Along with others in the \nSenate, I am seeking to mend and extend the PATRIOT Act, not to end it. \nThere is no reason why the American people cannot have a PATRIOT Act \nthat is both effective and that adequately protects their rights and \ntheir privacy. The only people who ever threatened an expiration of the \nPATRIOT Act were the President and House Republicans. As I noted on \nDecember 21, the administration and the Republican congressional \nleadership were those who were objecting to extending the act and \nthreatening its expiration. That was wrong. That made no sense. They \ncame to their senses in the days that followed.\n  In his State of the Union speech this week the President said only \nthat reauthorizing the PATRIOT Act was needed to provide the same tools \nwe provide to law enforcement authorities to fight drug trafficking and \norganized crime. I have worked with others to provide additional tools \nin the fight against terrorism. With others on both sides of the aisle, \nI also want to protect the liberties of ordinary and law-abiding \nAmericans from overreaching and unchecked Government intrusion. \nPermanent gag orders and conclusive presumptions in favor of the \nGovernment, when intrusive demands for library records or personal \nmedical records are being made by agents without court approval, smack \nof a police state, not the United States.\n  Republican and Democratic Senators joined together last month to say \nwe can do better to protect Americans' liberties while ensuring that \nour national security is as strong as it can be. In the days after 9/\n11, the Senate Democratic majority joined with Republicans and the \nadministration in bipartisan action. Unfortunately, the President's \npolitical adviser Karl Rove and other Republican partisans have sought \nto make the PATRIOT Act a partisan issue. I urge them, instead, to join \nwith our bipartisan coalition and work with us to provide a better \nbalance to protect the rights of ordinary Americans.\n  Every single Senator--Republican and Democratic--voted last July to \nmend and extend the PATRIOT Act. That bipartisan solution was cast \naside by the Bush administration and Republican congressional leaders \nwhen they hijacked the conference report, rewrote the bill in ways that \nfell short in protecting basic civil liberties, and then tried to ram \nit through Congress as an all-or-nothing proposition. I have joined \nwith Senators of both parties in an effort to work to improve the bill. \nSome of us are working hard to protect the security and liberty of \nAmericans. What is wrong is for the White House to seek to manipulate \nthis into a partisan fight for its partisan political advantage. \nInstead of playing partisan politics, the Bush administration and \nRepublican congressional leadership should join in trying to improve \nthe law. Especially when security and liberty are at issue, why not \nmake the extra effort to produce a consensus bill that can deserve the \nconfidence of the American people?\n  This is a vital debate. The terrorist threat to America's security is \nvery real, and it is vital that we be armed\n\n[[Page S503]]\n\nwith the tools needed to protect Americans' security. At the same time, \nthe threat to civil liberties is also very real in America today. The \nquestion is not whether the Government should have the tools it needs \nto protect the American people. Of course it should. That is why I \ncoauthored the PATRIOT Act 5 years ago, and that is why that act passed \nwith broad bipartisan support. When I voted for the PATRIOT Act, I did \nnot think it was an ideal piece of legislation, and I knew that it \nwould need careful oversight and, in due course, reform. This is about \nhow to reconcile two fundamental goals--ensuring the safety of the \nAmerican people and protecting their liberty by means of a system of \nchecks and balances that keeps the Government--their Government--\naccountable. Those goals should not be the goals of any particular \nparty or ideology, they are shared American goals.\n  Our Nation is a democracy, founded on the principles of balanced \ngovernment. We need to restore checks and balances in this country to \nprotect us all and all that we hold dear. Our Congress and our courts \nprovide checks on the abuse of executive authority and should protect \nour liberties. We need to write the law so that Congress has provided \nits check in the law and so that courts can play their role, as well. \nAll Americans need to take notice and demand that their liberties and \nsecurity be properly and effectively maintained.\n  I see the senior Senator, my good friend from Pennsylvania, on the \nfloor. I will yield back the rest of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

It serves as notification to Congress that the President \nintends to initiate negotiations for a free trade agreement, FTA, with \nthe Republic of Korea.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, The United States \n           Trade Representative, Washington, DC, February 2, 2006.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     President pro tempore, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stevens: In accordance with section 2104(a)(1) \n     of the Trade Act of 2002 (the Trade Act), and pursuant to \n     authority delegated to me by the President, I am pleased to \n     notify the Congress that the President intends to initiate \n     negotiations for a free trade agreement (FTA) with the \n     Republic of Korea. We expect these negotiations to commence \n     in May 2006. We will be consulting closely with the Congress \n     regarding these negotiations, as required by the Trade Act.\n       The Administration is committed to concluding trade \n     agreements that benefit our farmers, workers, businesses, and \n     families by opening markets around the world. With the \n     continued help of Congress, we will continue to advance \n     America's trade interests.\n       An FTA with Korea will help foster economic growth and \n     create higher paying jobs in the United States by reducing \n     and eliminating barriers to trade and investment between \n     Korea and the United States. An FTA will enable American \n     companies to increase their exports of goods and services to \n     Korea. The FTA will require Korea to eliminate its tariffs on \n     U.S. industrial and agricultural goods, remove any \n     unjustified sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures, \n     improve the transparency of its regulatory and licensing \n     procedures, and lower its barriers to U.S. service providers.\n       The United States has much to gain through an FTA with \n     Korea. Korea already is our seventh largest trading partner \n     with $72.6 billion in total bilateral trade during 2004. An \n     FTA promises to increase trade still further across a wide \n     range of goods and services and thereby promote economic \n     growth and the creation of better paying jobs in both \n     countries. An FTA will also level the playing field for U.S. \n     exports in Korea by providing U.S. products treatment \n     comparable to that which Korea has offered its other FTA \n     partners, such as Chile, Singapore, and the European Free \n     Trade Association countries (Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, \n     and Liechtenstein).\n       An FTA with Korea will provide benefits for U.S. \n     agricultural producers. In 2005, based on eleven month \n     annualized data, Korea was the sixth largest export market \n     for U.S. farm and ranch products. Under an FTA, Korea will \n     eliminate duties on U.S. agricultural goods and reduce other \n     barriers in Korea's agricultural sector, thus creating new \n     opportunities for U.S. farmers in this major market. U.S. \n     negotiators will work hard to ensure that the FTA facilitates \n     further market access for U.S. food and other agricultural \n     exports to Korea and addresses the full range of trade \n     barriers that U.S. agriculture exports currently face in \n     Korea, including unjustified SPS measures. We will consult \n     closely with Congress and the U.S. agriculture community in \n     developing our positions on agricultural issues during the \n     negotiations.\n       The FTA will also promote exports of U.S. industrial goods \n     by eliminating Korea's tariffs on U.S. products and reducing \n     its non-tariff barriers. U.S. industry groups have \n     consistently cited Korea as a potential FTA partner because \n     of the significant opportunities an FTA will provide for \n     new U.S. industrial goods exports. FTA negotiations will \n     also provide an opportunity to reduce or eliminate \n     restrictions that make it difficult for U.S. service \n     providers to operate in the Korean market.\n       In recent years, U.S. industry has repeatedly pointed out \n     deficiencies in Korea's efforts to protect intellectual \n     property. The Administration has held extensive, detailed \n     discussions on this subject with Korea since 2001, and Korea \n     has made progress on important issues, including improved \n     protection for sound recordings transmitted over the Internet \n     and better enforcement against software and textbook piracy. \n     FTA negotiations will provide a unique opportunity to improve \n     further the protection that Korea affords to intellectual \n     property, including strengthened measures in Korea against \n     the illegal online distribution and transmission of \n     copyrighted works.\n       We also recognize the concerns raised by U.S. industry \n     about the close interaction between the Korean government and \n     business in some sectors of the economy and the insufficient \n     transparency in Korea's regulatory processes. In order to \n     address these concerns, we will seek to ensure that the FTA \n     provides\n\n[[Page S504]]\n\n     for regulatory transparency in trade and investment matters, \n     including a public comment period, the publication of general \n     administrative actions, and other appropriate provisions.\n       An FTA with Korea will also promote bilateral investment. \n     U.S. companies are already the largest source of foreign \n     investment in Korea, while Korea is a growing source of \n     investment in the United States. Additional bilateral \n     investment holds the potential of adding to the many jobs \n     that current high levels of bilateral investment support.\n       An FTA will also help strengthen Korea's cooperation with \n     the United States in multilateral and regional trade fora. \n     Korea is already a close partner in the Asia-Pacific Economic \n     Cooperation (APEC) and in the Doha Round of negotiations in \n     the World Trade Organization (WTO). As host country for the \n     APEC Leaders Meeting in November 2005, Korea played a \n     leadership role in securing a call by all 21 APEC Leaders for \n     an ambitious conclusion to the WTO Doha Development Agenda. \n     It similarly played a constructive role in the recent Hong \n     Kong Ministerial meeting. Concluding an FTA will help ensure \n     that there continues to be a commonality of interest and \n     close cooperation between the United States and Korea in all \n     international trade fora.\n       In addition to complementing our cooperative efforts with \n     Korea on global and regional trade issues, an FTA will \n     further enhance the strong United States-Korea regional \n     partnership, which is a force for stability and development \n     in Asia. An FTA will reinforce the shared interests of the \n     United States and Korea and promote common values, \n     facilitating our efforts to work together on a wide range of \n     issues. Korea is a key ally in the region on military and \n     security matters. We are partners in the global war on \n     terrorism, and the extensive ties between the U.S. and Korean \n     armed forces bolster U.S. strategic interests in the region.\n       While we see substantial benefits in pursuing an FTA with \n     Korea, we are also giving careful consideration to concerns \n     that some members of Congress have raised regarding Korea's \n     trade policies. We will continue to consult closely with \n     Congress as we consider how to address these issues in the \n     context of FTA negotiations.\n       Initial consultations with the Congressional Oversight \n     Group (COG) on September 8, 2005 and with other Members of \n     Congress regarding potential FTA negotiations with Korea have \n     been positive, and our decision to move ahead with \n     negotiations with Korea was strongly influenced by the \n     bipartisan expressions of interest we have received from \n     members of Congress and U.S. industry. The Administration \n     will continue to consult closely with the Congress, including \n     the COG, throughout the negotiation process on the full range \n     of issues.\n       Our specific objectives for negotiations with Korea are as \n     follows:\n     Trade in Goods\n       Seek to eliminate tariffs and other duties and charges on \n     trade between Korea and the United States on the broadest \n     possible basis, subject to reasonable adjustment periods for \n     import-sensitive products.\n       Seek to eliminate non-tariff barriers in Korea to U.S. \n     exports, including permit and licensing barriers on \n     agricultural and other products, restrictive administration \n     of tariff-rate quotas, unjustified trade restrictions that \n     affect new U.S. technologies, and other trade restrictive \n     measures that U.S. exporters identify.\n       Seek to eliminate government practices that adversely \n     affect U.S. exports of perishable or cyclical agricultural \n     products, while providing for improved U.S. import relief \n     mechanisms as appropriate.\n       Pursue a mechanism with Korea that will support achieving \n     the U.S. objective in the WTO negotiations of eliminating all \n     export subsidies on agricultural products, while maintaining \n     the right to provide bona fide food aid and preserving U.S. \n     agricultural market development and export credit programs.\n       Pursue fully reciprocal access to the Korean market for \n     U.S. textile and apparel products.\n     Customs Matters, Rules of Origin, and Enforcement Cooperation\n       Seek specific and trade facilitative customs commitments to \n     ensure that Korea's customs operations are conducted with \n     transparency, efficiency, and predictability, and that \n     Korea's customs laws, regulations, decisions, and rulings are \n     applied in a manner that facilitates the efficient and timely \n     release of goods, and prevents unwarranted procedural \n     obstacles to international trade.\n       Seek rules of origin, procedures for applying these rules, \n     and provisions to address circumvention matters that will \n     ensure that preferential duty rates under an FTA with Korea \n     apply only to goods eligible to receive such treatment, \n     without creating unnecessary obstacles to trade.\n       Seek terms for cooperative efforts with Korea regarding \n     enforcement of customs and related issues, including in the \n     area of trade in textiles and apparel.\n     Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Measures\n       Seek to have Korea reaffirm its WTO commitments on SPS \n     measures and eliminate any unjustified SPS restrictions.\n       Seek to strengthen cooperation between U.S. and Korean SPS \n     authorities.\n       Seek to strengthen collaboration with Korea in implementing \n     the WTO SPS Agreement and to enhance cooperation with Korea \n     in relevant international bodies on developing international \n     SPS standards, guidelines, and recommendations.\n     Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT)\n       Seek to have Korea reaffirm its WTO TBT commitments and \n     eliminate any unjustified TBT measures.\n       Seek to strengthen collaboration with Korea in implementing \n     the WTO TBT Agreement and create a procedure for exchanging \n     information with Korea on TBT-related issues.\n     Intellectual Property Rights\n       Seek to establish standards to be applied in Korea that \n     build on the foundations established in the WTO Agreement on \n     Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights and \n     other international intellectual property agreements, such as \n     the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Copyright \n     Treaty, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty, and the \n     Patent Cooperation Treaty.\n       In areas such as patent protection and protection of \n     undisclosed information, seek to have Korea apply levels of \n     protection and practices more in line with U.S. law and \n     practices, including appropriate flexibility.\n       Seek to strengthen Korea's laws and procedures to enforce \n     intellectual property rights, such as by ensuring that Korean \n     authorities seize suspected pirated and counterfeit goods, \n     equipment used to make such goods or to transmit pirated \n     goods, and documentary evidence.\n       Seek to strengthen measures in Korea that provide for \n     compensation of right holders for infringements of \n     intellectual property rights and to provide for criminal \n     penalties under Korean law that are sufficient to have a \n     deterrent effect on piracy and counterfeiting.\n     Trade in Services\n       Pursue disciplines to address discriminatory and other \n     barriers to trade in Korea's services market, and pursue a \n     comprehensive approach to market access, including any \n     necessary improvements in access to the telecommunications, \n     financial services, professional services, or other sectors.\n       Seek improved transparency and predictability of Korean \n     regulatory procedures, specialized disciplines for financial \n     services, and additional disciplines for telecommunications \n     and other service sectors, as necessary.\n     Investment\n       Seek to establish rules that reduce or eliminate artificial \n     or trade-distorting barriers to U.S. investment in Korea, \n     while ensuring that Korean investors in the United States are \n     not accorded greater substantive rights with respect to \n     investment protections than U.S. investors in the United \n     States, and to secure for U.S. investors in Korea important \n     rights comparable to those that would be available under U.S. \n     legal principles and practice.\n       Seek to ensure that U.S. investors receive treatment as \n     favorable as that accorded to domestic or other foreign \n     investors in Korea and to address unjustified barriers to the \n     establishment and operation of U.S. investments in Korea.\n       Provide procedures to resolve disputes between U.S. \n     investors and the Korean government that are in keeping with \n     the Trade Promotion Authority goals of being expeditious, \n     fair, and transparent.\n     Electronic Commerce\n       Seek to have Korea affirm that it will allow products and \n     services to be delivered electronically and will not \n     unjustifiably discriminate among those products and services.\n       Seek to affirm that Korea does not apply customs duties to \n     digital products that are delivered electronically.\n       Seek to ensure that Korea determines the dutiable value of \n     digital products contained on carrier media based on the \n     value of the media, not their content.\n     Government Procurement\n       Seek to expand on Korea's commitments in the WTO Government \n     Procurement Agreement (GPA), thus providing greater \n     opportunities for U.S. firms to secure construction and \n     supply contracts with the Korean government, particularly by \n     allowing U.S. suppliers to compete for smaller contracts that \n     are not currently open to U.S. bidders or goods.\n     Transparency/Anti-Corruption/Regulatory Reform\n       Seek to make Korea's administration of its trade and \n     investment regime more transparent, and pursue rules that \n     will permit timely and meaningful public comment before Korea \n     adopts trade- and investment-related measures.\n       Seek to eliminate Korean government regulation or other \n     measures that discriminate against or deny full market access \n     for U.S. exporters or investors.\n       Seek to ensure that Korea applies high standards \n     prohibiting corrupt practices affecting international trade \n     and investment and enforces such prohibitions.\n     Competition\n       Address anticompetitive business conduct, designated \n     monopolies, state enterprises, and other competition-related \n     issues, as appropriate.\n       Seek provisions that foster cooperation on competition law \n     and policy and that provide for consultations on specific \n     competition issues that may arise.\n     Trade Remedies\n       Provide a safeguard mechanism during the transition period \n     to allow a temporary revocation of tariff preferences if \n     increased imports from Korea are a substantial cause of\n\n[[Page S505]]\n\n     serious injury or threat of serious injury to the domestic \n     industry.\n       Make no changes to U.S. antidumping and countervailing duty \n     laws.\n     Environment\n       Seek to promote trade and environment policies that are \n     mutually supportive.\n       Seek an appropriate commitment by Korea to effectively \n     enforce its environmental laws.\n       Establish that Korea will strive to ensure that it will \n     not, as an encouragement for trade or investment, weaken or \n     reduce the protections provided for in its environmental \n     laws.\n       Seek to develop ways to work with Korea, including through \n     consultative mechanisms, to promote sustainable development \n     and address environmental issues of mutual interest.\n     Labor\n       Seek an appropriate commitment by Korea to effectively \n     enforce its labor laws.\n       Establish that Korea will strive to ensure that it will \n     not, as an encouragement for trade or investment, weaken or \n     reduce the protections provided for in its labor laws.\n       Based upon review and analysis of Korea's labor law and \n     practices, establish procedures for consultations and \n     cooperative activities with Korea to strengthen its capacity \n     to promote respect for core labor standards, including \n     compliance with ILO Convention 182 on the worst forms of \n     child labor.\n     State-to-State Dispute Settlement\n       Encourage the early identification and settlement of \n     disputes through consultation.\n       Seek to establish fair, transparent, timely, and effective \n     procedures to settle disputes arising under the agreement.\n       In addition, the FTA with Korea will take into account \n     other legitimate U.S. objectives including, but not limited \n     to, the protection of health, safety, environment, essential \n     security, and consumer interests.\n       We are committed to concluding these negotiations with \n     timely and substantive results for U.S. workers, consumers, \n     businesses, and farmers, and will pursue these specific \n     objectives, keeping in mind the overall and principal U.S. \n     negotiating objectives and priorities that the Congress has \n     identified. We look forward to continuing to work with the \n     Congress as negotiations with Korea begin, and we commit to \n     work with you as we bring them to a successful conclusion.\n           Sincerely,\n     Rob Portman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/02/senate-section/article/S505-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING CORETTA SCOTT KING\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of \nCoretta Scott King and express my condolences on her passing. Mrs. King \ncarried the message of nonviolence and the dream of racial equality \naround our great nation and throughout the world. She led goodwill \nmissions in Africa, Latin America, Europe, and Asia. Mrs. King traveled \nthroughout the world advocating racial justice, religious freedom, and \nhelping those in need.\n  Coretta Scott was born in Marion, AL, on April 27, 1927. In a world \nwhere neither women nor minorities pursued an education, she graduated \nas valedictorian of her high school class and attended Antioch College \nin Yellow Springs, OH. She received a bachelor of arts in music and \neducation and then studied concert singing at the New England \nConservatory of Music in Boston, MA.\n  While in Boston, she met Martin Luther King, Jr., and the two forged \na unique relationship that led to the raising of their four children \nand an endeavor to find racial equality throughout our country. She was \nnot just the wife of one of our great civil rights leaders. She was a \ngreat civil rights leader in her own right. She became the first woman \nto deliver the Class Day address at Harvard, and the first woman to \npreach at a statutory service at St. Paul's Cathedral in London.\n  Just days after the death of Martin Luther King, Jr., Mrs. King \ncarried out her husband's dream by leading a march on behalf of \nsanitation workers in Memphis, TN. Mrs. King continued to speak \npublicly and write nationally syndicated columns. As founding \npresident, chair, and chief executive officer of the Martin Luther \nKing, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, she dedicated herself to \nproviding local, national, and international programs that have trained \ntens of thousands of people in Dr. King's philosophy and methods. In \n1983, she led an effort that brought more than a half million \ndemonstrators to Washington, DC, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of \nthe 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, where King delivered \nhis famous ``I Have a Dream'' speech.\n  Mrs. King was also an instrumental part in establishing Dr. King's \nbirthday, January 15, as a national holiday in the United States. By an \nact of Congress, the first national observance of the holiday took \nplace in 1986. Dr. King's birthday is now marked by annual celebrations \nin over 100 countries.\n  Mrs. King has received honorary doctorates from over 60 colleges and \nuniversities and was the author of three books. She served on, or \nhelped create, dozens of organizations, and has met with various heads \nof state to address the issues of racial inequality and fighting \npoverty.\n  As a nation, we owe Mrs. King a debt of gratitude for her strength \nand perseverance throughout her lifelong pursuit of equality for all \nAmericans. She and her husband inspired generations of Americans to \nwork towards freedom and equality. Their legacy will live on and their \nquest for civil rights will never be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/02/senate-section/article/S505-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                  Private First Class Brian J. Schoff\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man who was born \nin Michigan City. Brian Schoff, 22 years old, died on January 29 when a \nroadside bomb exploded near his humvee during a combat operation. With \nhis entire life before him, Brian risked everything to fight for the \nvalues Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the \nworld.\n  Although Brian moved to Tennessee when he was young, his valor over \nthe course of his service in Iraq is proof that he was a Hoosier at \nheart. He joined the Army in 2003, a year after he graduated from high \nschool, because he wanted to serve his country. Brian enjoyed the \nmilitary, but he intended to return to Indiana in May to join his \nfather working at Sullair Corporation. His father described his son to \nlocal media outlets as an adventurous, active person who enjoyed \nhunting, fishing and sports.\n  Brian was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. He was a member of the 101st Airborne Division based at Fort \nCampbell, KY. This brave young soldier leaves behind his father, Brian \nL. Schoff, and his mother, Cathy Odle of Manchester, TN.\n  Today, I join Brian's family and friends in mourning his death. While \nwe struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride \nin the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Brian, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Brian was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, Brian will be remembered by family members, \nfriends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the \nsacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Brian's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of Brian's actions will live on far longer that any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Brian J. Schoff in the \nofficial Record of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and \nfor his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I \nthink about this just cause in which we are engaged, and the \nunfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that \nfamilies like Brian's can find comfort in the words of the prophet \nIsaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord \nGod will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Brian.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/02/senate-section/article/S506-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S506]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S506]]\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress, I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On February 1, 2006, in New Bedford, MA, a man walked into Puzzles \nLounge and asked someone at the bar if it was a gay bar. The man then \nopened fire with a handgun, wounding at least three people. Two of the \nvictims were flown to Boston hospitals for treatment, while the third \nperson was taken to St. Luke's hospital in New Bedford.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate.

That is because while it means faster, \nmore efficient resolution of claims for those harmed by asbestos \nexposure, it also means certainty for manufacturers so that they can \nspend more of their money investing in their businesses and creating \nmore American jobs.\n  Americans injured by asbestos are waiting too long and paying too \nmuch to adjudicate these claims. According to estimates from the RAND \nInstitute, of the $70 billion expended on asbestos litigation through \n2002, nearly 60 percent was spent on attorneys' fees and other \ntransaction costs. Put another way, asbestos victims are only getting a \nlittle more than 40 cents of every dollar that is being paid out on \nasbestos claims. In addition, in many cases, these claimants are \nwaiting more 3 years to collect this compensation as their cases wind \ntheir way through the tort system. As a result, many of these victims \nare not able to cover the costs of medical treatments that cannot be \ndelayed. The FAIR Act will help claimants by capping attorneys' fees at \n5 percent--and thereby putting 95 percent of the compensation paid out \ninto the pockets of the victims. It will also ensure that victims get a \nruling on their claim within 90 to 180 days from the Department of \nLabor--not 3 years or more.\n  Since the 1980s, the number of companies defending themselves from \nasbestos claims has risen from 300 to more than 8,400. More than 70 \ncompanies have gone bankrupt, resulting in more than 60,000 workers \nlosing their jobs and retirees seeing their retirement funds shrink. In \nTennessee, according to the 2002 Economic Census, more than 400,000 \njobs are in the manufacturing sector. Without this bill, tens of \nthousands of those jobs may be shipped overseas as companies struggle \nto afford the enormous payouts that result under the current system.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee has considered this issue for more \nthan 20 years. Senator Specter and Senator Hatch before him held \nnumerous meetings with stakeholders and members of the Judiciary \nCommittee. The bill has gone through numerous revisions to accommodate \nissues raised by parties on all sides. Senator Specter and Senator \nLeahy have been cooperative, accommodating, flexible, and generous with \ntheir time. And they have produced a bill that has garnered support \nfrom a broad spectrum of manufacturers, insurers, and claimants.\n  The FAIR Act may not be perfect, but it will start us on the road \ntoward achieving two critical goals: it allow people injured by \nasbestos to receive compensation quickly and efficiently, without \nspending years tied up in the courts and losing a large chunk of their \naward to attorneys' fees; and it will save jobs by giving American \ncompanies certainty with regard to the costs of compensating claimants.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/02/senate-section/article/S506-3", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S506-S507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ILLEGAL EXPORT OF DANGEROUS FIREARMS TO MEXICO\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, several recent published reports indicate \nthat lax gun safety laws here in the United States may be resulting in \nthe trafficking of thousands of firearms across the border into Mexico \nand contributing to a surge in violence and crime in that country.\n  Many firearms are illegal in Mexico. In fact, there are apparently \nless than 2,500 licensed gun owners in the entire country. This is \nbecause such licenses take a year or more to process, cost nearly \n$2,000, and must be renewed every 2 years. In addition, Mexican \nauthorities say they confiscate more than 250 illegal firearms every \nday from crime suspects. U.S. and Mexican law enforcement officials \nestimate that as much as 95 percent of these guns can be traced back to \nthe United States.\n  Mexican law enforcement officials have made several major illegal \nweapons seizures in the last few months alone. In December, 20 assault \nrifles were seized in Tijuana, just across the border from California. \nIn another seizure, police recovered a cache of weapons that included \nseven assault rifles and several semiautomatic handguns in the Mexican \nborder town of Nuevo Laredo. It also should be noted that in the last \nyear alone more than 100 people were shot to death by suspected drug \ncartel members in Nuevo Laredo. According to Mexican and U.S. \nofficials, these drug smuggling operations are frequently the end users \nof guns illegally trafficked from the United States.\n  Reportedly, weak U.S. gun regulations are being exploited to help arm \ncriminals in Mexico. One way of doing this is through the use of a \n``straw purchaser'' who buys firearms legally in the United States on \nbehalf of a Mexican gun trafficker. In one reported case last year, a \nhandgun recovered in Reynosa, Mexico, was traced back to a Texas man \nwho had reportedly bought more than 150 guns for criminals in Mexico. \nIn another case, more than 80 guns were traced to a Mexican national \nwho apparently paid Texas residents to purchase them for him. According \nto Mexican authorities, guns recovered in Mexico are often traced to \noriginal buyers in Texas, where ``straw purchasers'' can buy guns and \nammunition in unlimited quantities.\n  Law enforcement authorities in Mexico say assault rifles are the most \nsought-after weapons by Mexican criminals. Unfortunately, these \ndangerous weapons are in plentiful supply here in the United States due \nto Congress's failure to reauthorize or strengthen the 1994 Assault \nWeapons Ban. On September 13, 2004, this legislation expired, allowing \n19 previously banned assault weapons, as well as firearms that can \naccept detachable magazines and have more than one of several specific \nmilitary features, such as a folding/telescoping stock, protruding \npistol grip, bayonet mount, threaded muzzle or flash suppressor, barrel \nshroud or grenade launcher to be legally sold again. These dangerous \nweapons are being bought in the United States and trafficked into \nMexico, where they are frequently used in violent crime, conflicts \nbetween rival drug cartels, and shootouts with Mexican law enforcement \nauthorities.\n  Apparently, law enforcement officials are also concerned about the \nprevalence of .50-caliber firearms, which are turning up more \nfrequently in Mexico in recent years. These high-powered weapons fire \nthumb-sized bullets that come in armor-piercing, incendiary, and \nexplosive varieties and can easily punch through aircraft fuselages, \nfuel tanks, and engines. Under current U.S. law, .50-caliber sniper \nrifles can be purchased by private individuals with only minimal \nfederal regulation. In fact, these dangerous weapons are treated the \nsame as other long rifles including shotguns, hunting rifles, and \nsmaller target rifles.\n  I am a cosponsor of the Fifty-Caliber Sniper Weapon Regulation Act \nintroduced by Senator Feinstein. This bill\n\n[[Page S507]]\n\nwould reclassify .50-caliber rifles under the National Firearms Act, \nNFA, treating them the same as other high-powered or especially lethal \nfirearms like machineguns and sawed off shotguns. Among other things, \nreclassification of .50-caliber sniper rifles under the NFA would \nsubject them to new requirements, including registration with federal \nauthorities. These additional requirements would help law enforcement \nofficials identify ``straw purchasers'' and other sources of illegally \ntrafficked .50-caliber rifles recovered in Mexico more easily.\n  The United States has a responsibility to do what it can to help \nprevent the illegal export of dangerous firearms outside of our \nborders. By enacting commonsense legislation, like the Fifty-Caliber \nSniper Weapon Regulation Act and the Assault Weapons Ban, we can \nimprove the security of communities in the United States, as well as \nthose in neighboring countries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/02/senate-section/article/S507-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, last year, I joined with Senators Enzi, \nHagel and Allard to introduce S. 1562, the Safe and Fair Deposit \nInsurance Act of 2005, legislation to overhaul and reform this \ncountry's deposit insurance system. I also wish to thank Senator Ben \nNelson for joining us as a cosponsor.\n  I have been closely tied to deposit insurance reform for many years, \nand I am pleased to see that my strong commitment to this issue will \nresult in the enactment of critical reforms that will provide tangible \nbenefits to financial institutions and their customers. Many of my \ncolleagues on the Banking Committee will recall when I first introduced \nthe Main Street Act back in 2000. We have come a long way since then. \nThe legislation that is now making its way to President Bush's desk is \nthe result of many years of debate and careful deliberation, and has \ngarnered strong bipartisan support along the way.\n  The enactment of this legislation will mark a notable milestone in \nthe history of banking and financial services in this country. Deposit \ninsurance is one of the cornerstones of our country's financial system, \nand it is especially critical to our Nation's smaller financial \ninstitutions and community banks.\n  I am pleased that we are giving the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation and the National Credit Union Administration the requisite \ntools to appropriately operate and manage the newly merged deposit \ninsurance fund and assess premiums based on the risks that institutions \npose to the system. These reforms were long overdue. It is imperative \nthat the framework of deposit insurance that was established to promote \nthe stability and soundness of our banking system not fall victim to \nthe political process or become static but rather be appropriately \nreformed and dynamic enough to keep pace with the evolution of that \nsystem.\n  The key reforms embodied in the legislation will promote depositor \nconfidence by ensuring that depositors' hard-earned money, from the \nfunds that cover daily living expenses to funds they are saving for \nretirement and a rainy day, will continue to be insured against risks \nover which they have no control.\n  By merging the bank insurance fund with the savings association \ninsurance fund, we create a stronger and more diversified fund, and \neliminate the possibility for disparities in premiums between banks and \nthrifts. Implementing a system of risk-based insurance premiums will \nensure that banks pay based on the risk they pose to the system, and \nthe FDIC will be able to price insurance premiums accordingly. By \nincreasing the level of coverage for retirement accounts to $250,000, \nwe are adjusting for the real value of coverage, and will promote \nfinancial stability for individual retirees. In the current \nenvironment, with the uncertainty surrounding Social Security and \npension benefits, it is critical that we provide appropriate coverage \nfor the hard-working Americans who have saved for their retirement and \nlong-term needs.\n  I would again like to recognize the banking community in South Dakota \nfor the invaluable and critical role they have played in this process \nover the past 5 years. I truly appreciate the input and recommendations \nthat I have received from the industry overall. I would also like to \nthank Chairman Shelby, and Ranking Member Sarbanes for their \nleadership, Senators Enzi, Hagel and Allard for the many hours of hard \nwork, and former FDIC Chairman Don Powell for his commitment to deposit \ninsurance reform and tremendous leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/02/senate-section/article/S507-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  RECOGNIZING THE COMMISSION ON INDEPENDENT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES\n\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity \nto recognize a remarkable organization, the Commission on Independent \nColleges and Universities, cIcu, with which I have had the pleasure of \nworking closely in the years since I was elected to the U.S. Senate. I \nam delighted to announce that this year cIcu is celebrating its 50th \nanniversary. In 50 years of service, cIcu has been at the forefront of \nevery major issue facing postsecondary education in New York. With Abe \nLackman's leadership, cIcu has been a powerful champion for college \naccess, helping to increase opportunities for thousands upon thousands \nof New Yorkers.\n  cIcu's more than 100 members--private, nonprofit colleges and \nuniversities in New York--offer an exceptional educational experience, \nwith personalized attention, and world-class faculty. New York is home \nto more of the Nation's top 100 colleges and universities than any \nother State and a leading destination for students attending college \nout of State. Because of the hard work and commitment of the people at \ncIcu and throughout the independent sector, cIcu member campuses have \nbeen pioneers in expanding access to higher education in New York, \nserving more low-income and minority students than many public higher \neducation institutions. New York's independent colleges and \nuniversities are also a robust economic engine, generating innovative \nideas and sustaining thousands of jobs--a fact that Abe would never \nallow me to forget.\n  cIcu schools enroll 452,000 students, including 300,000 New Yorkers, \nemploy 131,000 people with an annual payroll of $6 billion, and \ngenerate $40 billion of annual economic impact. From major research \nuniversities to small faith-based institutions, cIcu's schools are \nshaping the future of individual students' lives and New York's \neconomy. So happy birthday cIcu. May your second 50 years be as \nsuccessful and productive as your first 50.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/02/senate-section/article/S507-3", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S507-S508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IN MEMORY OF WILLIAM MATTHEW BYRNE, JR.\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to offer a few \nwords in observance of the passing of U.S. District Judge William \nMatthew Byrne, Jr., a great legal mind and ambassador of justice who \nnobly served our country for over 30 years on the Federal bench.\n  I extend my deepest sympathy to the family of Judge Byrne, his many \nfriends and colleagues, and the members of the legal community \neverywhere who had come to know his talent and charm. A giant in his \nfield, Judge Byrne tirelessly traveled the globe teaching and promoting \nthe rule of law. His efforts touched countless individuals and left an \nimmeasurable impact on legal systems on an international scale.\n  After honorably serving our Nation in the U.S. Air Force and amassing \nan unparalleled 96 percent conviction record as a U.S. attorney in Los \nAngeles, Judge Byrne was named head of the Commission on Campus Unrest \nby President Nixon. As head of the Commission, Judge Byrne sought to \nbridge the growing cultural divide that had developed as a result of \nthe war in Vietnam.\n  The Commission's report revealed Judge Byrne's unassailable judgment \nand great courage. Bravely stepping into the middle of the fray, he \nfound fault with students and police alike. Judge Byrne's work on the \nCommission played an important role in reuniting the country around our \nshared values. His contribution was recognized in 1971, when he was \nconfirmed to a Federal judgeship at the age of 40, making\n\n[[Page S508]]\n\nhim at that time the youngest man in America's history to rise to this \nprominent position.\n  Although he dealt with many high-profile cases, Judge Byrne was most \nremembered for his courageous handling of the trial of Daniel Ellsberg, \nthe man charged with releasing classified documents in the infamous \nPentagon Papers case. The Government, he ruled, did not have a case, \nand a mistrial was declared.\n  In a time of rampant government scandal and deep-seated corruption at \nthe highest levels of power, Judge Byrne courageously stood up for his \nconvictions, sending the powerful message that nobody was above the \nlaw.\n  ``The totality of the circumstances in this case,'' Judge Byrne \nruled, ``offend a sense of justice.'' It is for this sense of justice \nthat Judge Byrne will always be remembered.\n  Throughout his long and remarkable career, Judge Byrne distinguished \nhimself as a man of sound jurisprudence, honor, and integrity. His \nlasting legacy of sensible legal adjudication serves as an inspiration \nto all Americans.\n  Once again, my heart goes out to Judge Byrne's family and all those \nwho knew him.\n  He will truly be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/02/senate-section/article/S508-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE RETIREMENT OF TOM CAMPBELL\n\n Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the life work \nof Mr. Tom Campbell as he retires from Dow Agrosciences after more than \n40 years of dedicated service. Tom will leave a legacy of leadership \nand a belief in the unlimited potential of American agriculture.\n  Mr. Campbell joined the Dow Chemical Company agriculture division in \n1965 as a field representative servicing corn and soybean producers in \nIllinois and Missouri. From there, he transferred to Louisiana to work \nwith producers of sugar cane, rice, soybeans, sweet potatoes, cotton, \nstrawberries, timber, and livestock. He moved to Hawaii in 1973 as \nmanager for the company's Hawaii operations where he worked with sugar \ncane, pineapple, and fresh fruit producers as well as customers of \nproduct groups Dow served. In 1975, Mr. Campbell was moved to Midland, \nMI, to manage the market introduction of a new insecticide into the \ncotton and corn markets in North America. Transferring to Dallas, TX, \nhe then managed product sales for Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Montana, \nNorth and South Dakota, Wyoming, and Colorado. He then returned to \nMichigan to manage the marketing of agricultural products serving the \nrangeland and industrial vegetation markets of North America.\n  In 1989, he became the Federal Government Affairs manager, based in \nWashington, DC. In this capacity, Mr. Campbell has been responsible for \nFederal legislative activities, interfacing with governmental agencies \non regulatory matters, continued involvement and cooperation with \ndomestic trade associations, and support to business development in \nother countries. Mr. Campbell held this position until his retirement \non December 31, 2005.\n  On the home front, Tom and his wife Lynda have raised two sons, been \nmembers of the St. John's Episcopal Church of McLean, VA, and are \nactive in numerous community groups and boards, from the Langley High \nSchool Boosters Club to their local homeowners association.\n  In this business, there are people who tell you what you want to hear \nand people who tell you what you need to hear. Tom Campbell has always \nbeen someone who tells me and other Members of Congress what we need to \nhear, and I thank him for that.\n  The reason that I mention all these things, the reason that Mr. \nCampbell has had such a long and rich career, of course can be traced \nback to his roots on a wheat and cattle farm in Mitchell County, KS, \nand the bachelor's degree in animal science he earned at Kansas State \nUniversity. Kansans join me in celebrating the many accomplishments of \nTom Campbell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/02/senate-section/article/S508-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S508-S510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-5520.

A bill to amend title XVIII to reform the Medicare \nprescription drug program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing ``The Medicare Part \nD Reform Act of 2006.'' This bill is necessary to address some of the \nmajor problems in the Medicare prescription drug benefit that took \neffect on January 1 of this year. As we all know, the reaction of our \nseniors has been widespread disappointment, mass confusion and \ndownright anger.\n  Let me describe some of the problems that I am hearing from people in \nMichigan about this new Medicare prescription drug benefit.\n  First, many drug companies have previously issued discount cards and \nare currently providing drugs to low-income people and seniors at a \nnominal or no cost. These are individuals usually at 200 percent of the \nFederal poverty level, which is 19,600 for a single person or $26,400 \nfor a couple, while to qualify for the Medicare low-income subsidy, \ntheir income must be $14,700 for a single person or $19,800 for a \ncouple. Many of these programs are being discontinued, and seniors are \nlosing a vital method of obtaining low cost prescription drugs.\n  Second, prescription drug plans can drop a drug from its list of \ncovered drugs with 60 days notice at any time during the calendar year. \nThis is particularly egregious for a senior who relied on a particular \nmedication being available and covered when the senior chose that \nparticular plan.\n  Third, the situation of so-called ``dual eligibles'' is clearly worse \nnow than before enactment of the prescription drug benefit. These are \nformer Medicaid beneficiaries who are being forced into Medicare \nprescription drug coverage, often putting them in plans with more \nrestrictive formularies and higher co-payments, in other words leaving \nthem worse off.\n  Fourth, many Michigan residents are retirees from good paying jobs \nand currently have a good prescription drug plan. This has changed for \nthe worse with the creation of the new Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit because many companies have decided to scale back or eliminate \nthat retiree coverage. As a result, many of those retirees are worse \noff than they were before the bill became law.\n  Fifth, Medicare is specifically barred from negotiating lower drug \nprices for all of its beneficiaries.\n  Finally, the coverage gap from $2,250-$3,600 in prescription drug \nexpenses per year, commonly referred to as the ``doughnut hole,'' is \nunconscionable. Many seniors do not yet understand that this huge \ncoverage gap is looming in their future and that during this gap, they \nare still expected to pay their monthly premiums, although they are \ngetting no prescription drug coverage assistance.\n  To address many of these concerns I, along with my colleague Senator \nStabenow, today am introducing the Medicare Part D Reform Act of 2006, \nand I hope the Senate will immediately consider these positive reforms. \nMy legislation has four goals and I will briefly outline them.\n  First, this legislation would prohibit prescription drug plans from \nremoving drugs from the plan's list of covered drugs until January 1 of \nthe following year. This will give seniors the opportunity to make an \ninformed decision during open enrollment at the end of each year if one \nplan decides to remove a particular drug from the plan.\n  Second, my legislation clearly states that the discount cards that \npharmaceutical companies are providing to our lower income seniors are \npermissible and that seniors should be allowed to participate in these \nprograms. There has been some confusion as to whether companies can \nlegally continue these programs and, if companies do continue their \nassistance, questions have arisen as to whether that assistance will \ncount towards the ``true-out-of-pocket'' costs for that beneficiary, \nwhich plunges them into the ``doughnut hole'' when they reach $2,250. \nMy legislation mandates that there will be no negative consequences for \npharmaceutical companies continuing to provide discount cards to our \nlow-income seniors.\n  Third, my legislation would allow former Medicaid beneficiaries now \nreceiving their medications under Medicare to continue to receive their \nprescription drugs even if they cannot meet the worsened co-payment \nrequirements.\n  Lastly, the legislation would specifically give the Federal \nGovernment the authority to negotiate lower prescription drug prices \nfor our seniors. Current Medicare law prohibits the Department of \nHealth and Human Services from negotiating lower prices, as we do for \nveterans in our VA health programs. As a result, Medicare beneficiaries \ndo not have the benefit of the bargaining power of Medicare.\n  All of us are hearing from our constituents that we need to improve \nMedicare Part D. Congress needs to fulfill the promise it made that \nMedicare Part D would lower prescription drug prices, not increase \nthem. This bill will help us begin to keep that promise.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2240\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill for the relief of Carmen Shahrzad Kulcsar; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I offer today private relief \nlegislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Carmen \nShahrzad Kulcsar, a 15-year-old Australian national currently living \nwith her aunt and uncle in San Marcos, CA.\n  I have decided to offer private relief legislation on Carmen's behalf \nbecause I believe that removal from the United States would not only be \ntragically unfair to her, but also to her aunt and uncle who have taken \nCarmen into their home and treated her like a daughter after the tragic \nevents that brought her to America. Furthermore, Carmen's removal could \nput her aunt's, her uncle's, and her own life in grave danger.\n  Carmen's parents separated due to physical abuse, alcohol abuse, and \nallegations of affairs. In 1992, at the young age of two, Carmen \nwitnessed her father shoot her mother point blank range in the head.\n  Her father--David Kulcsar--was convicted of murder and sentenced to \n12 to 16 years in prison. Fortunately for Carmen, her American aunt \nManieh Varner was granted sole guardianship and custody of her niece by \nan Australian court.\n  Carmen entered the United States on a temporary Visitor's Visa and \nhas resided here for the past 13 years with her aunt and uncle.\n  Carmen is a model student at her high school. She takes honor classes \nand has worked hard to earn a cumulative grade point average of 3.5. \nHer report card has multiple comments regarding her outstanding \ncitizenship and as being a pleasure to have in class.\n  Carmen is a member of the competitive Academic Decathlon Team. Her \nfuture can be a bright one and it is unlikely that she will become a \nburden on the State or Federal Government.\n  Carmen's aunt has always wanted to adopt her niece and begin the path \nto legal residency. However, there has always been one problem. \nCarmen's father never wanted Carmen to go with her aunt and made \nrepeated threats for revenge against Mrs. Varner. Adopting Carmen \nrequires notifying Mr. Kulcsar about the adoption and Mrs. Varner \nbelieved always, as she does now, that doing so would put her and \nCarmen's life in risk.\n  Mrs. Varner cannot pursue adoption now because time constraints \nprevent the process from being completed before Carmen's 16th birthday; \nthus, adoption would have no bearing for immigration purposes.\n  Mr. and Mrs. Varner have done their best to try and create a life for \nCarmen that would otherwise have been impossible for her in Australia.\n  Both U.S. citizens, Mr. Varner is a high school teacher while Mrs. \nVarner is employed by the State of California's Department of \nTransportation. Along with a daughter of their own, they have made the \nbest possible situation of a horrible tragedy.\n  Unfortunately, if this private relief bill is not approved, the \nchoices available to Carmen are grim. Clearly it would be impossible \nfor her to go back to Australia.\n  The only memory she has of that country is the memory of her mother's \nmurder at the hands of her father. The only family in Australia is that \nof her unstable, recently released from prison father. She would be \nforced to live illegally in the United States through no fault of her \nown. America is the only land she has ever known. It is her home.\n  Given these extraordinary and unique facts, I offer this private \nrelief bill on behalf of Carmen Shahrzad Kulcsar. We have the \nopportunity to make a just and fitting solution for this wonderful \nfamily. Therefore, I ask my colleagues to support this private relief \nbill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2241\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENCE.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law or any order, \n     for purposes of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1101 et seq.), Carmen Shahrzad Kulcsar shall be deemed to \n     have been lawfully admitted to the United States for \n     permanent residence as of the date of enactment of this Act \n     upon the payment of the required visa fees.\n\n     SEC. 2. REDUCTION OF NUMBER OF AVAILABLE VISAS.\n\n       Upon the granting of permanent residence to Carmen Shahrzad \n     Kulcsar under section 1, the Secretary of State shall \n     instruct the proper officer to reduce by 1 the total number \n     of immigrant visas available during the current fiscal year \n     to natives of the country of the alien's birth under section \n     203(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1153(a)).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MENENDEZ:\n  S. 2243. A bill to make college more affordable by expanding and \nenhancing financial aid options for students and their families and \nproviding loan forgiveness opportunities for public service employees, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 2244. A bill to provide funding and incentives for caregiver \nsupport and long-term care assistance; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce The Caregiver \nAssistance and Relief Effort, CARE, Act and the College Access and \nAffordability Act because far too many families today are squeezed by \nthe demands of caring for aging loved ones while working to give their \nchildren what all parents want for their kids--the opportunity to go to \ncollege and be successful. As a son helping to care for a mother with \nAlzheimer's disease and the proud parent of two college-age kids, I \nknow personally the intergenerational demands families are facing and \nthe sacrifices they are making to care for their loved ones. That's \nexactly why my first legislative initiatives in the United States \nSenate are to make higher education and long-term care more affordable \nand more accessible for New Jersey families and families across the \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S514]]\n\n  The CARE Act would provide tax credits to those caring for ailing \nfamily members and loved ones, and encourage individuals to plan and \ninvest in their own long-term care by offering a tax deduction for \nlong-term care insurance. In addition, it would double the funding for \nthe existing National Family Caregiver Support Program, which supports \na wide range of important services for older persons.\n  There are an estimated 44.4 million caregivers in the U.S., which is \n21 percent of the adult population. My home State of New Jersey has \nover 830,000 caregivers, ranking it 9th in the country.\n  Caregiving families face unique strains. They are challenged with \nadditional costs, and often caregivers must sacrifice their job or cut \nback on their hours at work. Almost 6 in 10 caregivers either work or \nhave worked while providing care, and 62 percent of caregivers report \nhaving had to make work-related adjustments ranging from going in late \nand leaving early to having to give up work entirely. Caregivers are \nalso a valuable asset to keeping health care costs down. They are \nproviding $257 billion in care annually, more than double the annual \nspending on home care and nursing home care combined. Their compassion, \ndedication, and selflessness come at a price to their families and are \na benefit to the greater good of our State and Nation. This legislation \nis aimed at addressing their hard work, sacrifice, and contributions to \nsociety.\n  The other bill I'm introducing today, the College Access and \nAffordability Act, will help open the doors to higher education for \nmore young people by making financial assistance more flexible for \nstudents and by expanding and enhancing existing financial aid options.\n  I know the difference a college education can have on a young \nperson's life. As the first in my family to go to college, and later \nlaw school, I had opportunities that would not have been available to \nme had I not been able to go to college. But financing a higher \neducation was not an easy thing for my family. Federal financial aid \nhelped ensure that I could go to college and that I could pursue my \ndreams. I know first-hand the important benefits of receiving Federal \naid--not only did it help me finance my dreams of college, but it also \ngave me the extra confidence that I needed to succeed.\n  So, I am committed to ensuring that other promising young people get \nthe same chance that I did and that we, as a Nation, will be there to \nhelp everyone in this country achieve their dreams of college, \nregardless of background, race, language, or income level. One of the \ngreat foundations of this country is that the doors of opportunity are \nopen to anyone who works hard. We must follow through on that promise \nby providing a path for young people to have access to and attend \ncollege. If we do not lead the way to ensure that our colleges are full \nof the brightest minds and fullest potential, we are failing to prepare \nour future generations and we are jeopardizing the future of our \nNation.\n  The College Access and Affordability Act will make financial aid more \nflexible and accessible to more students, such as extending Pell Grant \neligibility to students who attend school year-round. It will also make \nsubstantial changes to the Hope Scholarship Tax Credit, a useful tool \nin helping cover the costs of a higher education. Since the Credit was \nenacted in 1997, the maximum credit has not increased to reflect the \nrising cost of tuition. This bill would raise the award by $1,000 and \nallow the credit to be claimed for all 4 years of college, instead of \nthe current 2 years. It will also make more families eligible for the \ncredit by expanding the eligibility limits.\n  Finally, in recognizing that many of our communities are in need of \nqualified individuals to serve in essential public service positions, \nthis bill would help attract dedicated college graduates who serve low-\nincome communities in positions such as science, math, bilingual, or \nspecial education teachers; nurses; first responders; and child welfare \nworkers.\n  Too many students do not pursue a college education because they \nthink it is out of their reach. We must commit to providing sensible \ntools and adequate resources so that financing a college education is \nnot more of a burden on families, and achieving the dreams of a higher \neducation is not beyond the reach of our Nation's young people.\n  On any given day, families across New Jersey, and indeed, across this \ncountry, face the daunting challenges of making ends meet--putting food \non the table, clothing their children, and putting a roof over their \nhead. If that weren't enough, add the challenge of trying to pay for \ncollege or care for an aging parent, or in many cases, both, and you \nhave what many times is an insurmountable challenge. But that's exactly \nwhat's happening to more and more people everyday. And the \nintergenerational demands will only increase as the baby boom \ngeneration grows older and our life expectancy increases. We need to \nwork now to address the challenges on both fronts--from providing \naffordable long-term care and encouraging future retirees to plan for \ntheir own long-term care, to ensuring that anyone who is willing to \nwork hard has the opportunity to go to college and succeed. That's what \nthis country is all about, and that's why I've made these initiatives \nmy first priorities in the U.S. Senate. I'm hopeful that we will be \nable to work in a bipartisan fashion to address these important \nchallenges facing American families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/02/senate-section/article/S514-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S514-S515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 365--TO PROVIDE A 60 VOTE POINT OF ORDER AGAINST OUT \n    OF SCOPE MATERIAL IN CONFERENCE REPORTS AND OPEN THE PROCESS OF \n                         EARMARKS IN THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration\n\n                              S.

AVAILABILITY OF CONFERENCE REPORTS ON THE INTERNET.\n\n       Rule XXVIII of all the Standing Rules of the Senate is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n[[Page S515]]\n\n       ``9. It shall not be in order to consider a conference \n     report unless such report is available to all Members and \n     made available to the general public by means of the Internet \n     for at least 24 hours before its consideration.''.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by the senior \nSenator from California, Senator Feinstein, in submitting a bipartisan \nproposal to reform some of the procedures of the Senate that have \ncaused an explosion of anonymous earmarks in conference reports.\n  Our proposal does not bar the long-standing practice of allowing \nMembers to channel resources to communities in their States that need \nFederal resources. However, we attempt to bring a far greater degree of \ntransparency to the process and make it nearly impossible for Members \nto insert items in unamendable conference reports which have not \nundergone thorough scrutiny by either the House or Senate.\n  The proposal we are submitting today would create a point of order \nagainst any item included in a conference report that had not been \nconsidered by either body. This point of order lies against all \nlegislation, not simply appropriations bills. Thus a transportation \nauthorization conference report that includes highway and bridge \nprojects that were not considered by either body would be subject to \nthis point of order, just as an earmark inserted in an appropriations \nconference report would be subject to a point of order. This point of \norder could be waived by 60 votes.\n  Although current Standing Rule 28 allows a point of order against \nitems in conference reports that were not considered by either body, \nthis point of order is almost never used. That is because if the Rule \n28 point of order is sustained, the entire conference report is \nrejected and Senate and House Members must reconstitute a new \nconference where all items in the original bills must be renegotiated.\n  Under our approach, if a point of order against an item in the \nconference report is sustained, the conference report, minus the items \nstruck by the point of order, is returned to the House for its \nconcurrence.\n  Our approach is modeled after the Byrd Rule that applies in the case \nof reconciliation conference reports.\n  I believe that this new point of order will make it far less likely \nthat Members will attempt to insert new items in conference reports \nthat have not been thoroughly aired in debate. However, our resolution \ngoes much further in enhancing the transparency of earmarks, especially \nin appropriations bills.\n  Our resolution requires that any Senator who requests an earmark in \nan appropriations bill must file a copy of the request with the \nSecretary of the Senate, who is then required to publish the earmark \nrequest in the Congressional Record.\n  Moreover, our resolution requires that all earmarks that are included \nin appropriations bills must be specifically identified in the Report, \nalong with the sponsor of the earmark and an explanation of the \nessential government purpose of the earmark. In addition, such reports, \nincluding conference reports, must be made available to all Members, \nand the general public via the Internet, at least 24 hours before \nconsideration of the measure.\n  There is nothing inherently wrong when a Member directs financing for \na key project in his or her state. Sometimes it is necessary to get the \nFederal bureaucracy to focus on the needs of our constituents. However, \nthe process needs far greater transparency, and it is my hope that this \nresolution will resolve some of the problems that have been associated \nwith this process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/02/senate-section/article/S515-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 366--AFFIRMING THE IMPORTANCE OF INCREASED \n  INTERNATIONAL ACTION AND A NATIONAL WEEK OF PRAYER FOR THE UGANDAN \n  VICTIMS OF JOSEPH KONY'S LORD'S RESISTANCE ARMY, AND EXPRESSING THE \nSENSE OF THE SENATE THAT SUDAN, UGANDA, AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY \n BRING JUSTICE AND HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO NORTHERN UGANDA AND THAT \n FEBRUARY 2 THROUGH 9, 2006 SHOULD BE DESIGNATED AS A NATIONAL WEEK OF \n             PRAYER AND REFLECTION FOR THE PEOPLE OF UGANDA\n\n  Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Santorum, Mr. DeMint, Mrs. \nHutchison, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Bond, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Kyl, \nMr. Specter, Mr. Smith, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Allard, Mr. Burns, Mr. \nBunning, Mr. Ensign, Mr. McCain, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Enzi, Mr. \nBennett, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Craig, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Frist, \nMr. Brownback, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \nAkaka, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Carper, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Jeffords, \nMs. Landrieu, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. \nFeingold, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Lautenberg) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

DISCLOSURE OF WHITE HOUSE CONTACTS WITH JACK \n                   ABRAMOFF.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Public confidence in Government has been undermined by \n     widespread reports of public corruption involving Jack \n     Abramoff, including indictments and plea agreements that cite \n     alleged wrongdoing by senior public officials.\n       (2) Public perception of a culture of corruption undermines \n     the people's faith in their Government representatives and \n     our system of Government.\n       (3) Due to the serious nature of Jack Abramoff's crimes and \n     continuing allegations of corruption involving him, public \n     confidence in the Government can be restored only if there is \n     full disclosure of his contacts with the President, White \n     House staff, and senior executive branch officials.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the White House should immediately and publicly disclose \n     each visit and meeting between Jack Abramoff and the \n     President, White House staff, or senior executive branch \n     officials, which should include the date, list of attendees, \n     purpose of the visit or meeting, any documentation associated \n     with the visit or meeting, including any photographs, and any \n     action taken or withheld by the Government as a result of the \n     contact.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2705.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING PROTECTING MIDDLE-\n                   CLASS FAMILIES FROM THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM \n                   TAX.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the alternative minimum tax was originally enacted in \n     1969 as a supplemental tax on wealthy tax evaders, but has \n     evolved into a tax on millions of middle-class working \n     families, particularly families in which both parents work, \n     and families with 2 or more children;\n       (2) by the end of the decade, the alternative minimum tax \n     will ensnare more than 30,000,000 taxpayers, the majority of \n     which will have adjusted gross incomes below $100,000, and \n     the National Taxpayer Advocate has thus identified it as the \n     most serious problem facing individual taxpayers;\n       (3) the alternative minimum tax is often portrayed as a tax \n     that is most problematic for residents of States such as New \n     York, California, Massachusetts, and New Jersey, but the \n     truth is that many other States have a significant percentage \n     of taxpayers affected by the alternative minimum tax, \n     including Oregon, Maryland, Virginia, Minnesota, Ohio, Maine, \n     Georgia, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, so the problem is \n     of national importance;\n       (4) a family with 2 children will become subject to the \n     alternative minimum tax at about $67,500 of income in 2006, \n     and a family with 5 children will start owing the alternative \n     minimum tax at about $54,000 of income, if Congress fails to \n     act;\n\n[[Page S517]]\n\n       (5) the year 2006 is the ``tipping point'' for the \n     alternative minimum tax, as the number of taxpayers affected \n     nationally will explode from 3,600,000 to 19,000,000 if \n     Congress fails to act;\n       (6) in 2004, only 6.2 percent of families earning $100,000 \n     to $200,000 a year were subject to the alternative minimum \n     tax, and that number will explode to nearly 50 percent if \n     Congress fails to act;\n       (7) if alternative minimum tax relief is extended through \n     2006, about two-thirds of the benefits will be realized by \n     families earning under $200,000, with more than half of the \n     total benefits going to families with incomes between \n     $100,000 and $200,000;\n       (8) starting in 2008, the average married couple with 2 \n     children earning $75,000 or more will find that more than \n     half of the tax cuts they have been expecting from the \n     various laws passed since 2001 will be ``taken back'' via the \n     alternative minimum tax; and\n       (9) the temporary relief from the alternative minimum tax \n     (provided in 2001 and extended twice in 2003 and 2004) \n     expired at the end of 2005, but the tax reductions on \n     dividends and capital gains do not expire until the end of \n     2008, making immediate action on those provisions a less \n     urgent matter.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that protecting middle-class families from the alternative \n     minimum tax should be a higher priority for Congress in 2006 \n     than extending a tax cut that does not expire until the end \n     of 2008.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2706.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING DOHA ROUND.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) are \n     currently engaged in a round of trade negotiations known as \n     the Doha Development Agenda (Doha Round).\n       (2) The Doha Round includes negotiations aimed at \n     clarifying and improving disciplines under the Agreement on \n     Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on \n     Tariffs and Trade 1994 (Antidumping Agreement) and the \n     Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (Subsidies \n     Agreement).\n       (3) The WTO Ministerial Declaration adopted on November 14, \n     2001 (WTO Paper No. WT/MIN(01)/DEC/1) specifically provides \n     that the Doha Round negotiations are to preserve the ``basic \n     concepts, principles and effectiveness'' of the Antidumping \n     Agreement and the Subsidies Agreement.\n       (4) In section 2102(b)(14)(A) of the Bipartisan Trade \n     Promotion Authority Act of 2002, the Congress mandated that \n     the principal negotiating objective of the United States with \n     respect to trade remedy laws was to ``preserve the ability of \n     the United States to enforce rigorously its trade laws . . . \n     and avoid agreements that lessen the effectiveness of \n     domestic and international disciplines on unfair trade, \n     especially dumping and subsidies''.\n       (5) The countries that have been the most persistent and \n     egregious violators of international fair trade rules are \n     engaged in an aggressive effort to significantly weaken the \n     disciplines provided in the Antidumping Agreement and the \n     Subsidies Agreement and undermine the ability of the United \n     States to effectively enforce its trade remedy laws.\n       (6) Chronic violators of fair trade disciplines have put \n     forward proposals that would substantially weaken United \n     States trade remedy laws and practices, including mandating \n     that unfair trade orders terminate after a set number of \n     years even if unfair trade and injury are likely to recur, \n     mandating that trade remedy duties reflect less than the full \n     margin of dumping or subsidization, mandating higher de \n     minimis levels of unfair trade, making cumulation of the \n     effects of imports from multiple countries more difficult in \n     unfair trade investigations, outlawing the critical practice \n     of ``zeroing'' in antidumping investigations, mandating the \n     weighing of causes, and mandating other provisions that make \n     it more difficult to prove injury.\n       (7) United States trade remedy laws have already been \n     significantly weakened by numerous unjust and activist WTO \n     dispute settlement decisions which have created new \n     obligations to which the United States never agreed.\n       (8) Trade remedy laws remain a critical resource for \n     American manufacturers, agricultural producers, and \n     aquacultural producers in responding to closed foreign \n     markets, subsidized imports, and other forms of unfair trade, \n     particularly in the context of the challenges currently faced \n     by these vital sectors of the United States economy.\n       (9) The United States had a current account trade deficit \n     of approximately $668,000,000,000 in 2004, including a trade \n     deficit of almost $162,000,000,000 with China alone, as well \n     as a trade deficit of $40,000,000,000 in advanced technology.\n       (10) United States manufacturers have lost over 3,000,000 \n     jobs since June 2000, and United States manufacturing \n     employment is currently at its lowest level since 1950.\n       (11) Many industries critical to United States national \n     security are at severe risk from unfair foreign competition.\n       (12) The Congress strongly believes that the proposals put \n     forward by countries seeking to undermine trade remedy \n     disciplines in the Doha Round would result in serious harm to \n     the United States economy, including significant job losses \n     and trade disadvantages.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States should not be a signatory to any \n     agreement or protocol with respect to the Doha Development \n     Round of the World Trade Organization negotiations, or any \n     other bilateral or multilateral trade negotiations, that--\n       (A) adopts any proposal to lessen the effectiveness of \n     domestic and international disciplines on unfair trade or \n     safeguard provisions, including proposals--\n       (i) mandating that unfair trade orders terminate after a \n     set number of years even if unfair trade and injury are \n     likely to recur;\n       (ii) mandating that trade remedy duties reflect less than \n     the full margin of dumping or subsidization;\n       (iii) mandating higher de minimis levels of unfair trade;\n       (iv) making cumulation of the effects of imports from \n     multiple countries more difficult in unfair trade \n     investigations;\n       (v) outlawing the critical practice of ``zeroing'' in \n     antidumping investigations; or\n       (vi) mandating the weighing of causes or other provisions \n     making it more difficult to prove injury in unfair trade \n     cases; and\n       (B) would lessen in any manner the ability of the United \n     States to enforce rigorously its trade laws,

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON USE OF NO-BID CONTRACTING BY \n                   FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) on September 8, 2005, the Federal Emergency Management \n     Agency announced that it had awarded 4 contracts for \n     emergency housing relief following Hurricane Katrina to The \n     Shaw Group of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Fluor Corporation of \n     Aliso Viejo, California, Bechtel National of San Francisco, \n     California, and CH2M Hill of Denver, Colorado;\n       (2) these contracts were awarded with no competition from \n     other capable firms, and up to $100,000,000 in taxpayer funds \n     were authorized for each of these contracts;\n       (3) in the midst of concerns about abusive and \n     irresponsible spending of taxpayer funds, the Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency pledged to re-bid these \n     noncompetitive contracts, with Acting Under Secretary of \n     Emergency Preparedness and Response, R. David Paulison, \n     stating before the Committee on Homeland Security and \n     Government Affairs of the Senate that ``[a]ll of these no-bid \n     contracts, we are going to go back and re-bid'';\n       (4) the Federal Emergency Management Agency has yet to \n     reopen these 4 contracts to competitive bidding, and declared \n     on November 11, 2005, that these contracts would not be \n     reopened for bidding until February 2006;\n       (5) by February 2006, the majority of the contracts will \n     have been completed and the majority of taxpayer funds will \n     have been spent;\n       (6) large and politically-connected firms continue to \n     benefit from no-bid and limited-competition contracts, and \n     contracts are not being awarded to capable, local companies;\n       (7) according to an analysis in the Washington Post, \n     companies outside the States most affected by Hurricane \n     Katrina have received more than 90 percent of the Federal \n     contracts for recovery and reconstruction;\n       (8) the monitoring of Federal contracting practices remains \n     difficult, with a report by the San Jose Mercury News stating \n     ``The database of contracts is incomplete. Information \n     released by Federal agencies is spotty and sporadic. And \n     disclosure of many no-bid contracts isn't required by law''; \n     and\n       (9)(A) there is currently no Chief Financial Officer \n     charged with monitoring the flow of all funds to the affected \n     areas; and\n       (B) the task of financial management is spread across \n     disparate Federal departments and agencies with inadequate \n     oversight of taxpayer funds.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Federal Emergency Management Agency should--\n       (1) immediately rebid noncompetitive contracts entered into \n     following Hurricane Katrina, consistent with the commitment \n     of the Agency made on October 6, 2005, before millions of \n     taxpayer dollars are wasted on irresponsible and inefficient \n     spending;\n       (2)(A) immediately implement the planned competitive \n     contracting strategy of the Agency for recovery work in all \n     current and future reconstruction efforts; and\n       (B) in carrying out that strategy, should prioritize local \n     and small disadvantaged businesses in the contracting and \n     subcontracting process; and\n       (3) immediately after the awarding of a contract, publicly \n     disclose the amount and competitive or noncompetitive nature \n     of the contract.\n\n     SEC. 306. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING DOHA ROUND.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) are \n     currently engaged in a round of trade negotiations known as \n     the Doha Development Agenda (Doha Round).\n       (2) The Doha Round includes negotiations aimed at \n     clarifying and improving disciplines under the Agreement on \n     Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on \n     Tariffs and Trade 1994 (Antidumping Agreement) and the \n     Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (Subsidies \n     Agreement).\n       (3) The WTO Ministerial Declaration adopted on November 14, \n     2001 (WTO Paper No. WT/MIN(01)/DEC/1) specifically provides \n     that the Doha Round negotiations are to preserve the ``basic \n     concepts, principles and effectiveness'' of the Antidumping \n     Agreement and the Subsidies Agreement.\n       (4) In section 2102(b)(14)(A) of the Bipartisan Trade \n     Promotion Authority Act of 2002, the Congress mandated that \n     the principal negotiating objective of the United States with \n     respect to trade remedy laws was to ``preserve the ability of \n     the United States to enforce rigorously its trade laws . . . \n     and avoid agreements that lessen the effectiveness of \n     domestic and international disciplines on unfair trade, \n     especially dumping and subsidies''.\n       (5) The countries that have been the most persistent and \n     egregious violators of international fair trade rules are \n     engaged in an aggressive effort to significantly weaken the \n     disciplines provided in the Antidumping Agreement and the \n     Subsidies Agreement and undermine the ability of the United \n     States to effectively enforce its trade remedy laws.\n       (6) Chronic violators of fair trade disciplines have put \n     forward proposals that would substantially weaken United \n     States trade remedy laws and practices, including mandating \n     that unfair trade orders terminate after a set number of \n     years even if unfair trade and injury are likely to recur, \n     mandating that trade remedy duties reflect less than the full \n     margin of dumping or subsidization, mandating higher de \n     minimis levels of unfair trade, making cumulation of the \n     effects of imports from multiple countries more difficult in \n     unfair trade investigations, outlawing the critical practice \n     of ``zeroing'' in antidumping investigations, mandating the \n     weighing of causes, and mandating other provisions that make \n     it more difficult to prove injury.\n       (7) United States trade remedy laws have already been \n     significantly weakened by numerous unjust and activist WTO \n     dispute settlement decisions which have created new \n     obligations to which the United States never agreed.\n       (8) Trade remedy laws remain a critical resource for \n     American manufacturers, agricultural producers, and \n     aquacultural producers in responding to closed foreign \n     markets, subsidized imports, and other forms of unfair trade, \n     particularly in the context of the challenges currently faced \n     by these vital sectors of the United States economy.\n       (9) The United States had a current account trade deficit \n     of approximately $668,000,000,000 in 2004, including a trade \n     deficit of almost $162,000,000,000 with China alone, as well \n     as a trade deficit of $40,000,000,000 in advanced technology.\n       (10) United States manufacturers have lost over 3,000,000 \n     jobs since June 2000, and United States manufacturing \n     employment is currently at its lowest level since 1950.\n       (11) Many industries critical to United States national \n     security are at severe risk from unfair foreign competition.\n       (12) The Congress strongly believes that the proposals put \n     forward by countries seeking to undermine trade remedy \n     disciplines in the Doha Round would result in serious harm to \n     the United States economy, including significant job losses \n     and trade disadvantages.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States should not be a signatory to any \n     agreement or protocol with respect to the Doha Development \n     Round of the World Trade Organization negotiations, or any \n     other bilateral or multilateral trade negotiations, that--\n       (A) adopts any proposal to lessen the effectiveness of \n     domestic and international disciplines on unfair trade or \n     safeguard provisions, including proposals--\n\n[[Page S595]]\n\n       (i) mandating that unfair trade orders terminate after a \n     set number of years even if unfair trade and injury are \n     likely to recur;\n       (ii) mandating that trade remedy duties reflect less than \n     the full margin of dumping or subsidization;\n       (iii) mandating higher de minimis levels of unfair trade;\n       (iv) making cumulation of the effects of imports from \n     multiple countries more difficult in unfair trade \n     investigations;\n       (v) outlawing the critical practice of ``zeroing'' in \n     antidumping investigations; or\n       (vi) mandating the weighing of causes or other provisions \n     making it more difficult to prove injury in unfair trade \n     cases; and\n       (B) would lessen in any manner the ability of the United \n     States to enforce rigorously its trade laws, including the \n     antidumping, countervailing duty, and safeguard laws;\n       (2) the United States trade laws and international rules \n     appropriately serve the public interest by offsetting \n     injurious unfair trade, and that further ``balancing \n     modifications'' or other similar provisions are unnecessary \n     and would add to the complexity and difficulty of achieving \n     relief against injurious unfair trade practices; and\n       (3) the United States should ensure that any new agreement \n     relating to international disciplines on unfair trade or \n     safeguard provisions fully rectifies and corrects decisions \n     by WTO dispute settlement panels or the Appellate Body that \n     have unjustifiably and negatively impacted, or threaten to \n     negatively impact, United States law or practice, including a \n     law or practice with respect to foreign dumping or \n     subsidization.\n\n     SEC. 307. MODIFICATION OF BOND RULE.\n\n       In the case of bonds issued after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act and before August 31, 2009--\n       (1) the requirement of paragraph (1) of section 648 of the \n     Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (98 Stat. 941) shall be treated \n     as met with respect to the securities or obligations referred \n     to in such section if such securities or obligations are held \n     in a fund the annual distributions from which cannot exceed 7 \n     percent of the average fair market value of the assets held \n     in such fund except to the extent distributions are necessary \n     to pay debt service on the bond issue,\n       (2) paragraph (3) of such section shall be applied by \n     substituting ``distributions from'' for ``the investment \n     earnings of'' both places it appears, and\n       (3) Paragraph (4) of such section shall be applied by \n     substituting ``March 1, 1985'' for ``October 9, 1969''.\n\n     SEC. 308. TREATMENT OF CERTAIN STOCK OPTION PLANS UNDER \n                   NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION RULES.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall modify \n     the regulations under section 409A of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 to extend to applicable foreign option plans the \n     exception under such section for incentive stock options \n     under section 422 of such Code and options granted under an \n     employee stock purchase plan meeting the requirements of \n     section 423 of such Code. Such extension shall be subject to \n     such terms and conditions as may be prescribed in such \n     regulations.\n       (b) Applicable Foreign Option Plans.--For purposes of \n     subsection (a)--\n       (1) In general.--The term ``applicable foreign option \n     plan'' means a plan providing for the issuance of employee \n     stock options--\n       (A) which is established under the laws of a foreign \n     jurisdiction, and\n       (B) which, under such laws or the terms of the plan (or \n     both), is subject to requirements substantially similar to \n     the requirements under section 422 or 423 of such Code.\n       (2) Substantially similar.--A plan shall not be treated as \n     subject to substantially similar requirements under paragraph \n     (1)(B) unless--\n       (A) the plan is required to cover substantially all \n     employees,\n       (B) in the case of an option under an employee stock \n     purchase plan, the plan is required to provide an option \n     price which is not less than the amount specified in section \n     423(b)(6) of such Code, except that such section shall be \n     applied by substituting ``80 percent'' for ``85 percent'' \n     each place it appears,\n       (C) the plan is required to provide coverage of individuals \n     who, but for the exception of the application of section 409A \n     of such Code by reason of this section, would be subject to \n     tax under such section with respect to the plan, and\n       (D) the plan meets such other requirements as the Secretary \n     of the Treasury prescribes in the regulations under \n     subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 309. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE DEDICATION OF \n                   EXCESS FUNDS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that any increases in \n     revenues to the Treasury as a result of this Act and the \n     amendments made by this Act that exceed the amounts specified \n     in the reconciliation instructions shall be dedicated to the \n     Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, in an amount not \n     to exceed the amount which is $2,900,000,000 more than the \n     funding levels established for such Program for fiscal year \n     2005.\n\n     SEC. 310.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON USE OF NO-BID CONTRACTING BY \n                   FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) on September 8, 2005, the Federal Emergency Management \n     Agency announced that it had awarded 4 contracts for \n     emergency housing relief following Hurricane Katrina to The \n     Shaw Group of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Fluor Corporation of \n     Aliso Viejo, California, Bechtel National of San Francisco, \n     California, and CH2M Hill of Denver, Colorado;\n       (2) these contracts were awarded with no competition from \n     other capable firms, and up to $100,000,000 in taxpayer funds \n     were authorized for each of these contracts;\n       (3) in the midst of concerns about abusive and \n     irresponsible spending of taxpayer funds, the Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency pledged to re-bid these \n     noncompetitive contracts, with Acting Under Secretary of \n     Emergency Preparedness and Response, R. David Paulison, \n     stating before the Committee on Homeland Security and \n     Government Affairs of the Senate that ``[a]ll of these no-bid \n     contracts, we are going to go back and re-bid'';\n       (4) the Federal Emergency Management Agency has yet to \n     reopen these 4 contracts to competitive bidding, and declared \n     on November 11, 2005, that these contracts would not be \n     reopened for bidding until February 2006;\n       (5) by February 2006, the majority of the contracts will \n     have been completed and the majority of taxpayer funds will \n     have been spent;\n       (6) large and politically-connected firms continue to \n     benefit from no-bid and limited-competition contracts, and \n     contracts are not being awarded to capable, local companies;\n       (7) according to an analysis in the Washington Post, \n     companies outside the States most affected by Hurricane \n     Katrina have received more than 90 percent of the Federal \n     contracts for recovery and reconstruction;\n       (8) the monitoring of Federal contracting practices remains \n     difficult, with a report by the San Jose Mercury News stating \n     ``The database of contracts is incomplete. Information \n     released by Federal agencies is spotty and sporadic. And \n     disclosure of many no-bid contracts isn't required by law''; \n     and\n       (9)(A) there is currently no Chief Financial Officer \n     charged with monitoring the flow of all funds to the affected \n     areas; and\n       (B) the task of financial management is spread across \n     disparate Federal departments and agencies with inadequate \n     oversight of taxpayer funds.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Federal Emergency Management Agency should--\n       (1) immediately rebid noncompetitive contracts entered into \n     following Hurricane Katrina, consistent with the commitment \n     of the Agency made on October 6, 2005, before millions of \n     taxpayer dollars are wasted on irresponsible and inefficient \n     spending;\n       (2)(A) immediately implement the planned competitive \n     contracting strategy of the Agency for recovery work in all \n     current and future reconstruction efforts; and\n       (B) in carrying out that strategy, should prioritize local \n     and small disadvantaged businesses in the contracting and \n     subcontracting process; and\n       (3) immediately after the awarding of a contract, publicly \n     disclose the amount and competitive or noncompetitive nature \n     of the contract.\n\n     SEC. 306. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING DOHA ROUND.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) are \n     currently engaged in a round of trade negotiations known as \n     the Doha Development Agenda (Doha Round).\n       (2) The Doha Round includes negotiations aimed at \n     clarifying and improving disciplines under the Agreement on \n     Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on \n     Tariffs and Trade 1994 (Antidumping Agreement) and the \n     Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (Subsidies \n     Agreement).\n       (3) The WTO Ministerial Declaration adopted on November 14, \n     2001 (WTO Paper No. WT/MIN(01)/DEC/1) specifically provides \n     that the Doha Round negotiations are to preserve the ``basic \n     concepts, principles and effectiveness'' of the Antidumping \n     Agreement and the Subsidies Agreement.\n       (4) In section 2102(b)(14)(A) of the Bipartisan Trade \n     Promotion Authority Act of 2002, the Congress mandated that \n     the principal negotiating objective of the United States with \n     respect to trade remedy laws was to ``preserve the ability of \n     the United States to enforce rigorously its trade laws . . . \n     and avoid agreements that lessen the effectiveness of \n     domestic and international disciplines on unfair trade, \n     especially dumping and subsidies''.\n       (5) The countries that have been the most persistent and \n     egregious violators of international fair trade rules are \n     engaged in an aggressive effort to significantly weaken the \n     disciplines provided in the Antidumping Agreement and the \n     Subsidies Agreement and undermine the ability of the United \n     States to effectively enforce its trade remedy laws.\n       (6) Chronic violators of fair trade disciplines have put \n     forward proposals that would substantially weaken United \n     States trade remedy laws and practices, including mandating \n     that unfair trade orders terminate after a set number of \n     years even if unfair trade and injury are likely to recur, \n     mandating that trade remedy duties reflect less than the full \n     margin of dumping or subsidization, mandating higher de \n     minimis levels of unfair trade, making cumulation of the \n     effects of imports from multiple countries more difficult in \n     unfair trade investigations, outlawing the critical practice \n     of ``zeroing'' in antidumping investigations, mandating the \n     weighing of causes, and mandating other provisions that make \n     it more difficult to prove injury.\n       (7) United States trade remedy laws have already been \n     significantly weakened by numerous unjust and activist WTO \n     dispute settlement decisions which have created new \n     obligations to which the United States never agreed.\n       (8) Trade remedy laws remain a critical resource for \n     American manufacturers, agricultural producers, and \n     aquacultural producers in responding to closed foreign \n     markets, subsidized imports, and other forms of unfair trade, \n     particularly in the context of the challenges currently faced \n     by these vital sectors of the United States economy.\n       (9) The United States had a current account trade deficit \n     of approximately $668,000,000,000 in 2004, including a trade \n     deficit of almost $162,000,000,000 with China alone, as well \n     as a trade deficit of $40,000,000,000 in advanced technology.\n       (10) United States manufacturers have lost over 3,000,000 \n     jobs since June 2000, and United States manufacturing \n     employment is currently at its lowest level since 1950.\n\n[[Page S631]]\n\n       (11) Many industries critical to United States national \n     security are at severe risk from unfair foreign competition.\n       (12) The Congress strongly believes that the proposals put \n     forward by countries seeking to undermine trade remedy \n     disciplines in the Doha Round would result in serious harm to \n     the United States economy, including significant job losses \n     and trade disadvantages.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States should not be a signatory to any \n     agreement or protocol with respect to the Doha Development \n     Round of the World Trade Organization negotiations, or any \n     other bilateral or multilateral trade negotiations, that--\n       (A) adopts any proposal to lessen the effectiveness of \n     domestic and international disciplines on unfair trade or \n     safeguard provisions, including proposals--\n       (i) mandating that unfair trade orders terminate after a \n     set number of years even if unfair trade and injury are \n     likely to recur;\n       (ii) mandating that trade remedy duties reflect less than \n     the full margin of dumping or subsidization;\n       (iii) mandating higher de minimis levels of unfair trade;\n       (iv) making cumulation of the effects of imports from \n     multiple countries more difficult in unfair trade \n     investigations;\n       (v) outlawing the critical practice of ``zeroing'' in \n     antidumping investigations; or\n       (vi) mandating the weighing of causes or other provisions \n     making it more difficult to prove injury in unfair trade \n     cases; and\n       (B) would lessen in any manner the ability of the United \n     States to enforce rigorously its trade laws, including the \n     antidumping, countervailing duty, and safeguard laws;\n       (2) the United States trade laws and international rules \n     appropriately serve the public interest by offsetting \n     injurious unfair trade, and that further ``balancing \n     modifications'' or other similar provisions are unnecessary \n     and would add to the complexity and difficulty of achieving \n     relief against injurious unfair trade practices; and\n       (3) the United States should ensure that any new agreement \n     relating to international disciplines on unfair trade or \n     safeguard provisions fully rectifies and corrects decisions \n     by WTO dispute settlement panels or the Appellate Body that \n     have unjustifiably and negatively impacted, or threaten to \n     negatively impact, United States law or practice, including a \n     law or practice with respect to foreign dumping or \n     subsidization.\n\n     SEC. 307. MODIFICATION OF BOND RULE.\n\n       In the case of bonds issued after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act and before August 31, 2009--\n       (1) the requirement of paragraph (1) of section 648 of the \n     Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (98 Stat. 941) shall be treated \n     as met with respect to the securities or obligations referred \n     to in such section if such securities or obligations are held \n     in a fund the annual distributions from which cannot exceed 7 \n     percent of the average fair market value of the assets held \n     in such fund except to the extent distributions are necessary \n     to pay debt service on the bond issue,\n       (2) paragraph (3) of such section shall be applied by \n     substituting ``distributions from'' for ``the investment \n     earnings of'' both places it appears, and\n       (3) Paragraph (4) of such section shall be applied by \n     substituting ``March 1, 1985'' for ``October 9, 1969''.\n\n     SEC. 308. TREATMENT OF CERTAIN STOCK OPTION PLANS UNDER \n                   NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION RULES.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall modify \n     the regulations under section 409A of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 to extend to applicable foreign option plans the \n     exception under such section for incentive stock options \n     under section 422 of such Code and options granted under an \n     employee stock purchase plan meeting the requirements of \n     section 423 of such Code. Such extension shall be subject to \n     such terms and conditions as may be prescribed in such \n     regulations.\n       (b) Applicable Foreign Option Plans.--For purposes of \n     subsection (a)--\n       (1) In general.--The term ``applicable foreign option \n     plan'' means a plan providing for the issuance of employee \n     stock options--\n       (A) which is established under the laws of a foreign \n     jurisdiction, and\n       (B) which, under such laws or the terms of the plan (or \n     both), is subject to requirements substantially similar to \n     the requirements under section 422 or 423 of such Code.\n       (2) Substantially similar.--A plan shall not be treated as \n     subject to substantially similar requirements under paragraph \n     (1)(B) unless--\n       (A) the plan is required to cover substantially all \n     employees,\n       (B) in the case of an option under an employee stock \n     purchase plan, the plan is required to provide an option \n     price which is not less than the amount specified in section \n     423(b)(6) of such Code, except that such section shall be \n     applied by substituting ``80 percent'' for ``85 percent'' \n     each place it appears,\n       (C) the plan is required to provide coverage of individuals \n     who, but for the exception of the application of section 409A \n     of such Code by reason of this section, would be subject to \n     tax under such section with respect to the plan, and\n       (D) the plan meets such other requirements as the Secretary \n     of the Treasury prescribes in the regulations under \n     subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 309. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE DEDICATION OF \n                   EXCESS FUNDS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that any increases in \n     revenues to the Treasury as a result of this Act and the \n     amendments made by this Act that exceed the amounts specified \n     in the reconciliation instructions shall be dedicated to the \n     Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, in an amount not \n     to exceed the amount which is $2,900,000,000 more than the \n     funding levels established for such Program for fiscal year \n     2005.\n\n     SEC. 310.

Mr. GRASSLEY submitted an amendment intended to be proposed \nby him to the bill H.R. 4297, to provide for reconciliation pursuant to \nsection 201(b) of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal \nyear 2006; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE MEDICARE PART D \n                   PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) It is not acceptable that startup issues under the new \n     Medicare prescription drug program have resulted in some of \n     our Nation's most vulnerable citizens having difficulties \n     getting their prescription drugs covered under the program, \n     and these issues must be addressed and resolved.\n       (2) The Department of Health and Human Services and the \n     Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services are working \n     tirelessly to address these startup issues and have taken \n     numerous steps to smooth the transition process.\n       (3) All prescription drug plans under part D of title XVIII \n     of the Social Security Act and MA-PD plans under part C of \n     such title (in this section referred to as ``Medicare \n     prescription drug plans'') already have a ``first fill'' \n     policy in place that provides a new enrollee with coverage \n     for prescription drugs during at least the first 30 days of \n     enrollment regardless of whether the particular prescription \n     drug is on the plan's formulary, and the Centers for Medicare \n     & Medicaid Services is enforcing this requirement.\n       (4) Under current law, full-benefit dual eligible \n     individuals (as defined in section 1935(c)(6) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395u-5(c)(6)) are already \n     automatically enrolled into Medicare prescription drug \n     coverage so no change in law is necessary.\n       (5) Medicare prescription drug plans are already \n     responsible for covering the cost of covered prescriptions \n     filled for enrollees, including short term transition \n     prescriptions.\n       (6) Medicare prescription drug plans are already \n     responsible for reimbursing any enrollee, including full-\n     benefit dual eligible individuals, for any out-of-pocket \n     costs incurred by the enrollee that should have been covered \n     by the plan.\n       (7) The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is already \n     reimbursing States for the reasonable administrative costs \n     incurred by States that have temporarily covered some claims \n     for prescription drug coverage during the transition period.\n       (8) Enrollment is exceeding projections, with at least \n     24,000,000 Medicare beneficiaries who now have drug coverage \n     and another 90,000 are enrolling each day in the Medicare \n     prescription drug program;\n       (9) In addition, the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     has taken many other actions to smooth the implementation of \n     the Medicare prescription drug program, including the \n     following:\n       (A) Establishing processes to ensure that full-benefit dual \n     eligible individuals are not overcharged for their \n     prescriptions and to require Medicare prescription drug plans \n     to refund overcharges to such individuals.\n       (B) Establishing a reconciliation process to ensure that \n     Medicare prescription drug plans reimburse pharmacies for \n     costs incurred by pharmacies that are payable by such plans.\n       (C) Conducting extensive and continuing outreach to \n     pharmacies and pharmacy associations on the implementation of \n     the Medicare prescription drug benefit, particularly with \n     respect to full-benefit dual eligible individuals, as well as \n     establishing a special pharmacy telephone help line.\n       (D) Requiring Medicare prescription drug plans to have \n     comprehensive formularies and procedures for enrollees to \n     rapidly secure an exception to the limitation of coverage of \n     a prescription drug when medical necessity is demonstrated.\n       (E) Permitting full-benefit dual eligible individuals to \n     switch Medicare prescription drug plan under the Medicare \n     prescription drug benefit at any time, for any reason, and \n     improving data flows and communication with plans to ensure \n     that plan switches by such individuals become fully effective \n     as quickly as possible.\n       (F) Partnering with national, State, and local groups that \n     work with full-benefit dual eligible individuals to educate \n     such individuals about the Medicare prescription drug \n     program, and assisting in their transition to, and enrollment \n     under, such program.\n\n[[Page S650]]\n\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Secretary of Health and Human Services is making \n     significant progress in smoothing the implementation of the \n     new Medicare prescription drug program, legislation changing \n     the program is not needed at this time, and legislation at \n     this time would also likely complicate implementation of the \n     program and confuse beneficiaries;\n       (2) each of the implementation problems identified under \n     the Medicare prescription drug program will be resolved more \n     quickly through administrative actions, which the Secretary \n     of Health and Human Services already has the authority to \n     take under current law, rather than through Congressional \n     action followed by administrative action;\n       (3) the Senate fully supports the efforts of the Secretary \n     of Health and Human Services, Medicare prescription drug \n     plans, pharmacists, and others to implement the Medicare \n     prescription drug program and to resolve problems that have \n     occurred during the implementation of the program; and\n       (4) the pace of enrollment in the Medicare prescription \n     drug benefit indicates that extending the six-month \n     enrollment period is not warranted and, by contrast, such an \n     action could exacerbate implementation issues under the \n     program.\n

Mr. GRASSLEY proposed an amendment to amendment SA 2707 \nproposed by Mr. Frist (for Mr. Grassley (for himself and Mr. Baucus)) \nto the bill H.R. 4297, to provide for reconciliation pursuant to \nsection 201(b) of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal \nyear 2006; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE MEDICARE PART D \n                   PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) It is not acceptable that startup issues under the new \n     Medicare prescription drug program have resulted in some of \n     our Nation's most vulnerable citizens having difficulties \n     getting their prescription drugs covered under the program, \n     and these issues must be addressed and resolved.\n       (2) The Department of Health and Human Services and the \n     Centers for Medicare &\n\n[[Page S679]]\n\n     Medicaid Services are working tirelessly to address these \n     startup issues and have taken numerous steps to smooth the \n     transition process.\n       (3) All prescription drug plans under part D of title XVIII \n     of the Social Security Act and MA-PD plans under part C of \n     such title (in this section referred to as ``Medicare \n     prescription drug plans'') already have a ``first fill'' \n     policy in place that provides a new enrollee with coverage \n     for prescription drugs during at least the first 30 days of \n     enrollment regardless of whether the particular prescription \n     drug is on the plan's formulary, and the Centers for Medicare \n     & Medicaid Services is enforcing this requirement.\n       (4) Under current law, full-benefit dual eligible \n     individuals (as defined in section 1935(c)(6) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395u-5(c)(6)) are already \n     automatically enrolled into Medicare prescription drug \n     coverage so no change in law is necessary.\n       (5) Medicare prescription drug plans are already \n     responsible for covering the cost of covered prescriptions \n     filled for enrollees, including short term transition \n     prescriptions.\n       (6) Medicare prescription drug plans are already \n     responsible for reimbursing any enrollee, including full-\n     benefit dual eligible individuals, for any out-of-pocket \n     costs incurred by the enrollee that should have been covered \n     by the plan.\n       (7) The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is already \n     reimbursing States for the reasonable administrative costs \n     incurred by States that have temporarily covered some claims \n     for prescription drug coverage during the transition period.\n       (8) Enrollment is exceeding projections, with at least \n     24,000,000 Medicare beneficiaries who now have drug coverage \n     and another 90,000 are enrolling each day in the Medicare \n     prescription drug program;\n       (9) In addition, the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     has taken many other actions to smooth the implementation of \n     the Medicare prescription drug program, including the \n     following:\n       (A) Establishing processes to ensure that full-benefit dual \n     eligible individuals are not overcharged for their \n     prescriptions and to require Medicare prescription drug plans \n     to refund overcharges to such individuals.\n       (B) Establishing a reconciliation process to ensure that \n     Medicare prescription drug plans reimburse pharmacies for \n     costs incurred by pharmacies that are payable by such plans.\n       (C) Conducting extensive and continuing outreach to \n     pharmacies and pharmacy associations on the implementation of \n     the Medicare prescription drug benefit, particularly with \n     respect to full-benefit dual eligible individuals, as well as \n     establishing a special pharmacy telephone help line.\n       (D) Requiring Medicare prescription drug plans to have \n     comprehensive formularies and procedures for enrollees to \n     rapidly secure an exception to the limitation of coverage of \n     a prescription drug when medical necessity is demonstrated.\n       (E) Permitting full-benefit dual eligible individuals to \n     switch Medicare prescription drug plan under the Medicare \n     prescription drug benefit at any time, for any reason, and \n     improving data flows and communication with plans to ensure \n     that plan switches by such individuals become fully effective \n     as quickly as possible.\n       (F) Partnering with national, State, and local groups that \n     work with full-benefit dual eligible individuals to educate \n     such individuals about the Medicare prescription drug \n     program, and assisting in their transition to, and enrollment \n     under, such program.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Secretary of Health and Human Services is making \n     significant progress in smoothing the implementation of the \n     new Medicare prescription drug program, legislation changing \n     the program is not needed at this time, and legislation at \n     this time would also likely complicate implementation of the \n     program and confuse beneficiaries;\n       (2) each of the implementation problems identified under \n     the Medicare prescription drug program will be resolved more \n     quickly through administrative actions, which the Secretary \n     of Health and Human Services already has the authority to \n     take under current law, rather than through Congressional \n     action followed by administrative action;\n       (3) the Senate fully supports the efforts of the Secretary \n     of Health and Human Services, Medicare prescription drug \n     plans, pharmacists, and others to implement the Medicare \n     prescription drug program and to resolve problems that have \n     occurred during the implementation of the program; and\n       (4) the pace of enrollment in the Medicare prescription \n     drug benefit indicates that extending the six-month \n     enrollment period is not warranted at this time, and, by \n     contrast, such an action could exacerbate implementation \n     issues under the program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2732.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 366, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 366) affirming the importance of \n     increased international action and a national week of prayer \n     for the Ugandan victims of Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance \n     Army, and expressing the sense of the Senate that Sudan, \n     Uganda, and the international community bring justice and \n     humanitarian assistance to Northern Uganda and that February \n     2 through 9, 2006 should be designated as a national week of \n     prayer and reflection for the people of Uganda.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I want to speak about a matter of urgency \nand extreme concern to me that is going on right now in Uganda.\n  As my colleagues may know, I have spent much time in Africa, \nparticularly in Uganda, talking with President Museveni.\n  The major issue that he and I discussed is the ongoing terrorist \ntragedy in his country. The Lord's Resistance Army, LRA, is a rebel \nparamilitary group formed in 1987 operating mainly in northern Uganda \nand southern Sudan. The group is engaged in an armed rebellion against \nthe Ugandan\n\n[[Page S693]]\n\nGovernment in what is now one of Africa's longest-running conflicts.\n  It is led by a man named Joseph Kony who claims to be a spiritual \nmedium and uses his influence to kidnap and murder thousands of \ninnocent civilians, most of them children. Because of this twisted man \nand his army, the region has become one of the darkest spots of human \natrocities worldwide.\n  Between 20,000 and 50,000 children have been kidnapped by the LRA for \nuse as soldiers and sex slaves.\n  More than 1.6 million people have been forced to flee their homes, \nliving in Internally Displaced People, IDP, camps. Every week 1,000 \npeople die in the camps from the appalling conditions.\n  Though the Internally Displaced People camps were meant to provide \nsecurity against the LRA attacks, they are now where most abductions \ntake place.\n  It is estimated 40,000 children flee every night to bigger towns, \nseeking the safety in numbers, sleeping on street corners and in other \npublic spaces. I recently saw a documentary on this titled ``Invisible \nChildren.''\n  Up to 200,000 people have been killed in the violence, with many more \ndying from disease and malnutrition as a direct result of the conflict.\n  The conflict continues to retard Uganda's development efforts, \ncosting the poor country's economy a cumulative total of at least $1.33 \nbillion, which is equivalent to 3 percent of Uganda's GDP.\n  Last night, in his State of the Union address, President Bush \ndeclared we must, ``take the offensive by encouraging economic \nprogress, and fighting disease, and spreading hope in hopeless lands.'' \nHe is absolutely right. We can no longer allow these atrocities in \nUganda to go unnoticed and unaddressed; we must become more involved.\n  To that end I am supporting a resolution, S. Res. 366.\n  Further, I will include for the Record a letter to Secretary of State \nRice signed by 34 organizations. This letter urges high-level attention \nto the situation in northern Uganda.\n  I will also include the text of United Nations Security Council, \nUNSC, Resolution 1653 dated January 27, 2006. This resolution \n``strongly condemns'' the activities of the Lord's Resistance Army. The \nResolution also reiterates the Security Council's demand ``that all \nsuch armed groups lay down their arms and engage voluntarily and \nwithout any delay or preconditions in their disarmament and in their \nrepatriation and resettlement.''\n  UNSC Resolution 1653 ``[r]equests the Secretary-General to make \nrecommendations to the Council, as appropriate, on how best to support \nefforts by States in the region to put an end to the activities of \nillegal armed groups, and to recommend how United Nations agencies and \nmissions--the United Nations Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS), MONUC and \nONUB--can help, including through further support for the efforts of \nthe governments concerned to ensure protection of, and humanitarian \nassistance to, civilians in need.''\n  These words are long overdue, and are only the beginning. Thus far \nthe action of the United Nations has been woefully inadequate. Words \nare not nearly enough. We need more action from the UN. If the United \nNations is to be useful for the peoples of the world, this sort of \nproblem is its highest and best use.\n  As for the role of the United States, I suggest that Secretary Rice \nand Permanent Representative Bolton actively engage in drafting the \naforementioned recommendations to the Security Council.\n  I also strongly suggest to President Bush and our administration that \nthey examine every aspect of his executive authority to relieve this \nsuffering, including the new authorities Congress provided under \nSection 1206 of Public Law 109-163, the train-and-equip legislation.\n  I believe these will be significant steps toward shedding light into \nthe darkness that has cloaked the ongoing Ugandan tragedy, ending the \nconflict, and drawing the region into a positive future. I ask members \nfor their support and thank the dozens of Senators who have joined me \nas cosponsors of this bipartisan resolution.\n  Let us pray for a cessation of the horrors and evils in Uganda and \nthe Sudan.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the above-referenced documents in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                 January 30, 2006.\n     Re Crisis in Northern Uganda\n\n     Dr. Condoleezza Rice,\n     Secretary of State, Department of State,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Rice: We, the undersigned organizations call \n     on the U.S. government to dedicate high-level attention to \n     the situation in northern Uganda in order to help bring an \n     end to the intractable conflict and catastrophic humanitarian \n     conditions.\n       As you know, for the past 20 years, the people of northern \n     Ugandan have endured a conflict involving the rebel Lord's \n     Resistance Army (LRA) and the Government of Uganda. More than \n     1.7 million people--eighty percent of the population--are \n     displaced and forced to live in squalid internally displaced \n     persons (IDP) camps. These camps remain largely unprotected \n     and vulnerable to LRA attacks and abductions. The LRA has \n     kidnapped more than 30,000 children from their homes--holding \n     them hostage as soldiers, sex slaves, and bondservants. An \n     estimated 35,000 children commute nightly to sleep in town \n     centers in order to avoid violence and abduction. \n     Nonetheless, these children, known as ``night commuters'', \n     remain vulnerable to exploitation and sexual and physical \n     abuse.\n       This deplorable humanitarian and human rights situation is \n     the result of an ongoing conflict that continues to be a \n     cause of instability in southern Sudan and, now, the broader \n     Great Lakes. Threats to regional security are growing: the \n     LRA has expanded its area of operation deeper into southern \n     Sudan and, for the first time, into the Democratic Republic \n     of the Congo (DRC). LRA attacks against southern Sudanese \n     civilians threaten implementation of the Comprehensive Peace \n     Agreement (CPA), and recent LRA incursions into the DRC have \n     heightened existing tensions between the Ugandan and \n     Congolese governments. Within this context of increasing \n     regional instability, multiple actors regrettably continue to \n     provide covert support to the LRA.\n       Establishing a secure environment requires urgent \n     leadership from the U.S. Government to put in place a \n     comprehensive regional approach that addresses LRA cross-\n     border movements and prioritizes a resolution to the \n     conflict, while simultaneously ensuring civilian protection, \n     humanitarian access, and the reintegration of former \n     combatants. To reduce civilian suffering, help consolidate \n     peace in Sudan, and prevent further destabilization of the \n     region, our organizations recommend the following actions:\n\n                 United Nations Security Council Action\n\n       The continued presence of the Lord's Resistance Army in \n     southern Sudan and its recent expansion into the DRC \n     underscores the urgency for United Nations Security Council \n     (UNSC) engagement. Under Secretary-General Jan Egeland's \n     December 19, 2005 briefing on the humanitarian situation and \n     the passage of UNSC Res. 1653 are welcome first steps towards \n     engaging the Security Council on this issue, but greater \n     action is required. We urge the US to take a leadership role \n     at the United Nations to place northern Uganda on the UNSC \n     agenda. The February 2006 US presidency of the UNSC would be \n     an opportune time to galvanize action on this important \n     issue. Specifically, the UN should do the following:\n       Continued encouragement and support for a regional solution \n     to disarming groups within eastern DRC, Uganda, and southern \n     Sudan. With the UNMIS mandate up for renewal in March, the \n     United States should call on all relevant actors to \n     accelerate the deployment of UNMIS and ensure that threats to \n     civilians and disruption of humanitarian aid addresses the \n     destabilizing presence of the LRA. Continued consideration \n     should be given to the recommendations of the regional \n     Tripartite Commission on Disarming groups in eastern DRC.\n       Appoint a Special UN Envoy for Northern Uganda who will \n     work collaboratively with all local, regional, and \n     international stakeholders to help mediate between all \n     parties to end the conflict.\n       Create a panel of experts to investigate and monitor the \n     activities of the LRA, as well as the networks supporting the \n     LRA, and its impact on regional peace and security.\n       Call on all parties to declare an immediate ceasefire; \n     encourage greater international diplomatic and financial \n     support for on-going mediation efforts, while ensuring a \n     coordinated response to LRA activity in the area.\n       Call on the government of Uganda, in accordance with its \n     national IDP policy, to adopt a security strategy that \n     focuses on protection rather than confrontation, prioritizes \n     civilian and aid convoy protection, and holds protection \n     personnel accountable for crimes they commit.\n\n                   Direct U.S. Support for Mediation\n\n       After 20 years of conflict, military victory is unlikely. \n     Recent overtures made by the LRA leadership to negotiate are \n     promising and greater international political pressure on all \n     parties is needed to explore a peaceful solution. \n     Approximately ninety percent of the LRA is comprised of \n     children; further military aggression against the LRA only \n     serves to inflict more violence upon these\n\n[[Page S694]]\n\n     children. Former Ugandan Government Minister Betty Bigombe's \n     mediation efforts deserve greater U.S. support. Accordingly, \n     we strongly recommend that the State Department appoint a \n     senior level advisor to coordinate efforts within the U.S. \n     government, among the donors, and ensure that greater \n     resources and material support are available for Bigombe as a \n     negotiation strategy is developed.\n\n           Protection for Civilians and Humanitarian Workers\n\n       Efforts to protect civilians have languished and high-level \n     involvement by the international community is needed. Eighty \n     percent of the population is displaced and primarily \n     dependent on limited international food assistance and \n     services. The delegation of civilian protection and \n     humanitarian worker security to local defense units (LDUs) \n     both hinders humanitarian access and leaves IDPs vulnerable \n     to LRA attacks. For example, at times LDU personnel have been \n     inebriated while escorting humanitarian agencies, or \n     sometimes have refused to provide escort unless provided with \n     food. This gap in protection significantly hinders relief \n     efforts and the population's ability to access employment, \n     basic healthcare and education. Through US leadership, donor \n     governments must work with the Ugandan government to devise a \n     security strategy that prioritizes civilian protection \n     instead of confrontational operations. This strategy must \n     expand the area of protection around IDP camps to allow for \n     greater civilian movement, so that the displaced can gain \n     access to basic services and income generating opportunities.\n\n     Disarmament, Demobilization & Reintegration (DDR) Enhancement\n\n       In coordination with the government of Uganda, donors must \n     develop and enact a comprehensive plan to draw LRA fighters \n     out of this conflict and back into the community. Donors must \n     provide adequate funding for DDR, including support for \n     communities and children abducted by the LRA.\n       To conclude, we firmly believe that high-level engagement \n     and sustained leadership by the United States will help bring \n     an end to this conflict, which traps millions of children and \n     families in despair and threatens ongoing peaceful \n     transitions in Sudan and the DRC. We look forward to hearing \n     from you about the Administration's plans to address this \n     conflict.\n       Sincerely,\n         Africa Action, Africa Faith and Justice Network, \n

(2006)--Adopted by the United Nations Security Council \n               at Its 5359th Meeting, on 27 January 2006\n\n       The Security Council, Recalling its resolutions and the \n     statements by its President on the Great Lakes region of \n     Africa and concerning the situation in the Democratic \n     Republic of the Congo and in Burundi, and in particular \n     resolutions 1649 and 1650 of 21 December 2005,\n       Recalling its resolution 1625 (2005) on strengthening the \n     effectiveness of the Security Council and the role of civil \n     society in the prevention and resolution of armed conflict, \n     particularly in Africa,\n       Further recalling its resolution 1631 (2005) on cooperation \n     between the United Nations and regional organizations and \n     General Assembly resolution 59/213 (2004) on cooperation \n     between the United Nations and the African Union,\n       Reaffirming its respect for the sovereignty, territorial \n     integrity, unity and political independence of all States in \n     the region, and recalling the importance of the principles of \n     good-neighbourliness, non-interference and cooperation in the \n     relations among States in the region,\n       Reiterating its condemnation of the genocide in Rwanda of \n     1994 and the armed conflicts which have plagued the Great \n     Lakes region of Africa in the past decade and expressing its \n     profound concern at the violations of human rights and \n     international humanitarian law resulting in wide scale loss \n     of life, human suffering and destruction of property,\n       Aware that the link between the illegal exploitation of \n     natural resources, the illicit trade in those resources and \n     the proliferation and trafficking of arms is one of the \n     factors fuelling and exacerbating conflicts in the Great \n     Lakes region of Africa, and especially in the Democratic \n     Republic of the Congo,\n       Expressing its deep concern at the devastating impact of \n     conflict and insecurity on the humanitarian situation \n     throughout the Great Lakes region and their implications for \n     regional peace and security, especially where arms and armed \n     groups move across borders, such as the long-running and \n     brutal insurgency by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in \n     northern Uganda which has caused the death, abduction and \n     displacement of thousands of innocent civilians in Uganda, \n     the Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\n       Welcoming the efforts undertaken by the Tripartite Plus \n     Joint Commission comprising Burundi, the Democratic Republic \n     of the Congo, Rwanda and Uganda as a significant contribution \n     to heightened dialogue between the countries of the Great \n     Lakes,\n       Recalling its previous resolutions that reaffirmed the \n     importance of holding an international conference on peace, \n     security and stability in the Great Lakes region and \n     recognizing the continued ownership of the process by the \n     countries of the region with the facilitation of the United \n     Nations, the African Union, the Group of Friends and all \n     others concerned,\n       Taking note with satisfaction of the holding of the First \n     International Conference on Peace, Security, Democracy and \n     Development in the Great Lakes Region, in Dar es Salaam, on \n     19 and 20 November 2004,\n       Recognizing the ``Good Neighbourly Declaration'' of \n     September 2003 by the representatives of Burundi, the \n     Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Uganda and the \n     Dar es Salaam Declaration of 2004 adopted by the first Summit \n     of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region,\n       Recognizing the significant achievements and progress in \n     the peace processes in the Great Lakes region, the recent \n     installation of a democratically elected government in \n     Burundi and progress in the transition to democratic \n     institutions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\n       Expressing its gratitude to the United Nations Organization \n     Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) and \n     to the United Nations Operation in Burundi (ONUB) for their \n     significant contribution to peace in the region,\n       Paying tribute to the donor community for the assistance it \n     is providing to the countries in the region, and encouraging \n     it to maintain that assistance,\n       Welcoming General Assembly resolution 60/1 on the 2005 \n     World Summit Outcome and in particular the commitment to \n     address the special needs of Africa,\n       1. Commends the positive role played by the Secretary-\n     General, the African Union, the Group of Friends of the Great \n     Lakes region and other stakeholders in organizing and \n     participating in the First Summit of the International \n     Conference on Peace, Security, Democracy and Development in \n     the Great Lakes Region of Africa;\n       2. Urges the countries of the Great Lakes region to \n     continue in their collective efforts to develop a subregional \n     approach for promoting good relations, peaceful coexistence, \n     peaceful resolution of disputes as envisaged in the Dar es \n     Salaam Declaration and encourages them, in partnership with \n     the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and other \n     stakeholders, to finalize the preparations for the second \n     Summit to be held in Nairobi, including a clear focus on \n     peace and security issues, with a view to adopting a \n     Security, Stability and Development Pact for the countries of \n     the Great Lakes region;\n       3. Calls upon the countries of the region to agree on \n     confidence-building measures based on effective and concrete \n     actions;\n       4. Encourages and supports the countries of the Great Lakes \n     region, individually and collectively, to strengthen and \n     institutionalize respect for human rights and humanitarian \n     law, including respect for women's rights and protection of \n     children affected by armed conflict, good governance, rule of \n     law, democratic practices as well as development cooperation;\n       5. Encourages the development of the prevailing goodwill \n     and relations among the countries of the region which have \n     positively influenced the successful transition in Burundi \n     and the course of the ongoing democratic transition in the \n     Democratic Republic of the Congo;\n       6. Urges all States concerned to take action to bring to \n     justice perpetrators of grave violations of human rights and \n     international humanitarian law and to take appropriate \n     measures of international cooperation and judicial assistance \n     in this regard;\n       7. Expresses its support for the efforts by States in the \n     region to build independent and reliable national judicial \n     institutions in order to put an end to impunity;\n       8. Strongly condemns the activities of militias and armed \n     groups operating in the Great Lakes region such as the Forces \n     Democratiques de Liberation du Rwanda (FDLR), the Palipehutu-\n     Forces Nationales de Liberation (FNL) and the Lord's \n     Resistance Army (LRA) which continue to attack civilians and \n     United Nations and humanitarian personnel and commit human \n     rights abuses against local populations and threaten the \n     stability of individual States and the region as a whole and \n     reiterates its demand that all such armed groups lay down \n     their arms and engage voluntarily and without any delay or \n     preconditions in their disarmament and in their repatriation \n     and resettlement;\n       9. Stresses the need for the States in the region, within \n     their respective territories, to\n\n[[Page S695]]\n\n     disarm, demobilize and cooperate in the repatriation or \n     resettlement, as appropriate, of foreign armed groups and \n     local militias, and commends in this regard the robust action \n     of MONUC, acting in accordance with its mandate, in support \n     of the Forces Armees de la Republique Democratique du Congo \n     (FARDC) in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the \n     Congo;\n       10. Underscores that the governments in the region have a \n     primary responsibility to protect their populations, \n     including from attacks by militias and armed groups and \n     stresses the importance of ensuring the full, safe and \n     unhindered access of humanitarian workers to people in need \n     in accordance with international law;\n       11. Calls upon all States in the region to deepen their \n     cooperation with a view to putting an end to the activities \n     of illegal armed groups, and underlines that these States \n     must abide by their obligations under the Charter of the \n     United Nations to refrain from the threat or use of force \n     against the territorial integrity or political independence \n     of their neighbours;\n       12. Urges the international community, non-governmental \n     organizations and civil society to increase humanitarian \n     assistance to civilians affected by displacements and \n     violence from years of protracted conflicts in the Great \n     Lakes region;\n       13. Commends the efforts of the United Nations Organization \n     Missions in the region in accordance with their respective \n     mandates, to protect civilians, including humanitarian \n     personnel, to enable delivery of humanitarian aid and to \n     create the necessary conditions for the voluntary return of \n     refugees and internally displaced persons;\n       14. Requests the Secretary-General to make recommendations \n     to the Council, as appropriate, on how best to support \n     efforts by States in the region to put an end to the \n     activities of illegal armed groups, and to recommend how \n     United Nations agencies and missions--the United Nations \n     Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS), MONUC and ONUB--can help, \n     including through further support for the efforts of the \n     governments concerned to ensure protection of, and \n     humanitarian assistance to, civilians in need;\n       15. Calls upon the countries of the region to continue in \n     their efforts to create conducive conditions for voluntary \n     repatriation, safe and durable integration of refugees and \n     former combatants in their respective countries of origin. In \n     this regard, calls for commensurate international support for \n     refugees and reintegration and reinsertion of returnees, \n     internally displaced persons and former combatants;\n       16. Calls upon the countries of the region to reinforce \n     their cooperation with the Security Council's Committee and \n     with the Group of Experts established by resolution 1533 \n     (2004) in enforcing the arms embargo in the Democratic \n     Republic of the Congo and to combat cross-border trafficking \n     of illicit small arms, light weapons and illicit natural \n     resources as well as the movement of combatants, and \n     reiterates its demand that the Governments of Uganda, Rwanda, \n     the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi take \n     measures to prevent the use of their respective territories \n     in support of the activities of armed groups present in the \n     region;\n       17. Urges the governments concerned in the region to \n     enhance their cooperation to promote lawful and transparent \n     exploitation of natural resources among themselves and in the \n     region;\n       18. Welcomes the establishment of the Peacebuilding \n     Commission and underlines its potential importance to the \n     work of the Security Council in this region;\n       19. Invites the international community, including regional \n     organizations, international financial institutions and \n     relevant bodies of the United Nations system, to support and \n     complement the peacebuilding and development initiatives \n     required to sustain peace, security and stability in the \n     countries of the Great Lakes region;\n       20. Decides to remain seized of the matter.\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
